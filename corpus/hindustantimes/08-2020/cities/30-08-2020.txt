30-08-2020||Delhi||Rains brighten the other side of #WFH||There are two sides of a coin, and that holds true even with the case of pandemic induced work from home (WFH) scenario. Most professionals in Delhi-NCR have been asked to work from home; at least for another month or till the end of 2020 or beyond! While the disadvantages of #WFH have been the talk till now, it’s that one advantage that the professionals are joyous to share, i.e. no one has to cross roads-turned-into-rivers to reach work, all drenched, and then shiver due to the air conditioning at work place. Denizens certainly love not to travel on a rainy day. Take for instance Pankaj Sharma, a Gurugrammer, who works near Delhi’s Nehru Place. “Since I saw the condition of water flooded roads on social media, I’ve been thanking my stars that I didn’t have to travel to work in this mess! So till now I was listing the cons of WFH, but since monsoon has set in, I feel lucky to have WFH option,” says Sharma. And Harshita Saraf, a Mayur Vihar resident, who used to drive to Gurugram everyday, shares why life feels heavenly now. “I usually drove to work, but in rains I preferred the Metro to avoid waterlogging. Even then it used to be a task to commute since trains used to get so full that I could hardly breathe. I’m loving it now — this WFH.”. Even those who had to only travel within the city, are glad to continue their WFH. “Initially I was cribbing for not being able to visit office in CyberHub. But, rains brought me a realisation (laughs)... Though I do face some network issues when it’s raining, but it’s much better than being stuck outside, like forever... I spent three hours around Dhaula Kuan last monsoon, and don’t want that to repeat this year,” says Nikhil Bansal who used to travel to Cyber Hub from his home in Delhi’s Kamla Nagar. Working women who are otherwise too occupied due to workload and miss office as their escape from household chores are also happy to be home. Dimpi Kalra, a Delhi-based IT professional. who lives close to Sohna Road, says, “I saw a video of a guy boating in whaterlogged Gurugram... First I thought it’s fake, but when it was covered in news, I laughed so hard... Is baar ka haal dekhkar I feel blessed, that I can work from home!” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rains-brighten-the-other-side-of-wfh/story-BJf0M6qQCJOFSqxc1sTz1M.html

30-08-2020||City||Commercial units in north Delhi oppose user charges with retrospective effect||New Delhi: Commercial establishments under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s jurisdiction are opposing the civic body’s decision to charge “user fee” for waste collection retrospectively from January 2018, when the Solid Waste Management Bye laws-2017, were notified by Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.On August 21, a delegation of hotel, restaurant and shop owners’ associations raised the issue with North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash. Their say they shouldn’t be charged retrospectively and the charges should be revised.Commercial establishment owners say the civic agency can’t charge for a service, which it wasn’t providing in 2018, retrospectively.The North corporation has started issuing notices to hotels, restaurants and shops to pay user charges from January 2018. As per the law, the charges for commercial establishments vary from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000 per month. While a shop or coffee or sweet shop has to pay Rs 500 per month as user charges for waste collection, a restaurant with seating capacity up to 50 has to pay Rs 2,000 per month.Murli Mani, a guesthouse owner in Karol Bagh and president of the Ajmal Khan road traders’ association, said, “Commercial establishments in Karol Bagh area have been served notices to pay anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 60,000 depending on the type of commercial establishment. This is unfair, as the kind of services they are supposed to provide under the new rules were not being provided then.”The North corporation started sending notices to commercial establishments in August after the lockdown norms were relaxed.Traders’ association say this new charge will put additional burden on traders, who have already suffered huge loss due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Confederation of All India Traders is planning to take up the issue with the L-G. “Due to the lockdown imposed because of Covid, traders have already suffered huge financial loss. They are still facing financial problems as things are yet to get back to normal. This new charge imposed by the north corporation will only make matters worse for traders. We will raise this issue with the LG,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT.Nursing home owners say they already have to pay for the disposal of medical waste and hired people for solid waste management. Dr Ajay Bedi, honorary secretary of the nursing home forum of Delhi Medical Association, said, “Nursing homes have to pay Rs 2,000 per month. We have been asked to pay since January 2018. When the corporations were not providing the services as per the new rules, then why should we pay in-retrospect?”North corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said, “The new rules state that the civic bodies have to charge people for solid waste disposal. Currently, we are charging only commercial establishments. We have got several representations against the charges being collected from January 2018. Their concern is genuine. We are trying to work out a way so that these charges can be collected from this financial year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commercial-units-in-north-delhi-oppose-user-charges-with-retrospective-effect/story-v6RB7Kn2cyJTWa5H1zkiPJ.html

30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Brand Factory outlet fined Rs 6.72 lakh in 21 cases of unfair trade||The Mohali district consumer disputes redressal commission has slapped a Rs 6.72 lakh fine on a Brand Factory outlet at Cosmo Mall in Zirakpur in single-day judgements on 21 cases of unfair trade. Though the cases were decided on August 21 the commission’s orders were received on August 28.The commission had last week fined the clothing store around Rs 2 lakh in seven different cases for unfair trade. Notices were issued in 21 cases in which customers had complained about the store arbitrarily charging goods and services tax (GST) and using misleading advertisements, but as no representative from the store turned up even after 30 days, a fine of Rs 32,000 was imposed in each case. The store will pay Rs 7,000 to the complainant and Rs 25,000 to the legal-aid fund of the commission in each case. In all the 21 cases, the owner had arbitrarily charged 5% GST and used misleading advertisements. Commission president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said it was clear admission on the part of the Brand Factory owners that they had arbitrarily charged GST from the complainant by adopting unfair trade practices and committed deficiency in service. Noting that it appeared that the process of law was “misused by simply filing complaints before the Commission against a particular outlet owner,” Sharma said, “It is noticed that a huge number of cases are pending against the owner on similar points of controversy.”In a number of cases complaints were filed against the outlet owners and then “compromises reached with the owner,” who paid money to the complainant and the complaint was withdrawn, Sharma added.“The owner continues with this malpractice regularly and minting money by overcharging innocent consumers daily and does not mind paying a small amount in lieu of these complaints to the various complainants who are probably generated for this purpose,” the commission observed. One of the complainants, Karamveer Singh of Gillco Valley, Sector 127, had purchased a set of vests from the Brand Factory outlet in Zirakpur. The MRP of the product was Rs279, inclusive of all taxes, and there was a 60% discount on it. It is alleged that he was to pay only Rs.111.60, but instead of charging this amount, the stores added 5% GST and charged him Rs 117 for the product. Despite repeated requests by the customer, no clarification was provided by the shop owner. It was, therefore, alleged that it was a case of misleading advertisement and unfair trade practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brand-factory-outlet-fined-rs-6-72-lakh-in-21-cases-of-unfair-trade/story-CBIVVmgNq3BSrmzQTdGKlL.html

Even after the MC general House approved its setting up in Sector 25, and floated tenders for the same, now, the civic body is planning to shift its location again to Industrial Area, Phase 1.Approval for setting up the plant in Industrial Area will be an agenda in the MC general House meeting scheduled for August 31.For more than a year now, dispute over the location is raging between councillors of the two locations. Councillors of wards adjacent to the twin sites – Sector 25 and Industrial Area, are opposing the setting up of the plant near their respective wards.Criticising the MC’s move to bring back the agenda to set up the plant in Industrial Area, local councillor Shakti Prakash Devshali, said, “It is shocking as the MC House has already decided on the issue, then why is it being brought up again? We will oppose the move to shift it to Industrial Area where it adversely affects more than two-lakh people. The livelihoods of more than 25,000 people working here will also be adversely affected.”Meanwhile, Sector 25 councillor, Sheela Devi, said, “The decision to set up the plant in Sector 25 was suspended in the wake of my opposition. The area can’t afford it as there is already a waste processing plant and dumping, cremation and burial grounds in the area.”Notably, MC officials have maintained that as per the plant’s plan, there will be no foul smell as it is will be gas-based electric incineration with a 30-metre high chimney.“They made such claims even when the Jaypee waste processing plant was being setup, but see the situation today. We can’t trust them in such issues,” said Devshali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fate-of-carcass-incineration-plant-in-chandigarh-uncertain/story-mZheUYHgOgeESgBrK5UF5N.html

The MC on Saturday had asked the railways to take over the construction of the damaged bridge after putting up a retaining wall. Engineer Gurdeep Singh said, “The MC handed over the work to the railways on Saturday. They will start laying approach slabs in a couple of days.”Once the railways are done installing approach slabs, the MC will start working on laying down a road on the bridge. The slabs will need a curing period of around 10-12 days. Since the railways will complete the assignment till September 15, the MC is sure to miss the deadline.Moreover, MC officials say constructing a road in the monsoon season is not viable.STRING OF MISSED DEADLINESRailway authorities had closed one side of the flyover in July 2016 due to safety concerns. The project stayed in a limbo for two years as the department refused to pool money for the project. It was only after the Ludhiana MC handed the railways ₹24.3 crore did construction finally begin in 2018. The initial deadline was June 30, 2019 but it was extended to December 2019.The MC took over the project in December and fixed March 2020 as the deadline. However, the project was pushed to June due the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The June deadline was yet again unfruitfully pushed to August 15 and extended to September 15. However, it is very likely that the civic body will have to set a fresh deadline yet again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-set-to-miss-jagraon-bridge-s-sept-15-deadline-too/story-pL0TG7UY0AO6PiKTj1fIUO.html

In her complaint, Gajraj said the man had alleged that she was drawing illegal brokerage from miscreants.“This irresponsible and provoking statement allegedly made by a minister cannot be in good faith and is made prejudicial, having the personal enmity. The intention of this man is very clear that he wants to create pressure on her to play in his hands while administering the justice,” she mentioned in her complaint.Inspector Vikas at Narnaul city police station said they have registered an FIR against an unknown person under sections 153, 500, 504 and 186 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66 of the IT Act, 2000.A controversy had erupted after local BJP leader’s son Amit Yadav was shot at outside his house in Mahendergarh’s Narnaul on Friday. His father, while visiting him at hospital, had allegedly spoken against Gajraj during an interaction with local journalists, audio clip of which was widely circulated.Second instance of minister-SP conflictThis is the second such case wherein an SP and a BJP minister are at loggerheads. In November 2015, Haryana health minister Anil Vij had left the meeting of district grievances and public relations committee after a spat with Sangeeta Kalia, the then Fatehabad SP, as she refused to follow his order to leave the venue following heated exchanges over the alleged illegal liquor trade in Fatehabad.Vij had justified his stand, saying that he was getting complaints of drug mafia and liquor mafia being active in the area, but the police had failed to bring that under control.However, the officer had refused to leave the meeting and even objected to the minister’s manners. Vij had then left the meeting himself.State crime branch to probe Gajraj’s complaint: VijHaryana home minister Anil Vij on Sunday said the state crime branch will probe in the case.On being asked about Abhay Chautala’s remarks on the same, Vij said, “Let us get it investigated first by the state crime branch and then it will be better to tell who is right and who is wrong.”Vij’s comments came on the day when he was inspecting the under-construction international level football stadium at the national war memorial stadium on NH-44 in Ambala Cantonment. He said the FIFA-approved football stadium that is being constructed at a cost of ₹100 crore is on par international standards and will be the best in North India.It is going to be the first such stadium in Haryana, where national and international level football matches will be held, Vij added.(With inputs from Bhavey Nagpal in Ambala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/called-corrupt-in-audio-clip-ex-mahendergarh-sp-lodges-plaint/story-08naqXkR3mkr44XekHOAyK.html

Starting this week, the government even introduced the odd-even rule and we can only open on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But these days are considered inauspicious.”Jagjit Singh, the owner of Scissors Cut makeover studio in Model Town, Gol market, and owner of Venus Salons in Sarabha Nagar, Pardeep Kumar, said they were losing more customers due to the odd-even criteria as the customers were moving to other salons that are open on that day.”“The clientele of customers for chemical services like rebonding, colouring etc is down by over 80 percent as fear has gripped the customers and it is not possible to cover up the expenses of salons by providing haircuts services only. We also have to pay the rent, power bills etc for the entire month, even when we are allowed to open the units for 11 to 12 days in a month. The government should pay heed to the problems being faced by the beauty sector,” said Jagjit Singh.The shrunken incomes of the owners are impacting the salaries of the staff. One of the staff members at a salon requesting anonymity said the owners had also reduced their salaries. “Earlier, we used to get a monthly salary, but now many salon parlour owners are paying salaries on a proportionate basis considering the number of days on which a salon is open,” they said.Owner of Taurus Salon in Model Town extension, Monu, said, “We stand by the government and hard steps are required to stop the spread of disease. But the government should pay heed to the problems being faced by the sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekend-lockdown-odd-even-criteria-curtails-profits-of-salons-in-ludhiana/story-JrKGIxFwo4ideL9BJUUjYO.html

The cabinet will not work as per people’s expectations, they added.On the other hand, Daduwal refuted the allegations of inducting his loyalists in his team saying, “We have only 10 posts in the cabinet and the appointments were made in a democratic way as the members proposed the names and the same were approved.”He said more committees and a legal cell will be formed in the coming days and more people will be accommodated.Speaking about his future plans, Daduwal said they will soon meet the Haryana chief minister, Union home minister and Prime Minister and seek their support for the pending case against SGPC (Amritsar) in the Supreme Court for the formation of fully operational and independent Sikh body to control operations of all gurdwaras in Haryana.Daduwal said they will start publishing the Nanakshahi calendar and a monthly Haryana Sikh Sandesh magazine from next year. The calendar and magazine will be provided free of cost to every Sikh family in the state, he added.HSGMC also plans to install the portrait of former Sikh leaders from Haryana in gurdwaras. Daduwal said he will also visit several gurdwaras in the state after the Covid-19 restriction is lifted.Asked if he will meet Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Daduwal said, “The chief minister is the political head of the state and we will meet him for our issues and problems, whenever required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-gurdwara-body-chief-draws-flak-for-inducting-loyalists-into-panel/story-m3kCbZNm8LD5S6DszZ3A4J.html

Fortunately, no injuries were reported.Growing in a vacant plot close to house number 1052, the tree damaged power lines as it fell, leading to a day-long power outage. “The tree had hollowed out roots and we had asked authorities concerned to remove it. It was bound to fall. A similar tree is growing at an awkward angle near this plot, which can also fall anytime,” said Kuldeep Singh Gill, president of the Sector 21-B resident welfare association (RWA).Dr Sanjeev Mahindru, whose sports utility vehicle, a Mahindra XUV 300, was parked under the tree, said its roof, windshield and bonnet were damaged. “It will cost a lot of money to get the vehicle repaired and I’m not even sure if insurance will cover it,” said Mahindru, who runs a private clinic in Lalru with his wife.Two cars, a Verna and a Santro, also had minor damages because of the falling poles.Raj Kumar Singla, who lives close to the spot said they had been writing to the administration since 2018 to remove the tree but they were told it was not dead and could not be cut.When contacted, UT horticulture division officials said, “The exact cause of the tree falling down is being looked into. Officials were called to clear the tree and fix the electricity poles in the morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cars-electricity-poles-damaged-as-tree-falls-in-sector-21-b/story-CVggvcniK1itp37Hsl0pYL.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Poor condition of roads in Chandigarh leave residents a harried lot||Chandigarh residents are repeatedly complaining about poor condition of roads in the city, which have deteriorated further after heavy rains this month. This comes after the municipal corporation (MC) was only able to finish pending maintenance work of 2019, and the work for this year had to be postponed, due to lockdown restrictions and later, during the monsoons.General secretary of the Sector 33-B residents’ welfare association (RWA), Kuljinder Sra, said, “A deep hole had formed near the entrance of Sector in 33-B in the summer. I had complained to the MC authorities repeatedly since it can be dangerous when there is waterlogging on the road. But, it has not been repaired so far.” Residents of northern sectors are also complaining about the poor state of roads. A resident of Sector 9, Anmol Gupta, said, “Streets in Sector 9 haven’t been repaired in years. After the monsoon this time, the top layer of the roads has been damaged heavily and needs to be dismantled. The roads need to be re-carpeted as soon as possible.”Organising secretary of Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), Sandeep Bhalla, said, “Even if there is a delay in resuming work, the quality needs to be improved. Firstly, the MC must ensure they have enough funds to get quality materials for constructing the roads. Once the re-carpeting is done, they must last atleast for the next five years. Meanwhile, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chief spokesperson, Anish Garg, added, “The slip roads of the city are in dire need of repairs they must be recarpeted first as many cyclists and two-wheelers are at risk. Roads around the road gullies must also be increased in height so that waterlogging can be controlled.”The road repair had to be halted due to the rains but as per India Meteorological Department (IMD) Chandigarh director Surender Paul, the intensity of rainfall is likely to drop by the middle of September. “As per long range forecast, good intensity of rains can be expected till about September 10, after which it is likely to come down. Only light to moderate showers will be likely after that, while heavy showers over 60 mm can be ruled out,” he said.Saying that road repairs will be started by the middle of September, chief engineer of the MC, Shailender Singh, said, “Road repairs had been halted during the monsoons and we are likely to start again after the second week of September when intensity of rain starts to go down. We will have enough manpower to carry out the maintenance works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/poor-condition-of-roads-in-chandigarh-leave-residents-a-harried-lot/story-ooUirOFBg27dKkEY0NIUgO.html
30-08-2020||City||Curbs imposed in Srinagar, Budgam districts to prevent people from taking out processions||Authorities in Kashmir imposed restrictions in parts of Srinagar and Budgam districts on Sunday to prevent people from taking out Muharram processions to mark the last day of the 10-day mourning period, officials said. Muharram processions have been banned by the Jammu and Kashmir administration this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Police also used force to break up processions in Alamgari Bazar-Zadibal area of Old City in Srinagar where hundreds gathered to mourn on the occasion. Residents claimed that police fired tear gas and pellets to disperse the mourners.“It was a very small procession compared to thousands of people which would gather on this occasion. There was due regard of sanitisation, social distancing and wearing of masks but still the police lobbed tear gas shells and used pellets to push us into the inner areas,” a resident Raashid Ahmad said.“Is it wise to push people into congested areas if Covid-19 is the reason to ban such gatherings? It would have been better to allow people to remain in open areas like the main road where social distancing would be possible. This is a religious and sentimental issue, we are mourning and the administration can’t suppress the sentiment by military measures,” he said.Mostly people confined themselves to their local Imam Baras, mosques or homes to observe Muharram. Srinagar senior superintendent of police Haseeb Mughal said they have been asking people to observe the occasion inside their homes amid the pandemic. He said while many have adhered to the guidelines, youngsters have not been listening. “People tried to come out at around a dozen of places. Many policemen were injured as they were hit by stones. We had to use mild force,” the SSP said.“Overall situation was peaceful except small incidents at many places. People have been trying to come out on road even to protest but there has been no major incident,” he added.The administration has imposed restrictions under Section 144 in Budgam and Srinagar’s Lal Chowk and Old City areas like Zadibal. Security forces laid concertina wires and barricades to block roads and stop mass movement of people in certain places. No groups or gatherings were allowed by the authorities.“There were concertina wires on roads from Khanyar onwards to Alamgari Bazar,” said Muzaffar Ahmad, a government employee in Old City.In central Kashmir’s Budgam district, despite the restrictions, a sizable procession was taken out on the road towards main-chowk. People wore masks and marched as they sang elegies in the memory of Imam Hussain. “Although there were restrictions, police did not interfere to break up the procession. There was no leader to lead it. However, this is for the first time that there was no Zulginah (bringing out a horse with the procession),” said a Budgam resident, Bilal Ahmad.On Saturday, around 18 people were injured after police fired teargas shells and pellets to disperse a Muharram procession in Bemina locality of Srinagar. The photos of pellet injured youngsters, some in their eyes, have flooded social media enraging residents. Police has said that mild force was used as mourners defied restrictions in view of Covid-19. Peoples Democratic Party has strongly condemned the use of force on peaceful Muharram processions in Kashmir, terming such action as blatant display of barbarism. “Militating against a peaceful religious gathering has reflected the government’s iron fisted approach adopted in Kashmir without any compunction. It has proved beyond doubt that religion is being demonised, democratic dissent criminalised and cruelty is being normalised in Kashmir,” said PDP spokesman Syed Suhail Bukhari. The month of Muharram is remembered in Muslim history for the sacrifice of Imam Hussain and his companions in a seventh-century battle in Karbala, present day Iraq. Many Muslims used to take out mourning processions on select routes in Srinagar on 8th and 10th day of the month before the 1990s, However, they have been banned since militancy erupted in J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curbs-imposed-in-srinagar-budgam-districts-to-prevent-people-from-taking-out-processions/story-v6SDMzPhDm9VQdwjv7TEtN.html
30-08-2020||City||Haryana government is synonymous with corruption, unemployment and crime: Hooda||Slamming the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government in Haryana, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday called it “synonymous with corruption, unemployment and crime”. Addressing a press conference here, the former Haryana chief minister said youths were facing unemployment crisis while the government sacked physical training instructors and contractual employees of the tourism department.“Instead of creating new jobs, the state government is focusing on sacking its employees. Corruption is going on unabated in all government departments. During the pandemic, liquor and transfer of land scams took place under the nose of the government led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The government should order a probe in these cases either by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a retired judge of the high court or a panel of legislators. The people of Haryana have seen the corrupt face of this government,” Hooda added. He said a Haryana minister (OP Yadav) and former Mahendergarh superintendent of police Sulochana Gajraj were at loggerheads over ‘rise in crime’. “A common man is afraid of stepping out of his house due to the rise in criminal activities and police’s lackadaisical approach towards curbing it,” he added.‘Right to recall’ bill should be passed for MPs, MLAsReacting sharply over Dushyant Chautala’s proposed ‘right to recall’ bill for village heads, Hooda said the government should first pass this bill for legislators and MPs.“The government is trying to create a dispute among villagers by passing a right to recall bill for sarpanches,” he said.On the three ordinances related to the agriculture sector promulgated by the central government, Hooda said his party will not allow the passage of these bills. “The government should introduce a fourth bill which gives guarantees of the minimum support price to the farmers. If these three bills would be passed, farmers of Haryana and Punjab will be destroyed,” he added.Hitting out at the government over the sacking of physical training instructors, Hooda said the government must bring a private bill and give employment to the terminated teachers.“If this government will not reinstate them, we will give them jobs after coming to power,” he added.On a question pertaining to his role among 23 other Congress leaders in writing a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi, Hooda said he will not share internal matters of the party with the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-government-is-synonymous-with-corruption-unemployment-and-crime-hooda/story-IOhB2cCRzeM2mkWTtf2jfM.html

30-08-2020||Pune||DMER advisory over Tocilizumab use for Covid treatment||The Directorate of Medical Education (DMER) has issued an order to all district task forces, government hospitals, private hospitals and deemed universities, that Tocilizumab is not a proven drug for the treatment of Covid-19 and must be judiciously used. This comes after the Pune task force and also the state task force recommended the use of the drug for critical Covid-19 patients. The order dated August 29 says, “Tocilizumab is an off label experimental drug used in Covid-19 and therefore, judicious use of the drug is recommended. Patients must be closely monitored between day 5 and day 9 and if clinically and biochemically indicated then only it should be administered.” It also states that only one dose of the drug should be administered as opposed to two which was prescribed earlier at the right time. The order comes after trials found that the drug is not significantly effective in the treatment and so the supply had been limited. This is now causing a shortage of the said drugs as doctors continue to prescribe the drug and relatives are left searching for the same. The drug is essentially used in case of rheumatoid arthritis but was initially found to be effective in some cases. ‘Although the government of Maharashtra has requested the drug controlling authority of India to import the drug but it has not materialized yet and so the doctors have been asked to avoid aggressive dosage. “Instead all treating physicians are requested to prescribe alternative drugs like etolizumab and avoid creating confusion in patients and relatives,” states the order. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Pune said, “A single dose of Tocilizumab costs around Rs 40,000 and it is not as effective as it was thought to be for treating Covid-19. Instead, plasma therapy which is much cheaper and is now likely to be capped at Rs 7,000 is found to be much more effective in treating critical Covid-19 patients.” SB Patil, assistant commissioner FDA Pune said, “There is a shortage of Tocilizumab and despite the manufacturer suggesting its inefficiency in treating Covid-19, doctors continue to prescribe it. In case of rheumatoid arthritis, the drug can be administered a few days later but in case of Covid-19, relatives are asked to get the drug immediately which is leading to an artificial shortage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dmer-advisory-over-tocilizumab-use-for-covid-treatment/story-dthECzq6KxBEOGteuhITdK.html
30-08-2020||City||Ludhiana: Social distancing goes for a toss during Ganesh visarjan||Not giving two hoots about the social distancing norms, people from all walks of life thronged the banks of Sutlej River to immerse the idols of Lord Ganesha on Sunday. People gathered on the banks were seen hugging and putting colours on each other. This happened a day after the district witnessed its biggest spike in Covid-19 fatalities with 17 people losing their lives. To top it all, neither the police nor the administration was at the spot to control the crowd. Social activist Varinder Bhakoo, a member of Shri Ek-Dant Ganesh Mahotsav Society, Kitchlu Nagar, expressed dismay over violation of social distancing guidelines. “It is really unfortunate that people are not following the social distancing norms that too at a time when Ludhiana is witnessing a rise in Covid cases,” Bhakoo said. “Belief is important but at this time we need to be cautious and adhere to the guidelines issued by the government. It is surprising that even amid the lockdown so many people managed to gather at the banks of Sutlej. What if one of them is an asymptotic carrier? ,” he added. He said their society made efforts to uphold the sanctity of the festival. “Our Lord Ganesha was made of mud and organic paints. The visarjan was also carried out systematically. We first took the permission of a sarpanch in Doraha.” When asked, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “Religion is a personal choice. I won’t comment on it. I urge people to maintain social distance in places of worship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-during-ganesh-visarjan/story-KTHlbwqiOrRYeYN1OReDoO.html

Elaborating on why getting a degree on time will be a challenge even for students attempting Open Book Examination, Behera adds, “The paper is very lengthy, the site stopped working, the teachers were messaging constantly to submit answer sheets and it created a lot of panic to upload the written answers within the given time period. I doubt if would be able to score well. And of course, if I don’t score well this is going to show on my maksheet. The completion of our graduation has already been delayed because of the pandemic; now our future has been compromised further because of open book exams (OBE).” Students who have got admissions in prestigious colleges for masters programmes have been given a deadline to submit their marksheets, and are in a state of utter confusion since their graduation is not yet complete as per the varsity. “I got admission in IIT Dhanbad and have to submit last semester marksheet by October 31. However, I’m unsure of how I’ll manage that because of this mishap. In one of my subject papers, there were two tabs — one for B Sc (Prog) Chemistry and the other was for B Sc (Hons) Chemistry. Both had the same paper code, and I mistakenly uploaded my answer sheet on B Sc (Prog) tab, instead of the honours tab. When I realised my mistake, I informed the college and they said next paper me dhyan rakhna ab kuch nahi ho sakta! When will the next paper be? How will I submit a marksheet to IIT? What’ll happen to my future? Why did the two courses have the same question paper code?” says a Samriddhi Vats, a worries student of B Sc (Hons) Chemistry at Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences.Some students who had planned to opt for offline exams, ie exams in ink and paper, due to their bitter experience with the mock tests are now finding themselves in midst of a conundrum. “Initially, I was planning to give exam in offline mode, and start working by showing a conditional degree. However, UGC recently mentioned that the degree will only be given once we have written our exams. Without even a conditional degree in hand, which company will accept me? The online mode of examinations is rampant with problems and I don’t want to risk scoring low by giving online exams where students run out of time to finish and struggle to even download question papers, but a scenario of a half baked degree is any day better than no degree,” says Sanjay Kataria, who is pursuing masters in Department of Library and Information Science.And students who have enrolled themselves for Open Book Exams (OBE) have also complained of major technical snags that ensure a further delay in final marksheet. “Our future is in jeopardy because students aren’t able to give online exams while attempting OBE! Students during political science exam got two different question papers. This lead to a lot of confusion. University authorities later said that the second one is the actual question paper. What about those who attempted the first one, like me? Will those students now have to give another attempt at online exams or wait to give it in offline mode? This will lead to a delay in getting our final marksheet and subsequently a delay in the degree. How will the students apply for higher education in that case,” asks Sneha Sarah Shaji, a student o Political Science (Hons), Hindu College.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jobs/du-degree-delay-students-say-future-is-in-jeopardy/story-BokUv45XsKUuwBZj1mDaaK.html

Recently when the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi spoke about menstrual hygiene in his Independence Day speech, his initiative to address the issue from the Red Fort was appreciated by one and all.Bollywood celebs have also been supporting Instagram campaigns that talk about mentrual health. Actor Kirti Kulhari who posted about one such campaign, says, “It’s deplorable that menstruation and conversation around it has been shamed for centuries. There should be no need for code words for period, no need for wrapping newspapers around a pack of sanitary pads when buying it and asking for a pad doesn’t have to be a hushed request. Stains are foreseeable outcomes of having a period and we need to be okay with the fact. It’s time we ended period shaming and the silence surrounding it.” An NGO, Humans For Humanity, which had been working to spread awareness around menstrual hygiene through various campaigns have kicked off Red Cloth Campaign during the pandemic, to keep the ball rolling. This initiative talks about breaking taboos around periods. “We are inviting everyone to participate; take a step forward towards normalisation of opening conversations around periods to pull it out of the myths it lies embroiled in. One can participate by simply tying a red cloth around the wrist and putting up the picture as a post or story on Instagram with the hashtag in the caption,” says Anurag Chauhan, founder of the NGO, who is now taking the virtual route to spread awareness on menstrual hygiene.Actor Lisa Ray and singer-actor Shibani Dandekar have also supported the campaign along with many social media users, who have been sharing their stories by posting pictures of hand tied in red cloth. And while posting about the campaign, the actors are tagging their co-stars to make the chain bigger and thus creating more impact. Sharing her views on menstrual health and campaigns, actor Kubra Sait adds, “It’s extremely important to talk about menstrual health. I’m so grateful for Indian filmmaker and producers to take up this entire conversation from India to the global level. It’s still so crucial that we bring it to every school, every elementary level so that girls and also boys can speak about this. We should normalise it, instead of it being some sort of taboo, we can’t speak of... I’m extremely blessed and lucky to have such conversations at home! And what NGOs are doing to spread awareness about it is excellent. While such conversations happen on an educated level, it also needs to take place where eduction is also needed.” Bollywood choreographer Sandip Soparrkar also shared about the campaign on his social media, and feels “it’s high time we stop talking about periods in hush tones”. Soparrkar dressed in red and put a tilak on his forehead to support the campaign on his social media handles. Another actor who has shown support to this cause is Divya Seth Shah. She says, “Misogyny found varied paths down the ages. Subjugation and Superstition fuelled them. The silence and shame centered around menstruation has remained. A bodily function that propelled the human race is rendered unspeakable by centuries of social taboo. Time to change that. The rite of passage into adulthood. Just making it real and dignified, and the Red Cloth Campaign is a powerful visual declaration of the end to this silence.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/break-the-taboo-celebs-support-menstrual-health-via-social-media/story-c4J71mNEJkEKDaDDoVdU4N.html

According to Chandan Kumar, the city police and railway police are passing bucks on the issue instead of taking action.Kumar has now approached director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta seeking his intervention in the matter. Chandan’s brother Kundan Kumar, 22, worked as a sanitary worker at an automobile showroom in Jugiana.According to Chandan Kumar, the supervisor of the showroom used to thrash Kundan and due to this, he was suffering from depression for the past many days.“On August 13, my brother called me and informed me that the accused are thrashing him near the railway track. When I reached there, I found his mutilated body on the other side of the track,” he added.“The accused have murdered my brother and made it look like an accident.

30-08-2020||City||Sports academies remain shut in Ludhiana, athletes left in the lurch||The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the sporting economy to a shuddering halt. With the majority of sports academies closed in Ludhiana, players are left in the lurch. With the rising Covid-19 cases, coaches are giving online training to the players which according to them is not proving to be beneficial for them.Players have stated that there are many games that require a team and proper strategy and practicing alone at home is not serving the purpose. Sitting at home for the last five months is affecting players’ health and future performances.Prince Kumar, 15, who aims to become a Judo coach said that he is unable to practice and maintain fitness levels, and with uncertainty looming over sports events, he fears a loss of competitiveness, opportunities and other benefits.A gold medallist in the Commonwealth Judo Championship held in Jaipur in 2018, Prince is practicing for the Khelo Indian Games scheduled to be held next year. He said, “Due to financial constraints, I faced many challenges when the lockdown was imposed in March. Maintaining my fitness is a struggle. My coach sends me pre-recorded videos so I am practicing at home.”Nutrition is another aspect that has taken a beating during the lockdown. While players in training camps are assured of a proper diet, it is difficult for sportspersons in rural areas.Judoka Priya Sharma, 21, who represented the country in the World University Games 2019 Summer Universiade said, “I am practicing at home for two hours daily and due to financial problems, I am not able to take a protein-rich diet that I used to have earlier at the college. I am residing near Tibba road which is very far away from the Guru Nanak Stadium and I’m not able to go there as I don’t have funds to commute.” While boxer, Mandeep Kaur from Chakkar village said that she is unable to do the kind of workout or practice, she normally does in a camp. “At the camps, we get a lot of exposure, proper guidance from coaches. But now, I am just able to practice with the limited infrastructure available here in my village academy. I practice for four hours daily to be able to participate in the Olympics to be held next year.”In 2015, Kaur won a gold medal in the junior World Boxing Championship held in Taipei. Earlier, she had won a gold medal at the Nation’s Boxing Cup held in Serbia. Sarbjot Singh, 17, a player from the Malwa Hockey Academy, Ludhiana said that hockey is a team game and without all team members there is no use of practicing it. Hailing from Jalandhar, Singh said, “Since March, the academy has been closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and all players were asked to go home. I have been playing this sport for the last six years and miss the team members in the field.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sports-academies-remain-shut-in-ludhiana-athletes-left-in-the-lurch/story-dVcRR7t6WeSLqgpRO1sTnK.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC starts shifting legacy waste from Dadumajra plant to open dump||Unable to find a firm to execute the task, the municipal corporation has itself kicked-off the process to shift the legacy waste collected at the waste processing plant to the dumping ground at Dadumajra. Over 25,000 metric tonnes (MT) of waste has been lying unprocessed at the site for years, resulting in odour and leachate, which has impacted the plant’s efficient functioning. The MC General House in July had given the go-ahead to shift this waste with a budget of Rs 80 lakh.Using its own garbage disposal vehicles, MC has started the work on a low scale while continuing it search for a contractor.Another project to clear the 5 lakh MT of legacy waste at the Dadumajra dumping ground is already underway at a cost ₹35 crore.The civic body had earlier floated a tender for hiring a firm to shift the legacy waste, but could not find any one for the job, prompting it to invite bids again.The hired firm will provide one pocklane excavator, one excavator-cum-loader, seven tippers and one chain dozer (for levelling the said waste). It will also bear the cost of driver, helper, fuel, etc. The work has to be completed within two months from the date of allotment of contract. Failure to finish it in the stipulated time may lead to the firm’s performance security being forfeited.“Legacy waste has to be shifted so that the waste processing plant can be operated properly. We will shift the legacy waste to the dumping site in phases so that it does not burden the removal process underway there,” said Dr Amrit Pal Singh, medical officer of health (MOH).Singh said, “MC is using its own vehicles to shift the garbage, but we cannot spare these vehicles for long, as it affects the city’s garbage collection and disposal work.”MC had taken over the waste processing plant from Jaypee Group on June 19 and has been running it since.The corporation had signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant, which over the years was not operated to its optimum capacity. The plant was only processing 120 MT of waste against a requirement of 450 MT, with the remaining waste being illegally dumped in the open ground nearby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-starts-shifting-legacy-waste-from-dadumajra-plant-to-open-dump/story-bsJKDdUBfrynkzBZkdXK3L.html

The total now stands at 3,666, of which 1,627 cases remain active. Meanwhile, two women succumbed to the virus on Sunday even as 104 patients were cured and discharged. The toll stands at 73 while the number of those who have recovered has reached 1,966.Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said both women who died were having comorbidities and were hospitalised for more than a week. One of them, aged 40, was from Bhagomajra village. She was suffering from liver disease, diabetes and hypertension and was admitted to the PGIMER, Chandigarh. The other, aged 55, was from Baltana and suffered from hypertension. She was undergoing treatment at Government Medical College and Hospital in Patiala. “They have been cremated as per the protocol under the observation of health officials,” said Dr Singh. Among the fresh cases, 92 have surfaced in Mohali city, 56 in Gharuan, 46 in Dhakoli, 31 in Kharar and the remaining in Lalru, Dera Bassi and Kurali.

30-08-2020||Chandigarh||GMADA issues notice under section 19 of Land Acquisition Act to acquire 737 acres for Aerotropolis||The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has issued a notification under Section 19 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 737 acres of land for its seventh independent township, Aerotropolis, an extension of Aerocity, the USP of which is its proximity to Chandigarh International Airport.The project is spread over 5,400 acres.Section 19 of the Act refers to the amount to be determined as compensation.A notification was also issued earlier by GMADA under section 11 of the Act to acquire the land, which calls for objections, if any, from owners.The township will comprise both residential and commercial spaces and will come up on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road.In the first phase, land will be acquired in Chau Majra, Saini Majra, Patton, Manauli, Siaun and Matran of Mohali district.“We have issued a notification under section 19 and we will be completing the acquisition process by February next year. Earlier, it was to be completed by November this year, but due to Covid-19, the process was delayed,” said Tarsem Chand, GMADA land acquisition officer.Announcing the compensation amount to land owners and other affected persons was practically the last step in the acquisition process, he said.Another senior official of GMADA said the land had to be purchased under the land pooling policy (LPP) of 2013. Recently, GMADA had also increased compensation for land owners opting for the LPP scheme for various residential projects. For commercial plots, owners will get 200 sq yard plots instead of 121 square yards fixed earlier, he added.Under the scheme, farmers are offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land. Big housing and commercial projects are developed on their land, for which farmers are offered housing and commercial sites.Though GMADA is yet to calculate the compensation, sources say it’s likely to range between Rs2.5 to Rs3 crore for those who do not opt for land pooling.While acquiring land for Aerocity in 2008, GMADA had offered compensation of Rs1.5 crore per acre to farmers.AEROTROPOLIS FACTSSpread over 5,400 acres, the township is an expansion of AerocityWill come up on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road, close to Chandigarh International AirportWill have residential and commercial spacesIn the first phase, 737 acre land will be acquired in Chau Majra, Saini Majra, Patton, Manauli, Siaun and MatranThe remaining land will be acquired in Badi, Kurdi, Kishanpur, Safipur and Kishanpura villagesOTHER GMADA TOWNSHIPSAerocity, Knowledge City and IT City, all in the vicinity of Chandigarh AirportEco City, Edu City and Medi City in New Chandigarh, Mullanpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmada-issues-notice-under-section-19-of-land-acquisition-act-to-acquire-737-acres-for-aerotropolis/story-ypa0uEGuHRA3D5Qsh92VaL.html

30-08-2020||City||IIT students, alumni launch portal to provide transport facilities to needy NEET, JEE candidates||New Delhi: Students and alumni from three Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) -- Delhi, Mumbai and Madras -- launched a portal to connect with people who may want to help needy students appearing in the upcoming JEE and NEET exams with transport facilities to travel to their examination centres amid the pandemic.While the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) will be held from September 1 to September 6, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) is scheduled on September 13.The move comes after IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao made an appeal on social networking site Facebook on Friday. In a statement issued on Sunday, IIT-D said, “The call-for-help germinated independent actions from IIT Delhi Alumni Association (IITDAA), IIT Bombay and IIT Madras alumni and finally converged into a wonderful user-friendly portal viz www.eduride.in. This portal aims to ease the burden of commuting for the needy candidates especially from remote locations and poorly connected areas.”Candidates from any part of the country can register themselves as a “student” on the portal and enter details of their exam centres. The candidates can call on a helpline number +91 93113 23756 on Monday to book the ride. Welcoming the initiative launched by IIT students and alumni, Rao, said, “Some candidates had written to me and commented on social media channels that they cannot afford private transport and asked for help in reaching the examination centres. We immediately made an appeal to the alumni and others for help. If we all work together and support each other in these times of need, there is no obstacle that we cannot surmount. I am confident this portal will not only ease the commuting difficulties for the candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iit-students-alumni-launch-portal-to-provide-transport-facilities-to-needy-neet-jee-candidates/story-lPc6karrxSuCq2H6FdK67H.html

30-08-2020||City||Use that sanitiser prudently and cautiously||In the last five months since Covid-19 forced everyone to reach for the alcohol-based hand sanitisers in a big way, many sanitiser-related accidents and injuries have been reported from around the world. Some of these incidents should really make us sit up , take note and exercise utmost caution while using the hand rub.Let me begin with a case reported from Gassco, Norway, that alerts us to a danger that most of us are unaware of- the deadly combination of alcohol-based sanitiser and static electricity. In April, an employee of Gassco sanitised his hands with an alcohol-based hand rub and touched a metal surface, when the hands were still wet. Due to static electricity, the vapour from the hand sanitiser ignited with an almost invisible flame on both his hands. The employee rushed to a sink and immediately extinguished the flames, but suffered first and second degree burns on both the hands. This incidence calls for utmost caution while using hand sanitisers, particularly in the winter months, when , because of the dry weather, static electricity is more prevalent. I would particularly warn those individuals who experience static shocks (and sparks) more than others, on touching a door knob or a car handle or any metallic part for that matter, in dry weather. Remember not to touch anything with hands which are still wet from the sanitiser. To put it differently, do not use more than the quantity required to disinfect the hands and wait till your hands are completely dry and the liquid or the gel has completely evaporated before touching anything. I would suggest similar precautions while operating an electric switch or any electric gadget that could give out a spark. I must mention here that a severe burn injury caused to an 11-year-old girl in a Children’s hospital in Portland, Oregon, USA, in 2013, was traced to fumes from the sanitiser spilled on the girl’s dress, igniting on account of static electricity. Olive oil used on her head to remove the glue used for an EEG test earlier and had dripped on to her dress, fed the flames further, the report on the cause of the fire said. There are similar reports of burn injuries caused by static electricity and sanitizers in two hospitals in the United States – in 2006 and 2002.Alcohol evaporates readily at room temperature and it is these vapours that catch fire. In March this year, a 44-year old resident of Rewari, Haryana, suffered 35 per cent burn injuries while cleaning his cell phone and keys with an alcohol-based sanitiser in the kitchen, near a source of fire. According to the hospital where he was admitted for treatment, he spilled some of the liquid on to his clothes during the process and the fumes from the alcohol reached the fire -- his wife was cooking on a gas stove nearby -- and before he could even realise what was happening, his clothes were on fire. So remember not to use the hand rub near any source of fire.Today, wherever you go -- shops, hospitals, elevators, entrance of housing colonies, airports, public offices -- you find a large bottle of sanitiser. Where soap and water are not readily available, use of alcohol-based sanitiser is imperative in these times of Covid pandemic. However, ophthalmologists are reporting cases of redness, irritation, dryness, discomfort and itching in the eyes, caused by increased use of sanitisers or the constituents of the sanitiser getting into the eye , every time you pump the dispenser to release the sanitiser spray.In fact a paper on the topic published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology recently (“Sanitiser aerosol driven ocular surface disease -- a Covid-19 repercussion”) expresses concern over this and advises consumers to close the eyes while pressing the dispenser and also keep the dispenser below eye level during usage, to prevent the sanitizer from getting into the eyes.So use the sanitiser prudently and cautiously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/use-that-sanitiser-prudently-and-cautiously/story-BH7vs89mL2jkqWjGv0dNZO.html

Referring to the ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines the Union ministry of home affairs issued on Saturday, Vij said as the states cannot impose lockdowns, the Haryana government has withdrawn its August 28 decision to close the markets on Monday and Tuesday. “Therefore, now there will be no lockdown,” Vij announced on Twitter. The Union ministry of home affairs guidelines say the states can no longer impose lockdowns outside containment zones without the Centre’s permission.To contain the spread of Covid-19, the Haryana government had on Friday ordered that malls and shops in the market places of urban areas will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday instead of the weekend. This order, however, did not apply to shops dealing with essential goods and services. The revised instructions were issued a week after the government had ordered offices and shops to remain closed on the weekend in the state. Meanwhile, Haryana Pradesh Vayapar Mandal welcomed the decision, saying the decision to shut business establishments on Monday and Tuesday was totally uncalled for and against the business communities which are already reeling under the losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-haryana-rolls-back-decision-to-shut-shops-malls-on-monday-tuesday/story-ShYdGrHXDha9fMnr1GGhNN.html

30-08-2020||City||Fake degree scam: MBU passouts stare at uncertain future, job loss||As the investigators dig deeper into the fake degree scam, hundreds of students passed out from Manav Bharati University (MBU) fear their degrees may be rendered invalid.Solan-based MBU had come under scanner after University Grants Commission (UGC) had written to authorities concerned in the state in August 2019 to conduct a thorough inquiry into the allegations of sale of fake degrees by APG University in Shimla and MBU, but the government remained silent for six months. It was after repeated reminders from UGC that the Himachal government initiated a probe against the two private universities.The UGC had informed that MBU had sold over four-five lakh degrees during the past seven years with the help of agents in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, West Bengal and South India, under the nose of HP Private Universities Regulatory Authority.Now, with the special investigating unit probing case, the university passouts are worried about their future. They have formed a group and are demanding justice from the government.“The university is being investigated for some illegal activities and allegedly fake credentials. We are suffering and seeking justice,” said a former MBU student not wanting to be named.These students are worried that their genuine degrees may be labelled fake by the investigation team. Preliminary investigations conducted by the Himachal police found that the university used two-three different registration numbers for students. Students anticipate that registration numbers on their degrees may be invalidated.“We are genuine students, but our documents could become invalid merely because we were issued a doubtful registration number by the university. It is not the students’ job to see which registration number they are being allotted. The university and government regulatory bodies are supposed to verify these things. Majority of MBU passouts belong to the lower-middle class, and now they might be on the brink losing jobs. Some already have as their degrees were not verified, said another alumnus.Many degree holders preparing for various competitive examinations said they were unable to concentrate on studies because of the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-degree-scam-mbu-passouts-stare-at-uncertain-future-job-loss/story-NdsRvJaDtYNGVdPvNWabmM.html

30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Plans afoot to develop ski slopes on Rohtang tunnel’s north portal||Plans are in the pipeline for developing ski slopes in Tiling Village in Lahaul, to boost tourism in the Himalayan valley. The Himachal government will soon seek the Centre’s approval for developing the ski slopes, CM Jai Ram Thakur told officials on Saturday. Tilling village, which has a population of 35 people (17 men and 18 women) according to the 2011 population census, is situated merely 2km away from the north portal of the Rohtang tunnel. The opening of the Rohtang tunnel, which connects Manali and Leh, will give impetus to tourism in the two remote valleys of Lahaul and Spiti.Lahaul-Spiti, which is spread over a sprawling 13,833 sq km, is a popular tourist destinations . The valleys are popular for their Buddhist monasteries, temples, and adventure tourism. The government plans to install a 550m lift in the area. There are also proposals of setting up three lifts in the village. Each lift will carry at least 60 people per hour. The estimated cost of the ski project is pegged at ₹18 crore . The Himachal government had earlier decided to ply vista dome buses inside the tunnel. The 8.8-km strategic Rohtang Tunnel, being built at 3,000 metres above sea level, will be opened for traffic by September-end. The ₹32,000-crore tunnel will shorten the 474-km distance between Manali and Leh by 46km, which means the eight-hour journey will be cut by two-and-a-half hours. The tunnel is also called Atal Tunnel, as the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced the project on June 3, 2000. The work was entrusted to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). After this announcement, there was a lull with the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi laying the foundation stone of the project on June 28, 2010. The Tunnel: In a nutshell1) The tunnel was originally designed to be 8.8-km long. However,GPS readings taken by the BRO after construction, showed it was 9-km long. 2)It is the world’s longest high-altitude tunnel at 3,000 metres above sea level 3) It will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46km 4) The tunnel also provides a telephone facility at every 150 metres, a fire hydrant at every 60 metres and an emergency exit every 500 metres5) There are turning caverns 2.2 km apart, air quality monitoring after every 1 km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection systems with CCTV cameras 250 metres apart.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to dedicate the tunnel. On Saturday, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who was accompanied by tribal affairs minister Ram Lal Markanda visited the tunnel to inspect the progress. Thakur said not only was the tunnel strategically important but will also boost tourism in the region . He said the Atal Tunnel will be a boon for residents of Lahaul and Spiti Valley who remain cut off from the rest of the country in winters for nearly six months due to heavy snowfall. The tunnel will provide almost all-weather connectivity to troops stationed in Ladakh, he added. Jai Ram Thakur said that for full all-weather connectivity up to Leh-Ladakh, additional tunnels would have to be built on the Manali-Leh route.The CM said snow galleries had also been built on the approach road to the tunnel from Manali side, and this will ensure all-weather connectivity. He said bridges on the approach road to both portals of the tunnel have also been completed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plans-afoot-to-develop-ski-slopes-on-rohtang-tunnel-s-north-portal/story-0mMovqjCLo6d6E3Xt551nI.html
30-08-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Resuming civic works in Pune unavoidable, but prevention should be top priority||PUNE The coronavirus pandemic has badly affected our economy and people need to get back to work and start earning. Starting work/projects is the first step towards normalcy and let people take responsibility for safeguarding themselves. Workspaces that do not require people to throng at close quarters can definitely resume. At this stage, India cannot afford unemployed people and needs to find a solution to develop herd immunity. Maithily Manakwad Prevention is the only cure Easing restrictions is unavoidable. It is not possible for any government to take foolproof measures to avoid any possible cases of spread of infection. Even developed countries like the US are unable to do so. The reason is that Covid-19 pandemic is not only a medical or health issue, but it is also an issue of social practices and hygiene, habits and taking precautions. Social reform is the need of the hour across all sections of society. For a developing economy of ours, continual lockdown is not a solution. Rather people should inculcate cleanliness and hygiene habits like wearing mask, following social distancing norm, washing hands and others. Easing restrictions means potential exposure of employees and labourers to the virus in all sections of industry and services. Employers should make enough arrangements for the safety of their employees. At the same time, local government bodies should look at increasing testing, isolation facilities and treatment centres. Dr Vishwas Chavan Spread public awareness on safety precautions I do not think that whatever steps the government authorities and local bodies have taken are adequate. Right now, on the streets, one can find four people out of ten not wearing masks or following safety norms. Many are not following the proper hygiene routine. The government should focus on spreading more awareness regarding safety precautions to flatten the Covid-19 curve. Avinash Kadhe Residents’ contribution is equally important The government is taking steps to control the pandemic, but people’s contribution is equally important. They are not following the simple SMS (sanitiser, mask and social distancing) norms which are very much essential to fight against the spread of Covid-19. Many times, the labour class of the society is not much aware of the hygiene habits and do not have access to basic necessities. Many people are not even wearing masks while stepping out and spit in public places. These offenders should be penalised. Labs and tests have increased and jumbo Covid-19 centres are also ready, which is a positive sign. In short, people participation and government’s efforts can together help in fighting the pandemic. Indrayani Khole Government ill-prepared to manage pandemicThe Covid-19 restrictions in the city are being eased, but the number of positive cases of people infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection is on the rise. The government and local bodies are ill-prepared to manage the pandemic. The local authorities should closely monitor the situation and impose a lockdown if necessary. Other cities with more population and fewer resources have managed the pandemic better, and we despite being a Smart City and an IT hub failed to keep a check on the rise in cases. There is confusion among residents with regards to rules and half-hearted implementation of the lockdown. Even today we can see many people flouting safety norms and not even wearing masks. I have seen masks hanging around the employees’ necks in grocery stores. Not only local bodies, even residents should behave responsibly. Arunkumar Nair, convenor, Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchyat Chapter, Vishrantwadi Stop announcing unreasonable targets for political mileage Civic development works are important and must be resumed wherever possible. State leaders are seen announcing unreasonable targets for civic projects to gain political mileage, which is alarming. In the city, it is seen that there is a race to resume civic projects, but some are uncalled for. The jumbo facility at College of Engineering, Pune, grounds was constructed at breakneck speed. It was done putting at risk the lives of the workforce involved, mainly migrant and low-income group labourers. They were seen working in rains, 24X7 without proper safety measures. On the contrary, at sites of road construction and water supply related projects, Smart City projects, labourers are working with proper care. Every stakeholder must recognise and respect the human rights of labourers specifically the right of protection from being affected by Covid-19. Reckless civic work without due care will lead to an increase in Covid-19 risk exposure of the low income and migrant workforce.

30-08-2020||Noida||Pak national arrested in UP’s Noida for violation of visa norms||A Pakistani woman has been arrested in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida for allegedly violating visa rules, Gautam Buddh Nagar Police officials said on Sunday. The 36-year-old woman, identified as Nausheen Naaz from Karachi in Pakistan, was held on Saturday. She was staying with her husband at their Ajmeri Gate home in Delhi on a long-term visa. The couple had got married in 2005, the officials said. “The woman had entered Noida in violation of the rules of her long-term visa. She was in a bus which was intercepted for checking under a flyover at Sector 14A of the city. She was arrested after inspection,” a police spokesperson said. An FIR has been lodged against her at the Sector 20 police station under Section 14 of the Foreigners’ Act, 1946, and further legal proceedings are underway in the case, he added. According to officials, the woman’s visa allowed her long-term stay in the country but not outside Delhi.  For travel anywhere outside the national capital she was required to have necessary permissions, they said. On Saturday, she was on her way to Sector 137 of Noida for a picnic along with some relatives in the mini bus but got arrested soon after crossing over into the UP territory. The others accompanying her were left after the inspection, the officials said. The Saturday arrest also came at a time when lockdown-like curbs are imposed in Noida, like elsewhere across Uttar Pradesh, over the state government’s orders amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Security checks intensify across the state, especially at state and district borders, during the period of restriction, which begins 10 pm Friday and ends 5 am Monday, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pak-national-arrested-in-up-s-noida-for-violation-of-visa-norms/story-vKYcbOyZS3YW9FdB8HSeZK.html

30-08-2020||Lucknow||Three more held in connection with killing of journalist in UP’s Ballia||Three more persons have been arrested in connection with the murder of journalist Ratan Singh here, a senior police official said on Sunday. Six people were arrested earlier in the case on August 25, police said. “A joint team of police, Special Operations Group (SOG) and surveillance on Saturday arrested Uday Narayan Singh, Anil Singh and Tejbahadur Singh,” Superintendent of Police Devendra Nath said on Sunday. The three were carrying a reward of Rs 25,000 each on information leading to their arrest, the SP said. A stick and two axes used in the crime have been recovered, he said. The SP said a local court had issued a non-bailable warrant against the three accused. Ratan Singh (45), who worked with a Hindi news channel, was shot dead on August 24 night in the Phephana police station area of the district. A day later, a police officer was suspended while six people were arrested in connection with the murder. Ballia’s Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sanjay Yadav had earlier said that on the complaint of the journalist’s father, six people -- Sushil Singh, Dinesh Singh, Arvind Singh, Suneel Singh, Vir Bahadur Singh and Vinay Singh --have been arrested. He added that Phephana police station in-charge Shashi Mauli Pandey was suspended. He said the complaint was lodged against 10 people. According to the ASP, the journalist’s father, Vinod Singh, alleged that Sonu Singh of their village had called his son to his house around 8 pm where the accused were waiting with lathis and a revolver and they killed him. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had stated on August 24 night that Ratan Singh had a property dispute with his neighbour and after a fight between the two, he was shot dead. Accused Dinesh Singh is the parcener (pattidar) of Ratan Singh. An old enmity and a property dispute with the neighbour led to the journalist’s murder, a senior police official had said. He said Ratan Singh’s killing had nothing to do with his being a journalist. The incident drew flak from the Opposition, which alleged “poor” law and order and accused the state government of failing to curb crime. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to the family of the deceased and offered condolences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/three-more-held-in-connection-with-killing-of-journalist-in-up-s-ballia/story-VR5AjdqT4DRVOHMAj0j5GO.html

30-08-2020||Delhi||JNU student Devangana Kalita denied bail in riots case||A Delhi court on Saturday denied the bail plea of JNU student and Pinjra Tod member Devangana Kalita, who was arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots conspiracy case, being probed by the Delhi Police’s special cell. The court said the statement of the ‘protected witnesses’ reflect the role of many accused persons, including Kalita, regarding the protest sites and how everything was being planned. The court also said the right to freedom of speech and expression as assured by the Constitution is subject to reasonable restrictions. Delhi Police in their submissions have maintained that the riots were orchestrated by a few anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protesters, such as Kalita. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said Kalita had planned and participated in road blockades as part of the plan. He said their statements clearly point to the role of Kalita as well as other co-accused persons and various actions taken by them in pursuance to the conspiracy.Kalita, lodged in Tihar jail along with another JNU student and Pinjra Todh member Natasha Narwal, was arrested by Delhi Police on May 23 in connection with a protest against the CAA in north-east Delhi’’s Jafrabad area in February. Police have named her as one of the main conspirators of the violence. He submitted that her location is also found at protest sites in Jafrabad at the time of the riots. At least 53 persons were killed and 400 others injured after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims in February.The special cell has named many anti-CAA voices such as Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar, Gufisha Fatima, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Tahir Hussain in the conspiracy leading to the riots. The arrested persons have denied the charges and accused the police of launching a witch hunt against anti-CAA protesters. “Since the present case is of a conspiracy resulting in riots, there are various individuals, organisations and groups which are interlinked and from the statements working in tandem. Thus, the statements or acts by the other co-conspirators in furtherance of the common object of the conspiracy will be admissible against the present accused Devangana, and the statements and evidence will have to be read in entirety since it is a case of conspiracy. Moreover, the assertion that the accused herself physically and directly did not resort to violence as understood in common parlance would not be germane in the context of various acts committed by different individuals including accused in the commission of riots,” the judge said in his 12-page order dated August 28.Appearing for Kalita, her counsel Adit S Pujari had told the court that his client’s expression of dissent is not an offence under the law. He said that his client had a history of resorting to cause-based peaceful expression of dissent. He said that even the apex court, with respect to the protest at Shaheen Bagh, had observed that right to protest against the legislature is not taken away.To this, the court said, “The said assertion, is correct to the extent that freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India grants her the power and right to voice her opinion about any legislation and thus, to peacefully protest. However, such a right under Article 19 of the Constitution of India is subject to reasonable restrictions.” Appearing for the special cell, special public prosecutor Amit Prasad had contended that during the course of the investigation, technical and manual evidence revealed that Kalita played an important role in the days leading to the riots by way of road blocks, hate speeches, and instigating protesters to get violent against the Union government. Kalita’s lawyer had earlier told the court that Kalita had only protested against the citizenship law and was not linked to the riots. The police said she belonged to the organisation, Pinjra Tod, and that it had actively participated in anti CAA/NRC protests as well as in instigating the riots. Her name was also revealed during the interrogation of accused Gulfisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-student-devangana-kalita-denied-bail-in-riots-case/story-tb8sW40E8FQ4B2myJX2ihP.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||Man suspected of stealing phone tied to tree, lynched by 4 people in Delhi’s Naraina||A 23-year-old man, suspected to be a cellphone thief, died after being allegedly tied to a tree and beaten up with sticks and iron rods in a public park by four men in west Delhi’s Naraina on Friday, the police said. All the four alleged killers were arrested on Friday. The sticks and iron rods used in the crime were also recovered from them, senior police officials associated with the case said on Saturday. The park where the murder took place is located behind a police post at Loha Mandi in Naraina. The dead man had been involved in nearly a dozen petty crimes and arrested at least thrice. He had come out of jail just ten days ago, his family members said. The police control room received a call around 6am about the incident at a municipal park in Loha Mandi on Friday, deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said. He added that a team from the Naraina police station reached there and found a man lying under a tree with injuries. A coconut fibre rope and a white muffler were also found on the crime scene, suggesting that the man was tie to a tree. Shesh Kumar, a washerman who is a witness to the crime, told police that he saw his four neighbours assaulting the man and taking him to the park early morning, Purohit said. Kumar told officials that the four men tied the victim to a tree and beat him up with sticks and iron rods, according to Purohit. Kumar lives near the park.“Kumar tried to intervene and requested them to release the injured person. But they did not pay heed to his request and said the man and his associates had stolen a mobile phone from a truck. Since his associates ran away with the mobile phone, they said they would not spare him,” Purohit said, quoting Kumar’s statement. The four men --- identified as Mushtaq Ahmed, his brother Shiraj Ahmed, Anish and Ishtihar (all residents of Loha Mandi) --- fled the crime scene after the condition of the victim deteriorated. They work as loaders in Loha Mandi. Police identified the victim as Rahul, alias Dhancha, a 23-year-old resident of Jawahar Camp in Kirti Nagar. The police took him to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead. His body was later shifted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, where the autopsy was conducted on Saturday. The suspects were soon arrested from Loha Mandi itself. They said Rahul and his associates had stolen Shiraj’s cellphone from his truck. While they caught hold of Rahul, his associates escaped with the stolen phone. “We are verifying the allegations of the arrested men,” said an official associated with the probe, requesting anonymity. Mukesh Yadav, a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Faizabad who works at an iron sheet manufacturing factory opposite the park said, “Nobody knows the actual reason for which the four men killed the man. Most of us (workers) were sleeping when the incident happened. By the time I reached the park, the man had fallen unconscious and his attackers had fled.” Officials said Rahul lived with his parents, wife, and two children Jawahar Camp in Kirti Nagar area, which is across the railway tracks from Loha Mandi. He had a love marriage four years ago. His wife, Pooja, said that on Thursday evening, he packed his clothes in a bag after they had an argument over storing drinking water in jars and left home, saying he would return only after getting a legitimate job. “When he did not return till midnight, i searched him in the neighbourhood and asked his friends but they all were unaware of his whereabouts. I thought he would return in the morning,” said Pooja. Around 11 am on Friday, Pooja said, a neighbour told him that some policemen were asking about her husband and their address. She went to the police station to enquire if her husband has been “named” in any crime yet again. “The policemen asked me to wait at the police station. An hour later, one of them told me that my husband was murdered for stealing a phone and his four killers were arrested. I don’t know what the truth is,” Pooja said, adding that her husband was last arrested for possessing a knife and an illegal gun. “He had come out of jail on August 17. The police always looked for him wherever any crime occurred in Naraina or Kirti Nagar,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-suspected-of-stealing-phone-tied-to-tree-lynched-by-4-people-in-delhi-s-naraina/story-dX62UuLRDS5NpyjcjrMgWP.html
30-08-2020||Gurugram||New drain channels to stop flooding in Gurugram||A week after underpasses at both IFFCO Chowk and Rajiv Chowk were inundated following heavy rains and were subsequently closed for nearly two days, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials said that they were building new drainage lines to prevent waterlogging. In 2017, during the construction of the Rajiv Chowk underpass, underground channel drains were inadvertently blocked during construction work. Officials found the anomaly when the underpass was flooded in July 2018. Till date, officials confirmed, they have not been able to find the original underground channel drains. The stretch leading to the underpass is located on a slope, resulting in rainwater from two residential sectors accumulating at the facility. An NHAI official who is privy to the matter said a drainage line for the underpass was laid last year but there were leveling issues. GMDA chief engineer Pradeep Kumar also said that levelling is an issue.“There is a mismatch in levelling which is resulting in flooding during heavy rains. To fix this, we will build an additional drainage line for the underpass, routing it through the Tau Devi Lal sports complex towards the main HSVP master drain,” said Kumar.Kumar said that the steps undertaken for fixing drainage lines at both IFFCO Chowk and Rajiv Chowk are part of GMDA’s new plan for finding “permanent and long-term” solution to the drainage problem in the city. The two underpasses were among eight of the city’s 11 that had high rainwater accumulation on August 19. Although rainwater was cleared from both the underpasses on the same day, with heavy rain occurring on the following day as well, they were not opened to public until August 21 as a precautionary measure.Kumar said estimates for the project have been made but he found some hurdles in the current route of the new line and suggested tweaks. “I have tweaked the drainage line and re-routed the line in some parts. These changes need approval from the GMDA CEO VS Kundu, after which we will commence the next phase,” said Kumar..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/new-drain-channels-to-stop-flooding-in-gurugram/story-5frQmbltjylNi5TfmIPibJ.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||Seelampur, Shastri Park flyovers to open in 10 days||Two flyovers aimed at providing signal-free ride between Welcome in northeast Delhi and Inter-state Bus Terminus (ISBT) Kashmere Gate — a roughly eight kilometre ride on one of the most congested and traffic-heavy stretches in Delhi -- may be inaugurated within the “next 10 days”, officials in the Public Works Department said. It would be a relief for motorists headed to the ISBT and parts of Central Delhi from Ghaziabad, north-east and east Delhi areas such as Shahdara, Seelampur, Dilshad Garden, Jafrabad and Gandhi Nagar as now they would be able to escape traffic snarls on the Grand Trunk (GT) Road.The project to build a one-way flyover at Seelampur and a two-way flyover at Shastri Park has taken over one and a half years due to finish. An official associated with the construction of these flyovers said that the project had witnessed a number of roadblocks in last few months. He said earlier in November-December due to spike in pollution the work remained suspended for around a month and then for over a week it was stopped due to communal violence in north-east district. Then, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the contractors did not have adequate workforce. The project is being executed by Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD).“We have completed 95% of the construction work. Some finishing work such as road carpeting, lane marking, painting and installation of street lights are going on, which will be completed in a few days The flyovers will be ready for use by September 10. Next month, we will write to the government for its opening ceremony. The flyover is likely to be inaugurated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal between September 10 and September 15,” a senior PWD official, said requesting anonymity.Officials said the two flyovers are likely to cut travel time between Shahdara in east Delhi to Kashmere Gate ISBT by at least 10 minutes. The construction of these flyovers had started in February 2019 and was to be completed in March 2020 but the project had hit a hurdle initially when construction was banned due to pollution and later because of riots in the region in February . Further the project was stalled due to the lockdown. It’s deadline was shifted to July 2020 but due to lack of labour it missed the deadline.“This is one of the priority projects of the city government so we wanted to open it in March this year but it couldn’t be done due to the hurdles. Even though the work was resumed in May end, the pace remained slow because of labour shortage. Work is now almost complete and the facility will be ready after September first week,” the PWD official said.The combined cost of the project is Rs 303.1 croreS Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said that once these flyovers are opened, it will bring relief to motorists commuting between Ghaziabad and the Kashmere Gate ISBT using GT Road—Yudhister Setu (over Yamuna)-Shahdara-stretch.“Opening of these flyovers will end traffic bottlenecks in areas such as Seelampur, Shastri Park, Shahdara. It will also improve connectivity to Gandhi Nagar and Khajoori Khas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seelampur-shastri-park-flyovers-to-open-in-10-days/story-DKiE7VN7kPerSxAkIhaFjI.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||Capital adds 1,954 cases; highestone-day virus spike since July 10||Delhi on Saturday recorded 1,954 new cases of Covid-19 – the highest single-day jump since July 10, when 2,089 cases were recorded, taking the cumulative number of infections in the city to 171,366. Delhi, which had seemingly turned a corner in its fight against the infection, has seen a steady rise in the number of cases, after a lull towards the end of July, till mid-August. In the past seven days, the national capital has added an average of 1,621 cases of the infection, the most since mid-July.While a total of 152,922 people have recovered from the disease in the city, Saturday’s health bulletin —issued by the Delhi government — also recorded 15 new deaths, taking the toll in the city to 4,404. To be sure, even though the case count in the city seems to be on an upward trajectory, deaths have mostly remained stable this month. As on Saturday, the city has added a daily average of 17 deaths in the past seven days, significantly lower than the fatalities Delhi was adding at the peak in mid-June. At that point, the city, for a week, recorded a daily seven-day average of over 70 deaths a day.Earlier this week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the infection figures in the city had witnessed a spike since August 17, following which he directed for stricter enforcement of safety guidelines and the number of tests to be doubled – to around 40,000 per day.Saturday’s health bulletin recorded 22,004 tests, of which 6,597 were the gold standard RT-PCR tests and the rest were rapid antigen tests. At least 212 containment zones in the city were notified in the last seven days — taking the total to 803 as on Saturday. Senior government officials said that clusters have surfaced in several locations, for which a large number of containment zones were created across the city.As on Saturday, southwest district has the highest number of containment zones (162), followed by west Delhi (113), north Delhi (110) and south Delhi (102), government records showed.Medical experts warned that people must continue following safety norms, such as wearing masks and maintaining hand hygiene.“Yes, there has been an increase in the number of cases being reported daily, but it is not alarming. We are also not reporting extremely high number of hospitalisations or deaths as it happened in June. So, its not a cause of worry. Plus, the government is well prepared and the infrastructure is in place. That said, people should continue following the general precautions like wearing mask and washing hands frequently,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/capital-adds-1-954-cases-highestone-day-virus-spike-since-july-10/story-t7V6VmQNwjADdAiKtSc29M.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||Hospitalisations up, but most not from Delhi, doctors say||The steady rise in the number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases recorded in the city has also led to a rise in the number of hospitalisations, with over 900 more beds occupied on Saturday than at the start of the month. The Capital added 1,954 more infections on Saturday and 3,966 are currently admitted in the city’s hospitals. To be sure, Delhi still has 10,177 free Covid-19 beds.Doctors and hospital officials said this increase has largely been driven by patients from neighbouring states, especially Uttar Pradesh. Clinicians from large multi-speciality hospitals in Delhi and Gurugram said between 70% and 90% of Covid-19 patients admitted in their hospitals are not from Delhi-NCR.“A large proportion of people are coming to Delhi hospitals from other states for Covid-19 treatment. I would say more than 80% of my patients are from outside Delhi, especially from Uttar Pradesh. Two months back, almost all my patients were from Delhi-NCR [National Capital Region],” said Dr Nevin Kishore, head of the bronchology department at Max hospital, Saket.The average number of Covid-19 cases being reported in Delhi each day has increased to 1,621 in the seven day-period ending August 29, compared to 1,018 cases reported on average in the first week of the month, data shows.On Friday, 3,966 people with Covid-19 were in hospitals in Delhi, according to the daily health bulletin, compared to 2,979 on August 1. In effect, almost 29% of the total active cases in Delhi are admitted in hospitals. “We are now getting a lot of calls for admissions from outside Delhi. More than half my patients are not residents of Delhi. After a dip, admissions started going up from the beginning of the month, simultaneously with an increase in the number of cases in UP and Bihar. Most Delhi patients are in home isolation,” said Dr Rajeev Chawla, consulting pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Over 7,000 in Delhi were isolating at home as on Saturday.Dr Kishore said, “After a dip in July, our ICUs are full again, this time mostly with patients from neighbouring states.”While movement between states was restricted during the lockdown period, the Unlock 1.0 guidelines, which came into effect in June, removed those curbs. A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.“Earlier, all our Covid-19 patients were from Delhi itself. But now, a large portion — at least 40%, are from outside. Patients are being brought in from neighbouring states like UP, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.However, the large super-speciality private hospitals such as Max and Apollo are running out of ICU beds.As on Friday noon, 93.9% of the intensive care unit beds with ventilators were occupied in large superspeciality hospitals and 75.8% non-ventilator ICU beds were occupied, according to data from the ‘Delhi Corona’ app.“There has been a slight increase in the number of cases being reported from Haryana and Delhi, but it is not substantial enough to account for the number of admissions. Almost 90% of my patients are from either Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, or Punjab. This is because of the dismal healthcare infrastructure in these states. The number of local admissions has flattened. Also, we are receiving the very sick patients who have either travelled from far or have been referred from other hospitals,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, head, emergency services at Medanta hospital in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hospitalisations-up-but-most-not-from-delhi-doctors-say/story-1bER6awy96TSc3440zUW4K.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||After spike in cases, Delhi amps up Covid-19 norms enforcement||Following a spike in Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government has started deploying additional enforcement teams in all 11 revenue districts to ensure people follow safety guidelines, and impose fines in the event of violations. This has led to penalties for violations going up by 10 times in some districts, officials said.Previously, police officers and officials engaged by sub-divisional magistrates were already enforcing Covid-19 guidelines and penalising people for not wearing masks or violating social distancing norms.On Thursday, HT had reported that since June 14, the police alone had penalised more than 188,000 people for not wearing masks. Government officials said the revenue districts penalised around 41,000 people in the same period norms violations. The additional deployment is part of a strategy for stricter norms enforcement after an announcement by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this week in light of a rise in daily recorded infections. This week, Delhi has recorded an average of 1,621 cases.On Friday, additional teams of between eight and 20 officers were deployed in all districts, depending on the region’s size and population density, a senior government official said. Each enforcement team will comprise an executive magistrate, and revenue and police personnel, an official said, adding that awareness teams have also been formed to encourage people to follow anti-Covid measures.“There has been a significant increase in fines after the additional deployment. It also suggests that people have started taking things casually, when they should be more alert,” said an official in the north district.North district data as on Saturday showed that 1,495 people were penalised in the 24 hours after the deployment, as against 146 penalties a day recorded in the district between June 1 and 15, when the Covid-19 situation in the city was at its peak.Similarly, central district data showed that 2,101 people were penalised for not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, as against 168 penalties recorded per day in the district between June 1 and 15.The penalty for not wearing a mask is a Rs 500 spot fine.Social distancing guidelines violations can attract a penalty up to Rs 1,000.Other districts are yet to collate data and send reports to the chief secretary’s office, a government official said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-spike-in-cases-delhi-amps-up-covid-19-norms-enforcement/story-lpBAtmqw86da4fvrAMURNK.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro resumption to happen in ‘graded manner’; protocol out soon||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will resume train operations after a hiatus of over five months from September 7, with the Union home ministry (MHA) on Saturday allowing Metro services in a graded manner under the Unlock 4.0 guidelines to gradually ease restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19.“Metro rail will be allowed to operate with effect from 7th September 2020 in a graded manner, by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (Mohua)/Ministry of Railways (MOR), in consultation with the MHA. In this regard, SOP will be issued by Mohua,” the order read.The announcement came on a day when Delhi recorded 1,954 fresh Covid-19 cases – the highest single-day spike since July 10, when 2,089 cases were recorded.Minutes after the go-ahead from the Centre, the DMRC issued a statement saying the protocols that need to be followed at the station and inside trains will be released after specific guidelines are issued by the Centre. “As per the latest guidelines issued by the MHA under Unlock-4, the Delhi Metro will be resuming its services for public from September 7 onwards in a calibrated manner,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC.Dayal added, “Further details on the Metro functioning and its usage by the general public will be shared once the detailed SOP on Metros is issued by the Mohua in the next few days.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal welcomed the decision. “I am glad that metro has been permitted to start its operations from 7 Sep in a phased manner,” Kejriwal tweeted.Delhi Metro services have been suspended since March 22. The MoHUA said it will issue SOPs for Metro operations, after discussions with all corporations. “Metro rail operations have been allowed from 7th September, 2020. The SOPs already circulated will be discussed on 1st Sep 2020 through video conferencing by Mohua with all metro companies and finalised,” ministry spokesperson Rajiv Jain said.While some commuters welcomed the announcement as “long overdue”, others questioned the timing, since Covid cases have been on the rise. “The Metro is vital for those who are working and going to their jobs. People who don’t own private vehicles don’t have to worry but riding the bus or taking cabs now is tough,” tweeted MK Tomar. Another commuter, Vinayak Patwardhan, tweeted, “Don’t allow the Delhi Metro to run just yet. Cases are on a rise and more people will get infected. The stations are a congested space and this will increase the possibility of the spread of infection...”Delhi Police and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officers said they will continue to hold meetings with the Metro’s security unit to decide measures to ensure social distancing at stations. One such meeting is scheduled for Monday.DMRC officials privy to the arrangements being made for the resumption of services pointed out that managing operations will be challenging. “Though the final SOP will come from the ministry, through the discussions we have had over the last few months, we know the focus will be on very strict implementation of social distancing norms inside the stations and in trains,” a senior DMRC official said on the condition of anonymity.Dr. Prateek Rajyavardhan, who specialises in community medicine and is associated with a government hospital in Delhi, said managing crowds in an enclosed space, especially in underground stations will be a tough task for the agencies. “We will have to wait for the final guidelines to be issued by the ministry before we comment on the success or failure of the trial. Managing the crowds in stations will still be easier, but what happens inside the trains? Since we have opened up the rest of the city, we had to open up mass transit systems at some point, but if this is the right time is what we need to see,” Rajyavardhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-4-delhi-metro-to-resume-on-sept-7-in-graded-manner-protocol-out-soon/story-vOzTSUdQslNLs5tRXVLscK.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Akali Dal seeks FIR against MLA Zira, says he tested Covid-19 positive on Aug 26||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday demanded registration of a criminal case against Congress MLA Kulbir Singh Zira for putting chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, other Punjab Vidhan Sabha members and staff at risk as he attended the one-day assembly session despite having tested positive for Covid-19 two days before. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, SAD leader in assembly Sharanjeet Singh Dhillon and former minister Bikram Majithia also demanded FIR against state health minister Balbir Sidhu for allegedly facilitating Zira’s illegal entry into the assembly by procuring a negative report for him. “We want the assembly speaker (Rana KP Singh) to act in a totally unbiased manner. If he plays a partisan role to justify Zira’s illegal entry as well as the unbecoming conduct of the health minister who was supposed to ensure compliance of Covid-19 protocol, the Akali Dal will have no choice but to bring forth a notice for his removal from his chair,” said the two. Majithia claimed that Zira tested positive at Ferozepur on August 26. “Health officials have said on record that they informed the health minister about Zira’s report on August 27. The minister should be sacked and a criminal case should be registered against him for violating the protocols of his own department,” said Majithia. The SAD leaders said the CM first gave a statement that SAD legislators who came in contact with MLA Gurpartap Wadala should not attend the assembly session as he had tested Covid positive. “But on the day of the session, the CM uttered a white lie saying the SAD MLAs deliberately did not come to attend the session. We want to ask him why he is going into seven-day quarantine after coming in contact with Zira. Isn’t he following the same protocol which was followed by the SAD MLAs?” they questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/akali-dal-seeks-fir-against-mla-zira-says-he-tested-covid-19-positive-on-aug-26/story-ZJ52tqufozB9VhFRSioIcM.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||SAD took Covid refuge to escape voting on farm ordinance resolution: Capt||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs took refuge in the pandemic to keep away from the one-day Vidhan Sabha session as they did not want to be party to the resolution rejecting the Centre’s anti-farmer ordinances. In a press release, the CM dismissed the Akalis’ charge of running away from burning issues on the pretext of Covid-19. “Having supported the ordinances being part of the NDA government, the Akalis could not afford to vote for the resolution and yet did not want to appear to be anti-farmer. Under the circumstances, they found an easy way out in the guise of the pandemic to stay out of the Vidhan Sabha completely,” said Amarinder.“The speaker and I had appealed to the MLAs having come in contact with any of their infected colleagues not to attend the session. But not a single Akali member turned up for the session. It is clearly the Akalis who are running away. At no point were opposition MLAs asked not to attend the session. The appeal was for all members, including those of the ruling party,” said Amarinder. “In case, if the Akalis are so concerned about the spreading of Covid and heeded the advice to stay away from the House on this ground, then why are they continuing with their street protests despite my repeated pleas to all political parties not to indulge in such activities which endanger the lives of people,” the CM asked. Amarinder also rejected the SAD’s demand for another Vidhan Sabha session next month when the state’s Covid figures are projected to peak. He pointed out that despite several of its own ministers and MLAs testing positive, his government decided to go ahead with the one-day session to meet the constitutional requirement as was being done by other states. Amarinder cited the example of neighbouring Haryana, which had cut short its original 3-day assembly session to one day amidst the pandemic after several of their MLAs tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-took-covid-refuge-to-escape-voting-on-farm-ordinance-resolution-capt/story-ZhX1gsDano1Pt0PW0jCCVJ.html

Gajinder’s name is on the list of 11 Sikhs the highest Sikh temporal seat has finalised for various awards. The list has not been announced officially. The decision was taken during a meeting of the Sikh clergy on August 24, it is learnt.“The award is being given to Gajinder Singh to hail his work and sacrifices for the community,” said an Akal Takht secretariat employee. The Akal Takht acting jathedar, however, was not available for comments.Currently living in Pakistan, Gajinder spent 14 years in a prison of the neighbouring country in the case of plane hijacking that was done for the release of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. After a terror attack on Indian Parliament in 2001, the union home ministry had shared a list with Pakistan to extradite 20 persons, including Gajinder.Besides, former Damdami Taksal head late Sant Giani Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale will be given the ‘Panth Rattan’ award. Slain religious figure Baba Charan Singh Bir Sahib, a fake encounter victim, will be given the title of ‘Qaumi Shaheed’.

30-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s decision on final-year varsity exams to be announced by Monday||A day after the Supreme Court (SC) clarified that final-year students cannot be awarded their degrees without end-of-term exams, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant called for a meeting with vice-chancellors (VCs) of all 13 state universities on Saturday. A special committee was formed to decide the fate of exams and a decision will be announced on Monday (August 31), said Samant, adding that holding exams before September 30 was not possible. On Friday, the apex court upheld a decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC) that called for completion of the evaluation process across the country by September. SC clarified that colleges and universities cannot award degrees to students without conducting final-year or final-term examinations. Maharashtra was one of the states that had decided to cancel final-year exams and promote the students on the basis of aggregate marks from semester exams. The court also mentioned that states were empowered to take decisions under the Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005, to postpone final-year or final-semester exams beyond the September-end deadline. It allowed states to approach UGC for new dates that have to be communicated to them “at the earliest”. Samant said after the meeting that the committee headed by Mumbai University’s vice-chancellor Dr Suhas Pednekar will submit its report by Monday noon after due deliberations with other vice chancellors and principals of colleges. Samant said, “Respecting the SC order, we will conduct examinations, but at the same time we will ensure that the health issues of the students, teaching and non-teaching staff members are not compromised. Taking all aspects into account and the options given to conduct the exams by UGC, the committee will submit its report by Monday afternoon. We will announce the rough timeline, how they can be conducted, besides the options for the students with ATKT and those going to other countries,” he said. The minister said that examinations will be held in the simplest way and without summoning students to the exam halls. “UGC has given us various options, including open book, assignment based, online and offline to conduct the exams. The committee will deliberate on these options and come out with the simpler and student-friendly format. We are also checking the option of online exams and are in touch with other state government over the options opted by them. The students will be given adequate time for the preparations. The VCs have told us that they will need 45-50 days for preparations of exams and as such, conducting the exams before September 30, is out of question,” he said. The minister said that conducting the exams at exam centres was not possible in the wake of the widespread Covid-19 infection.

30-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees record one-day spike of 16,867 Covid-19 cases||Saturday saw a record 16,867 Covid-19 cases in the state, a massive jump from the previous highest in a day (14,888) , even as the government considers more relaxations from the first week of September. The case tally rose to 764,281 as the state reported 328 more fatalities, taking the toll to 24,103.Pune district reported 3,062 cases (Pune city – 1972, Pimpri-Chinchwad – 1,132 and rural Pune — 958), followed by other key contributors such as Nashik (1,162), Nagpur (1,401), Jalgaon (879). Mumbai reported 1,432 cases, taking its tally to 1,43,389. In response to the notification issued by the Central government on Saturday, the state, too, is expected to take steps to extend relaxations from the ongoing lockdown. The state government is mulling to increase staff in government and private offices to 30 to 50%, allow interdistrict travel and other activities, including gymnasiums, to be operational from the first week of September. Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, said the state notification will be issued in a day or two. “We will take the central notification into account, while issuing our own by Monday or so. The decision about relaxations will be taken after due deliberation,” he said. Among 1,85,131 active patients in the state, the highest (49,365) are in Pune, 20,264 in Thane and 19,,971 in Mumbai. With 11,541 recoveries on Saturday, the number of recoveries reached 554,711. The state recovery rate stood at 72.58%. Of the 328 fatalities reported in past 24 hours, 255 were from past 48 hours, 37 were reported in the past week and the remaining 36 were from the period before it, the state health department has stated. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 3.15%, against the national rate of 1.82%. Maharashtra conducted 77,678 tests and reported 16,867 cases at a positivity rate of 21.71%. State has 13,12,059 people under home quarantine and 35,524 are institutionally quarantined. Authorities are wary about further spike in cases over the next few weeks amid the relaxations and the free movement of people due to the festivals. The state government is facing pressure from various fronts for relaxations from lockdown curbs and opening up religious places, gymnasiums, inter-district transport etc.“In the wake of more relaxations rolled out from the first week of September, we expect this leading to the rise in numbers in coming weeks. Though we have been claiming to reach the plateau by mid-September, the number of rural areas is still rising and it may make it difficult to expect the infection to stabilise by then. This has been the reason we have been planning to go for the aggressive surveillance and tracking of high and low-risk contacts under our ‘chase the virus’ programme in September. Our entire focus would be on reducing the fatalities even if the number of infections kept rising,” said an official from the health department. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said that though reducing the number of infections was not possible immediately, the government should focus on awareness among the people. “Now you cannot continue with the lockdown, nor you expect the number to come down immediately. By using alternative manpower to replace the existing workforce, which is under stress, the government should aggressively go for surveillance so that suspected patients are traced to the early stage. People should be educated about the guidelines and self-hygiene so that the spread is contained at maximum level and fatalities are controlled,” he said. “Though the number of tests has been increased, most of them are rapid antigen tests, which do not give cent percent report on infections. The patients with the negative report of the antigen test ought to go again for the Rt-PCR, though positive reports of antigen tests are confirmed positive cases,” said an official from the state government. The official said penetration in rural areas is cause for concern for them as health infrastructures in these areas is poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-record-one-day-spike-of-16-867-covid-19-cases/story-mNTuW4DbshrVKJom4OCT0I.html

30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Teachers are the unsung heroes of the crisis||While we are all aware of the tremendous fortitude displayed unerringly by medical staff, administrative services and security officials, et al, across the world, during the pandemic, what has largely been overlooked is the robust performance of the teaching fraternity.Teachers are often belittled and even reviled by parents in our country, mostly with no justification. During the current crisis, many parents have refused to pay their children’s fees even though schools have made arrangements for digital education despite several constraints across India.Government schools too have risen to the occasion and have somehow managed to keep the educational system afloat by innovatively sending course material and instructions to children through WhatsApp, email or other channels. Copies are being corrected and video/audio classes being conducted by most schools, despite little or no training of teaching staff in such methods.The pandemic came almost unannounced and no one was prepared for what was to come. People have lost their jobs and others have hung on by the skin of their teeth. Teachers have had to adapt from the comfortable norm of being in command in a classroom full of students, to being pale shadows of themselves as small blips on a tiny screen.The larger than life personas that many teachers possess, especially in the eyes of their students, equips them with an aura that enables them weave their magic through the time-tested way of classroom teaching. And although many schools had already shifted to blended learning modules before the pandemic, most teachers preferred the traditional paradigm of education.Now, suddenly, they have to act like performers before a camera with dozens of parents and relatives crowding the space where their students are supposed to attend online classes from home! Teachers have had to not only prepare their teaching material but also to learn the ropes of online sessions. They have tried to “zoom” in on each and every child with little or no success. Children are often found sleeping or playing games at the other end of the online connection, and it is not their fault either. The medium of online learning is onerous beyond a point, even for the millennial generation. They yearn to get back to their campuses just as their educators do!The Government has clearly specified that more than three hours of daily online learning is not wholesome for a primary school child. I dare say that the same is true for the teacher. I find that my own eyes and brain need a rest after a long webinar. However, most schools are insistent on longer hours per day, in order to finish off the much-dreaded syllabus.Asynchronous modes have been prescribed for tiny tots, instead of live classes, but many institutions have been carrying out synchronous teaching methods for them too. Little minds are thus bearing the burden of increased screen time.The shocking aspect of all this is that it is the parents who have been demanding more online hours for their wards, and yet have been loath to pay the fees to schools. Parental WhatsApp groups have been discussing the need to resist payment of fees despite court orders.Many parents have of course suffered as a result of the collapse of the economy but one would think that their children’s fees would take priority, unless they are in penury.The teachers meanwhile have carried on with amazing skills of multi-tasking, they have really slogged to balance their motherly or fatherly and housekeeping duties along with their teaching burdens. Several of them have become so adept at online teaching that they have amazed themselves with their new found expertise.In a series of webinars for boosting the morale of teachers, titled Ideas That Matter, which I have been carrying out with Shoolini University, I have discovered a new respect for the teaching community. Having become half a teacher myself these days, I often wonder why our nation does not give them the status and affection that they deserve.Their impact upon our precious growing children is obviously infinite. As Henry Brooks Adams said, “Teachers affect eternity…”.It is clearly time to sing the praises of the unsung heroes, our teachers.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-teachers-are-the-unsung-heroes-of-the-crisis/story-d1TRj4r0FqNCTJRGXXwmWP.html
30-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Day after man drowns in rainwater, civic body plans corrective measures||A day after a 19-year-old man died after drowning in the flooded Gaushala underpass following heavy rain, Ghaziabad’s municipal corporation has decided to form 10 teams to be deployed in five zones across the municipal area to check for water logging and take corrective measures.On Friday, the victim, Arjun alias Haddi, who goes by a single name, had drowned in the waterlogged underpass. The body could be taken out after a team of local divers was roped in. Following the incident, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey had directed an inquiry into the incident and also asked corporation officials to take corrective measures.“We have decided to form 10 teams; two will be deployed in each of the five zones across the city. The teams will be from different departments such as water works, civil and health and all teams will work in coordination; in case there is waterlogging in any area, the teams will immediately deploy pumps to flush out water,” said Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner.According to officials, the city at present has about 32 different areas marked as waterlogging-prone areas.“We already have pumps installed in these areas to flush out water. But the rain in the past couple of days has been heavy and water drainage took more time. The 10 teams will further check for waterlogging in other areas too and have been tasked to take immediate corrective measures,” Kumar added.“As regards the underpass incident, we have plans to widen the present drainage system, which could not timely flush out the water after the heavy rain. So the other option is to increase the drainage capacity so that water flushes out quickly. We will put up a proposal before senior officials,” he added. The district magistrate, meanwhile, said that the inquiry is one in the case of the 19-year-old’s death. “I have already asked the corporation officials to conduct videography of all waterlogging-prone areas and also to ascertain the quantity of rain in the city. This will help reduce the issue of water logging after taking corrective measures. The cleaning of drains is to be checked regularly so that water flushes out in time and is not obstructed by garbage etc,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-day-after-man-drowns-in-rainwater-civic-body-plans-corrective-measures/story-gu1SSpLRGS9t38GKGGxi3O.html
30-08-2020||City||UP govt allows up to 50% reservation of beds in private Covid hospitals in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government, in a directive issued on Saturday, mandated that the district administration can now reserve up to 50% of Covid-19 beds in private hospitals in the city, for patients requiring L2 or L3 category treatment. State officials said the decision was taken as several government hospitals across the district are facing a shortage of beds while the beds in private facilities are lying vacant. The L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals in UP have come up as part of state government’s three-tier structure for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The L1 hospitals are meant for asymptomatic patients, while the L2 hospitals treat patients having moderate symptoms. The L3 category hospitals, on the other hand, treat patients who have severe symptoms. The order also states that the rates for different category of beds reserved in private hospitals will be charged as per the rates prevalent under Ayushman Bharat Yojna. In Ghaziabad, there are 598 beds, across 10 private hospitals that offer paid Covid-19 treatment on the basis of rates fixed by the state government on July 10. The government had capped the prices for Covid-19 beds between ₹8,000 to ₹15,000 per day. While the cost of a general-ward bed is ₹1,800 per day, that for a high dependency unit is ₹2,700 per day. The cost of beds without ventilators has been fixed at ₹3,600 per day while those with ventilators are fixed at ₹4,500 per day. Till August 28, a total of 2,403 patients were admitted in paid private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh.“The state government order means that the district will now have more L2 and L3 category beds available for patients. The rates will be charged as per the prescribed rates under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna and will be paid to the hospitals by the government. The patients who get referred to these reserved beds from government facilities will not be charged,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. At present, the district has 376 L2 category beds and another 200 L3 category beds available in government or government-acquired facilities. Apart from these, there are 598 beds available in 10 private hospitals in Ghaziabad, of which 274 are occupied by paying Covid patients. “Till now, we have reserved only 19 ICU beds, out of 98 available in the 10 private hospitals. The new order by the government has made it clear that we can reserve up to 50% of the total beds. This will help our patients who are in government facilities. The patients referred from our hospitals will take treatment free of cost and the government rates will be paid from government funds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Since a majority of asymptomatic patients are now in home isolation, our L1 hospitals have almost shutdown with only one being operational at present. The 50% reservation of beds in private hospitals would mean that we have about 300 more L2 or L3 beds available for our patients,” Dr Gupta, added. In Ghaziabad, a total of 1,103 patients have been allowed home isolation option till August 28, since the option was made available on July 21. So far, 756 have completed their home isolation and have been marked as discharged. There are 347 asymptomatic patients, who are presently being treated in home isolation. Overall, in Uttar Pradesh, a total of 26,865 asymptomatic patients are in home isolation as per the figures shared by the state health department till August 28. Overall, 93,978 availed the home isolation facility and 67,113 have been discharged so far.The district magistrate confirmed that the government order was issued and they will hold meeting with private hospitals in a day or two. HT also tried to reach private hospitals in Ghaziabad but they said that they have not received any such order so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-allows-up-to-50-reservation-of-beds-in-private-covid-hospitals-in-ghaziabad/story-xjLykxh81O0mUzxfAPFvgJ.html
30-08-2020||Noida||Noida: GIMS starts to take HIV positive patients; Child hospital likely to be a non-Covid hospital||The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida is ready to admit HIV positive patients, officials at the hospital said Saturday. Earlier such patients were referred to bigger medical centres in Delhi.According to Dr Brig (retd) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS, the institute has been functioning as a Covid hospital since the outbreak of the disease. “The Uttar Pradesh government has now sanctioned us to develop an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) centre for HIV patients at the institute. This is the only government hospital in the district to treat HIV positive patients. We will have a dedicated facility for testing, counselling and medication free of cost,” he said.He added that medicines and tests of HIV patients are costly and earlier, this facility was not available at GIMS. He said HIV patients found Covid positive will also be treated at the hospital. There are 120 coronavirus (Covid-19) positive patients undergoing treatment at GIMS while 1,270 Covid patients have been successfully treated and discharged from the hospital.On Saturday, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 121 new Covid cases while 87 persons were discharged after treatment. The district has so far successfully treated 6,682 Covid-19 patients while 1,002 patients are undergoing treatment. The pandemic has so far claimed 45 lives in the district. There was no covid-related death on Saturday in the Noida district.Maj (retd) B P Singh, spokesperson of Noida’s Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), said there are only four Covid patients – three children and one adult - undergoing treatment at the hospital. “In May-June, there were around 50 Covid patients admitted to the hospital. That seemed to be a peak. So far, we have successfully treated 445 Covid patients, including 105 children. A three-day-old infant also tested Covid-19 positive and was discharged after treatment. There has been no covid-related death at the hospital,” he said. A source in the hospital said that if the number of patients continues to remain low at the SSPHPGTI, this hospital could be declared a non-covid hospital. The SSPHPGTI had also written a letter to the Uttar Pradesh government last month over the issue so that it may resume catering to child-related problems. The issue will be discussed in the hospital’s governing body meeting on September 4. Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said the pandemic seems to be under control in the district. On SSPHPGTI’s concerns, Ohri said that the hospital comes under the Directorate of Medical Education and Training, UP government. “This is in our discussion but only the directorate will decide on this,” Ohri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-gims-starts-to-take-hiv-positive-patients-child-hospital-likely-to-be-a-non-covid-hospital/story-tV6ehmS6gwMzwrFNJkZWcL.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Much ado about modaks, masks & muted Onam sadhyas||Come Corona’s September. As Corona presides over its first September, poor dear Rock Hudson might well be doing a cemetery-confined workout, twisting in his grave contemplating twists ‘n’ turns to his classic were it to be remade in the time of Corona, locked out in his Italian villa.Well, let the Hudsons rock it in the grave, come September and our Lamba jis & Lally Singh jis are more in the mood to rock it, Unlock, stock and barrel. The thing about Come September is that it can seem very much like that Maharaja Mac burger out of which one hopes to see popping oodles of extra cheese topping.The thing about August in the time of Corona is – dishing out damp festival season ‘starters’, as it is, like Janmashtami, Onam etc – that it pretty much looks like a mithai box cloaked with a cling film.Alas, rather than a designer Haldiram hamper, Corona’s festival-dotted August looks like a boring nukkad-wale ka mithai dabba, bereft of smashing saccharine showstoppers.Of Modaks in the time of masksPicture this. Looks like the Lollitas, Lamba jis & Co may be legging it to Unlock’s August jollifications, Ganeshotsav or Onam, in neighbouring apartments. But are they? Many an RWA (Residents’ Welfare Association) is erupting into Ganeshotsav gusto or Onam feasting, throwing social distancing protocols to the wind, so much so that the same ‘Tin Pot’ RWA chief who ticked you off for that “one” time he caught you mask-less in the Lift, is the one leading the lung exercises riding “Ganpati Bappa Morya” ululations, albeit minus his mask.Ah, but looks like the only place Lollitas & Co are legging it up and down is their apartment building’s common corridors, exercising not so much their ample anatomies as their grey cells: To go or not to go – to partake of the neighbourhood pujas or sadhyas. That is the million-modak question.“Are you crazy, how can you think of flouting social distancing norms?” the hyperventilating elderly Biji or Bauji’s voice of caution caterwauls.“Oh it’s cool, as long as you wear your mask,” the in-house pragmatic teenager twattles.“Hmmm ... honey, if you’re risking going, you might jolly well smuggle out some Modaks for me too!”That jolly last voice, belonging to a Lamba ji, Lally ji & Co, is the one that clinches the jollification joining-in dilemma for Lollita.Actually, it’s not the voice that does it. It’s the “unmasked” delight dripping from the vocal cords of Lamba ji or Lally ji at the mere prospect of Modaks that decides it for Lollita. Lollita’s one frosty look at the bulbousness mapping the middle regions of Lamba ji or Lally ji’s anatomies tilts the scales in favour of not going. Who’d wish the other scales tilting towards triple digits were Lamba ji & Co to park their Lockdown-cultivated calories on it!The curious case of much ado about ‘unmasked’ glee for Modaks.Of Unlock, stock and barrelWhilst Lollita & Co debate whether or not to leg it to neighbouring pujas and sadhyas, Lamba jis & Lally jis are busy legging it to, nah, not to parks (post-Lockdown, parks are passe), but to Unlock’s hottest Selfie-ism destinations – India Gate and Raisina Hill to Sukhna Lake to Sunset Point.If you thought the reason Lollita & Co didn’t leg it with the male for the masked selfie at Sukhna or India Gate is because Lamba ji or Lally Ji is suffering ‘n’ squiggling from a hangover of her glacial glare at the Modak smuggling schemes, perish the thought.The reason they’re going solo is because they’re hoping to stock up for real hangovers. For, post the masked Status Update-ism from Sukhna or India Gate, Lamba ji & Co are looking to do the other kind of gate – gate-crashing a “thekaa” for September stocks. The curious case of Corona’s ‘Come September’ locked up not with a Gina (Lollobrigida) but with Gin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-much-ado-about-modaks-masks-muted-onam-sadhyas/story-LKuLJgX9kIEkp0BqDo6v5H.html
30-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Fewer people found Covid-positive in RT-PCR retests in August||Fewer people, who have Covid-like symptoms, as well as co-morbidities, tested positive for the coronavirus disease, in RT-PCR testing in Ghaziabad this month, compared to June and July when cases had surged.Both government and independent experts say this could be because more people were affected by other seasonal viral diseases and were showing symptoms similar to the ones seen in Covid-19 patients, and hence were coming forward to be tested. These were first tested for antigens via rapid kits and, if negative, re-tested under the “gold standard” reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.Till August 28, 189,968 samples were tested. Of the total tests, 82,253 were tested through RT-PCR, while 107,715 were through the faster but less accurate rapid antigen tests.According to state government guidelines, which expands on Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) norms, all symptomatic, and those people with co-morbidities regardless of showing symptoms or not should be tested under RT-PCR after a negative antigen test.According to official records, the subsequent RT-PCR tests on 17,314 antigen negative cases gave 972 positives, which translates to a 5.61% test positivity rate (TPR, which is total number of positive cases per 100 tests). In comparison, about 17,477 subsequent RT-PCR tests were conducted from July 27 to Aug 26 and only 538 of these returned positive, which is a TPR of 3.07%. However, there is a lag: there are 5,431 samples collected in August that is yet to be re-tested. “The low positivity in subsequent RT-PCR test could also be a result of people with higher viral load getting tested positive in the rapid antigen kits. So, the number of positive result in subsequent tests will be low. Anyhow, the figure has shown a decline in about past one month,” said Dr. N K Gupta, CMO, Ghaziabad. “It could also mean that we have more patients now who may be suffering from regular viral infections or other similar ailments.” Overall, the TPR in the district is about 4.24% till August 28. This was 4.8% till July 31 and stood at a higher figure of about 7.54% till June 30.The official records stated that antigen testing, introduced from June 26, have a TPR of 2.68%, while RT-PCR is 6.22%. The CMO said that they were conducting about 800-900 RT-PCR tests which are taken up for high risk contacts like close contacts of positive patients, people having symptoms and those having co-morbid conditions. The medical experts said that decline in positivity of subsequent RT-PCR test shows an encouraging sign. “Decline in test positivity of subsequent RT-PCR test could also mean that overall severity of Covid-19 infection is less and it could also mean that people who are coming for testing may be affected by complications other than Covid-19. This could be issues like fever or viral etc which are prevalent more in monsoon season. Overall, if the figures indicate, it is encouraging sign,” said Dr. VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. In a recent review meeting, UP government appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, an IAS, had directed the Ghaziabad officials to conduct more of RT-PCR tests. The present average of daily tests is about 3000-3500 across the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-fewer-people-found-covid-positive-in-rt-pcr-retests-in-august/story-Z5EwpVz1tpr3jAmMBkwNZO.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The ghost of sunsets past||A many-splendoured blessing of the monsoons is that spoors of wild animals are clearly imprinted on jungle trails and peripheral ‘grey zones’ used by both man and foraging beast. On a ramble along the Shivalik foothills, I stumbled upon a remarkably fresh leopard pugmark trail outside a village. It had rained the night before and the pugmarks of the nocturnal hunter could easily be followed hours later like lingering plumes of airliner emissions across the blue dome. The leopard trail took the course of a cart/tractor track for a kilometre before diverting to dense thickets 50 yards off this well-used passageway hemmed in by crop and wild bush. The leopard was resting in secrecy in the thickets for the day after having been lured here by an abundance of wandering village dogs. A farmer was tilling his fields a 100 yards from the thickets while the posh European-style country house of a Chandigarh family was 250 yards away from the big cat’s bunker. What adds to its stealth and ability to operate under the human radar is the fact that a leopard hardly ever roars, snarls or growls when prowling the grey zones as the shadows of the moon lengthen or when resting and hiding during the day.There was no alert or panic about the leopard in the area simply because no one knew it was there, right under the villagers’ noses. It had harmed no human, neither had it turned a notorious livestock predator. Fact is that instead of playing out its presumptive role as a rapacious, blood-guzzling maneater and child lifter, the big cat had taken due care to avoid humans like the plague or Covid-19. Frenzied reportage and media paranoia on Covid seemed to have been picked up by the wily leopard’s sharp ears and led to the cat enhancing its self-effacing norm of social distancing!I sought a perspective on this invisible hunter’s astute ways from wildlife biologist and India’s leading expert on leopard-human conflict, Vidya Athreya. “Numerous leopards live amid the suburban settlements of Mumbai without detection. The leopard is a ghost, neither here nor there. Its presence in human proximity can go undetected for years till a chance happening takes place, such as a leopard killing a locality dog is caught on CCTV cameras or it is spotted in car headlights by late night travellers. There is nothing to get alarmed about. Livestock should be protected during the night and kept under vigilance when out for day grazing,” Athreya told this writer. COURTIERS IN THE KINGDOM OF FLOWERS Hoverflies are unsung and unrecognised but important pollinators of our gardens and crops. They are most often mistaken for honey bees, even by experienced Nature photographers. In the current season, the confusion between the two evokes the similarity between Flying ants and termites on wings (deemak).The easiest way to distinguish Hoverflies is that they have only one pair of wings while bees and wasps have two. The large eyes and short antenna of Hoverflies also render them distinct from bees as also the fact that they don’t sting. Hoverflies are elbowed out of the petals by larger bees.Ignorance is bliss and lends itself to poetic fancy. Pictures of hoverflies settling on flowers are incorrectly lent elaborate bee captions that elevate the humble flies to honey trails, birds and the bees, dangerous stings and other Shakespearean-like profound poetic references. But Hoverflies neither make honey nor hang about on hives. They roost on leaves. Hoverflies do not linger on a flower for a long time but are on the move constantly, hovering with sharp zigzag movements and have the ability to move abruptly and at the oddest angles. The Hoverfly has near-transparent wings and a lower body which is beautifully banded in black and amber. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-the-ghost-of-sunsets-past/story-dZ5D9NGC6N6HrHATuWdm8K.html

The officers have also seized 59 grams of drugs from them. The accused Abbas Ramzan Ali Lakhani and Karan Arora are booked under relevant sections of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.NCB officers said that both accused are in their early twenties. Lakhani, a resident of Bandra, allegedly became part of this nexus because of his habitual consumption. To buy the contraband, he entered the supply chain. Whereas Arora is a peddler and resides in Powai.Both the accused were released on bail immediately after being produced in court, said their lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-arrested-by-ncb-for-drug-trafficking-in-mumbai/story-FdMCmw2cNKhpdjhNHjrSyI.html
30-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Why tricity needs a coordinated lockdown||It’s getting to be very confusing. The Chandigarh administration on Friday discontinued the weekend lockdown after imposing it on August 21 following a spurt in Covid-19 cases.Though it ordered shops and malls to remain open, the administration decided to continue with the odd-even system that is operational in the city’s 11 congested markets.The weekend closure had come after Haryana and Punjab took similar decisions, but with the former allowing shops to open on Saturday and Sunday, UT authorities decided to follow suit.Unlike Haryana, however, UT will not be closing shops and malls on Monday and Tuesday instead.But in Punjab shops will still remain closed on weekends.Now what are tricity residents to do? Do they go to Sukhna on Monday, avoid shopping in Panchkula on that day and go mall hopping in Mohali on Tuesday?Won’t some sort of uniformity in rules help as there is extensive cross border movement between Chandigarh, Panchkula and Haryana? One city closed and the other partially open is bound to inconvenience residents.Also, keeping malls and some shops open on Sundays will lead to concentration of crowds in some spots, something that can be a disaster in a pandemic situation.The UT’s August 21 decision once again appears to have been a knee jerk reaction as it was roundly criticised by traders, who said they would suffer losses and be hit by the odd-even system as well.The interests of traders, vendors, restaurateurs, gym owners and others who have incurred substantial losses in the lockdown period too have to be factored in to get the economy going again.It’s time for tricity authorities to come together to thrash out a solution to control the spread of Covid-19, at the same time ensuring that uniform rules are imposed in all areas with minimum losses to businesses.Unprecedented times require innovative solutions. Let’s see what the administrations of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula come up with.CLOSE CALLShould tricity have uniform lockdown rules?Why will a coordinated lockdown help in the tricity? How can opening of malls and markets be planned better?

30-08-2020||Mumbai||Convicted public servant can’t be reinstated on suspension of sentence: Bombay high court||A public servant convicted in a criminal case cannot seek reinstatement in service only on the ground of suspension of his sentence by a higher court, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Thursday and dismissed a petition filed by a public servant from Chandrapur seeking the reinstatement in service. It is not possible for us to hold that the petitioner has acquired a right to be reinstated in service upon suspension of his sentence imposed in view of the provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, said the bench, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AS Chandurkar. The bench rejected petition filed by Shrikrushna Sinhe, who has been convicted by a special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court at Chandrapur for bribery and sentenced to three years imprisonment, and was dismissed from service on November 14, 2018. A few months before his dismissal, Sinhe’s appeal against conviction was admitted by a single-judge bench of HC, which on February 16, 2018, suspended his sentence and granted him bail. He had, thereafter, moved Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT), seeking an order for his reinstatement in service on the ground of suspension of the sentence imposed on him, and petitioned HC after the tribunal put his plea on hold, till the final decision on his appeal. But the HC refused to grant him any relief, observing that the suspension of the sentence had not erased the conviction recorded by the criminal court. “So long as the conviction is not reversed, the petitioner continues to be a convict and cannot have any legitimate claim for reinstatement in service,” said the bench led by the chief justice. “Such claim would arise after reversal of the conviction and that too if the rules so provide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/convicted-public-servant-can-t-be-reinstated-on-suspension-of-sentence-bombay-high-court/story-rKyvertGOnmoFfl6On6O8L.html
30-08-2020||Mumbai||First-year junior college admissions: Maharashtra education department to release 1st merit list today at 3pm||The state education department will declare the first merit list for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) at 3pm on Sunday. With more than 19,000 students who have applied for admissions scoring 90% and above this year, principals said that the cut-offs are likely to go up. The state and the Mumbai division also recorded the highest pass percentage since 2004. “We are expecting the cut-offs to go up substantially across streams this year as there are so many high scorers,” said Rajpal Hande, principal of Mithibai College. Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate, said that while cut-offs are expected to be higher, the fact that they are unlikely to decline in subsequent lists, indicates more competition. “Over the past few years, we have seen a trend that even if the merit list goes up only by 1-2% percentage points, it does not fall in the rounds that follow. This means that there are a lot of students with the same high score which leads to seats in prominent colleges getting filled in the first one or two rounds itself,” he added. Last year, despite the state board witnessing one of its worst pass percentages in the past several years, almost all prominent Commerce colleges in the city such as Vile Parle’s NM College, Matunga’s Podar College and Churchgate’s HR College closed their first merit lists above 90%. The cut-offs for Arts were also quite high. While St Xavier’s college at Dhobi Talao closed its first list at 94%, the cut-off at Matunga’s Ramnarain Ruia College was 92.6%. Owing to the Covid-19 situation, the education department is following the ‘zero contact’ process to conduct the admissions. Students will get messages on their registered mobile numbers with details of the college allotted to them. They can confirm their admissions online and can complete the entire admission process through the portal without having to go anywhere. Students who are allotted the college of their first preference have to take admission there. If they fail to do so, they have to wait for all the regular rounds to get over to be able to get another college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-year-junior-college-admissions-maharashtra-education-department-to-release-1st-merit-list-today-at-3pm/story-NZr4YxhCVeTfEP0IGmY19L.html
30-08-2020||Mumbai||Five students arrested for cheating shopkeepers in Mumbai||The Oshiwara police have arrested a group of five students for cheating pan shop owners from Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri. The accused, according to police, purchased cigarettes from pan shops and sent fake cash credit messages to the shop owners with the help of a bulk messaging site.The gang had purchased cigarettes worth ₹77,800 and the shopkeeper received messages from his bank showing a credit in his account. He later realised he was being duped and he filed a complaint.The arrested accused are identified as Jimit Panchal, 20, Apurv Goyal, 22, Bhavik Padiyar, 22, Sagar Gala, 24 and Nisarg Maskariya, 19.According to the police, on August 26, a pan- shop owner from Lokhandwala Market approached them and filed a complaint against an unknown person.He said on July 10 and 11, a young boy purchased cigarettes worth ₹77,800. He paid online and every time the shop owner received a message saying the amount was credited. But in August, when he visited his bank, he found those three transactions missing. He then realised that he was cheated.He then filed a police complaint and a first information report (FIR) registered under section 420(cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged [document or electronic record) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.Police later arrested Gala from Malad. Gala revealed names of his accomplices, and the rest four were arrested by police from the same location.“They all are college-going students and one of them is a third-year law student,” said a police officer.Gala told police he and his friends observed that most of the pan shopkeepers have started accepting money through E-wallets and don’t check their account balance they just rely on the message which they get from the bank. Once they receive a message, they think that the amount is credited their account. Investigation revealed that these accused were using two messaging platforms to send fake bank messages to their victims and police have written to those sites to know how many messages have been sent so far from these accused to other shopkeepers as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-students-arrested-for-cheating-shopkeepers-in-mumbai/story-bez6zOZ8zSCI9cqGjU0GPN.html

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Ratnagiri and Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Mumbai gave the official nod for the same to the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC) after years of delay.Both the agencies gave their no objection certificates (NOC) for the restoration and beautification of the 9-acre fort under the Shiv Srushti project of MLA Pratap Sarnaik who had taken up the matter of the delay with the agencies. Ghodbunder Fort located in Ghodbunder village in Bhayandar also houses a church. It is currently in ruins and was adopted by MBMC under the government’s Maharashtra Vaibhav Protected Monuments Adoption Scheme to restore historical monuments. “The department of cultural affairs had granted heritage structure status to eight monuments in the state including Ghodbunder Fort thus paving the way for their adoptions by the respective local civic bodies,” said Sarnaik. MBMC has planned conservation, restoration and beautification of the fort and its surroundings, said Sarnaik. The fort was built in 1730 by the Portuguese who had settled in Bhayandar in 1530. It was under Portuguese rule till 1737 till Marathas captured the fort and overthrew the Portuguese rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18th-century-ghodbunder-fort-in-mumbai-set-to-get-facelift/story-oQQ0cNUmKvdIXfLK6QuZBN.html
30-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 curve flattening in Mumbai’s Dharavi, rising in neighbouring Dadar and Mahim||While the Covid-19 curve has started to flatten in Dharavi, India’s largest slum cluster, the number of Covid-19 cases have doubled in neighbouring Mahim and Dadar areas in the past 40 to 60 days. Out of the total 4,680 positive cases in Dadar and Mahim, more than 70% have been reported after relaxations in lockdown, starting June 3. Owing to this, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) says it is tracing and testing “maximum people behind every case from Dadar and Mahim area, on the lines of Dharavi.” For the past few days, Covid-19 cases in Dharavi are being reported in single digits daily, with a few exceptions. The BMC has maintained that while the cases are coming down, four most densely populated pockets inside Dharavi – the Matunga Labour Camp, Kumbharwada, Kala Killa, and Koliwada continue to be on the corporation’s watch-list. The BMC, starting September 1, is also going to scale down Covid-19 containment facilities in Dharavi owing to the flattening of the curve. However, its neighbouring areas like Dadar and Mahim, now, remain a concern for the BMC. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G North Ward, said, “There are many factors behind cases increasing in Dadar and Mahim, and we are following the Dharavi model of testing and tracing maximum residents from Dadar and Mahim. We have also set up free testing camps, due to which we are detecting maximum cases. We have to understand that Dadar traditionally has been a commercial hub too, and post June 3, we have witnessed an increase in reporting of cases.” Dighavkar added, “After relaxations were given in lockdown measures, more and more cases are being reported. Maximum cases that we are detecting are of those who are asymptomatic and most are from high-rises. We have to wait and watch for now and continue testing and tracing the maximum number of people for the cases to come under control. At the same time, citizens have to be responsible.” Dadar also came into focus last week when a large number of residents had gathered in the local market ahead of Ganeshotsav by flouting all social distancing norms. In terms of numbers, on June 3, 2020, the first day of relaxations given by the state government under Mission Begin Again, Dharavi had 1,889 cases that have increased to 2,753, on Saturday after recording eight new cases. Of these 2,400 patients have been discharged after recovery. In the case of Dadar, the cases went up from 374 to 2,489 in the same period and in Mahim, Covid cases have reached 2,192 from 606 on June 3. The number of cases have doubled in Dadar in the last around 45 days from 1,130 on July 11 to 2,489 now. Similarly, in Mahim, cases have reached 2,192 from 1,092 on June 28. The G North Ward, under which Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim fall, has a total of 7,426 cases as of Friday, of which, 6,208 cases have recovered and 787 cases are active. Maximum active cases are from Dadar (400) and Mahim (294) while Dharavi (93) has the lowest number of active cases. Shiv Sena corporator from Dadar, Vishakha Raut said, “We controlled cases in slums and chawls by having stricter containment measures, but the same is not the case in Dadar. We have an educated and literate population here and it is expected that they will act more responsibly. However, it is a fact that after relaxations in the lockdown norms, the cases have increased due to an increase in mingling of residents socially, but the administration is also trying to trace maximum cases.” Raut claimed that mandatory testing for travel led to detection of several cases among those who wanted to go to their homes in Konkan during Ganeshotsav. He also put the onus on citizens for responsible behavior. “In the end, citizens have to be more responsible when they are out. I see people not following social distancing norms, not wearing masks even in areas like Shivaji Park. This all needs to stop, and we will need to act with more responsibility,” Raut added. Mortality rate for the GN Ward has gone down in the last 50 days. According to BMC’s data, there were 379 deaths in the ward on July 04, a mortality rate of 10.61%, which has gone down to 7.33% with 492 deaths, as of Friday. The GN Ward also has around 13 containment zones and 355 sealed buildings. Meanwhile on Saturday, Mumbai recorded 1,432 cases and 31 deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 143,389 and toll to 7,596. The fatality rate is 5.29%, while the recovery rate stands at 80.55%, with 115,500 patients in the city having been discharged after recovery. The number of active cases stands at 19,971. Mumbai’s total test figures have reached 7.53 lakh with an overall positivity rate of 18.84%, after 9,984 Covid-19 tests were conducted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-curve-flattening-in-mumbai-s-dharavi-rising-in-neighbouring-dadar-and-mahim/story-PYIRTexhsa92qBo0nRFeJP.html
30-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court refuses bail to man booked for stalking, assault||The Bombay high court (HC) has rejected the bail application of a man booked for stalking and assaulting a woman with knife after she rejected his marriage proposal.Justice Sarang Kotwal rejected the bail plea of Amol Kashid primarily on the grounds that there was a threat to the life of the woman if the accused was released on bail.The judge said in view of the fact that Kashid constantly harassed the complainant, entered her house and attacked her with a knife in front of her mother and grandmother after she rejected his marriage proposal, it was obvious there was threat to the woman if he was let out on bail. “Therefore, it is not desirable to release the applicant (Kashid) on bail,” he added and rejected his bail plea.The assault took place on April 9, 2019 and Kashid was arrested the next day.He had moved the court for bail on the grounds that as the investigation in the case is complete and charge sheet has been filed, his custody was no longer required. It was argued on his behalf that the man was behind bars for around one-and-a-half year since his arrest. The court was also assured that since Kashid was not a resident of Pune district and he will not again enter the district, there was no threat to the complainant or her family.Justice Kotwal, however, refused to accept the contention and noted that Kashid stalked and harassed the complainant for a long time and even returned to Shirur, after having left for Beed, to assault the woman who sustained six stab wounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-refuses-bail-to-man-booked-for-stalking-assault/story-a79Kkwao6wfQRtaEkhfAVM.html

According to police, the victim, a resident of Uttan in Bhayander, received a call from an unknown woman in July, proposing that the two become friends. Soon the duo started participating in video chats.In the first week of August, the woman told the victim that she was in love with him. She asked him to get naked and start a video chat with her. “The woman then informed the victim that she had recorded their chat and threatened to upload the clips on the internet if he did not pay her. The victim also received a call from a man claiming to be a CBI officer on special duty. The fake officer threatened the victim and said he would face criminal charges for sharing nude photos on social media,” said assistant inspector Satish Nikam of Uttan police station. The victim sent the woman ₹36,671 through multiple transactions to a digital wallet account.He then approached the police, and a case under sections 384 (extortion), 419 (cheating by personation) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against the two unknown callers. “We suspect a gang is operating in Thane Rural police district using the same modus operandi,” said Nikam. Due to the lockdown, fraudsters have adopted this method of extorting money from people as the victims have plenty of free time at their disposal, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttan-man-blackmailed-with-nude-video-extorted-of-37-000/story-BFWlmd8hJX2fpX32L5YQvK.html

30-08-2020||Pune||45% of Pune division’s plasma donors from PCMC||At least 45 per cent of Pune division’s plasma donors, which includes Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and Satara districts, are from Pimpri-Chichwad. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has alone contributed 266 donors of the 593 total donors at 11 blood banks in the division, as of August 28. PCMC has only two hospitals registered for plasma donations, but still has been leading the way in encouraging more donors. The initial response of donors in the industrial township, according to officials, was overwhelming, so much so that the administration fell short of plasma collection kits. While PCMC has 33,893 discharged patients after they were declared as cured, Pune city has more than double, 73,527 discharged people, but has seen less than half the number of plasma donors. Pune city has about eight blood banks which have received 286 donors.Dr Rajendra Wable, Yashwantrao Chavan Medical Hospital, dean, said, “There is no particular reason as to why donors are coming forward in PCMC, but social media groups have played a major role in spreading awareness. Through social media, people are coming in touch with donors and recipients. Sometimes relatives of the patients come to us along with donors. We are also starting the process of self declaration and willingness form from the recovered patients to respond positively in case they are called for the same. We even provide the plasma to private hospitals at a nominal cost.” Project platina by the state government encourages Covid-19 recovered patients to donate plasma for the treatment of active critical patients, but it hasn’t seen a good response in Pune city. Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham has appealed to the people to come forward and donate plasma. At a felicitation programme to honor plasma donors on Saturday, Venkatesham, said, “To reduce the number of deaths due to Covid-19, people can register at 9960530329 on Whatsapp. One plasma donor can save two lives and so people should come forward and do this noble deed.” The district administration has also started a website, https://puneplasma.in wherein donors can register and donate and people in need of plasma can come forward for the same. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh, said, “It is not clear as to why people are not coming forward as there are no complaints of dizziness or weakness among those who donate blood for plasma. We appeal to people to come forward and donate their blood.”Dr Avinash Bhondwe, President of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, said, “There is no awareness among the people and the administration should work on that. Local politicians must also encourage people in their area to come forward and donate in huge numbers. We do not see a good response among people even for a routine blood donation and in case of plasma from those who have recovered, fear is a contributing factor.

The girl has been admitted in hospital, the police commissioner said.The police said the girl, who is a trained shooter and prolific user of weapons, used a .22 bore rifle in the crime. Director general of police (DGP) Hitesh Chandra Awasthi visited the spot.Pandey said the girl fired three bullets—one hit a mirror and two others killed her mother and brother. He stated that the girl wrote the words ‘disqualified human’ on the washroom mirror.This act reflected the girl’s mental instability and that she required immediate medical assistance to recover, he added.He also said the girl was questioned before her maternal grandparents and she confessed to committing the crime. The rifle used in the crime had been recovered on the basis of her disclosure, Pandey said.The victims’ bullet riddled bodies were found lying on a bed inside their room, he added. The girl herself alerted her maternal relatives and domestic workers about the incident.The police commissioner said the girl’s father, who is presently posted in New Delhi, was a senior Indian Railway Traffic Services official in Northern Railway and he had held a senior position in Lucknow in the past. He was currently an executive director in the railway ministry and mostly stayed in Delhi while his family resided in Lucknow, Pandey added.Even on Saturday, he was in Delhi and reached Lucknow late in the evening after being informed about the incident.Pandey said the police were first informed at around 3.45 pm. The victims’ relatives were present in the house when the police reached there, he said.

30-08-2020||Pune||Reopening of places of worship: BJP stages protests against Maharashtra government||Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Saturday staged an agitation outside temples in Pune and other parts of western Maharashtra, including Shirdi and Kolhapur, demanding reopening of places of worship across the state, which have remained shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Pune, the BJP leaders and party workers held a ghanta-naad (ringing of bells) agitation at Sarasbaug temple. “The government has allowed liquor shops to function. However, temples and religious places are still closed. This is not acceptable,” said Jagdish Mulik, city party president. Mulik was accompanied by mayor Murlidhar Mohol and legislator Madhuri Misal. “The state government should allow people to go to places of worship. If the government does not take any decision now, citizens will break the rule on their own and start visiting temples,” said Mulik, adding that the state government is confused and is unaware of how to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Criticising the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, mayor Mohol said, “The state government must allow reopening of places of worship soon, as almost everything is now limping back to normalcy.”Over the past few weeks, there has been growing a chorus in the state for reopening of places worship. Besides the BJP, AIMIM Member of Parliament from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jaleel and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar have also threatened to launch an agitation. Jaleel has threatened to offer prayers inside a mosque on September 2 if the government does not decide on the reopening by September 1. Sensing pressure, Shiv Sena MP in Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut said that the state government is likely to take a call on the issue in the first week of September. Pune MP Girish Bapat led the agitations by workers in front of Omkareshwar Temple near Balgandharva.Ruling parties criticised BJP’s agitations, saying that the party is busy fanning flames of religious politics, when the city and state is facing bed shortage and the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Parvati constituency president Nitin Kadam, said, “We had appealed to the BJP to allow immersion tanks near water bodies, but the party did not allow citizens to perform Ganesh immersion in the city. Now, the same party is demanding reopening of temples. This shows their dual stand on the same issue.”Aam Aadmi Party’s Pune leader Mukunt Kirdat said, “There are many critical issues which the citizens are already facing like job loss, incomplete medical facility, bed shortage and enormous electricity bills. However, instead of addressing such development issues, the BJP is diverting the attention of citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/reopening-of-places-of-worship-bjp-stages-protests-against-maha-government/story-Q4Ca3ICkXaOxRTfYtAt4UN.html
30-08-2020||Pune||Peth area residents prefer this year’s crowd-free, noiseless Ganeshotsav||No sound systems blaring music or dhol-tashas (drums and cymbals) making their way across the narrow lanes during Ganeshotsav this year has made residents of Peth areas realise that this should be a template for Ganesh mandals on how to celebrate the festival. Residents and shopkeepers in the vicinity of mandaps are satisfied with the ‘new normal’ necessitated due to the Covid-19 pandemic which prevents loud and crowded processions. Sandip Konde, a resident of Sharada Ganesh Complex, Mandai area, said, “This year’s Ganesh festival took me back to the 80s and 90s when this type of peaceful Ganesh festival was celebrated. The environment is so peaceful. Every day all rituals are performed in the Mandai Mandir and nothing has changed apart from the crowd and the noise. However, I hope that the dhol-tasha pathaks (troupes) return next year as without them, the festival feels incomplete.” Every year, some of residents even had to lock themselves inside their homes or leave the city on the last two days of the festival as the celebrations reached its peak with 24-hour long processions. Mihir Shah, who owns a shop on Bajirao road, said, “My shop is located on Bajirao road near Natu Baug Ganesh Mandal which is famous for its light and sound show. Every year, all the shopkeepers had to close their shops at 5pm and leave, as the entire Bajirao road gets crowded. Even though my house is just 500metres away from my sho, it used to take me 20 to 25 minutes to reach my building. This year, the road is empty and I like the ‘new normal’ Ganesh festival celebrations.” This is the 128th year of the Sarvajanik (public) Ganesh festival, which was first started in Pune by Lokmanya Tilak in order to galvanise the society against British regime. Over the years, the festival gathered a celebratory nature with flouting of noise levels being a regular norm. Sanjay Mate, treasurer of Mandai Ganesh Mandal, said, “We are one of the most popular mandals in the city and we are celebrating Ganesh festival with simplicity and look forward to a noiseless immersion. We got a very positive response to the peaceful celebrations.” Giridhar Shinde, president of Digvijay Mitra Mandal, Sadashiv peth, said, “Every year we set up a mandap on the road and this year we have built a small mandap near the Ganesh mandir where all the rituals are being performed. It’s been 60 years and we have never encountered a noiseless Ganesh festival. One thing which we would like to continue in the coming years is to set up the mandap near the Ganpati mandir to avoid traffic and noise pollution.” Aditya Chavan, a resident of Sadashiv peth, said, “The best part about this year’s Ganeshotsav is that there is no traffic and noise in my area, which otherwise has a lot of disturbance.” Khushboo Shah from Sadashiv peth, said, “I am very happy the crowd-free and noiseless celebrations. Although, I miss the dhol-tashas as it represents the vibe of the overall Ganesh festival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/peth-area-residents-prefer-this-year-s-crowd-free-noiseless-ganeshotsav/story-k6UXo6lV0oEm5g7dmPl4oN.html

The detection has prompted the BSF to launch a major operation to check whether there were more such tunnels.In a tweet, the BSF said the approximately 20 feet long and three-four feet wide tunnel was detected inside the Indian territory near the International Border at Samba’s Basantar area. “Pakistan made sandbags with Shakargarh/Karachi written were also found at the mouth of the tunnel to hide it. The place of opening of the tunnel is around 170 Mtrs from IB [international border] towards the Indian side in the field of a local farmer.”The BSF said its troops foiled nefarious design of Pakistan to infiltrate terrorists into Indian territory with this detection. “Efforts of alert BSF troops deployed in our counter-infiltration grid once again resulted in neutralizing the evil designs of terrorists.”A BSF officer said there have been regular inputs about the presence of terrorists on the Pakistani side looking for infiltration options into the Indian territory. A patrol detected the tunnel 50 metres from the border fence on the Indian side on Thursday.“BSF has found some plastic sandbags at its mouth with Pakistani markings. It was being dug nearly 25 to 30 feet beneath the ground. The BSF has launched a massive search operation and anti-tunnelling drive to detect such tunnels,” said the officer on condition of anonymity.The nearest Pakistani border post is about 400 metres from the tunnel.“The modus operandi of digging tunnels to push terrorists is an old tactic of Pakistan. It seems Pakistan has started imitating Hamas fighters, who dig out underground tunnels to enter Israel,” said an officer from the counter-insurgency wing of the Jammu & Kashmir police.In September 2019, the BSF launched an operation along the border to detect underground, cross-border tunnels. The BSF also uses ground-penetrating radars to detect tunnels.Pakistan has chosen areas like Samba for digging such tunnels to push armed terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bsf-detects-trans-border-tunnel-from-pakistan-to-j-k/story-M6okTSPXKTGMsOHqnlOjGP.html
30-08-2020||Delhi||JNUSU requests vice-chancellor to facilitate registration of Sharjeel Imam, Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal for next semester||The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) on Saturday wrote to vice-chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, seeking his “urgent intervention” in facilitating the pending semester registrations of three research scholars arrested for their alleged role in the Delhi riots, ahead of the August 31 deadline.Sharjeel Imam, Natasha Narwal, and Devangana Kalita are accused of instigating people through their inflammatory speeches during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests before the riots. The three have denied the allegations.The Union sought Kumar’s intervention to ensure the “academic progress of these students is not impeded”.“We are getting calls from their family members. They are also stressed,” said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, explaining why the body approached the V-C.In its email to Kumar, the Union said Imam’s registration has been blocked despite repeated appeals by JNUSU. “This is to bring to your immediate attention that the registration of Sharjeel Imam (PhD student/CHS/SSS) has been pending from the last semester. This is despite repeated appeals from the JNUSU to the Proctor office that the registration has been blocked.”“..on behalf of JNUSU, we would request you that the registration process for the last and upcoming semester of Sharjeel Imam and the process of upcoming semester registration for Natasha Narwal (PhD student/CHS/SSS) and Devangana Kalita (PhD Student/CWS [Centre for Women Students]/SSS) who presently are students of JNU should be facilitated,” the students’ body wrote in its letter.Imam, a PhD student at JNU’s Centre for Historical Studies, was first arrested in January followed by Narwal and Kalita in May. Narwal and Kalita are members of student collective Pinjra Tod and research scholars at the university’s School of Social Sciences.Registrar Pramod Kumar said the current registration process is only provisional. “When they [the arrested students] are out of jail, they can get the registration done depending upon the conditions of their release.”Natasha’s father Mahavir Narwal, a retired scientist, said, “Since she is in judicial custody and doesn’t have access to internet or banking facilities, I had requested that I be authorized to register for her instead. That doesn’t solve the problem because I don’t have her login ID and the details are saved in Natasha’s phone which is with the police. I have written to university officials this week to assist me in this but there has not been any response so far.”Surajit Mazumdar, general secretary at JNU teachers’ association, and a professor at the school of social sciences, said, “...Their continuation as students should be ensured and they should be allowed to register for the semester, and if and when they are released from custody, their period of custody can be dealt with in a manner akin to the zero semester/year provision already existing for those with medical problems. Alternatively, they can be granted special approval to discontinue their registration with the right to re-enrol as and when their custody ends.”Aakash Bhattacharya, a former JNU student and close friend of Kalita and Narwal, said, “Unless administration is willing to take different measures, registration looks difficult. If they aren’t registered, it will be a big blow to their academic prospects because they will no longer remain students of the university.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnusu-requests-vic-chancellor-to-facilitate-pending-registration-of/story-V5P7y8RF6OVXjQ0MRsITeP.html
