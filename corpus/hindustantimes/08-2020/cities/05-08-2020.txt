Both the suspects received bullet injuries on their legs and the victim was rescued.Varun Pawar, station house officer, Knowledge Park police station, said a team was conducting checking near the Hindon Pushta road at 1am when they noticed the vehicle. “The auto-rickshaw coming from Safipur, however, zoomed away, ignoring the police’s signal to stop for checking. The police officials heard a woman’s rescue call from the auto. The police team chased the auto and forced the driver to stop after a 200-metre chase,” he said.“The two suspects abandoned the auto and tried to escape after opening fire from a country-made gun. The police also fired shots in which the two suspects were injured, and then apprehended,” he said. The driver was identified as Nadeem, a resident of Bijnor and his allegedly accomplice Imran, a resident of Surajpur. The suspects allegedly told the police that the woman had hired an auto from Surajpur for Pari Chowk. “She wanted to go to her native place in Agra. But the two suspects drove the auto on the wrong route intentionally to commit crimes. They had held the woman hostage, but the police acted on time and rescued the woman,” police said. The two suspects were booked under Section 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and Section 376 (rape) of IPC. “The two suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” he said.

The State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and other special teams too, will leave the city after August 7. The commissionerate has five zones, and apart from its 9,000 police personnel, the department had deputed 750 additional personnel to control the movement of people during the pandemic. Several platoons of SRPF and other special forces were deployed in different parts of the commissionerate, especially in the containment zones. The notice to release them was sent by the police commissioner to the deputy municipal commissioners of all the zones in Thane on August 5. “Containment zones have been reduced and the government has now opened the state borders. Apart from at Covid centres, not much police force is needed on the ground. Moreover, with the festive season soon to begin, the teams also need to prepare for the same,” said a police officer, on condition of anonymity.In the Thane commissionerate, 926 police personnel tested positive, of which 856 were discharged. Deputy commissioner of police, special branch, B Patil said, “We had 9,000 police personnel from our own force, while 750 additional officers were called in. We will now release these personnel while the special forces will be released on August 7. This, however, does not mean that there will be no patrolling in the city.

05-08-2020||Noida||Covid effect: No change in circle rates this year in GB Nagar||The district stamp and registration department in Gautam Budh Nagar has decided not to change circle rates this year as the real estate sector is facing a slump and has been hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown. There were zero registrations in April this year. SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general (registration), Gautam Budh Nagar, said the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the real estate sector. “In April, we did not register any property and hence stamp duty collection was zero in that month. In May, we registered some property and collected Rs 11 crore. In June and July, we have collected Rs 60 crore and Rs 101 crore, respectively,” he said. The department could manage only Rs 171 crore in stamp duty from April to July this year against the annual target of Rs 3,158. Tripathi said that due to Covid-19 and the lockdown, the department was not able to conduct surveys of properties. “We have not received feedback from stakeholders on circle rate revision this year. The district administration plans to keep the circle rate unchanged,” he said. The circle rates, if revised, would have come into effect from August 7/8. In 2019, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration had waived the 6% surcharge levied on additional facilities such as swimming pool, community centre, club and gyms in group housing projects. The administration had also decreased circle rates of Noida’s commercial properties by 21.5%. Circle rates are the minimum rates that form the basis of calculating stamp duty and registration charges. PPS Nagar, advocate and patron Noida Bar Association, said circle rate should correspond to the market rate. “We know the market rate is very low this time and there are no buyers. The rate of commercial property is skyrocketing in certain areas. I feel the circle rate should be revised to match the market rate,” he said. In the registry office, prior appointment is a must for property registration to ensure social distancing. Tripathi said people need to book their appointments at www.igrsup.gov.in before they visit the office. “They will be given a time slot for registration. This is to ensure people follow social distancing and there is no crowd at the registration office,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-effect-no-change-in-circle-rates-this-year-in-gb-nagar/story-CjjLImNPGO5npw5a2yI0rM.html

A case has been registered at the Sector 20 police station. The occupant of the house, Urmil Hooda (67), is the wife of a retired brigadier, who lives in C block of Sector 30. According to her, she had left the house just before the lockdown to stay with her daughter in Gurugram. “I visited the house only once in between to get some clothes but it was locked the rest of the time. Today morning, the domestic helper who cleans outside the house called me and informed me that the door of the house had been broken into,” said Hooda. Following the information, the family came back to see the damage and it was discovered that the entire house had been ransacked and things were strewn around. The complainant said that the cupboards had been broken into and valuables like gold jewellery, silver coins, cash, etc. were missing. The family later informed the police and a case of burglary and trespassing was registered at the Sector 20 police station.Police officers said that the house had been empty for a very long time and there is a chance that someone may have been monitoring the situation for a while.“The family had been away during the lockdown. There aren’t any CCTV cameras in the area which we can use to find information about the burglars. However, a probe in the matter is underway and we are questioning all neighbours and staff in the area for more clues. No one claims to know anything about the break-in at the moment,” said RK Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-house-burgled-while-family-was-away-due-to-lockdown-valuables-worth-2-lakh-stolen/story-YqDc48jAKcEP9Ye4oP3CWI.html
05-08-2020||City||Lukewarm response to plasma donation in Haryana||ROHTAK: Haryana has witnessed a lukewarm response to the call for convalescent plasma donation as only 49 people have come forward. Twenty patients who recently recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have donated plasma at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak, 16 in Faridabad, 11 in Gurugram and two in Panchkula, reveal the data obtained from the four plasma banks.The convalescent plasma therapy has been given to 25 patients in Faridabad, 17 in Rohtak, five in Gurugram and two in Panchkula. Haryana’s first plasma bank was set up at ESIC hospital in Faridabad in the second week of July and since then, three more such banks have come up in Rohtak, Gurugram and Panchkula. Head of the medicine department at PGIMS, Dr VK Katyal, said they have been taking plasma from people aged between 18 and 60 on the basis of their health conditions.“This therapy is a boon for a Covid-19 patient, whose kidney and liver are damaged. We are treating a 39-year-old patient, who is suffering from a liver problem. He has shown significant improvement after two convalescent therapies,” he added.On being asked about tepid response to plasma donation in Haryana, state’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said 33% of the recovered patients have shown unwillingness to donate plasma.“Many recovered patients with kidney, heart, lung or liver diseases are not eligible for the donation. Moreover, women who have ever been pregnant and someone weighing less than 50kg are also barred from the donation,” he added.The nodal officer said nearly 17% of the recovered patients were found to be unfit for the donation as they suffered from various diseases. “About 10% recovered patients have given wrong details on helpline numbers introduced to enrol people for plasma donation. Many people are skipping donations so that they can offer it to their family members in the case they get infected. Few donors fear that they could witness side effects if they donate plasma,” Dr Chaudhary said. “A plasma donor should have normal weight, haemoglobin level above 12 and no history of diabetes or hypertension. Moreover, the donor should not have hepatitis B or C and HIV. The therapy will be administered to those with respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), oxygen saturation less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or pus in their lungs,” the doctor added.‘Want to save it for my father’A 23-year-old recovered patient from Rohtak, who refused to donate plasma, said, “My father is suffering from diabetes and I want to save the plasma for him in case he contracts the infection.”“I am the sole breadwinner of my family and I didn’t donate plasma for the fear of side effects. I took this decision as a precautionary measure for my family,” said a 36-year-old man from Jhajjar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lukewarm-response-to-plasma-donation-in-haryana/story-sG2np12jsor0aQlH8IcUvI.html

This directive came in the light of incidents wherein large numbers of people in rural areas faced problems while submitting documents to the authority as well as interpreting written correspondence with regard to property and other matters.Jitender Yadav, administrator, Gurugram, said that officials in estate office I, estate office II and Rewari have been asked to promote the use of Hindi to facilitate easier exchange of information. “We had received directions from Chandigarh in this regard in which it was mentioned that people often faced trouble in interpreting letters written in English. So we have decided to push the use of Hindi and bring more of it in official usage,” he said, adding that they would gradually keep on increasing the usage of Hindi in official communication.Allottees of HSVP properties, meanwhile, welcomed the decision, saying this move would make it easier to understand technical matters dealt by the authority as these are related to acquisition and allotment of land. “A large number of farmers find it difficult to read directions issued by the authority but once these come in Hindi, it would be easier for them to understand the same,” said Dilip Yadav, an allottee of HSVP, who has been waiting for an alternative from the authority for the last two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hsvp-to-promote-use-of-hindi-to-communicate-with-allottees/story-2jWLp4lXeZUoEq5NK3hEEO.html
05-08-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: PG courses begin at GIMS||To further improve patient care and academics, post-graduate courses in four faculties were started at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida’s Kasna on Wednesday.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida industrial development authority (GNIDA), who inaugurated the new courses, congratulated all newly-joined directorate of national board (DNB) residents. “GIMS has provided excellent care for Covid-19 patients, training all hospital staff in the district. I believe that it was the training, innovations and protocol-based treatment of Covid-19 patients at GIMS that the Gautam Budh Nagar district has the lowest case fatality-ratio (CFR) among all districts in Uttar Pradesh. I hope all DNB residents will set a benchmark in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients in future,” Bhooshan said.Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, the GIMS director, said it is the hard work of all their faculty and staff members that has resulted in the growth of this institution. “After starting the MBBS course for 100 students, after due approval from the Medical Council of India (MCI), the PG courses will further improve patient care in our hospital. These trainees will boost patient care in the hospital and further growth of the institute and in return will gain from the immense and varied clinical workload. This will help not only in patient care, but also undergraduate training as they will help in training of the MBBS students,” he said. In January this year, the inspection team of the National Board of Examinations (NBE), had given permission of 20 DNB seats in five streams to GIMS for this academic session. Approximately 1,500 patients visit the hospital daily and over 200 patients are admitted as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-pg-courses-begin-at-gims/story-6F6HlGQNSxSnDGS3KREfuJ.html
05-08-2020||Noida||More number of patients opt for home isolation in GB Nagar||The number of asymptomatic patients opting home isolation has been increasing every day in Gautam Budh Nagar ever since the Uttar Pradesh government allowed it late last month. At present, the district has 254 patients in home isolation, out of 404 asymptomatic patients. The health department believes that the number of patients in home isolation will further go up in the coming days.“We also feel that home isolation is not a bad choice for asymptomatic patients, who is not having co-morbidities. The patients, who are in home isolation, are in regular contact with our doctors. They have to answer our queries regarding their health. If anything sounds alarming, we immediately admit them in different facilities,” said Dr Deepak Ohri , the district’s chief medical officer.Patients choosing home isolation need to give an undertaking promising compliance with all norms needs to be submitted by the patient; a consulting doctor will declare patient as asymptomatic; patient to ensure round-the-clock availability of a caregiver; minimum two toilets at home and separate isolation room at home. Patients will also have to purchase medical kits equipped with pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask, gloves, among others, for themselves.Dr. Dalip K Kakru, head of micro-biology department in Sharda institute of medical sciences opined that the government could go even further. “Being in home quarantine can be a better choice even for the patients with mild symptoms. But, the patients on home quarantine will have to remember not to give false information to those who check with them in an effort to stay at home,” he said. ‘Cases could be flattening’According to the official figures, on July 31, 133 new cases were detected in GB Nagar district, followed by 129 on August 1, 105 on August 2, 79 on August 3 and 36 on August 4. But on Wednesday (August 5), as many as 100 new cases were reported. In addition, the district recorded a 83% recovery rate.District magistrate Suhas LY said that early testing of the symptomatic patients and organizing health camps in different localities for identifying the patients with co-morbidities and influenza like symptoms are the main reasons of downward trend of active cases. “Also, our doctors of different Covid-19 facilities did exemplary job in treatment of the infected people. The graph is expected to go on receding trend soon,” he said. Dr. Ohri said that focus critical age groups and patients with co-morbidities has resulted in low fatality rate and more recoveries. Dr. Kakru, however, didn’t completely agree that daily active cases had started “dipping”. “No doubt, the district administration’s efforts to stem the epidemic, by containing localities and isolating people, have been successful and the disease is fading of its own accord. But, the graph is sort of flattening not dipping. In the recent past, the reduction number of active cases here are mainly due to the mixing of RT-PCR reports with rapid antigen kits’ test reports, which often do not show the exact picture of new positives. So, it is better to keep our fingers crossed till the pandeimc ends,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/more-number-of-patients-opt-for-home-isolation-in-gb-nagar/story-Cf328kJ4JIRBhWKhulxb3I.html
05-08-2020||City||Illegal registries: Revenue officials demand quashing of FIRs, departmental inquiry||Gurugram: The Haryana Revenue Officers Association on Wednesday demanded that FIRs registered on Saturday against naib tehsildars and a tehsildar in connection with illegal registries in the city should be quashed, saying the action was carried out in haste. The association, which submitted memorandums to DCs across the state, including in Gurugram, said the suspension of these officials should be revoked and a departmental inquiry be carried out first. Abhishek Bibian, district revenue officer, Yamunagar, who is president of the association, said their primary demand is that an internal inquiry should be conducted and action should be taken as per department rules only if any official is found guilty. “The FIRs have been lodged in haste and these should be quashed. There is a departmental procedure to handle these matters. We are not saying these officials are not guilty, but there is a need to hold a fair probe. If anyone is found involved in wrongdoing, then highest action may be taken in this regard as per rules,” he said. Basti Ram, district revenue officer, Gurugram, said he along with tehsildars and naib tehsildars of Gurugram district submitted their demands to deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, who heads the revenue department. “The suspension of these officials should be revoked and they may be posted at the headquarters during the probe. The decision to register FIRs is hasty as the inquiry against these officials is yet to be completed. There is a need for a transparent probe and criminal cases must be quashed,” he said. “A memorandum of demands has been received from revenue officials and it will sent to higher authorities in Chandigarh for consideration,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram The mobilisation of revenue officials happened following the state government’s decision to register FIRs against six serving revenue officials and a retired revenue official in connection with the illegal registration of property deeds in violation of Haryana Development of Urban Areas Act 1975. The police on Saturday registered cases against five serving naib tehsildars, one tehsildar and one retired naib tehsildar under section 420 of IPC and section 10 and 11 of Urban Areas Act, 1975. The complaint against these officials was lodged by the district town planner, enforcement, on the directions of the financial commissioner Haryana, who recommended the action based on an enquiry report of the divisional commissioner, Gurugram. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had said last week that criminal action would taken against officials involved in these violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-registries-revenue-officials-demand-quashing-of-firs-departmental-inquiry/story-YcyTRvLEn2SaN9LmpStbpJ.html
05-08-2020||City||Paid treatment, home isolation are preferred choice of Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad||Treatment at private hospitals and isolation at home have emerged as two popular choices for the Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad. According to officials of the health department, about 58% active patients in Ghaziabad opted to avail either of the twin facilities, while only 20% of active patients are admitted in government facilities. The UP government on May 1 had allowed the roping in of private hospitals on a paid basis for Covid-19 treatment. On July 20, the government allowed for home isolation facility for patients. According to official records, about 34% and 24% patients have opted for private hospitals and home isolation, respectively, out of total active cases till August 4 while only 20% were in government’s L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals. “Ever since the two facilities were allowed, patients have shown preference for paid Covid treatment and home isolation. These are the patients who can afford paid treatment and also have required facilities at home for moving into home isolation. As a result of drop in numbers, we have temporarily shutdown our L1 Divyajyoti Hospital in Niwari about 10 days go and presently have only two L1 facilities — besides one L2 and L3 hospitals each,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The L1, L2 and L3 Covid hospitals are part of UP government’s three-tier structure to deal with Covid cases. While L1 hospitals are meant for asymptomatic patients, L2 cater to patients with moderate complications while the L3 hospitals are meant for patients having co-morbid or severe health complications. According to the official figures of admission till August 4, the L1 hospital at SRM University, Modinagar, and ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad have a total of 72 patients admitted in them. The L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar is treating 36 patients, while the L3 hospital in Meerut has 79 patients. About 203 other patients are either taking up treatment outside the district or have remained untraceable. In some cases, some patients are yet to be allocated facilitiy for treatment. “We have 10 private hospitals and a majority of patients admitted there are those that have moderate or severe symptoms. The home isolation option is also gaining popularity and 222 asymptomatic patients have been allowed to home isolate themselves till August 4. So, in a way the focus is now shifting more towards paid treatment and home isolation,” Dr Gupta added. The 10 private hospitals offering paid Covid treatment in Ghaziabad have a combined capacity of 598 beds. Home isolation was allowed by the UP government on July 20 with several preconditions for asymptomatic patients. A team of doctors stationed at dedicated control room in Ghaziabad are in direct contact with the patients in order to monitor their health status with respect to temperature, oxygen levels and any other symptoms. In furtherance of the home isolation, the UP government is also planning to introduce paid monitoring of home isolated patients by selected private hospitals. “The proposal is in the planning stage and a feasibility study is being conducted to find if paid monitoring of home isolated patients can be done through private hospitals, like it is being done in other cities of NCR. Under the proposed arrangement, patients in home isolation will be given an option to choose from several packages for their daily monitoring on a paid basis,” said an officer from the health department. A video conferencing of the district health department officials with UP officials about the proposed arrangement was also held on Tuesday evening. “The packages offered may include daily monitoring, tele-assistance and training on home isolation protocols, video consultation with doctors, facilities of dietician and even visit by nursing staff to patient’s house. The prices of the packages will vary as per the facilities chosen by the patient. Once the feasibility study is completed, final directions will be issued by the UP government,” the officer said. The officials said that private monitoring of home isolated patients is being planned as the numbers of cases are rising and over a period of time monitoring of such patients will become a tedious job by the teams of health department officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paid-treatment-home-isolation-are-preferred-choice-of-covid-19-patients-in-ghaziabad/story-MWUEZhwCfMSoeDIz98QvpM.html
05-08-2020||Mumbai||HC dismisses PIL challenging HPC’s categorisation of prisoners for temporary bail, parole||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Alliance for People’s Movements, challenging the decision of the high power committee (HPC) to refuse temporary bail, furlough or parole leave in view of Covid-19 pandemic, to prisoners booked or convicted under special Acts and for economic offences.The petitioner body, an alliance of progressive organisations and movements across India working for human rights and civil liberties, had moved the HC, challenging certain clauses in the May 11, 2020 order of the high power committee.This included the clause by which accused persons booked under special Acts and economic offences, we’re excluded for grant of interim bail or parole. The petitioner body also challenged the clarification issued by the HPC on May 18, that its categorisation of convicts for temporary release shall not be construed as a direction for their mandatory release, and that the case of every prisoner be considered on its own merits.Arguing on behalf of the petitioner body, advocate SB Talekar had mainly submitted that the HPC exceeded its jurisdiction and arbitrarily classifieds prisoners for availing the benefits of temporary bail, furlough, or parole leaves.HC however, rejected the argument. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar said a perusal of the order of the Supreme Court (SC) under which the HPC was constituted showed that complete discretion was given to the HPC to determine the category of prisoners who should be released to decongest prisons. It said the SC had directed that the prisoners can be categorised depending upon the nature of offence, the duration of the sentence, or the severity of the offence, and any such relevant factors which the HPC may consider appropriate.HC added that on April 13, the SC clarified that there was no direction for compulsory release of prisoners, and the purpose of the directions was that the states assess the situation in their prisons regarding the outbreak, and decongest the prisons to prevent the spread of the contagion in jails.HC also took into consideration that by July 24, 10,338 prisoners had already been released either on emergency bail or parole and presently 26,279 prisoners are housed in jails across the state, having total capacity to house 23,217 prisoners. Besides, the state government has opened temporary prisons at 36 locations and around 2,597 prisoners are lodged there.“Thus, it is clear that the respondents [state authorities] have already taken steps to reduce overcrowding in prisons,” said the bench while dismissing the PIL.As regards the petitioner body’s prayer for direction to release prisoners serving life terms without insisting that they should have been released in the past at least twice, either on furlough or parole, and reported back to the jail in time, the bench said another bench of HC has already found that literal interpretation of the condition imposed by HPC will deprive the prisoners of the benefit if they have not availed furlough or parole twice in the past, and issued necessary clarification to prevent the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-dismisses-pil-challenging-hpc-s-categorisation-of-prisoners-for-temporary-bail-parole/story-sS2QCyHBZfTRJkxKETk5VP.html

The police said on Wednesday that they have arrested suspect Akash Bihari who also has a criminal record against his name. As per records, Joshi’s family had had an altercation with a group of men from their locality on July 16, after which they had approached the local police. Joshi’s family alleged that the men harassed a girl in their family, but the cops did not register a complaint. On the night of July 20, when Joshi was returning home from his sister’s house where he had attended a birthday party, he was cornered by several men in Mata Colony, with one of them shooting at him from close range. Joshi succumbed to injuries a day later on July 21. “In connection to the murder, we have arrested Akash Bihari who was absconding. He is the tenth suspect in the case. He told us that he was not present at the scene of crime but had a role in planning the attack on Joshi. He also has a previous criminal record. Bihari is the last suspect to have been nabbed in the case,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city). Investigators said that Bihari was picked up from Jassipura area on late Tuesday night, during a checking operation and upon receiving information from an informer. According to the police, Bihari also has a previous criminal history with a case of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and another case involving IPC sections of rioting and 354b (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her) lodged against him at Vijay Nagar police station earlier this year. The other suspects arrested in connection with the case are Ravi Kumar, Shahnoor alias Chotu (who goes by a single name and is the man who allegedly fired at Joshi), Mohit Kumar, Dalvir Singh, Akash Nath, Yogendra Singh, Abhishek Kant, Abhishek Mota and Mohammad Shakir. After Joshi succumbed on July 21, the cops finally swung into action and lodged an FIR against two suspects and two unidentified men for harassment of his niece. Earlier, the police top brass had suspended the local police post in-charge as well as the SHO of Vijay Nagar police station for alleged laxity.An inquiry has also been started by the circle officer to probe police laxity and the two cases, of harassment and that of Joshi’s murder, have since been transferred to the Kotwali police station. “The inquiry by the circle officer is pending,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tenth-suspect-arrested-in-connection-with-ghaziabad-journalist-s-murder/story-wilwrytSpZhu06HFCO4X4I.html
05-08-2020||City||Body in a suitcase: Warisha’s family booked for wrongly identifying body||The Bulandshahr police on Tuesday night registered a case against Warisha’s mother and two brothers for wrongfully identifying a body, found on July 27 in a suitcase in Ghaziabad, as that of Warisha. She surfaced alive on August 3, making the police realise that there had been a goof-up. The FIR was filed at Bulandshahr Kotwali on the night of August 4 under IPC Section 195a (threatening any person to give false evidence) on a complaint given by Afsar Ali, the uncle of Warisha’s husband Amir Khan. Khan, his father and mother are already in jail in connection with a dowry death case lodged against them by Warisha’s family after she had gone missing on July 23 from her in-laws’ house in Bulandshahr and the unidentified body in the suitcase was identified as that of Warisha. After Warisha surfaced on August 3, the police dropped the charges of dowry death from the FIR but the others charges remain. “The latest FIR was filed on Khan’s uncle’s complaint. He has alleged that Warisha’s family pressured him to identify the body as that of Warisha, but he refused to do so,” said Diksha Singh, circle officer (city), Bulandshahr. The FIR names Warisha’s brothers, Ismail and Israil, and their mother Bundo. “Amir, his mother and my brother (Amir’s father) have been wrongfully implicated in the dowry case. After Warisha returned, the three are still in jail and we want them released. Amir and Warisha got married during the lockdown on June 1 and we took no dowry. An air cooler and an almirah were given by her family and there was no demand put forward by our family. She fled from our house on July 23 while everyone was away for work. Amir immediately called up her mother and she said that both the families should search for her,” Ali said. He said it was Khan who approached the police with a missing person complaint after Warisha disappeared. “My brother (Amir’s father) and I were in Jaipur at that time. Later, Warisha’s mother arrived with some influential people and threatened our family. We repeatedly told the police that the photos of Warisha and the dead woman did not match. But no one listened to us. On August 4, police told me that action is to be taken against Warisha’s family. So they prepared a written complaint and asked me to sign it. We also want the police to probe how Warisha fled Bulandshahr and where she was staying till August 3,” Ali said. According to the police, Warisha fled Bulandshahr and came to Noida where she stayed for a while before leaving for her home in Aligarh on August 3. Aquil Ahmad Afridi, Khan’s lawyer, said, “Now that the charges of dowry death have been dropped, we will apply for bail. We are also keeping tab on what Warisha says in her CrPC 164 statement before a magistrate.” The post mortem of the body was conducted in Ghaziabad on July 29 and later it was handed over to Warisha’s family who took it to their hometown in Aligarh and buried it. The teeth, nail scrapings, fingerprints and viscera have been preserved for further probe.“The woman was murdered approximately four or five days before the autopsy. Warisha’s brother Israil had signed the identification documents in Ismail’s presence,” a Ghaziabad officer said, requesting not to be named. Warisha’s family could not be contacted as their phones remained switched off since Tuesday. “As regards the allegations made by Khan’s uncle, we will look into it. The police will also submit to the court a detailed investigation report. The motive for identifying the body wrongly will also be found out,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). The Ghaziabad police, meanwhile, had lodged a fresh case of murder and destruction of evidence in connection with the murder of the unidentified woman whose body is now buried in Aligarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-in-a-suitcase-warisha-s-family-booked-for-wrongly-identifying-body/story-yJW9MdvRukWpbGPjPyMi6O.html

The authority has been asked to expedite and send the list of officials as several letters have already been written in this regard without eliciting a response. The latest letter in this regard was sent by chief vigilance officer to HSVP Gurugram on July 15.The matter pertains to an e-auction held on June 18 2017, in which the authority had put up 21 residential plots. Under the ,rules it was imperative that information about these plots is put on the website 21 days prior to auction, but instead, the details were uploaded just two days before the auction was held, the complainant in the matter, Dhanraj Bansal, a city resident, allegedly. Similar violations were carried out in the next two auctions held on July 29 and 30, he alleged.A complaint in this regard was lodged on the CM Window in April 2018 by Bansal, leading to an inquiry by Yashpal Yadav, the then administrator of HSVP, Gurugram. The probe conducted by him found that alleged irregularities had been conducted in the auction of plots as details of the same were not uploaded as per the stipulated rules, which led to losses to the authority as information to more people would have enabled the authority to get more money in the auction. Yadav had recommended that in case of losses to the authority, action should be recommended against concerned officials, said HSVP officials on condition of anonymity.“When the auctions were carried out in 2017, inadequate time was given to the buyers to participate in the auction and this has been continuing. If action is taken, such practices will stop,” said Bansal.When asked about the matter, HSVP admInistrator Jitender Yadav said that the list of concerned officials would be soon sent to the chief vigilance officer (CVO). “A list will be sent at the earliest,” he said.Rajiv Mehta, CVO, HSVP said that they are actively pursuing cases in which response has been delayed. “I have recently joined and found that responses are delayed. Strict action will be taken in such cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hsvp-seeks-list-of-officials-involved-in-violating-e-auction-norms/story-MQRoP9p3PUdn9GrP3bjTZM.html

Although experimental, the therapy has shown promise in helping people fight off the infection. The bank was set up to provide easier access to plasma after many patients and their families reported that they could not find matching plasma. In private hospitals of the city designated for Covid-19 treatment, nearly 78 patients are admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) including 16 on ventilator support. It includes patients from Gurugram, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other states.According to doctors at the blood bank, three people who had recovered from Covid-19 had approached to donate plasma, but did not fulfill the criteria. “One was above the age limit of 60, while the other two had low prevalence of antibodies,” said Dr. Mahima Kilhor, medical officer at Rotary blood bank. On inauguration day, the plasma bank collected 10 units of plasma -- one unit contains 200 ml of plasma --- from the five patients. The per unit cost was fixed at ₹8,500, but free for BPL card holders and pregnant women.Of the 10, four were procured by patients admitted in private hospitals. “One unit of plasma collected from a single donor can be given to two patients. Since there has been no donation in the last one week, the bank is left with only six units,” said Kilhor, mentioning that it is seen that one unit of plasma is used for the treatment. In a few cases two units can be administered.According to Kilhor, the plasma unit is provided only after detailed verification and a signed request from the authorised nodal officer of the hospital where the patient is undergoing treatment, along with the medical superintendent of the district health department.Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said they will work on increasing awareness. “Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material will be distributed by the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in areas falling under different primary heath care centres,” he said. “By next week, hoardings on plasma bank will be placed in 25 locations across the city. It will increase the footfall for the plasma donation.” In various hospitals of Gurugram, at least 259 Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment. It includes 78 patients of Gurugram, 27 from other districts of Haryana, 33 from Delhi, 79 from Uttar Pradesh and 42 from other states of the country. On Wednesday, the total count of the infected person reached 9398, with 64 new cases. Out of the total cases, 8548 have recovered from the illness and 725 are active.

A factory worker in Badshahpur, Shashtri decided to make the switch from a private to government school in view of the uncertainty around his financial situation that has persisted ever since the outbreak of Covid-19. He said that he spoke to the school authorities and others who had children in the school and decided to make the switch after much deliberation. “The school provides good education and the environment is also healthy. Keeping in mind the current circumstances and the financial uncertainty, I decided to take this decision. There is no immediate end to the pandemic in sight and with a diminishing income, it is important to spend resources wisely,” said Rathi. He said that while online classes were being conducted by his son’s previous school, they were unstructured and children were unable to follow the lessons taking place. “If children are going to study online and on their own only, then paying such high fees doesn’t make much sense. Schools have been demanding the complete fee and not giving any concessions. We researched about the government schools and decided to give it a try,” said Shashtri. With incomes drying up and financial distress affecting jobs and businesses all across, many working-class and middle-class families, whose children used to study in low-cost private schools in the neighbourhood, are making the choice of shifting to government schools. Apart from the rising financial constraints, for many parents, the shift is also influenced by the futility of paying high fees for online classes, which they considered as a relatively lesser effective mode of teaching. As per data shared by the Haryana education department, as many as 43,293 private school students have moved to government schools across the state ever since the 2020-21 academic session started on April 1. A total of 2,453 private school students have shifted to government schools in Gurugram alone.Satish Kumar, a resident of Bhondsi, recently moved his three kids from a private school in Ghamroj to the government senior secondary school in Bhondsi. Kumar, who runs a general store, said that while the private school had been conducting online classes, they were erratic and not up to the mark. Based on feedback from neighbours, whose children had been studying in the government school, he got his children admitted to the new school. “During the pandemic, I saw my children struggling with online classes. There was no schedule or timetable. Teachers shared assignments as per convenience and it was becoming difficult for children to grasp concepts. On the other hand, I saw that those who were going to government schools were learning quite well. I didn’t make sense to pay such high fees during a pandemic when the quality of teaching was either similar or better in government schools,” said Kumar. School principals across the district confirmed that they had seen an uptick in the number of students who were migrating from private schools to government schools. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school had received at least 100 applications from students who were planning to shift from private schools to government schools in the past week. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, sector 43, said that 230 students from private schools had taken admission in the school during the pandemic. “Many students from private schools are coming for admission nowadays. While different parents have different motivations, the fact that government schools provide quality education without any cost is an important consideration, based on feedback that we have received,” said Miglani. Surinder Singh, principal of Government senior secondary school, Darbaripur, said that his school had been contacted by parents of at least 30 children in various grades who were keen on moving from private schools to government ones. “Many children have approached us but their admission is pending since private school are yet to release their documents and certificates that are needed for the formal completion of admission process,” said Singh. He said that the school was expecting enrolments from at least 30-40 students by the end of the month. Some of these children have already been added to the class WhatsApp group. Singh said that many of the prospective students were children of farmers whose source of earnings had dwindled due to the lockdown. “Children from villages in the vicinity are opting for government schools now. Due to the pandemic, income of various families has dried up. They are keen on continuing learning but are unable to afford private schools. Government schools provide a cheaper option,” said Singh. District education officer Indu Boken said that around 2500 students who earlier studied in private schools had taken admission in various government schools across the district until July end. “The strength of such students is increasing on a daily basis,” said Boken. She said that the effort of government schools towards conducting online classes during the pandemic and the improved performance over the years were among factors that were influencing parents’ decisions in making the switch. “The performance of government schools in the state has increased considerably over the years. People are also taking cognizance of the fact that government schools have been conducting classes without a break since the country went into lockdown. Not all private schools have been conducting classes regularly,” said Boken, adding that said that while online private schools that were heavily reliant on gadgets and technological devices, government schools have been conducting classes through television for students lacking online resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-schools-a-lucrative-option-for-financially-hit-parents/story-i3vwnFmqTPR9xrcqMQQltI.html

05-08-2020||City||Students unable to complete DU’s online test can write physical exam later on: HC||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said all final-year undergraduate students, including those in the general category, who have registered for Delhi University’s (DU) open book examination (OBE) but cannot complete it, will have the option to physically appear for the exams later -- even if they have downloaded the question paper but could not manage to upload or e-mail the answer sheet for any reason. A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad passed the order after DU counsel senior advocate Sachin Datta agreed to the court’s suggestion that considering the problems related to OBE, the general category should also be given an option to appear for the physical examination like the PWD category students. Around 240,000 students are set to take the test through OBE on August 10. The court, however, agreed with DU’s contention that if a student uploads or e-mails an answer sheet of any subject, then he or she will not be permitted to sit for the physical examination in that particular subject later on. The university’s counsel said any student unable to take the OBE exam for any other reason will get a chance again when the university holds the physical test at a later date. The court was hearing petitions filed by law student Prateek Sharma and the National Federation of Blind (NFB), seeking effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially abled students for the exams. On Wednesday, DU filed an affidavit in the court, stating that in the second set of mock tests, 186,814 students had registered out of which 23,693 students were able to complete examination process. In the first phase, 183,376 students had registered of which 33,162 students completed the process. Seeing the outcome, the court noted that “data relating to the second phase of the mock test is more abysmal than the first phase”. It expressed displeasure at the dismal number of people appearing for the second mock tests. “Even for the PWD category students and VH students, the data of the second phase is no better than that of the first phase, if not worse. This is a clear indication that final-year students are not thoroughly prepared to participate in the OBE on-line mode of examination that the university of Delhi has proposed to conduct,” the court said. The bench directed the varsity to provide scribes, on request, to visually impaired students at common service centres (CSCs) for the online OBE for final-year undergraduate courses, if they have opted for one. The court directed DU to finalise the results date. It also asked the university to give specify dates to hold physical examinations for those who could not take the online test. The bench said the university should provide at least two reading material or text books of each paper to visually handicapped students and granted a week’s time to students to make the request to DU. It said DU will ensure no such student is deprived of a scribe if it has been informed in advance. Delhi University will also give provisional admission to students in its postgraduate courses, subject to them clearing the entrance exam, the court said. It asked the university to state the number of students who registered and logged in for the online examination and listed the matter for further hearing on August 17. A member of the university’s examination branch, who wished not to be named, said, “The university from the beginning is saying that another chance will be given to students who are not able to appear in OBE remotely. The exams in the normal pen and paper mode will be conducted only after the declaration of the results of OBE exams.”Meanwhile, another bench of the Delhi High Court reserved its order on a bunch of pleas challenging the conduct of OBE examinations. DU told the court that the idea behind holding the online exam was to prevent students from assembling in one hall, where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-unable-to-complete-du-s-online-test-can-write-physical-exam-later-on-hc/story-SBQmKGja8AOt2yH6UF83dL.html
05-08-2020||City||Delhi govt to conduct a study for finding ways to ramp up revenues||New Delhi: The Delhi government will conduct a study to find ways to improve revenues, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday.The move comes a day after the government sent notices to around 10,800 companies in the city for paying lesser or no tax between January and March this year. The Delhi government’s tax collection in January-March this year has gone down by over Rs 2,000 crore compared to the same period last year.On Wednesday, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, held a meeting, for the second consecutive day, to discuss ways to increase government’s revenue collection. Sisodia on Wednesday directed the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) to prepare a detailed study to improve the revenue base in Delhi and submit its report in two months. The DDC is a policy think tank of the Delhi government. Its chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and vice-chairperson is Jasmine Shah, who is also the media advisor to the CM.Talking about the scope of the study, Sisodia said the DDC would have to suggest short and long-term measures to improve the revenue base of Delhi. He also directed DDC to consult with leading experts in the field and relevant organisations working in public finance while carrying out the study.“The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has put a huge strain on government revenues in the national Capital territory (NCT) of Delhi. Therefore, all out efforts need to be made towards revenue augmentation so that the government is able to undertake all necessary works and programmes for the welfare of people of Delhi,” Sisodia said after the meeting. According to Delhi’s economic survey for 2019-20, though the Capital is among the states with the highest per capita income, its position is 19th in terms of its own tax revenue as the percentage (4.73%) of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) during 2018-19. “For 2018-19, Uttar Pradesh’s tax revenue as percentage of GSDP is 9.1%, Kerala’s is 7.7%, Rajasthan 7.2%, Maharashtra 7.1% and Andhra Pradesh 7%. Looking at Delhi’s trend itself, its tax revenue to GSDP was 6.18% in 2009-10, which reduced to 5.38% in 2014-15 and further reduced to 4.73% in 2018-19. In comparison, the average tax revenue for all states as a % of their GSDP was 5.94% in 2009-10, which increased to 6.25% in 2014-15 and further increased to 6.69% in 2018-19,” the government said in a statement. DDC vice chairman Jasmine Shah said the Delhi government’s early call for opening the economy and a robust healthcare strategy has set the right conditions for an economic revival. “The DDC will perform a rigorous study on the improvement of the revenue base of Delhi. We will involve the field experts to perform this study. Today, the Delhi model of fighting against COVID-19 has become a model for across India and we are confident that with time and a proper strategy, we will be able to overcome the revenue deficit too,” he said. In a bid to improve Delhi’s revenue deficit, the trade and taxes department of the Delhi government has started analysing the returns by taxpayers registered under GST. On Tuesday, Sisodia held a meeting with the officials, in which it was said that of the 15,000 taxpayers analysed so far, nearly 970 taxpayers have not filed returns for 2020-21 from January to March. The Delhi government has also found that this year, nearly 10,800 companies paid lesser or zero tax from January to March. Taking cognizance of these findings, the Delhi government has prepared a list of defaulters. The deputy chief minister has appealed to all the companies to immediately deposit their taxes. He also said that the Delhi government will take stringent action against the defaulters. “The Delhi government has evaluated 15,000 companies so far but in the future up to 7 lakh companies registered under GST will be evaluated. The Delhi government will take strict action against all the defaulters after the evaluation,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-conduct-a-study-for-finding-ways-to-ramp-up-revenues/story-iL3JUj3imtEpXjQDH0fNfJ.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC quashes Panjab University’s decision to revoke ex-senator’s registration||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed the decision taken by Panjab University (PU) in 2019 to revoke the registration of a former senator, Munish Verma, as graduate constituency member, which allows ex students to elect and contest polls for the varsity’s apex governing body. Verma’s registration was cancelled and he was barred from participating in future senate elections after being indicted of wrongfully hiring three persons as centre and assistant superintendents in the 2014 annual examinations at MR Government College in Fazilka, Punjab. The high court, however, upheld PU’s decision to constitute a committee to probe the 2014 incident and its report observing that Verma has not been able to establish on what means he is entitled to seek quashing of these decisions. He had approached high court in February 2020 challenging all these decisions. He claimed he had been a whistle blower regarding certain major and important issues pertaining to the varsity, and that was ‘primary cause’ of this victimisation. The high court bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh said that as per PU Act, a person’s name can be struck off from the register of registered graduates with the concurrence of not less than two-third members of the senate. However, there were total 91 members, two-thirds of which comes to 61; but, when the decision on revoking registration was taken, only 38 members were present. Hence, quorum of the meeting was not complete. The court also observed that the varsity in its May 2019 proceedings acted in “undue haste to accomplish their designs” to ensure that Verma is thrown out of the senate “by all ways and means”. “What one can concur is that the respondent authorities, perturbed over the conduct of the petitioner, are trying to curb freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 to the petitioner,” the bench observed, referring to proceedings of senate. As of Verma’s submissions that he was not properly associated with the probe into the 2014 incident, which led to revocation of his registration, the court observed that the petitioner was aware of proceedings being carried against him by the university and has intentionally sought to evade his presence for a motivated cause, and therefore, cannot hide behind the plea of non-adherence to the principles of natural justice. The ‘fraud’ had came to light on April 4, 2014, when a flying squad of the university visited the examination centre and recommended removal of all three who were appointed illegally. After that, a committee in 2015 constituted by the Panjab University vice-chancellor had indicted the ex-senator of cheating the varsity while deputing the three persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-quashes-panjab-university-s-decision-to-revoke-ex-senator-s-registration/story-qpMlNkpF4sDtNCCj1XR0BP.html

The accused has been identified as Shadi Lal Tickoo, a resident of Kharar in Punjab and a native of Bandipura in Jammu and Kashmir. He works with the Harmony Health Care (BPLK) in Phase-II Industrial area. As per the information, Tickoo worked at the Cardio Lab from February 2016 to November, 2019 and was terminated due to some salary and administrative issues.

He retained some official records even after his termination though he claims to have destroyed all the records during the lockdown.Police are interrogating as to what led him to write the letter. He has so far confessed to writing the letter from a cyber cafe in Khanpur of Kharar, said superintendent of police (SP, law and order) Khushal Thakur. A chargesheet regarding the matter will soon be submitted in the court.THE ALLEGATIONSThe letter had stated that the Himachal Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation (HPSEDC) had purchased substandard and low-cost ventilators at Rs 10,29,840 per unit whereas the actual price of the ventilators was Rs 3,50,000 in the private sector.

05-08-2020||City||Attack on BJP panch: 3 BJP workers resign in south Kashmir||Three BJP activists dissociated themselves from the party on Wednesday, a day after Arif Ahmad Shah, a panch associated with the saffron party, was injured in a suspected militant attack in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district.The three BJP workers are Kund constituency president Nisar Ahmad Wani, Devsar constituency vice-president Sabzar Ahmad Paddar, and activist Ashiq Hussain Palla of Warpora-Kund .The resignation comes on the first anniversary of the revocation of Article 370, which is being celebrated by the BJP amid strict restrictions on movement and assembly of people. Shah was fired upon by suspected militants near his home at Akhran village of Devsar in Kulgam on Tuesday night. He sustained injuries on the neck. Wani, a baker, who had joined the BJP a few months ago, said, “I am an unlettered person and earn my living as a labourer. I think it is better to focus on feeding my family without any stress.” Though he said his resignation had nothing to do with the attack on Shah last night, he said Kund was a very dangerous area. “We live on a hill and fear is pervasive,” he said. Paddar said they had resigned of their own accord and had not been pressured. “I resigned owing to some personal reasons. We belong to poor families and want to focus on our families,” Paddar, who had joined the BJP six months ago, said. BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur said Shah was stable. However he denied that the workers who resigned were part of the BJP. “Atleast, I don’t know them,”he said. Last month BJP’s former Bandipora district president Waseem Bari, was killed, along with his father Basheer Ahmad and brother Suhail Basheer, inside his shop. Police had said two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) members were involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/attack-on-bjp-panch-3-bjp-workers-resign-in-south-kashmir/story-GxHw5DAV7BG3PQNmWhrk1L.html
05-08-2020||City||Pilot for paperless bus tickets launched||New Delhi: The state transport department in the Capital on Wednesday started on a pilot basis a provision for contactless ticketing, with all buses on route number 473 which connects Badarpur with Anand Vihar ISBT for three days, said Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot. Currently, buses in Delhi are operational but with restrictions – not more than 25 passengers at any given point of time. All the 25 passengers have to be seated. All the conductors were given online training to assist the commuters during the three-day pilot run by a team of Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology in Delhi, said Gahlot adding, “The aim of the initiative is to minimise physical exchange of cash and tickets between commuters and conductors, in the light of the covid pandemic.” A special task force set up by Gahlot is overseeing the pilot run. The first trial run of the project was organised on July 2, on which tickets of different values were issued on an ad-hoc basis in periodic intervals without any passengers in few buses on route number 763 (connecting Nizamuddin Railway Station with Uttam Nagar bus terminal) in which the trial run was conducted. “The trial run was successful. So, the department decided to go ahead with the pilot run which will be operational for three days. If it turns out to be successful, the initiative will be implemented in buses across several other routes within this month,” said a senior official in the transport department who did not wish to be identified. Under the system, the passengers have to get QR codes scanned in their mobile phones during the travel through a mobile application designed for the purpose. The required fare can be paid through Google Pay and other UPI-based payment systems supported by the mobile application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pilot-for-paperless-bus-tickets-launched/story-0w5hl6T9Unn7BN6dZOnqBN.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Can’t interfere with govt order banning defence personnel from using social media, says Delhi HC||The Delhi High court Wednesday dismissed a plea by a senior army officer, challenging the ban on the use of social media by army personnel, and stated that earlier advisories and directives regarding the conduct and behaviour of army personnel on social networking sites have not been abided with by some. A bench of justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and justice Asha Menon said several personnel “unsuspectingly” answered all kinds of questions related to their postings and whereabouts on social media and such information, when collated from a number of sources, can easily convey a full picture to an expert spy. The court was hearing a plea by lieutenant colonel PK Choudhary who had sought the court’s direction to the director general of military intelligence to withdraw its June 6 policy, ordering all members of the Indian army to delete their accounts from Facebook and Instagram and 87 other such applications. In the petition, filed through advocates Shivank Pratap Singh and Sanandika Pratap Singh, the officer sought direction to the Centre through the ministry of defence to withdraw its June 6 order. In a 19-page judgment dismissing his plea, the court said “warfare and intercountry rivalries and animosities today are not confined to the accession of territory and destruction of installations and infrastructure of enemy countries but also extend to influencing and affecting the economies and the political stability of enemy country, including by inciting civil unrest and disturbance and influencing the political will of the citizens of the enemy country”. The bench refused to interfere with the order and said that no satisfactory answer was obtained from the petitioner when he was told to explore alternative means for connecting with family and friends. The court also said the officer was being “followed (online)” by a large number of people and he keeps commenting on their posts and tweets, which is a breach of earlier advisories and regulations. The plea by the army officer had also said he is an active user of Facebook and uses the platform to connect with his friends and family as most of them are settled abroad, including his elder daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/can-t-interfere-with-govt-order-banning-defence-personnel-from-using-social-media-says-delhi-hc/story-mTq5ai0YEjCsg0uX0D6SKK.html

05-08-2020||Delhi||No business for past 5 months, shops at Metro stations seek rental waivers, deferments||Commercial establishments operating out of Metro stations have written to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to defer rental payments as no business has taken place since the last week of March, when the nationwide lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The DMRC has formed a committee to look into these demands. While public transport was allowed to resume in the national capital on May 20, under strict restrictions and rules, Metro services have been shut for almost five months now. The government is yet to announce the date for reopening Metro services. There are about 400 shops operating out of 285 Metro stations, not to mention the property development at stations such as Nehru Place and Huda City Centre that before the lockdown used to attract a high footfall owing to the numerous restaurants located in these places. The Delhi Metro earns around ₹600 crore in rental income. With a daily footfall of nearly 30 lakh on Metro network, it had been a lucrative proposition for commercial establishments to operate out of stations. But since the lockdown, these businesses has been suffering huge losses. Metro officials said the commercial establishments have been requesting a wavier on rents or a deferment on the rent payments as they have had no business in the past five months. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “The businesses of our tenants, including retail and commercial properties, have been badly affected. They have written to us asking that we defer rental payments. We are looking at the government guidelines on this. If we take coercive action against these tenants, some of them might be forced to shut down. We need to support them at this hour of crisis. The pandemic has still not settled down. So we are yet to take a call on the issue.” Dayal said, “In 2018-19, the earnings from non-passenger revenue was ₹594 crore, which include income from rentals and leases.” Rentals from commercial spaces is one of the important sources of the Metro’s revenue. Apart from that, the DMRC also earns revenue from parking at stations, and leasing of advertisement space on stations and trains, among others. However, the main source of DMRC revenue is from Metro operations which is around ₹3,000 crore annually.” HT was unable to get in touch with commercial establishment owners despite numerous attempts to reach them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-business-for-past-5-months-shops-at-metro-stations-seek-rental-waivers-deferments/story-ajRrsWyyWsk69wm4zbBC4M.html

He contended that internationally, police are not denied access to educational institutions and universities.On compensation to students who were seriously injured in the violence, he said it can be awarded only if there was an admission of the breach and in the present case, the issue was still being examined.He said the case of the petitioners was based on an “assumption of wrongdoing” by the police and it involves disputed questions of fact for which the evidence on record has to be examined.Violence has broken out in the varsity after student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).Police have been accused of entering the university campus and assaulting students after a protest against the Citizenship(Amendment) Act turned violent on December 15. At least 10 vehicles were allegedly torched by protesters. The Jamia students had said they were not involved in the violence and that their peaceful march was hijacked by outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-oppose-sit-to-probe-jamia-violence/story-cQvFHIWXjg204fURI5wi3L.html

05-08-2020||City||Capt government makes fresh push to enact PCOCA||Chandigarh The Punjab government is set to use the hooch tragedy to give an impetus to enacting the Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act (PCOCA). The issue of PCOCA, a strong law, figured at the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday, where the hooch tragedy was discussed. As per a government spokesperson, the fresh suggestion to have PCOCA to deal with organised crime was mooted by advocate general Atul Nanda, with several ministers supporting it. Framed on the basis of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), the law is considered to be the idea of former Punjab DGP Suresh Arora who had pushed for its introduction to crackdown on organised crime during the previous SAD-BJP government, especially to check gang culture. As per original provisions proposed in PCOCA, a statement before a superintendent rank (SP) official would be admissible before court. On Wednesday, the cabinet agreed that PCOCA was needed to combat organised crime like illicit liquor smuggling following which the CM asked the sub-committee under minister Brahm Mohindra to finalise and submit its report at the earliest. This sub-committee had been tasked with studying PCOCA, sometime after the Congress assumed power in 2017, but the matter was not pursued, after questions were raised over the misuse of the law. The CM, as per an official spokesperson, agreed with Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and other ministers that PCOCA could help control hardcore criminals and act as deterrent to gangsters. This is for the first time that such unanimity has been seen to enact PCOCA, the provisions of which are stronger. “If you look at the history of accused in this case, they were being booked repeatedly under the excise act but they were roaming freely because the present laws are not enough to curtail activities of such persons,” said a senior police functionary. When the Amarinder government wanted to push the PCOCA after taking over in 2017, the provision of a statement before SP being valid in court was amended. It was suggested, instead, that an SSP-rank officer would record a statement under this law and it would go to the IG for invoking the PCOCA. Thereafter, the IG would invoke the act in a particular case only after getting permission from an additional director general of police (ADGP) rank officer, who would specifically oversee the implementation of the PCOCA. All electronic evidence, including secret recordings of phone calls, gathered by the police will also be proof. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Delhi, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala are the states that already have this kind of law to check organised crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-government-makes-fresh-push-to-enact-pcoca/story-elVVHwQ2IBSkD0CIVFhU5J.html

The suspects sold 2.5 kilograms of gold to jewellers in Delhi-NCR and earned nearly R1.25 crore. Two cars used in the crime have been seized, deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajesh Deo aid.Those arrested were identified as Somveer, the sacked Haryana Police constable, Ajay Kumar, who works at a private security agency, Durga Prasad, who worked as a clerk at an advocate’s office in Dwarka, Chirag Juneja, a diploma holder in pharmacy, Daya Ram Lakra, Pankaj Sharma, and Sunil alias Sunny.DCP Deo said the father-son duo, who runs a jewellery shop in Chandni Chowk, said in their complaint that on July 22, around 1.30 pm, they were driving home and carrying 1.503 grams of gold and R4.5 lakh cash in a bag. As they reached the Geeta Colony flyover, a white Swift car intercepted their car, forcing them to stop. A Santro car also came and blocked their vehicle from behind.Two men with firearms said they were crime branch officers and asked the father-son duo to sit in their car. Thereafter, they kept driving around different roads of the city for nearly an hour and eventually stopped the vehicle on the Outer Ring Road near Burari, the DCP said.“The suspects forced the father and son out of the car and took their bag containing gold bars and cash.

Yet, Buddha Nullah pollution remains a bane for the city.The information has been obtained by a city-based RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal.Buddha Nullah pollution has been a political concern for a long time and was one of the poll issues during the MP elections held last year.Sabharwal said, “It should be brought to the fore that whether the promises made by politicians in the past were fake or genuine. If a grant was released, where has the money been utilised?”“A large number of projects have been announced in the past, but nothing concrete has been done to reach the solution,” said Sabharwal.An MC employee requesting anonymity said with the amount transferred to different departments for cleaning the nullah in the last two decades, the MC could have bought its own poclain machines and been able to de-pollute it properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-state-centre-grant-for-cleaning-ludhiana-s-buddha-nullah-in-last-two-decades-reveals-rti/story-aLdnlDZgj0OKQ1fUaowuGK.html

Till date, four critically-ill patients of GMC Amritsar and two of GMC Faridkot have been treated through plasma therapy. All six had recovered successfully.“I was admitted at GMC Amritsar for nearly a month after I tested positive. Doctors helped me recover but my health was deteriorating and I suffered a lot. After I got discharged, the authorities asked me to donate plasma but I refused to do so. I still feel weak and don’t want to get hospitalised again as I fear contacting the disease for the second time,” said a 24-year-old covid survivor.Another recovered patient, who refused to donate plasma, said, “GMC Amritsar lacks facilities to treat covid patients. Food provided there was of poor quality and cleanliness was worse. I had to be shifted to a private hospital for treatment. I do not want to visit that hospital again. I am ready to donate plasma if private hospitals offer such facilities.”“Who will go to hospital again after recovering from the diseases? Going there means contacting the infection again,” said a recovered patient from Patiala.GMC Amritsar blood bank in-charge Dr Neeraj Sharma said, “So far, only six donors have come forward. There are many misconceptions among people. Plasma donation neither makes the donor weak nor is it a painful process.”GMC Patiala medical superintendent Dr Paras Pandove said, “Searching for a plasma donor is a tough process as we have to follow the ICMR guidelines. Also, blood bank is far from the covid ward and donors cannot get infected again. Just 15 plasma donors have come forward so far and only six of them were eligible for the donation. Hospital counsellors are also trying to persuade recovered patients to donate plasma and help other critical patients recover.”WHO CAN DONATE PLASMA?People who have tested positive for Covid-19, had been critically-ill and recovered at least three weeks before donating.People aged 18 years and above, but not more than 60 years.People who have developed antibodies in their blood to fight the virus.People who do not suffer from co-morbidities or fatal disease such as HIV.Women who have not given birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-covid-survivors-reluctant-to-donate-plasma-fear-hospitalisation-for-second-time/story-0I7aRjtGJRlwsoT1A0TJyK.html

The order by the KDMC chief Vijay Suryavanshi states, “The state government has separated the villages from the civic body and has decided to form a new municipal body for these 18 villages. The civic body will now reform its wards. Hence, we are bound to stop all the works undertaken and proposed through the civic body funds in these villages.” After a decade long wait, on the backdrop of the civic polls, the Maharashtra state government in June declared that 18 villages out of the 27 villages will be separated from the civic body and will have a separate municipal body, while the remaining nine villages will remain under KDMC. The 18 villages comprise Ghesar, Hedutane, Umbroli, Bhal, Dwarli, Manere, Vasar, Ashele, Nandivl Ambernath, Adivli- Dhokli, Daudi, Chinchpada, Pisavli, Golivali, Mangaon. Nilje, Sonarpada and Kole. Earlier on June 30, the KDMC cancelled the corporator post of 13 corporators as they represent these 18 villages. Former corporator of Pisavli village Moreshwar Bhoir, who earlier had objected the decision of cancellation of corporator post will file a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in Bombay High Court on Thursday. “I have not yet received a letter on stopping the projects in these villages. However, this decision by the civic will affect the residents a lot. The civic body had undertaken water supply network works under Amrut yojana of which the first phase has already started in which kdmc is sharing the cost by 50%. The works of road repairs will also be stuck due to this decision,” said Moreshwar Bhoir, former corporator of Pisavli village. As per Bhoir the civic body has spent around Rs 200 crore in these villages since the 27 villages were included in KDMC in 2015. “Most of the works undertaken by the13 corporators in their wards in which the tenders are also finalised it will be cancelled now,” added Bhoir. He added, “Now one question we have is what the locals do when they don’t have a civic body to look up to. Right these villages do not come under any municipal body. I have decided to file public interest litigation in Bombay high court on Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-chief-orders-to-stop-ongoing-and-proposed-projects-in-18-villages/story-WFLhuvX0DO2eSfAEF0M1wI.html

However, the question of new facts did not arise because previously no sanction order had been passed by the competent authority and it was the first time when the authority had to consider the facts of the case.The complainant, Prem Singh Bisht, who appeared in the witness box in court and corroborated the contents of his complaint verbatim, stated that the DIG had not considered his evidence.The prosecutor argued that the complainant in his examination-in-chief had reiterated that face-to-face conversation had taken placed between him and SHO Kaur and another accused, sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh, where Kaur had told him to fulfil the demand for Rs 9 lakh bribe.Bisht told the cold that the DIG did not consider the call details between him, the SHO and the SI, which strengthened his allegations and deposition in court.He added that there was also CCTV footage of him meeting the accused SI and then the SI’s meeting with Kaur, but this scientific evidence was not considered by the DIG.The graft case in question dates back to October 2017, when SI Mohan Singh was arrested for accepting Rs 2 lakh in bribe, allegedly on the directions of the then Sector 31 SHO, Jaswinder Kaur.Bisht had alleged that the SI, who was the investigating officer in an attempt to murder case, demanded Rs 9 lakh to drop the names of three of his employees from the FIR.The CBI had arrested the SI while accepting Rs 2 lakh bribe, but the case was closed against Kaur as the agency could not find any evidence to implicate her, prompting Bisht to file an application first in 2019 and again in February this year.The graft-tainted SHO had surrendered before a Chandigarh court on July 25 in another Rs 5 lakh graft case from May this year. She is currently in judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2017-graft-case-cbi-court-turns-down-plea-to-declare-suspended-chandigarh-sho-accused/story-yH7MRc2vKap2d6cDFOgFpM.html

SAD’s Amritsar city president Gurpartap Singh Tikka led the protest outside Jandiala MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny’s residence at Anand Avenue in Amritsar. The Akalis’ Tarn Taran district president Virsa Singh Valtoha led the protest outside Khadoor Sahib MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki’s residence in Raishiana village. In Jalandhar, SAD workers held a protest march to gherao the residence of Sikki. Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Romana said, “Ministers of the government, MLAs and other leaders of the Congress party are involved in the illegal sale of the spurious liquor.”In Amritsar, police stopped SAD leaders and workers a little distance away from the house by barricading. Tikka said, “Danny sheltered those who were selling illicit liquor. The MLA should be booked for murder. We also demand a high level probe to unearth the political-police-mafia nexus.” In Rashiana village, Valtoha said, “More than 80 people have been killed by consuming illicit liquor in Tarn Taran. Most victims belong to Khadoor Sahib constituency and some of the victims’ kin have given written complaints to police against MLA Sikki and his personal assistant (PA) Jarmanjit Singh.”“The MLA and his PA are solely responsible for deaths of innocent people. We will continue our protest until the MLA and his PA are booked,” Valtoha added. Sikki said, “SAD is playing dirty politics. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has already taken strict action against those involved in illicit liquor trade. Those killed in the tragedy were close to me and they were like my family members. I am pained by the deaths. We have also ensured free treatment for those admitted at various hospitals. Some politicians are defaming me and my PA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooch-tragedy-sad-protests-against-cong-mlas-from-khadoor-sahib-jandiala/story-c2kWycQN29MZvaJQr4dzhJ.html

It will take a few months to get back on track.”Only 25% of the original number of customers visited the gym on Wednesday, added Gagneja.The guidelines released by the government for the reopening of gyms made face cover or mask mandatory at all times on the premises and recommended the use of the Covid-19 tracker app Aarogya Setu. Other instructions include keeping the machines six feet apart.“Only 10 customers showed in the morning. People are apprehensive. The response to booking is not good enough and it will take time to catch the rhythm,” said Manu Sharma, manager of Bodyscapes Fitness Temple, Sector 34A.SOME GYMS YET TO REOPENSanjeev Kumar, president of the Tricity Gym Owners’ Association, said, “80% of the gyms in the tricity reopened on Wednesday and others will open in a few days.

05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM directs DGP to book those directly involved in hooch tragedy for murder||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he will not tolerate any political interference in the hooch tragedy case, and directed the director general of police (DGP) to book those directly involved for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. Promising justice for victims of the case, which he termed as the biggest tragedy of recent times, the chief minister also mooted enhancement of punishment for spurious/illicit liquor manufacturing and smuggling under the Excise Act, to ensure that repeat offenders remain behind bars. As several ministers agreed, during a cabinet meet, to the suggestion of advocate general Atul Nanda that a strict law such as the Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act (PCOCA) was needed to fight illicit liquor smuggling, the chief minister asked the sub-committee, set up under Brahm Mohindra to examine the provisions of the proposed law, to finalise and submit its report at the earliest. He agreed with Sukhjinder Randhawa and other ministers that PCOCA could help control hardcore criminals and act as deterrent to gangsters, who continue to deal in organised crime even from prison, and had close connections with terrorists too. The chief minister’s directives on the hooch tragedy came during two video conferences – one of the cabinet meeting and the other a review meeting of the case with top police and administrative officials. ‘FINISH OFF THIS BUSINESS, CLEAN UP THE BORDERS’ Captain Amarinder also led his council of ministers in observing a two-minute silence as a mark of homage to the victims of the tragedy. “Finish off this business, clean up the border areas,” was his directive to police and district officials during the review earlier, attended by DGP Dinkar Gupta and chief secretary Vini Mahajan, along with SSPs and DCs of the affected districts of Tarn Taran, Amritsar Rural and Gurdaspur, along with officials of the excise and taxation department. “This has to stop,” he said, adding that the illicit liquor business had been going on in border areas for a long time, with use of lahan, but now it had assumed an even more dangerous proportion with the new trend of smuggling from neighbouring states. Asserting that he wanted “to see an end to this whole business of spurious and illicit/smuggled liquor,” the chief minister directed the officials to be strict in dealing with criminals, whether men or women. Reiterating his government’s zero tolerance policy to illicit liquor and drugs, he asked the police to coordinate closely with the excise and other departments concerned. 10-DAY DEADLINE FOR EX GRATIA Pointing out that the victims were the poorest of the poor, Captain Amarinder set a 10-day deadline for the DCs and police officers to identify and process cases to provide targeted additional relief for their families. The chief minister has announced Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia compensation to the families of each of the victims of the tragedy, in which the toll stands at 113 at present, with several more under treatment, which is being provided free in hospitals. Tarn Taran deputy commissioner Kulwant Singh said his district had reported 84 deaths, with 13 people under treatment. Of these 13, six had been referred to Amritsar for eye treatment, while one was critical, he said. He said the Rs 2 lakh compensation would be disbursed on Thursday as verification had been completed. NGOs ROPED IN TO COUNSEL CHILDREN The Child Welfare Committee, along with NGOs, had been roped in to counsel the children of the affected families, including two siblings who had lost both parents, the DC said. Children of employable age will be assisted for self-employment, while widows will be given sewing machines and assistance to earn a livelihood. Amritsar DC Gurpreet Khaira said 15 deaths had been reported in his district, where all efforts were being made to provide immediate relief to the families.Gurdaspur DC Mohd Ishfaq said ration kits had been provided to the affected people and a drive had been launched to create awareness about consumption of liquor, with instructions to destroy any illicit liquor lying with them. Inspector general, border range, SPS Parmar, said cases had been registered under Section 304 of the IPC and the Excise Act, and a coordinated crackdown had been launched in all border areas. He suggested introduction of colour coding for ethanol and other spirits to check illegal sale/distribution of such products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-directs-dgp-to-book-those-directly-involved-in-hooch-tragedy-for-murder/story-2ZDAm6dPCeWn2tCx1lS3qM.html

Last year, in the first week of August the water level in four dams that provide drinking water to the city was 98 per cent. Almost all the four dams including Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar were full but this year hardly there is 37 per cent storage. Mohol said, “I took a review of the water storage. It is raining now in the catchment areas of the dams. It is expected that the dams would get enough water in the coming days. The festival season is ahead. Ganesh festival is important so it has been decided to not introduce any cut as yet.” Mohol said, “After the Ganesh festival, the PMC would take a review meeting and take a call whether there is a need to introduce water cuts. We are hoping for better rains in the coming days and there might not be a need to introduce the cut in the future. But one thing is clear that we need to use water carefully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-water-cut-in-pune-until-after-the-ganesh-festival/story-kExgRS4FqUEoec3hiAl21M.html

Police registered a case against two missing Covid-19 patients for negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life on the complaint of the district health department after they went untraced. Civil surgeon Dr Rajinder Kumar said that two persons who tested positive on August 1 were not found at their addresses when health teams visited to quarantine them. “One of the patients has boarded an international flight using an old Covid-19 test report. We have lodged a formal complaint with the police against them. We fear many people could have been exposed to the virus,” he said. District epidemiologist Dr Vikramjeet Singh said in the first information report that Charanjit Kaur of Laleana village in Faridkot was not found at her residence when health officials visited to quarantine her on August 1. “Her family members told the team that she has gone to Mansa for Rakhi celebrations, but she was not traced over there as well. According to our information, she had booked a ticket to travel outside India and she has left the village. She tested negative on July 24, but her latest sample tested positive on August 1. Despite testing positive, the patient cleverly used the old Covid-19 report to get clearance for her travel and boarded the flight,” he said. The police are yet to find out the country she has gone, however, sources claim she went to Hong Kong. In another FIR, the health officials claimed that Bimlesh Kumar, 22, of Kotkapura town is missing from his residence since he tested positive.

Ram spoke to Hindustan Times following the transfer order. You have got a posting in the PMO. When do you plan to take charge of the new assignment? I will possibly join within a week once the government relieves me here. I will follow all the instructions from the higher-ups . From district collector to PMO… is it not a big opportunity? It will be a good learning experience given that I will get to understand the bigger canvas in the prime minister’s office, which has the responsibility of the entire nation. Your current and previous experience will be useful there. Working on the field all these years was a great experience. It taught me many things and offered real experience. What was your experience of being district collector in Pune? There were multiple challenges here; right from handling the assembly and Lok Sabha polls, which happened during my tenure. The smooth and peaceful handling of the polls was extremely important. The Covid pandemic has you at the forefront here, and earlier there was the Bhima Koregaon anniversary also. Your experience? The Bhima Koregaon anniverary was an important challenge because of its sensitivity. Coordination among all officials helped us ensure a peaceful gathering there. About Covid, there are many efficient officials working in Pune to ensure smooth handling of this crisis. Without these officials, no single officer would have been able to tackle the situation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/real-on-the-field-experience-will-help-me-with-the-bigger-canvas-of-pmo-s-office-says-naval-kishore-ram/story-iRAg7U7SSmHn3MV89EJ0EL.html

Four Ayodhya, kars sevaks -- Vasudev Gupta, Ramesh Pandey, Rajendra Dharkar and Vishnu Gupta -- died in the police firing. Gupta and Pandey were married when they died and had children while Dharkar was newly married and had no children. Vishnu was unmarried and his parents left Ayodhya few years after the incident.Gayatri Pandey, wife of Ramesh Pandey, is a satisfied person now. “When my husband died, my four children were kids. Life became an ordeal. We lived in a rented house. As time passed, we learnt to face hardships,” said Gayatri. “But I used to wonder when my husband’s sacrifice will be justified with construction of Ram temple,” added Gayatri.“Now, when the PM is coming for temple bhumi pujan, I feel satisfied that my husband’s sacrifice has not been wasted,” pointed out Gayatri. Vasudev Gupta’s family also had to face a lot of hardships due to his untimely demise. His wife Annapurna and youngest son died long back after prolonged illness. Vasudev’s elder son Sandeep and two daughters are alive. All of them are married.“My father will rejoice in heaven after the bhumi pujan. Now, when Prime Minister is coming for the bhumi pujan there is no doubt whether Ram temple will be constructed or not,” said Sandeep. “My sisters and I are very happy that after 30 years, the sacrifice of our father has not gone in vain,” added Sandeep.Rajendra Dharkar’s elder brother Rajesh is a satisfied man now. “With the consent of all family members, Rajendra’s wife was remarried after his death as she was young when my brother passed away,” he said. “My parents passed away long back after Rajendra’s death. Now, I am satisfied that my brother’s sacrifice has not gone waste,” added Rajesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/for-family-of-kar-sevaks-who-died-in-firing-sacrifice-bears-fruit/story-uN3AgKPNXb2MhE5GNMfr2M.html

05-08-2020||Delhi||DU gung ho about final year open book exams; students rue||Delhi University, which conducted the first phase of online mock tests in July, has started with the second phase. The open book online mock examinations will be held till August 4. While some universities have exempted final year students owing to Covid 19 precautions, no such respite seems likely for DU students. Final year students who wrote the exams talk about the hurdles they faced and what they expect of the university. “Mock tests are a mockery. Political science students were given the question paper for Geography. Later, they covered it up saying that this was just for sample. The site on which you can’t upload simple documents weighing in KBs and that crashes on results day, how do you expect to upload megabytes of answer sheets,” questions Dishant Grewal, final year Political Science student at Kirori Mal College. Internet connectivity has been a matter of grave concern for outstation students who left for their hometowns. Benna Fathima, a final year Sociology student at Hindu College who went back to Kerala in March, says that during monsoon, there are frequent power cuts. “The electricity just goes off and there is no internet. The university has made provisions for students to go to a centre in case they can’t write from home, but I live in a containment zone. Where do I go? I have my exam on August 13, but I am hoping it gets cancelled or postponed, otherwise I am doomed,” she says.Read: Students should prepare for final year university exams: UGC to SCThe problem with online exams is not just technical; the build up to prepare has lead to anxiety for many. Priyanshi Singh, a final year History student at Miranda House, who gave her mock test on August 1 from her hometown Ayodhya, says that the question paper was different from the ones they were used to. “This question paper missed certain themes. We usually get eight themes, with an option to answer any four. This paper had six themes with an option to answer any three. Many of my friends don’t have a laptop and had to upload from their mobile phone. At first, it showed uploaded, but within 10 minutes, it showed error,” she says. Adding to their worries is the time limit in which they have to scan, upload, fill in details and answer the questions. “All this in three hours…do we write the answers or spend time filling in roll numbers on each side? It was very haphazard. I would like to dissociate myself from the OBEs. I spent my days in anxiety and it has taken a mental toll on many of us. Despite repeated petitions, there is no solution. We are helpless,” says Singh.Read: HC pulls up DU for lack of preparation regarding exams for differently abled studentsStudents from various colleges and courses have filed petitions requesting that exams be cancelled. With no assurance on a concrete course of action, they are unable to apply for further studies. “In the first phase, only around 26% of the students sat for the mocks. Many students went home, where they don’t even have proper internet connection. There is a time limit during which the link remains active. What do we do in these scenarios? We have written to the VC and the chancellor but to no avail,” says Ashish Lamba, final year student at Campus Law Centre.Till the time final year students are graded, they can’t apply for higher studies or jobs, creating a state of limbo. “I appeal that the exams be cancelled, and instead we are graded on our past performance, or given assignments. In any case, these are open book exams, so what difference does it make if we submit assignments,” says Mayank Madaan, final year B.Com student at Satyawati College.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-gung-ho-about-final-year-open-book-exams-students-rue/story-0L4iX0FEkSJP1hKG8nzD6J.html

05-08-2020||Delhi||Independence Day 2020: Wear your love for the nation on your face mask||Face masks have become an indispensible part of our lives, and an essential item that we just can’t afford to miss wearing. But this shouldn’t hamper the enthusiasm of any celebration, right? So as Independence Day (August 15) approaches, masks in patriotic themes and taglines have started ruling over social media. Manufacturers and sellers across platforms say that these cost between ₹10 and ₹550, and have gained instant popularity. Shohrab Siddiqui who’s marketing such masks on social media, says, “I’m getting a lot of queries for these. And as the day approaches, we are expecting the sales to be good. People love to flaunt such quirky things in pictures on I-Day.”Sales are good, says Delhi-based Ankit Takkar who has a store in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar. He has been delivering these masks in the vicinity. “Masks ab compulsory ho gaye hain aur har kisi ko pehnne zaruti hai. Independence Day aa raha hain toh celebration toh hota hi hai. So we thought this was a good idea that’ll help one to be safe, yet look good. It’s a single layer fabric mask. Mostly youngsters are buying and even kids, too. We have N95 Tiranga mask, too,” adds Takkar.Priya Sardana, from Winkadeal, is based out of Haryana and is delivering tricolour T-shirts with matching masks, across India. These have taglines such as ‘Mera Bharat Mahan’, ‘Happy Independence Day’, and ‘15 August’. Sardana explains, “These are priced at ₹550, and people are showing keen interest in them. Normally there is a good sale as many offices and societies organise events for Independence Day. However, due to the current situation of Covid-19, all those events are not expected, and this could result in less sales this year. Nonetheless, these things cannot affect patriotism of people. Thus, we are still receiving enquiries and many of our customers say that it’s the pride of this day which matters. So even if there is no event, they would love to wear these T-shirts and masks.” Ravi Raghav, from Faridabad, who is delivering tricolour masks across Delhi-NCR, says, “Through these masks, there will be an enthusiasm in people and at this time, people in the country need it. Corona has put everyone in a difficult scenario. On Independence Day, I want everyone to remember that day when our country became independent. The same enthusiasm we had then is needed now to defeat this virus. On this Independence Day, we can all prove that we are one and we can beat any virus together!”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/independence-day-2020-wear-your-love-for-the-nation-on-your-face-mask/story-YmTHMn3uhZYR5ROiT9Lw5I.html

05-08-2020||City||No headway in Panipat’s ‘triple murder’ case; SP seeks more time||Solving the alleged murder case of three Panipat boys seems a hard nut to crack for police as the officials associated with the investigation are still groping in the dark. Following pressure mounted by the members of Kashyap community after lathicharge on the kin of the deceased, Haryana home minister Anil Vij had handed over the investigation to Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Surender Singh Bhoria. The minister had sought a report within two days in connection with the recovery of bodies of three children from a canal in Panipat. The cop was also told to submit an interim report about the use of force on the family members and villagers in Panipat, who were protesting against the police ‘failure’ in arresting the ‘murder accused’.SP Bhoria, though, has submitted an interim report to the home minister’s office, he has sought more time to complete the investigation.“I have submitted the interim report and sought time for the investigation,” he said. “But, we are waiting for the viscera report, which is very crucial for the investigation,” he added. “We have also sought permission for a lie-detection test of people who have been accused by the victims’ family members,” he said. The SP has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under DSP Jagdeep Duhan, which has started the probe. The family members of the victims alleged that six boys had gone to a ‘bleach house’ near their village to bring thread for flying kites. While three returned home, the other three went missing, only to be found dead later. The kin had alleged that someone caught the boys in the bleach house and thrashed them.On their complaint, an FIR under the section of murder was also registered, which was followed by the constitution of an SIT to be headed by DSP Sandeep Kumar. The special probing team, however, failed to crack the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-headway-in-panipat-s-triple-murder-case-sp-seeks-three-week-s-time/story-mNzJI3V9owtxrgXaAocuZL.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meanwhile, in his little Kerala...||How lovely it would be to meet someone whose life hasn’t been altered by the coronavirus! A life that is still going on unhindered, as always, more or less.Well, then meet Suresh S Nair of Ambadi grocery store, in Gurugram’s Old Railway Road.“Yes, the business is the same as before,” he confirms, speaking on phone from his grocery shop. “No, I haven’t got the infection, nor any member of my family, nor anyone among my relatives.... coronavirus hasn’t touched me.”In spite of this happy fact, Mr Nair is being as careful as a grocer can be. “I’m nearing 60... I fear it would be dangerous for me to catch the corona.” His voice betrays no fear, as when one talks of calamities that only seem to happen in the news media, not in real life. The soft-spoken man reveals that he has abandoned his habit of taking a break in the afternoon and heading home in nearby Lakshmi Vihar for lunch. “Now, I tend to stay in one place for a long time rather than exposing myself to too many places and situations.” He gets the food from home.Unlike most other businesses, neighbourhood groceries have been spared of the collateral toll of the pandemic, Mr Nair observes. The kinds of things such modest establishments sell are used for daily consumption, which are needed in good times and bad. So, “shops like ours” were allowed to function during those many weeks when the city, as well as the country, were in a shutdown mode. Mr Nair played cautious even then. “I would open the shop for limited hours only.”But initially the little store did suffer from a hiccup, because of the nature of the business. The shop isn’t just any random grocery giving you yellow dal and brown dal. Mr Nair’s is a South Indian store specialising in food from Kerala as well as other southern states—he is himself from Pathanamthitta, the district in southern Kerala famous for the Sabarimala temple. Indeed, entering his shop is like stepping inside one of the most intimate aspects of a Kerala home, its kitchen pantry. There’s guruvayur pappadam, sacks of red rice, putt kadala lentils, garlic pickles and sachets of ginger coffee—he shows all of these on WhatsApp video. While the counter has at least one cluster of bananas hanging from the rope, just the way they are put up in roadside shacks throughout Kerala.The supply of these ingredients was briefly affected in the early days of the lockdown “and I couldn’t keep all stuff available at all time for my long-time customers.” Eventually, the goods trains started moving, Mr Nair says, and his shop was back to running smoothly on the tracks. As soon as he would get the stock replenished from Kerala, the gentleman would inform his customers, many of them fellow Malayalis, on WhatsApp. They would message him back with their shopping list and he would get the packages ready before summoning them to the grocery. “That way, nobody had to wait and gather in my shop and increase the risk of spreading the infection.”Now Mr Nair excuses himself—a customer has just turned up. He sells to him a good quantity of kappa, or tapioca, which he describes as “Kerala ki arbi.”Mr Nair speaks fluent Hindi. He has been living in the Delhi region since 1985 and initially resided in west Delhi’s Janakpuri “which is home to a lot many people from our Kerala.” A retired X-ray technician in a hospital, he opened the shop in 2011 and operates it all by himself. His wife is a technician in a veterinary lab and his daughter, a school teacher, is currently working from home.These days, Mr Nair feels that life is again becoming “normal for everyone.” He shuts down his store by 7pm (it was 9pm in the pre-corona era) and heads home on his scooty. Today, though, he will reach a bit later because “I’m delivering a stock of ponni chawal to a friend whose house falls on the way.” He, however, insists he doesn’t do home-delivery, fearing that on reading this dispatch, his customers might start badgering him into delivering stuff to their home, too.Later, on reaching his house, Mr Nair is photographed through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter.

05-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to soon screen patients for Covid-19 using voice samples, AI||After conducting antigen and antibody testing, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to diagnose citizens for Covid-19 on the basis of their sound waves. By the next week, the civic body will commence the non-invasive voice analysis of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients at the NESCO jumbo Covid-19 centre in Goregaon. The results of the analysis can indicate the presence of the virus in 30 seconds, and those testing positive, will undergo a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test to confirm if they are infected. Using artificial intelligence, Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital, which is run by the civic body, will conduct the study on 2,000 patients at the centre. RT-PCR is considered the gold standard test for diagnosing Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – but the result through this testing method takes more than eight hours. In contrast, a rapid antigen test can give results within 30 minutes, but this method can give a higher rate of false negatives according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). As lockdown restrictions have eased, civic officials said economic alternatives are required to rapidly and accurately diagnose the cases of Covid-19. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nair Dental Hospital, who is in-charge of the NESCO facility, said that though the concept of diagnosing patients through their sound waves is new, several countries such as the United States of America and Israel are using it. When the symptoms of Covid-19 manifest, a patient starts developing breathing problems, which affects the amount of air exhaled, thereby interacting with inflamed muscles on its journey to generate voices or speeches. These interactions impact voice modulations—measurable qualities that form the basis of their biomarkers. Depending on its variations, an individual can be detected with Covid-19, said Dr Andrade. “There is a voice application which can be installed on phones or laptops. The suspected patient will be asked to count a few numbers before the device, similar to conducting a breath analyser test. The voice sample will automatically get synced with the main server of the provider. Then, through artificial intelligence, the result will be procured within 30 seconds,” said Dr Andrade. The app will analyse voices of three types of individuals — suspected, positive and negative patients. Depending on their vocal biomarkers (VB), they will be diagnosed. For example, if a person’s VB is below the standard point (0.5), the person will be considered as negative. But if anyone records VB above it, the person will be considered a suspected patient and undergo RT-PCR test for a confirmed result. “As the technology is in the initial stage, we need to cross-check its results. So even if a person tests negative, he/she will have to undergo voice analysis to check the authenticity of the technology. It will take two-three months to conclude the study,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Cooper hospital, which has been given the responsibility of conducting the study, is yet to get the final nod from its ethical committee. “We are hoping to get it in a day or two,” added Kakani. Dr KK Agarwal, a cardiologist and former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “For centuries, doctors have relied on sound beats of the heart to detect a person through a stethoscope. Now, the same technique can be used to screen suspected Covid-19 patients. This technology may be new but is being widely used across the globe.” Medical experts believe that this technique can help detect people faster and earlier, especially when the BMC is planning to open up theatres, malls and restaurants. “We have seen that people often pop in fever suppressants to avoid getting detected. Later, they spread the virus to more people. But this technique, which is completely non-invasive, can detect infected people easily especially at railway stations and airports,” added Dr Andrade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-soon-screen-patients-for-covid-19-using-voice-samples-ai/story-O9f8bhGJaXvUU10XlTtQZI.html

05-08-2020||Mumbai||Despite heavy rain alert, malls in Mumbai to reopen today||Though the heavy rainfall warning issued for the city for Wednesday is likely to play spoilsport, owners of malls and shopping complexes have decided to reopen the establishments after more than four months, as per the civic body’s directives. On Monday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) released a circular, allowing malls and shopping complexes to remain open from Wednesday, between 9am and 7pm. However, theatres, restaurants and food courts are yet to get the nod from the civic body to remain open. The kitchen of restaurants in food courts can, however, operate for home delivery through aggregators. A spokesperson for Phoenix Marketcity, Kurla, and Palladium and High Street Phoenix, Lower Parel, said, “We plan to open tomorrow [Wednesday] as per schedule, provided rain does not play a spoilsport. Phoenix has planned a number of precautionary measures for customers as well as for the staff amid the Covid-19 outbreak. However, we are unsure how many customers will visit the mall because of the rain.” Malls are gearing up to reopen and will implement safety measures such as checking temperatures of customers with thermal cameras or scanners, using ultraviolet scanners to disinfect bags at the entrance, placing hand and shoe sanitisers at various points in the mall, conducting periodic disinfection of the mall premises, sanitasation of washrooms and marking floors outside retail shops that witness overcrowding to ensure social distancing, asking all customers to mandatorily download Aarogya Setu mobile application on entering. Some malls also made rooms for staffers and customers showing Covid-19 symptoms to isolate them until medical workers reach the spot. There are also provisions for first aid kits and digital payment options. Ambulances will be on standby, along with doctors on call. Kunal Varshan, owner, Atria Mall, said, “We are opening on Wednesday as per schedule. Retail stores in the mall will remain open. Despite the heavy rainfall alert, we have decided to open as the alert was published last week. To ensure safety of customers, we will take steps such as thermal scanning at entrance, disinfection of the premises and washrooms every two hours, and have placed hand sanitisers at various points. Social distancing norms will be followed even in elevators and on escalators.” Many malls have also installed sensor-based taps, soap dispensers and drinking water spouts in washrooms and automated parking ticket dispensers, even as provisions are made for sensor-based lift operations. Sachin Dhanawade, chief operating officer (COO), retail and real estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Limited, which operates Growel’s 101 mall at Kandivli, said, “We have installed UV lights in the baggage scanners and thermal cameras to track the movement of customers throughout the mall premises ensuring that the rule of one person per 75 square foot, is mandated. From entry to exit, all touch points in the mall have been made contactless such as automation of the parking entry ticket dispenser and contactless digital payments for parking, QR-code-based food ordering for take-away, sensor-based contactless lift operations, contactless soap dispensers, sensor-based taps and contactless water spouts.” This is the second time that plans to reopen the city as a part of the state’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative is seeing roadblocks. On June 5, owners of shops and markets were hesitant to reopen their establishments despite permissions owing to Cyclone Nisarga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-heavy-rain-alert-malls-in-mumbai-to-reopen-today/story-KHF6Q6TJsJtdyvm3CvuDhN.html
05-08-2020||City||Navi Mumbai civic body gets its own Covid testing lab, set to acquire 200 ICU beds and 80 ventilators||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Dr DY Patil Hospital, Nerul, for 200 fully-equipped intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 80 ventilators. The beds will be made available for free of cost for patients. Currently, NMMC has 202 ICU beds and 93 ventilators.  The MoU was signed between municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar and Dr Rahul Peddawad, chief executive officer of DY Patil Hospital. Bangar said, “This agreement will give us additional beds. Patients occupying these beds will not be charged as the treatment charges will be borne by NMMC. The beds will be made available in four phases, with 50 beds in each phase, starting from August 10 to September 10. This arrangement will go a long way in our mission to reduce the death rate in Navi Mumbai.” Until Tuesday, the city saw 18,141 cases of Covid-19, including 468 deaths. Meanwhile, the corporation also started its own testing lab, which can conduct 1,000 tests each day. The state-of-the-art lab will give provide results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCMR) tests in 24 hours. The civic body plans to use the lab to conduct tests for other diseases, after the Covid-19 outbreak ends. “The infrastructure for the lab was set-up, and we were only waiting for approval from ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research]. We got the required approval and conducted 1,000 tests on the very first day. We expect the testing in the city to increase manifold. While the lab will at present be used for Covid 19 tests, in the future, it will also be used for hepatitis, swine flu, leptospirosis, HIV and other molecular tests,” said Bangar. As the civic body did not have its own lab until Tuesday, it had to depend on other government and private labs for tests, leading to great delay in getting the results. “Within two days after I took charge, we started conducting rapid antigen tests that give results in 30 minutes. We now have 22 rapid antigen testing centres, which conduct around 2,500 tests,” Bangar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-civic-body-gets-its-own-covid-testing-lab-set-to-acquire-200-icu-beds-and-80-ventilators/story-StIfWS5lzuusYdaTQNQZRI.html
05-08-2020||City||Sixth accused held in fake e-pass racket in Mumbai||The crime branch on Tuesday arrested 31-year-old Abhijit Pawar, a contractual worker at the Thane collector’s office in connection with the fake e-pass racket. Earlier, the crime branch had arrested five people for providing citizens with fake e-passes and medical certificates for ₹3,000 to travel outside the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during the lockdown . Pawar, along with Samir Chaudhary, his colleague from the collector’s office, Abdul Karim Mohammad Shaikh; Samir Shamsuddin Shaikh, Noor Mohammad Abdul Gani Shaikh and Vinay Mohan Pate have sold 400-500 fake police e-passes to citizens. Pawar’s arrest comes days after the officers from crime branch’s unit 3 busted the racket on July 25 and arrested Shaikh, Samir, Noor and Pate. The police received a tip-off about a gang which had been duping citizens who wanted to travel to other districts in the state from MMR. During inquiry, the police discovered that the accused were operating from Malvan and would send the e-passes from there to citizens on WhatsApp or email. The numbers of their mobile phones were registered on locations in Delhi. An officer then approached Shaikh posing as a customer and asked for an e-pass to travel to Satara from Mumbai. After receiving the pass, a police team went to Malvan and arrested Shaikh, Samir and Noor, while Pate was arrested from his home in Vasai. The police also seized a laptop, mobile phones and several fake passes from the accused. During the inquiry, the police discovered that Chaudhary was the head of the information technology department of the collector’s office (rural wing), from where the e-passes are issued to citizens by authorities. “He knew the login details of the system and shared it with Pawar, who issued the passes to citizens with the help of other four accused,” said police inspector Nitin Patil of crime branch unit 3. On July 29, the police arrested Chaudhary and based on his statement, they arrested Pawar .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sixth-accused-held-in-fake-e-pass-racket-in-mumbai/story-06oK7qMeui8gqUkMpvgMrJ.html

The association has given a list of demands including deferment of motor insurance, subsidised fuel rates, vehicle sanitisation, increasing the age limit of school buses from eight to 20 years, increasing the capacity of school buses, the experience of five years for bus drivers to be abolished if the driver has a heavy vehicle licence and parking facilities for school buses. “We are staring at a bleak situation, as the schools are closed for many months. Simultaneously, bus owners have not received the transportation fees for the academic year ending May 2020,” said Anil Garg, president, School Bus Owner Association.“Majority of the bus crew members especially bus drivers are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Karnataka. Most of them have gone back to their home towns, amid the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. We are not sure whether they will be back to serve after the school reopens. If this continues, there will be a massive shortage of drivers and cleaners and it will be very difficult to operate school buses. We would seek government intervention to provide some support to the bus owners and staff members to bring them out of this crisis.” Garg said.Similar demands on providing financial aid to drivers and waving of vehicle interest for autorickshaws and black and yellow taxis have been raised by Autorickshaw and black and yellow taxi unions in the city.“We have also sought financial aid of ₹10,000 per month to the drivers during the lockdown,” said AL Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximen’s Union. Meanwhile, both autorickshaw and taxi unions have asked for an increase in minimum fares. Taxi unions have asked to increase minimum fare from ₹22 to ₹25 and the same for autorickshaws from ₹18 to ₹22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-financial-aid-to-school-bus-drivers-association/story-KfrVW87K5wtkErFQP7f7hI.html

The three-month period will make it easier for smaller companies to also participate in the bids.” MSRDC is looking for a contractor for the three-month period even on the Katai and Gove toll plaza on the Bhiwandi-Kalyan-Shilphata Highway.MSRDC had invited bids for toll-management of BWSL after MSRDC’s contract with the previous concessionaire, MEP Infrastructure Developers, expired in January 2020. MSRDC is expected to collect toll for the sea-link that was opened in 2009 till 2052 with revision in rates every three years. It was last revised in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bwsl-toll-msrdc-looks-for-a-3-month-toll-operator/story-qFOT3sN8toYTNGdayXywHO.html

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Kharar, Pal Singh said, “Bajwa will be produced in the consumer court on Wednesday. A non-bailable warrant was issued against him.”In its judgment in December last year, the consumer court had directed the complainant, Naseeb Kaur of Kharar, to place on record the list of properties of the accused along with an affidavit to initiate further proceedings. Kaur had mentioned in the complaint that Bajwa was dealing in sale, purchase and development of residential as well as commercial properties. She had alleged that she sold around 12 kanal of land to Bajwa’s firm on March 17, 2018. In return, he gave her 15 post-dated cheques of ₹4.95 lakh each. When Kaur presented these cheques, they were returned unpaid, with the reason, “exceeds arrangement”.Bajwa was even declared a proclaimed offender in August last year and again in February this year.

05-08-2020||Mumbai||Ram temple bhoomipujan: Shiv Sena to keep it low-key||Left out of the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on Wednesday, the Shiv Sena will hold muted celebrations to mark the event, considering it has partnered with secular parties in Maharashtra to form the government and also because of the restriction on public gathering due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In the run-up to the bhoomipujan, party leaders have been recounting and enlisting party and its workers’ contribution and sacrifice in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.With the BJP not yielding an inch of the credit for the temple in Ayodhya, the Sena is working at keeping its core identity, Hindutva, intact.  The party has put up hoardings across the city welcoming the construction of the Ram temple with slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’. A giant hoarding with a picture of Lord Ram, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Sena founder Bal Thackeray, in the city has been put up with a phrase, ‘Saheb’s roar, dream fulfilment of Hindus’, followed by ‘Jai Shri Ram’. Another such hoarding had the slogan: ‘Advent of Ram Rajya, fulfilment of dreams’, followed by a slogan hailing Lord Ram.The party had planned low-key celebrations in city’s wards, but they were later put off on account of the Covid-19 situation. Party leaders said no invitation for Thackeray is viewed as a positive step as it would have been complicated matters for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. “There is no official celebration or an event planned by the party. On a local level, people may do something in their homes to mark the bhoomipujan. After all, Lord Ram is for everyone and not one political party. Given the Covid-19 scenario, it was not possible to plan anything officially,” said a Shiv Sena MP, requesting anonymity. Meanwhile, Sena legislator Dilip Lande has planned sweet distribution, Mahaaarti in Ram temple, and puja in the 10 Shiv Sena Shakhas that fall under Chandivli Assembly constituency on Wednesday. “There will be a mahaaarti in a Ram Temple, followed by firing crackers and sweet distribution. We are also going to felicitate a few kar sevaks, who Balasaheb said he took immense pride in,” Lande said.Even though the Sena chief will not remain present in Ayodhya, Sena corporator from Mira-Bhayander, Vikram Pratap Singh, took the soil from the place where Sena founder Bal Thackeray was cremated to the temple town in Uttar Pradesh. “We are sainiks [soldiers] of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav ji Thackeray and have come here with the pious soil from the Smriti Sthal of Balasaheb Thackeray. It was Balasaheb’s dream that a grand temple of Lord Ram be constructed in Ayodhya and it is getting recognised,” Singh said. Singh along with the Shiv Sainiks who have accompanied him plan to light 492 diyas (lamps) on the banks of river Saryu and also hand over the soil to the head of the temple trust. On the eve of the bhoomipujan for the Ram temple at Ayodhya, Shiv Sainiks recounted the call of Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray around three decades ago to perform kar seva, at the height of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, as a “once-in-a-lifetime experience”. Twenty-eight years later, the Shiv Sena, which started with Hindutva as its core agenda, has snapped ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party and joined hands with secular parties to head the government in Maharashtra. The party leadership, however, maintains they have not abandoned Hindutva. After the entry of Thackeray scion Aaditya in the functioning of the party and the subsequent alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, the Sena was said to have gone soft on its Hindutva agenda by their political opponents and political observers. Shiv Sena leader and former Lok Sabha MP Chandrakant Khaire, however, said, “Hindutva is our identity.” Sena party union chief Suryakant Mahadik added, “If you ask people which of the two parties-- BJP or Sena --is a staunch Hindutvawadi party, they will say Shiv Sena. We are still Hindutavawadi.” Sena deputy leader Vishwanath Nerurkar attacked the BJP and PM Narendra Modi for ignoring the contribution of BJP stalwarts, including LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. “Advani did the Rath Yatra that stirred people’s emotions, but he is not there. Only PM Modi will be seen. What right do they have to claim credit for it? What has the temple got to do with politicians? Instead, the bhoomipujan should have been done at the hands of Shankaracharya. This is politics,” Nerurkar, who was then a Sena corporator, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ram-temple-bhoomipujan-shiv-sena-to-keep-it-low-key/story-wMc1kvpRczhpAJNfH62M9H.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh hospitals restrict normal delivery service for women from outside||The hospitals under the UT administration have restricted normal delivery services for women living outside the city jurisdictions as a measure to check the spread of Covid-19.Chandigarh has five hospitals that cater to the needs of pregnant women, right from antenatal check-ups to childbirth procedures, from across the tricity. The occupancy rate of such wards is almost always 100% at any given time.Hospitals in the city, especially the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, have time and again called for a proper referral protocol for any type of admission or emergency case from the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab.The authorities from the UT and the neighbouring states had also recently met to discuss the issue of “improper referrals” from the states which in turn increased the rush in hospitals here. The authorities had decided that nodal officers will be appointed for the seamless transfer of patients.Dr BS Chavan, director-cum-principal, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, said the steps taken to restrict normal deliveries had been taken to stop the infection spread. “It is a temporary arrangement. If the same facilities are available in the neighbouring cities, people should prefer those. We will deal with serious and complicated cases, which come from any area. But for normal procedures, districts should take responsibility. Also, there is more chance of exposure to infection to patients here,” he said.A senior health officer from Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, said there had been a few cases in the past where the women tested positive after childbirth and the staff had to be quarantined.UT health secretary, Arun Gupta, said though no such decision [in this regard] had been taken at the highest level, it would not be wrong for the hospitals to restrict normal services. “If the same procedure can be conducted in district hospitals of Panchkula and Mohali, they should be used.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-hospitals-restrict-normal-delivery-service-for-women-from-outside/story-CXHeMYaySIzOTAmYyLYDWM.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court asks Centre to examine possibility of using refurbished ventilators from abroad||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Centre to examine whether refurbished used ventilators procured by a Punjab firm can be put to use. “We prime facie feel that in case, the aforesaid ventilators are put to use, it may be of help to some serious patients. A copy of the report be supplied to Mr Jain (additional solicitor general, Satya Pal Jain) to enable him to seek instructions, particularly, since it is a matter of saving lives of critical patients,” the bench of justice Rajan Gupta and justice Karamjit Singh said while acting on an expert panel report on use of these ventilators. The court has acted on a plea of SB Medical Systems, a Punjab firm, which had approached high court in June, after its consignment of 32 used ventilators imported from United States of America, was not released by customs authorities. The firm had argued that soon after Covid-19 outbreak, the Centre had allowed the import of used ventilators following which the firm placed an order. They said they had also sought necessary approval from the state and the central governments. However, by the time the consignment came, the Centre withdrew the notification, the court was told. It was further stated that the Kerala and Karnataka governments had already allowed use of these ventilators and it was only in this case that the consignment was not being released. The government, during the hearing had expressed its reservation on the efficacy of the ventilators. Acting on the plea, the high court on July 15 had sought an expert opinion of doctors’, which, in its report on Tuesday, opined that the “32 used ventilators are of reputed brands and were found to be in working condition. However, they may be put to use subject to certification of disinfection, effectiveness and assured maintenance by the refurbished company.” The panel was headed by director, department of medical education and research, Punjab, Dr Avnish Kumar.Besides directions to Centre, the court has also asked Punjab government’s counsel as to which authority can certify regarding disinfection and effectiveness. Meanwhile, the firm too has been asked to submit a certificate of disinfecting the ventilators and assuring the effectiveness and maintenance. The matter will come up for further hearing on August 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-asks-centre-to-examine-possibility-of-using-refurbished-ventilators-from-abroad/story-6HtwgR6PqUuhf9zKIeQ5AL.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Two Asha workers, cop among 5 held for child trafficking in Chandigarh; 2 newborns rescued||With the arrest of two Asha workers from Punjab on Tuesday, Chandigarh Police unearthed a child trafficking racket going on in the city.The duo arrested with three others, including a police constable, had been selling newborns picked up from different districts of Punjab to families in Chandigarh. Police even rescued a two-day-old boy who was about to be sold to a decoy customer. Another newborn, an 11-day-old girl, who was sold for ₹1 lakh to a city-based couple on July 28 was also rescued. Both children were handed over to the Childline NGO. The accused were identified as Bhawna, 32, of Sector 45; Asha workers Kuldeep Kaur, 32, of Jahlan village in Patiala and Sarabjit Kaur, 40, of Mimsa village in Dhuri; health worker Mandeep Singh, 35, of Zalal Diwal village in Ludhiana; and Punjab Police constable Amarjit Singh, 29, of Shivjot Enclave, Mohali, who was deployed as driver to the station house officer, Balongi.For the last three days, the accused were in touch with the complainant, a businessman in Sector 37, Ravinder Kumar, who posed as a customer for purchase of two babies — a male and a female.He was asked to meet them in Sangrur or Jalandhar.On Monday night, when the accused arrived at the airport light point in Amarjit’s car, they were held. Amarjit, who was behind the wheel, claimed he was helping his neighbour Bhawna.The accused were produced before the court and remanded to seven-day police custody. A case under Sections 370 (trafficking of persons), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code was registered.Kuldeep and Sarabjit were responsible for arranging newborn babies. “The Asha workers were involved in tracing pregnant women in Punjab and helping them through pregnancy. Taking advantage of their situation, the two would either steal the child or convince parents to sell it,” said Paramjit Kaur, station house officer, Sector 31.A male child was sold for ₹4 lakh while a female would sell for ₹1 lakh. The accused sold three children in Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi, and had sold the fourth one only last week. “We are looking into the role of other Asha workers involved in the racket,” said the SHO.Bhawna, who had earlier worked as a matchmaker, had also gotten involved in trafficking. Her role was to strike deals with the clients in Chandigarh. Accused Mandeep would find prospective buyers in different districts of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-asha-workers-cop-among-5-held-for-child-trafficking-in-chandigarh-2-newborns-rescued/story-cYjhp0yEjfgXT5xB8oC9vK.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Barring emergency, no surgery for 15 days in Punjab govt hospitals||Amid a spate of Covid-19 cases in the state in the past few days, the Punjab health department has ordered all civil surgeons to postpone all surgeries, except medical emergency cases, for the next 15 days. The decision was taken amid reports that specialist doctors were performing all sorts of surgeries that can be avoided for a few days and were citing it as a reason not to join Covid-19 related duties. “The increase in the number of cases will require services of more healthcare staff. Keeping this in view, you are hereby requested to postpone the elective surgeries in all government healthcare facilities so that the staff is available for Covid-19 duties,” read a letter sent to all civil surgeons by the director, health and family welfare. Elective surgery is a procedure scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. The order says it must be ensured that emergency and trauma services are provided without interruption. “All the staff that would assist these doctors in elective surgeries have also been asked to be put on Covid-related duties immediately,” an official said. Also, the health department has issued orders to rural pharmacy officers to perform Covid-19 duties or face action. “All rural pharmacy officers have been asked to work under the civil surgeons to perform Covid-19 duties. But civil surgeons have brought to my notice that some officers are still not reporting to them. They should immediately report to the civil surgeons concerned and explanation would be sought from those not following the orders,” read a letter by additional chief secretary (health and family welfare).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/barring-emergency-no-surgery-for-15-days-in-punjab-govt-hospitals/story-GPwfYWIUPV6y7RWtJvKV5J.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s GST inflow in April-July 38% short of last year’s mop-up||The Punjab government has suffered a dent of 38% in its gross goods and services tax (GST) collection in the first four months of the current fiscal due to the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. The state’s GST mop-up, including state GST (SGST) and integrated GST (IGST), for the April-July period was Rs 2,644 crore as against Rs 4,252 crore during the corresponding months of the previous year, according to the latest data shared by the taxation department. The dip of Rs 1,608 crore in GST collections as compared to financial year 2019 is primarily of account of revenue loss during April and May this year when the state was under total lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus with curfew in place. Against a collection of Rs 2,084 crore in the first two months of financial year 2019, the state government got merely Rs 717 crore, or say 63% less, between April 1 and May 31 this year. The revenue had taken a nosedive of 86% at the start of the year as curfew was imposed in Punjab on March 23, falling from Rs 1,086 crore in April 2019 to merely Rs 156 crore this time. May’s collections were better but marginally at Rs 515 crore against last year’s Rs 998 crore before picking up further in the subsequent two months.27% JUMP IN REVENUE FROM JUNE Unlike the all-India GST revenue which saw a 3.8% drop in July as compared to the previous month, the state posted an increase of 27%. The inflow rose to Rs 1,103 crore from Rs 870 crore in June, indicating stability in collections as economic activity is picking up in more and more sectors during the unlocking process, even though it is still 9.26% lower than the GST mop-up of Rs 1,216 crore in the same month of the previous year. A taxation official said the collections for these months could include some tax returns for previous months also as relief was provided to taxpayers in furnishing of returns for the months of February, March and April 2020 in view of the pandemic. Commissioner, taxation, Nilkanth S Avhad said there is some recovery due to revival of economy but there is still a long way to go. DIP IN REVENUE WORRIES GOVT The shortfall has got the state government worried even though its monthly GST revenue is protected at Rs 2,503 crore for this year. Under the new indirect tax regime, the states have been guaranteed a 14% year-on-year growth in their GST revenue over the financial year 2015-16 base and they are to be compensated by the central government for any shortfall. “The centre is to give compensation to the state government for the GST revenue gap of Rs 4,335 crore in first two months (April and May 2020) which became due in June,” a state official said requesting anonymity. The compensation, which is given bimonthly, for June and July is estimated to be approximately Rs 3,000 crore as per advance tax collection figures and will become due this month. However, there is anxiety in the state government after the finance ministry indicated to a parliamentary panel that it may not be in a position to pay the promised compensation this year. The state government, in a letter last week, raised its objections, reminding the centre of its innumerable assurances for assured compensation. Punjab has been among the states reporting the highest shortfall in the GST revenue collection in the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-gst-inflow-in-april-july-38-short-of-last-year-s-mop-up/story-Qy5olf5xg9UzBcGYfjiRfM.html
05-08-2020||Chandigarh||‘Ultra heat treated milk plant to come up at Rohtak’||The Haryana government plans to set up an ultra heat treated (UHT) milk tetra pack plant at Rohtak at a cost of ₹19.55 crore. The national dairy development board has been requested to prepare a detailed project report. UHT milk has a longer shelf life, particularly during summers. ACS, cooperation, Sanjeev Kaushal, said bulk milk coolers would also be provided to the co-op societies throughout Haryana. This would help ensure improvement in milk quality. These projects were announced by CM Manohar Lal Khattar during his 2020-21 budget speech, he said. Kaushal said a new milk plant with latest technology and capacity of three to five lakh litres per day (LPD) was also proposed to be established in southern Haryana. This would cover the national capital region, he said. The NDDB would submit a detailed project report and the search for land for the plant is going on. He said the Dairy Development Federation was also supplying sweetened flavoured skimmed milk powder to the elementary education department as part of their midday meal scheme, three days a week, which had recently been increased to six days a week. With the schools not functioning during the lockdown, the state government had decided to provide dry rations to students. About 600 metric tonnes of skimmed milk powder in 500 gram packs has been supplied for May and June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ultra-heat-treated-milk-plant-to-come-up-at-rohtak/story-0mMXlsuSRBDro9eG0kjjHO.html
05-08-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad: NIA custody of Hany Babu extended till August 7||A special court on Tuesday extended the National Investigating Agency’s (NIA) custody of Hany Babu MT, 54, an associate professor in the department of English at Delhi University, till August 7. The NIA claimed Babu, arrested by the agency on July 28 in connection with the Elgar Parishad case, was in touch with people connected to Manipur-based insurgent group Kangleipak Communist Party – Military Council (KCP-MC). Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty made several statements, claiming Babu’s links with the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist). On Tuesday, as Babu’s custody ended, the agency produced him before the court and sought his further custody. The agency said, “During investigation, it is revealed that the accused was in contact with one Paikhomba Meitei, secretary information and publicity, military affairs, KCP-MC, an organisation banned under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.” The agency told the court that the data recovered from Babu showed that Meithei had shared an interview of former general secretary of CPI (Maoist), Muppala Lakshman Rao, alias Ganapathi. The agency also claimed that Babu was actively involved in raising funds to help Maoists, for their release from prison. “Accused, along with arrested accused, were involved in highlighting the issue of arrest and subsequent conviction of GN Saibaba, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for his links with CPI (Maoist),” the agency told the court. The agency claimed that the accused was using various social media accounts for communication with other co-accused, suspects as well as other members and sympathisers of CPI (Maoist). “During the investigation of the present case, near about 1.26 lakh emails were recovered from the accused’s email, which is under process of scrutiny,” the agency claimed. The plea was opposed by Babu’s lawyer Susan Abraham, along with advocate Nilesh Ukey, on the grounds that the accused has cooperated with the investigating agency. The court did not accept the objection and extended Babu’s custody with NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-nia-custody-of-hany-babu-extended-till-august-7/story-8aKOUwA9W0wytRn5nOddiK.html
05-08-2020||Mumbai||Highest one-day spike: State records 12,326 Covid-19 recoveries||Maharashtra on Tuesday reported its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 recoveries at 12,326, taking the count to 299,356 (65.37% recovery rate).The state on Tuesday reported 300 Covid-19 deaths, second-highest jump in fatalities, to take the toll to 16,142, while it recorded 7,760 new infections, including Mumbai’s second-lowest spike (709) since May 12, when it recorded just 426 cases. The state’s case tally touched 457,956, including 142,151 active cases. Pune district retained its top position in daily infections with 2,207 cases, including 1,296 in Pune city, 326 in rural parts of the district and 585 in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Pune district saw 56 more deaths (29 in city, 10 in rural parts and 17 in Pimpri-Chinchwad), while Mumbai reported the same number of fatalities in the past 24 hours. Kolhapur reported 40 deaths (including 11 in the city), Bhiwandi-Nizampur registered 16 and Nagpur saw 17 deaths. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) reached 3.52%, which is much above the national rate of 2.11% The state conducted 53,324 tests in a day, taking the total tests conducted so far to 23,52,047 and the cumulative positivity rate to 19.47%. The state’s recovery rate has improved over the past two weeks. A total of 69,869 patients recovered in the last seven days, at the rate of 9,981 patients a day, against the 63,913 infections during this period. The recovery rate has improved to 65.37% from 59.34 % a week ago on July 28 and 55.72% on July 21. The national rate was 65.77%, as of Monday. According to an official from the health department, apart from keeping the infection in check, they have been focusing on reducing the fatality rate. “We have been aggressively tracking and testing the contacts. At same time, we want to improve the recovery rate as we have now ramped up our health infrastructure and have been tracking patients fast to ensure early referral to the hospital. Although Maharashtra has the highest number of cases in the country, our aim is to reduce the number of active cases,” the official said. Dr Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president of Indian Medical Institute, said that the figures of the recovery of patients are deceptive. “All discharged patients cannot be termed as recovered. The full recovery from the infection is done after 14 days or in some cases they need 21 days. Patients recovering at home also are counted as fully recovered. In Thane city, private hospitals were given a target of daily discharge, which we opposed. Having said this, it is also true that the recovery rate in the state is improving.”An area of concern for the state government is the rising spread in the rural parts of the districts, like Pune, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Latur, Solapur. When the urban parts of these districts were reporting reduction in cases, its rural parts showed a surge in cases over the past few days. Dr Bhondve said the number of cases in rural areas was increasing because of migration of people after unlocking, weak infrastructure, failure of local administration to ramp up the facilities and shortage of the health workers and doctors.Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said, “There will be a drastic drop in cases in rural areas, too, soon. Our strategy has been aggressive tracing, testing and ramping up of health infrastructure. It has worked well across the state and will help us in containing the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highest-one-day-spike-state-records-12-326-covid-19-recoveries/story-0YV7KBos4MgjRBH7sop29O.html
05-08-2020||Mumbai||State department to investigate illegal fishing practices||The state fisheries department on Tuesday initiated an investigation and called for action regarding unauthorised fishing practices affecting rare and endangered marine species along the Maharashtra coastline.The fisheries commissioner ordered the inquiry based on a report by marine biologists from the Mangrove Foundation (under the state mangrove cell), which documented how unsustainable fishing practices, excessive juvenile by-catch, and illegal shark fin trade were leading to a rapid decline of threatened, vulnerable, and critically-endangered sharks and allied species.HT had reported the details on Monday, elucidating how such practices along seven commercially important landing sites, including three in Mumbai, with high-density of elasmobranch (sharks, skates, rays, and sawfish) population, were leading to overall habitat degradation at fishing grounds. “In view of the seriousness of the matter highlighted by national and regional media, I have called for a detailed investigation across all 173 marine fish landing centres across seven Konkan districts as well as inspections to be undertaken at markets,” said Atul Patne, state fisheries commissioner, adding, “Strict action needs to be taken against fishing boats, sellers, buyers, and boat owners under the Maharashtra Marine Fisheries Regulation Act, 1981, and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, for unauthorised capture and sale of rare and endangered elasmobranch species. Reports on action taken have been called for at the earliest.”The fisheries department plans to set up an enforcement cell and increase manpower to address the issue. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the assistant commissioner of fisheries (ACF) is empowered to take action for the protection of rare and endangered marine species. “We have reiterated this in an order issued on Tuesday,” said Patne. “Presently, the department is facing a staff crunch with more than 60% vacancy, with 23 licensing officers managing 173 landing centres. Even if the ACF manages to track down cases, he is unable to prepare the required documents, present submissions in court, and track investigations.”Patne said that along with additional manpower, he plans to rope in non-government bodies or marine respondent groups involved in curbing such violations (sagar rakshaks) to assist his staff. “If shark fin trade is operational in the domestic circuit, it will be tracked to the source, and we will identify how it is operating,” he said.The Mangrove Foundation report also identified a fish landing centre at Satpati in Palghar, where the capture of eight shark species, including some part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, saw their fins removed and kept out to dry.Shark fishing is not illegal in India. However, catching 10 species protected under the Wildlife Act is prohibited and considered illegal. Shark fin import and export was banned by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 2015.The mangrove cell study identified 34 elasmobranch species – 14 sharks, 15 rays, and five species of wedges, sawfish and guitarfish – being caught across Satpati, Sassoon Dock, New Ferry Wharf, and Versova in Mumbai; Alibag in Raigad, Harnai in Ratnagiri, and Malvan in Sindhudurg. Of these, 24 species each fell under the vulnerable, endangered, and near-threatened categories of the IUCN Regional Red List, while one species of guitarfish (schedule I under WPA) was critically endangered. Eighteen of the 34 species caught were juvenile elasmobranchs.“We appreciate that the fisheries department has taken cognisance of the report. If such a study has made any contribution towards marine conservation, it has achieved its purpose,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-department-to-investigate-illegal-fishing-practices/story-67lpuss4jHhUHqxvhobClK.html
05-08-2020||Mumbai||No link to Sushant Singh Rajput death, stop dirty politics, says Aaditya Thackeray||Shiv Sena leader and state minister of tourism and environment Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday described the rumours linking him to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput as “dirty politics” by the Opposition. The 30-year-old minister said in a statement released on social media that he is not connected to Rajput’s death, which was declared a suicide in the post mortem report and is the subject of an ongoing investigation by Mumbai Police. Meanwhile, the state government has reiterated that it is opposed to transferring the probe into the circumstances surrounding Rajput’s death to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On Tuesday, Thackeray issued a strongly-worded statement in Marathi, in which he said the rumours linking him to Rajput, who died by suicide on June 14, are “mudslinging” by the Opposition. “Those who are pricked by the success and popularity of the Maharashtra government have started dirty politics over the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. Unnecessary mudslinging is going on at me and the Thackeray family. This is nothing but dirty politics arisen out of frustration,” said Thackeray in his statement. Referring to recent speculations about his close friendships with people in the commercial film industry, he said, “The film industry is an integral part of Mumbai. Several thousand livelihoods depend on this industry. I have personal relationships with some from the industry and it is not a crime.” In his statement, Thackeray described the rumours and speculations surrounding Rajput as “politics over the dead” and an assault on humanity. Denying any involvement in Rajput’s death, Thackaeray said he would never do anything that would hurt the prestige of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena and the Thackeray family. “I am not even remotely connected to the case. I wish to say as the grandson of Hinduruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray that I will never do anything that would hurt the prestige of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena and Thackeray family. The people who are levelling baseless allegations should understand this,” Thackeray said in the statement which he tweeted on Tuesday evening. This is the first time Thackeray has responded to the rumours implicating him in Rajput’s death. Over the past month, speculations have circulated on social media and some news media, which link Thackeray to actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is believed to have been in a relationship with Rajput. There are also allegations of misappropriation of funds levelled against Chakraborty by Rajput’s family. Among the allegations to go viral was one that claimed the Maharashtra government did not want to transfer Rajput’s case to CBI because it wants to protect a “young politician” who is implicated in the case. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders like Atul Bhatkhalkar and Narayan Rane have openly alleged Mumbai Police are under pressure to protect vested political interests. On Tuesday, Rane said Mumbai Police was trying to shield someone by terming Rajput’s death a suicide and not calling it a “murder”. Sena minister Anil Parab on Tuesday challenged the Opposition to show proof of Thackeray’s involvement in the case. “Whoever has evidence that Aaditya Thackeray is connected to the case or he went to some party, should come forward. This is nothing but an attempt to malign the image of the young leader. The Opposition is playing politics keeping the upcoming Bihar elections in mind,” Parab said while speaking to the media in Mumbai. He also responded to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s wife Amruta, who had tweeted that she felt Mumbai was no longer a “safe” place. “When the government changes, the police force does not. The same police provided them security for five years, and they are protected by the same police even today. If they do not have faith in the police any longer, then she should gladly leave the state,” Parab said. Meanwhile, after chief minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar said on Tuesday that his government has recommended Rajput’s case be transferred to CBI, the Maharashtra government reiterated its support of Mumbai Police’s investigation. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said, “Our stand is clear that we do not want to hand over the case to CBI as Mumbai Police is competent to handle the case. We have filed a caveat in the Supreme Court [SC] where it will be argued. It is now up to the Apex Court to decide upon the jurisdiction of the court.” Officials from the home department said that since Rajput’s death took place in Mumbai, there is neither reason nor legal provision for transferring the case to CBI without the Maharashtra government’s permission. “The main allegation against actor Rhea Chakraborty is illegal transfer of the money and for it, the Enforcement Directorate has already started investigation. Mumbai Police’s investigation is on the right track and has not found any substantial to book anybody by filing a first information report [FIR]. In such a case, the consent of the government that has jurisdiction over the place where the case occurred, is necessary,” said a state government official. A home department official said the state government would oppose the FIR that has been filed in Patna regarding Rajput’s death, on the basis of jurisdiction. “Rhea Chakraborty has made the petition in the Supreme Court for the transfer of the case to Mumbai. We will bring to the notice of the Supreme Court that it should be investigated where the case has taken place,” said the official. However, Nishant Katneshwarkar, former state government counsel in SC, questioned why Mumbai Police had neither filed an FIR nor closed the case. “It is beyond imagination why Mumbai Police has neither filed an FIR nor closed the case if it has not found anything substantial. But there is no precedent of any state having demanded transfer of any case from one state to another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-link-to-sushant-singh-rajput-death-stop-dirty-politics-says-aaditya-thackeray/story-Cl6iui3abtLOtu8on5JvFN.html

According to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Sameet Thakkar, Mumbai Police is not able to probe the case effectively due to the interference of film industry professionals as well as police personnel being occupied with Covid duty. The PIL will be heard before the bench of chief justice Dipankar Dutta on Wednesday. The PIL alleges that one of the reasons that the ongoing investigation by Mumbai Police has been slow is that the police is trying to shield influential people from the film industry. It also points out alleged failures on part of Mumbai Police to follow up on certain anomalies and alleges that persons with vital information regarding the case have not been given a hearing by the police. For these reasons, the PIL asks that the investigation be handed over to an SIT or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Last week, the Supreme Court had dismissed a similar PIL, which sought to transfer the probe into Rajput’s death to CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-unable-to-investigate-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-well-transfer-it-to-cbi-or-sit-pil/story-irlkzYYu8q9NcvmM7Sj9gI.html

It was mentioned that the UT has so far conducted 6.5 lakh tests and currently has 21,416 confirmed cases, 7,893 active cases, 13,127 recovered cases and 396 deaths,” a spokesman said.He said the Union home secretary while reviewing the Covid-19 death audit report observed that most critical patients die within 72 hours of hospitalisation and emphasized on the need to tackle the issue.Regarding testing capacities, the chief secretary said the related infrastructure has been ramped up and against the WHO recommendation of 140 tests per million population per day, J&K is now conducting 900 tests per million per day. “For this, five additional testing laboratories, four CBNAAT facilities and 15 TRUENAT laboratories were established in government medical institutions, besides, augmenting the RTPCR tests with Rapid Antigen Tests. Further, the administration is also in the process of procuring 3 COBAS 6800 fully automated systems to enhance per day testing capacity, which is currently at 12,000 tests per day,” the chief secretary said.The chief secretary informed that the administration has recently revised home quarantine guidelines to permit such isolation in favour of asymptomatic patients with no co-morbidity and have Arogya Setu App downloaded for better monitoring, adding that they are being provided with government-sponsored oxymeters with the instruction of reporting to hospitals if their oxygen saturation level dips below 90%. “This will reduce the burden on healthcare institutions and will pave way to better monitoring of critical cases,” he said. While sharing the data on surge of bilateral pneumonia cases in the Valley, chief secretary sought help of the Union government through a technical team of experts for analysing such cases and advising on probable containment of its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-spike-in-cases-j-k-ramps-up-testing-capacity/story-QePQTq2REWYgFt2fJnAdPM.html

05-08-2020||City||Congress launches ‘speak-up J&K’ online campaign||Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) on Tuesday launched an online five- day campaign ‘Speak-up Jammu and Kashmir’ urging the people to join and speak over “effects of abrogation of Article 370 and downgrading of the historical Dogra state into two UTs”. Talking to media persons here, JKPCC chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said the online campaign will continue till August 9, when formal notification was issued by the President in this regard. He said the party has posed four main questions to the BJP government, which were dubbed as main things to be achieved while abrogating the special status and disbanding the state. “The things listed by government had included— an end to terrorism and restoration of normalcy, creation of jobs in government and private sector, including 50,000 jobs in three months, wiping out corruption, and opening floodgates of development and industrialisation,” he said. “What has happened to the promise of providing large scale jobs, result oriented achievements to check corruption and massive action against corrupt and where are the floodgates for the development and progress of Jammu and Kashmir,” he added. He said the people will share their views if the government has achieved these targets post-abrogation of Article 370 and downgrading of the historical Dogra state into two UTs and when the statehood which was disbanded and downgraded against the wish of the people, would be restored with safeguards for the protection of jobs and land to local youth of J&K, as promised by the BJP. Countering claims in this regard, he said, as far as the issue of normalcy in the Valley is concerned, imposition of curfew and extraordinary security measures in the entire UT, continued restrictions and lack of any routine political activities are the indicators of utter failures. Panthers Party to hold protests across UT The National Panthers Party has decided to hold peaceful protest on Wednesday, “when the draconian government deprived one of the oldest states in the union of its statehood”. “The Panthers Party district, provincial and state leadership has been advised to demand restoration of statehood for J&K which was deprived a year ago by the government in defiance of the history, cultural, social violation and which has been rejected by the people of all districts in J&K,” said professor Bhim Singh, chief patron of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-congress-launches-speak-up-j-k-online-campaign/story-OFFpvaHPpylHVzzWpB1vHN.html

They shared photographs on social media as part of an identification drive.A man and his mother from Aligarh came forward. The elderly woman identified the victim as her 24-year-old daughter, Warisha, who goes by one name. They took the body to Aligarh, where the burial took place on July 29.Warisha’s husband and in-laws were booked for dowry death and sent to jail for 14 days. However, even before the police could gloat at having cracked the case, there came a twist. On Monday, Warisha bumped into a police constable in Aligarh and narrated her story. Only then, the realisation dawned on the police. The woman in the suitcase was someone else; she is yet to be identified. Officials from UP police said that the Ghaziabad police have now started investigations afresh in the case, even as the role of Warisha’s family is being investigated. “Ghaziabad police are now trying to establish the identity of the woman whose body was found in the suitcase. The teams are searching Delhi-NCR and other police stations have also been informed to send information about women who have gone missing in the past few days. In the meantime, the statements of Warisha will be recorded before a magistrate. Her mother and brother, who identified the wrong dead body, are still under scanner and we are questioning them,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). Officers from Ghaziabad police said that they have already registered a fresh case of murder and destruction of evidence to probe the killing and identity of the woman whose body was found in suitcase. “Initially when we saw pictures of Warisha and the dead body of the woman, we found that there were a lot of similarities. About 70 to 80% of facial features matched,” Kumar added. HT accessed a video in which Warisha’s family is seen identifying the dead body, even though a woman officer standing nearby seemed not so convinced about the identity. The hands of the dead woman were covered with Mehandi which seemed to have been applied afresh. “There are no marks of bangles on her hand... Even there is no name of her husband (Amir) written on her hands. But you (pointing to Warisha’s mother) were saying that her husband’s name was written on her hand. There is no name written,” the woman officer is seen telling Warisha’s mother during the identification process in the video. However, Warisha’s mother is seen repeatedly telling cops and others standing nearby that it was her daughter’s body. “During the physical identification of the body, the family insisted that it was their daughter’s body although our officials were not so convinced. But we finally relented and went by what the family claimed. The entire sequence of events is being probed and if her family’s intention is found to be malafide, they will face legal action,” Kumar added. The Bulandshahr police said that they dropped the charges of dowry death against her in-laws but other sections against them will remain as they allegedly harassed the woman for dowry and even beat her up. Warisha’s family could not be contacted for a comment despite repeated attempts . A Delhi resident who wrote the dowry death complaint given to Bulandshahr police on behalf of her family also declined to speak about the incident. “The woman will betaken for her CrPC 164 statements (statements before a magistrate) on Wednesday. Once she gives her statements, we will take up investigationz accordingly,” said Diksha Singh, circle officer (city), and the case investigating officer from Bulandshahr police. The body of the unidentified woman is still buried in Aligarh and the Ghaziabad police said that it will be exhumed during the course of investigations. SSP Kalanidhi Naithani did not respond to repeated calls for a comment.“Our teams are trying to trace her identity (of the dead woman). We will soon take a call for exhuming the body. Meanwhile the DNA and viscera of the woman is preserved and will aid in investigations,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-in-suitcase-family-of-aligarh-victim-under-scanner/story-qBKuKW4eJU5pgf0J3DNt6I.html
05-08-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 drugs racket: Role of Delhi hospitals under scanner||A special investigations team (SIT) probing the alleged racket wherein pharmaceutical drugs and medicines, including those used in the treatment of Covid-19 and cancer, were being smuggled to Iraq, has decided to widen its probe after three Delhi-based pharmacists were nabbed last week.The SIT now is looking at the roles of hospitals and distributors of pharmaceutical products in the national capitalIn the past three days, police have conducted raids in Delhi and the five-member SIT, headed by an ACP rank officer, has received inputs to suggest involvement of hospitals, from where the pharmacists were able to source remdesivir .Remdesivir —an experimental drug administered to Covid-19 patients in emergency situations — is directly supplied from manufacturing companies to the hospitals and there are no stockists of the drug. Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), east, said, “So far, the chain has led to pharmacists in Delhi and we have obtained leads to suggest involvement of some hospitals. The investigation is focused on who was supplying these medicines, which are in short supply, to these pharmacists.” So far, four Iraqi interpreters, three pharmacists — two from Delhi and one from Jharsa in Gurugram — and a medical store attendant have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the chain. The nexus came to the fore after the police and drug control department had conducted two raids on July 28, following which four Iraqi nationals were arrested. Forty eight vials of remdesivir, 55 strips of Fabiflu (Favipiravir) and 18 packs of Lopikast — the three drugs used in the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus — among a large cache of antibiotics, antacids, anti-allergic and other cancer treatment medicines, were recovered in the raid. One SUV and Rs 74.55 lakh cash was also seized. In subsequent investigations, police had arrested one Pardeep from Jharsa, who had allegedly supplied remdesivir to one of the arrested Iraqi nationals. Eighty four injections of remdesivir, which Pardeep had allegedly hidden in a room near a tubewell in his village in Pataudi, were recovered by the police. He had revealed during questioning that he had purchased the injections for Rs 15,000 per vial from a supplier in Delhi and sold them for Rs 18,000 per vial. Based on inputs from his questioning, police went to arrest three people from Delhi, identified as Shahid, Faizan and Tarun. Police probe has found that the Iraqi interpreters, who worked with city-based hospitals, had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years and since the pandemic, they had started dealing primarily in drugs used to treat Covid-19 which were in short supply. These drugs were sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq. The suspects worked as translators for medical tourism patients at private hospitals and enlisted the patients or their attendants as conduits and asked them to carry medicines along with their personal medicines in the flights to Iraq, where an aide would collect it from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-drugs-racket-role-of-delhi-hospitals-under-scanner/story-465VdDpAXhmf8Kc8dJBufP.html

The family ID card is a unique 14-digit identity document that would provide domiciled residents of Haryana with easy access to all the social welfare schemes of the Central and the Haryana governments. Tshe scheme would also help in creating a database of residents having a domicile status of the state and rectifying the mismatch that occurs in the list of beneficiaries available with different government departments. Officials said that two lakh families in the district have been surveyed under the scheme in the last one year. The family ID card scheme was announced on January 2, 2019, by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The scheme is meant to cover 54 lakh households across a population of 2.5 crore in the state. For this, a portal, www.meraparivar.haryana.gov.in, was launched by the government last year. To create the database, the state government has utilised the existing data of the Public Distribution System (PDS) in the state, records of government employees, and the data available with the urban local bodies (ULBs). The existing data is in the verification stage as families are required to provide details, such as Aadhaar card numbers of all members, along with their contact numbers. The district administration officials said the verification process was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As per officials, from August 27 till 29, camps will be held in rural and urban parts of the city for residents to submit their details. On Tuesday, Khattar, distributed token family Id cards in Panchkula to families already verified under the scheme. Government officials from all the districts were also connected to the CM’s programme through videoconferencing. As a part of the programme, the distribution of IDs took place in all the districts including Gurugram. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner; Sanjay Singh MLA Sohna, and Satya Prakash Jaravata MLA Pataudi distributed the cards to 20 families in the district.In a press statement issued by the administration, Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, said that nearly two lakh people in the district have been surveyed under the scheme. “The verification will continue based on which ID cards would be distributed by the local-level communities,” said Panwar. As per the statement, residents will not have to register each time for a particular scheme. The details in Family ID will be used in identifying all the people who fall under a particular scheme. Khattar said that in the next one month the entire process of data collection and verification will be completed and by September, the ID cards will be distributed. The beneficiaries can start availing the benefits under the scheme within the next three months, read the press statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-distributes-family-id-cards-to-20-families-in-gurugram/story-SNU9LDlaAIh80mZC6FOZ0K.html

The delegation also handed over a memorandum in this regard, which demanded that all perpetrators be arrested and charged with attempt to murder. The delegation also wanted the best medical assistance from the state government for the victim, Lukman. A statement issued by the members of the delegation read, “The perpetrators of this crime seem to have no fear of even the police as they can be seen misbehaving with our state police force as well. This is obviously an attempt to disturb communal amity in the city and create an atmosphere of fear among the Muslim community. ” Mufti Mohd Saleem Qasmi from Jamiat Ulama I Hind (Gurugram), who led Muslim community members on Tuesday, said, “To protect the pluralistic example of this city, the Gurugram administration needs to urgently instil a sense of security among those who reside here.” Calling the incident a ‘deplorable’ act, police commissioner Rao reiterated that the suspects will not be spared. “Strict action has already been taken. Some media reports said that the victim was beaten up in the presence of policemen. This is not the case. A homeguard official from the traffic police, who was present at the trunk market near Sadar bazaar when the incident was first reported, tried to stop the suspects but he could not handle the situation initially.Also a rumour was spread that the victim is already on the way to the hospital. After checking, the SHO concerned reached the spot and took him to the hospital in his car,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police, Gurugram while speaking to the media. The SHO was later suspended for allegedly failing to take action on the spot.He added that the four main suspects, who had assaulted the victim with a hammer and rods, have been arrested and booked under section 307 (attempt-to-murder) of Indian Penal Code. “At the time of registering the FIR, some facts were not clear. After investigations and talking to the victim, the police themselves added the additional charges in the FIR. At least seven more suspects have been identified and they shall be arrested soon. Three police officials have been suspended for negligence as they failed to take action on the spot. There will be no laxity in probe,” he added. Victim recounts incident (can be inset)Lukman, 25, who is recovering at a hospital in Nuh, on Monday night recounted the incident and stated that he was battered with a hammer and sticks for close to 20 minutes near the meat market before being rescued. “When I noticed that some men were chasing me on motorcycles near a traffic signal, I called Tahir, to whom I was delivering the buffalo meat. He told me to come to Sadar Bazar. I was scared since the accused were asking me to stop the pick-up truck. They cornered me near the main road and started kicking me. Someone picked up a hammer from a shop and they took turns hitting me with the hammer. A man intervened and tried to stop them, but he was slapped. I told them repeatedly that I was ferrying buffalo meat not cow meat,” said Lukman. He added that he was then bundled into his truck and taken to another location. “I was praying but the suspects asked me to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. I told them that you can shoot me if there is beef in my truck. They took Rs 20,000 cash from my pocket and another Rs 50,000 that was kept in the truck. The suspects were talking about taking me to a cremation ground and threatened to burn me alive. Policemen were trying to rescue me, but the suspects confronted the policemen. You can see in the videos. I was barely conscious and could not mention several things to the police and can only faintly recall whatever has been mentioned in the FIR,” he said. Subash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The FIR does not mention that the victim was forced to chant slogans or cash was stolen from him. The investigation is going on and no such link has come out in the probe so far.” Police have arrested four suspects, including the prime suspect, who was seen raining hammer blows on the victim in a video that had surfaced online. The case is being investigated by the crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/beef-in-truck-row-delegation-meets-police-chief-to-demand-action-victim-recalls-horror/story-eLwB15CgWOCTrGOt9w9G0J.html
05-08-2020||Gurugram||Antigen detection tests to be conducted in all urban primary health centres in Gurugram||In order to ramp up the testing capacity, the district health department has decided to allow rapid antigen detection tests for Covid-19 in all the 19 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) in the city, starting Wednesday. Earlier this month, the primary health centres were also allowed to collect samples for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) tests at the local level and transport these samples to the government lab at the Civil Hospital, Sector 10. The decision to allow UPHCs to conduct both antigen and RT-PCR tests is a part of the ongoing efforts to improve the health infrastructure in the city by strengthening the primary health centres, said officials. Experts say that strengthening UPHCs for Covid-19 sample collection and testing would help in the early detection of suspected cases that would prevent mortality and help in spreading public awareness regarding the disease. The district health department has conducted 48,774 antigen detection tests so far, out of which 1,345 have tested positive. Among those tested negative, 4,891 samples were taken for the confirmatory RT-PCR test, of which 550 were confirmed to be Covid-19 positive. The rapid antigen detection tests that began in the city on June 24, is mainly being conducted in the containment zones and the large outbreak regions (LORs) of the city. The antigen detection test looks for the toxin or the foreign substance in the body that triggers an immune response. It is helpful in quickly detecting and isolating infected patients. “Apart from conducting tests in camps, the UPHCs will now have the facility to conduct the rapid antigen tests. Earlier, UPHCs were only permitted to collect samples for RT-PCR from 9am to 2pm daily for residents who are suspicious of the SARS-CoV-2 virus symptoms and want to get tested without any hassle. Antigen tests will now be allowed in all the 19 UPHCs during the same time slot,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram.For this, the health department has distributed 100 kits to each UPHC. “ These kits will be used only for symptomatic patients and high-risk contacts of an already confirmed case. Those getting tested for antigen detection will have to show proper identification,” said Yadav. To test high-risk contacts of confirmed Covid-19 patients, teams at the UPHCs will use their respective data bases of all confirmed cases. “The Rapid Response Team (RRT) at the local level are aware of the people in the community. They are working with a population size of 1,000 to 2,000, which helps them in tracing the high-risk contacts. Based on their know- how about the community, these kits will be utilised,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer. Over the last one month, efforts have been made to strengthen the UPHCs to deliver better outcomes in tackling the pandemic. All the UPHCs are required to update on a daily basis the list of people in their areas whose samples are being collected for the RT-PCR test, their contacts, and those who are being tested positive. Importance of primary health centresExperts are of the opinion that primary health centres are critical in handling infectious diseases as they are the first point of care for people. The functioning of such primary health centres was earlier restricted to only a few areas of healthcare, namely antenatal care, child birth, neonatal and infant healthcare, childhood and adolescent healthcare, family planning, usage of contraceptives and other areas of reproductive health.. The 2017 National Health Policy recommended establishment of PHCs as health and wellness centres. The range of services were expanded to include management of infectious, communicable and non-communicable diseases along with care for the elderly, palliative health care, and mental health issues. Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India ( PHFI) said, “In an epidemic, PHCs have a critical role to play. Nearly 80% of the infections can be addressed at the PHC-level, where based on the screening alone, early diagnosis of the patient can be done. Early detection, testing and surveillance are possible at the local level. Although RT-PCR is the gold standard for frontline testing for Covid-19, arrangements for antigen testing at primary would help in identifying a higher number of high-risk cases.” Calling it a positive move, K Sujatha Rao, former secretary, union ministry of health and family welfare, who is also the former director general, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) said, “During the time, when HIV was widely prevalent in the country, HIV-ELISA (Enzyme - Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test was being conducted at the PHC level to identify patients. Diagnosis at the primary level helps in preventing morbidity and mortality.”According to Rao, for Covid-19 antigen testing, the team at the local level should to be careful of false negatives as antigen tests have a higher percentage of false negatives. “If 100 people are tested for antigen and 70 are negative, then it is important to figure out how many should be tested for RT-PCR. This is because, there are chances of missing out an infected person,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/antigen-detection-tests-to-be-conducted-in-all-urban-primary-health-centres-in-gurugram/story-kGMlPFvDVRl59FpjhQBgdI.html

05-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Number of containment zones rise due to revision in their area||The district has added as many as 34 containment zones in less than 10 days even as the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the period have not been significant.The number of containment zones in Ghaziabad has seen a rise since July 24 after the Uttar Pradesh government decided to revise the area of the category-1 (having one positive case) and category-2 (having multiple cases) zones. Officials of the district administration attribute the new scenario to lesser area assigned to each of the new containment zones. According to official records, the district on July 24 had the presence of 315 containment zones while the number of active cases stood at 909. On August 3, when a fresh list of containment zones was prepared, the list had a total of 349 zones with 929 active cases. On July 24, the state government had reduced the area of containment zones under both the categories. “The issue of rise in number of containment zones is due to the fact that the areas of containment zones got lessened as per the government order. Now, with the revised area, we have to define several containment zones to accommodate the cases. That is why the number has gone up,” said CP Tiwari, additional district magistrate (city). “In case more cases arrive now, we will have to accommodate all active cases and more numbers of containment zones will be marked. Earlier, the area was more, so we could accommodate more cases in a single containment zone,” he added. According to UP government’s order, the category-1 zones will have an area of 100 metres radius as against 250 metres earlier. The category-2 zones will have an area of 200 metres radius as against the previous area of 500 metres, along with additional buffer zone of 250 metres. “Since the order directed that the buffer zone in case of category-2 zones will be assessed based on local conditions, we are not defining any particular area for it. The buffer zone for each category-2 zone is assessed on local conditions,” ADM Tiwari said. The containment zones are created in case of emergence of Covid-19 cases and various exercises like surveillance, sanitization and door-to-door surveys are taken up in order to contain infection as well as break its chain from spreading further. “The rise in number of containment zones is due to the revision in area. But we are ensuring that the containment zones are sealed and de-sealed as per guidelines. Our activities of surveillance and containment have also been stepped up and we are also focussing on carrying out testing in containment zones,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Under the Unlock 3 guidelines issued by the UP government on July 30, state chief secretary RK Tiwari had said that the lockdown conditions will be applicable in the containment zones till August 31. “The containment zones will be defined as per the government order issued on July 24 and the list of containment zones will also be uploaded on the website by the district administration,” the order had said.On June 14, the UP government had issued revised guidelines in which they said that high-rise buildings/towers will be sealed only for 14 days as against 21 days earlier as part of the containment exercise. The directions were issued after residents had approached officials about the inconvenience faced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-number-of-containment-zones-rise-due-to-revision-in-their-area/story-Y2Z8pq8aBZdpBVOfFpU2CJ.html
05-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad ‘discharges’ first batch of 34 patients in home isolation||Ghaziabad Almost two weeks after the first Covid-19 patient was allowed home isolation in the district, the first batch of 34 such patients was ‘discharged’ on Tuesday. None of the patients under home isolation got into critical condition as a result of strict monitoring, district administration officials said, adding that they would remain in home quarantine for seven more days. The first patient in Ghaziabad, who was allowed home isolation on July 22, is a 31-year-old man from a locality under the jurisdiction of Indirapuram police station. According to the guidelines issued by the UP government, the patients in home isolation will be termed as discharged in 10-day period from the date of Covid-19 test, if they do not have fever during the past three days. “Based on guidelines for patients in home isolation, we have started with their discharge. The first batch of 34 patients was discharged on Tuesday after completion of 10 days. Now, they will have to remain in home quarantine for a further period of seven days as per norms. As a result of regular monitoring, none of the patients got into any critical condition,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Our teams deployed at the dedicated control room are taking up daily update of health status, oxygen levels and temperatures of the patients who are in home isolation. We have laid special emphasis on the monitoring aspect of such patients as they are not under direct observation of our doctors,” he added. The Uttar Pradesh government on July 20 allowed for home isolation of asymptomatic patients with certain criteria. Prior to this, all the positive patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, had to be admitted to Covid hospitals. “Since the patients in home isolation need not get physically discharged from any Covid facility, we will update the portal and mark these as discharged upon completion of the criteria mentioned for their discharge. During the further seven days’ period of home quarantine, such cases will not be termed as patients. However, they will continue to monitor their health with the help of medical kit available with them. There will be no need of any testing once the home isolation period ends,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. The conditions for home isolation include the undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home and separate isolation room. Patients are also required to purchase pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask and gloves, among others. According to official records, the district had a total of 208 patients, 75 women, in home isolation till August 3 and their age ranged from one year to 66 years. About 40 of such patients were allowed the facility under the jurisdiction of Kavi Nagar police station, 53 under Sihani Gate police station, 26 under Indirapuram police station, 27 in Sahibabad, and 19 under Kotwali police station, among others. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to come up with a plasma bank at MMG Hospital and the process for initiation for plasma therapy is already underway, the officials said. “We have a list of about 115 persons who recovered from Covid-19 and wish to donate plasma to active patients. So, we have planned that plasma bank will come up at MMG Hospital so that it can be stored safely. Our process for taking permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research is already underway. Once we get the permission, we will initiate plasma therapy. The equipment required for it will be bought from Rs 5 crore funds which will be provided to us by the government,” Pandey added. Plasma therapy involves treating a positive patient with the plasma of a compatible patient who recovered from Covid-19. The antibodies present in the plasma are expected to help the patient fight off the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-discharges-first-batch-of-34-patients-in-home-isolation/story-u9ZfXREhk3m2lrg1OZK0FM.html
05-08-2020||Gurugram||Fake currency racket busted, three held||The police on Sunday arrested three members of a gang and claimed to have busted a fake currency racket in the city that was involved in circulating counterfeit notes in Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. The police said they received a tip-off on Sunday morning that two men had done shopping worth more than Rs 10,000 at New Palam Vihar, but the currency notes they paid turned out to be fake.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the team conducting the investigations found that the men had come on a motorcycle to buy dairy products and paid for it with currency, which was fake. The information was passed to the crime unit and based on that the men were tracked to a rented accommodation in New Palam Vihar. “One of the officials from the crime team contacted one of the suspects and tried to strike a deal. Initially he was reluctant and tried to mislead us. He later agreed and offered to deliver counterfeit notes worth Rs 5,000 for Rs 1,000,” he said. Police said after the time of delivery was fixed, they raided the house and arrested three men from the spot. They were identified as Sanjeev Kumar and Ritik Kumar of village Gochi in Jhajjar and Bhavishya Singh of Sonipat. Police allegedly recovered printers from the room which were used for printing the currency. During questioning the suspects revealed that they took three months of training from Uttar Pradesh and then they starting making printouts of currency notes to match the original, said police. “Two of them were experts in printing and could replicate the watermark which was similar to those found on original notes. After checking the notes carefully, it was found that some features were missing and paper used for the notes was different than the ones used in original currency,” said Sangwan. The gang earlier used to watch YouTube to take the training but could not learn the techniques following which they contacted a person who had served jail time in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for printing counterfeit notes, said police. “We recovered fake notes worth Rs 19,100 in the denomination of Rs 200 and Rs 100, apart from Rs 1,000 in genuine cash. During questioning, the man revealed that they formed a team through common friends and took up a one-bedroom apartment in New Palam Vihar. They claimed that there was one more person involved in the racket that supplied fake currency notes to different part of the city as well as the state,” Sangwan said. A case under sections 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against them. The modus operandi of the gang was to sell the fake notes to traders and people dealing in changing money for less than half the rate of the denominated notes. Police said they have circulated more than Rs 20 lakh in the last four months with two printers and a computer in their room. “They had also engaged agents from different cities to identify potential customers, who would buy fake notes at one-fourth the rate and double their investment by using them in business,” Said Sangwan. Police is conducting raids and questioning more people to know the exact numbers of members involved in the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fake-currency-racket-busted-three-held/story-wEamt82cq2kSfVYkiTiBoJ.html
05-08-2020||Gurugram||Haryana’s higher education department keeps college fees unchanged in view of Covid-19 pandemic||The state higher education department on Tuesday said that it would not implement any fee hike in government colleges for the upcoming 2020-21 academic session, keeping in mind the financial distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Usually, universities across the state increase their fees by 10-15% every year, said officials. However, according to officials, increasing the fees this year could have adverse implications for the gross enrolment ratio of the state with many students being discouraged from taking admission.In a letter shared with all government colleges on Tuesday, the department said that this year too, the fee structure for the 2018-19 session will continue to prevail. This is the second year in a row that the higher education department has not hiked fees for colleges in the state. Earlier, in November 2019, the department was forced to roll back fee hike for the 2019-2020 session after protests by students.The department said that this year, the Covid-19 pandemic had caused major disruptions in the lives of people across the globe. It has created new challenges and put extreme economic pressure on people. This necessitated that fee structure is kept unchanged, keeping in mind the shifting ground realities.SP Sukhija, joint director-2, department of higher education, said that the department had taken the decision of not increasing college fees this year keeping in mind the interests of the students. “We have been receiving many representations and requests from people expressing their inability to pay an increased fee since their source of income has dried up. Routinely, universities increase their fees by 10-15% every year. If we were to go by the usual precedent, fee this year would have shot up. We, however, took a compassionate view so that students don’t have to suffer and pay an increased fee,” said Sukhija.He added that hiking the fee could have discouraged students from weaker economic sections of the society from taking admission. “If the fee is hiked and the students are not in a position to take admission, then this would adversely affect the enrolment ration in the state. We don’t want our students to be deprived of education due to higher fees,” said Sukhija.The decision to keep the fee structure unchanged this year had earlier been discussed in a meeting with all principals that took place last Sunday. Pooja Khullar, principal of the Dronacharya Government College, said that the decision had been taken keeping in mind the various constraints that people are facing due to the pandemic. “There will be no enhancement of fees this year. The department has decided to continue with the old fee structure so that students are not dissuaded from taking admission,” said Khullar.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the department had increased the fee last year but it had been rolled back after protests by students. This year, however, the department had decided against increasing the fee in view of the hardships faced by people because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The department of higher education is expected to initiate the online admission process for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the coming days. Nodal admission officers have already been appointed in various colleges across the state to facilitate the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-s-higher-education-department-keeps-college-fees-unchanged-in-view-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-qnfR8rZOOSUrd9saMsIUXI.html
05-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Brothers stab each other to death in drunken brawl||Two brothers, aged 28 and 32 years, allegedly stabbed each other to death following an altercation outside their house in Rajiv Colony, Sahibabad, late Monday. The Ghaziabad police said both men were rushed to MMG Hospital, where they succumbed to injuries soon after. The police said 28-year-old Mohan Lal and his brother Sagar Kumar alias Mota got into a fight outside their uncle’s house, nearby their own home in Rajiv Colony. Police said the men were in an inebriated state and inflicted multiple stab wounds on each other. “There was some household dispute between the two and soon there was heated exchange of words which resulted in the fight. As both of them were intoxicated, they picked up knives from the house and stabbed each other. This resulted in critical injuries and blood loss. After the police was informed, the brothers were rushed to the hospital where they later died,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said. “There was no motive as such for the fight, except for some minor household disputes between the two brothers which finally ended in two murders. There is no issue or fight over property as their house is small -- about 50 square yards,” he added. The police said Sagar was married and had a two-year-old son and a daughter born 10 days ago. His younger brother Mohan Lal was unmarried, but used to stay in the same house with Sagar. “Soon after the incident, their cousin gave a police complaint and we registered a case of attempt to murder. But later, they men died and so the case will have no suspect or victim now,” an officer from the Sahibabad police station said. When approached, the family members declined to speak to the media. Sujit Giri, a neighbour and husband of the local councillor, said, “There were altercations between the brothers in the past as well but the one on Monday night proved fatal. They were drinking together that night and ended up fighting and stabbing each other. The family is poor and we neighbours are helping them with the last rites and autopsy formalities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-brothers-stab-each-other-to-death-in-drunken-brawl/story-SNWuiC0IqzrDL8lWhgAfXJ.html

The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has entered a tripartite agreement on July 30 with IIT-Bombay, the technical supervisor of the project, and Tata Projects Limited (TPL), the agency that will execute the project within 10 months after the designs are obtained from US-based University of Minnesota, which holds the patent for the technology.Last week, the Supreme Court had warned that it would initiated contempt proceedings against IIT-Bombay for threatening to back out of the proposal to construct smog towers in Delhi.In an affidavit filed by MoEFCC in order to persuade the court from taking an adverse view of the delay to execute the project. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that the first installment for the project, estimated at Rs 18.58 crore, has been released and once the design of the tower is available from University of Minnesota, work will begin. The project management consultant will be National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), Mehta informed. The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said, “We want to know when the initial hiccups will be over and the work will begin.” The Court posted the matter for Monday. The bench had last week expressed dissatisfaction over the technical designs for the smog tower being unavailable. The court reminded the Centre of its February 28 order this year directing work on the smog tower to commence forthwith. The bench was under an impression that tower designs and specifications were already in place. The MoEFCC affidavit clarified that the delay was in finalising the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). As per the initial agreement, TPL was to obtain the designs and specification from University of Minnesota. But this took time as IIT-Bombay insisted on adding TPL in the MoU only by April this year. On April 22, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) convened a special meeting to approve the tripartite agreement between Ministry, IIT-B and TPL. The agreement was signed on July 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agreement-in-place-to-install-smog-tower-at-anand-vihar/story-0ioKdPGcKU90Ei8Gx7aFkO.html

Two of them – a 1-year-old girl and a 26-year-old woman – died, a three-year-old girl was rescued and was in stable condition, while one girl was missing. The house was located on the banks of the nullah in Santacruz (East), according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s disaster management cell. The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had suspended search operations at the time of going to press owing to the darkness. The search will continue on Wednesday. “The house was constructed using support from the wall, and was probably an illegal structure. The load of the structure might have also resulted in the wall collapse, due to which parts of the house collapsed,” said a BMC official. “No major evacuation of those residing on the banks of the rivers or nullahs was undertaken on Tuesday, but will be undertaken, if necessary. The situation of Covid-19 also has to be considered before moving citizens to nearby municipal schools.”The heavy rain till 12 noon led to waterlogging in 20 locations. At 9am, BMC asked all non-essential offices to remain shut. Traffic was affected on several roads owing to the closure of Milan subway, Andheri subway, Khar subway, Malad subway, National College and Dahisar subway.Train services on the Central Railway’s (CR) main and harbour line were shut in the morning owing to waterlogging at Kurla, Wadala, Chunabhatti and Parel stations. CR’s local train services on the main line resumed at 2.55pm, and on the harbour line at 4.08pm. On the Western Railway (WR), train services between Churchgate and Andheri were suspended due to waterlogging in the morning.“Due to heavy rain, about 200mm water was reported on tracks between Dadar and Prabhadevi. After water levels receded, the first slow train from Andheri resumed at 11.40am and fast local train service from Virar resumed at 12.45pm.” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, Western Railway.The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) also diverted its buses on more than 56 routes in the city owing to waterlogging on 26 roads. Waterlogging was also reported at Hindmata, Gandhi market, SIES College, Sion, Dadar TT, Bhendi Bazar, JJ flyover junction, Thakurdwar in Marine Lines, Postal Colony in Chembur, Chunabhatti railway station, Mankhurd station and Tilak Nagar station.Two minors, including Adnan Shaikh, 5, and Imran Shaikh, 13, were injured as a tree fell on their house. The incident was reported at 2.11am on Tuesday at Chembur’s HP Nagar. Both were admitted to Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi. Overall, 142 incidents of tree/ branch fall were reported between 8am on August 3 and 6pm on August 4.Further, a landslide was reported on the Western Express Highway near Malad around 7.30am. No injuries were reported, but traffic on the southbound lane was hit for a few hours as the debris was being cleared.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, mayor Kishori Pednekar and guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray visited several parts of the city on Tuesday to take a stock of the situation. Thackeray visited Hindmata and Gandhi market junction where rain water did not drain out for hours. Chahal also visited Mithi river, BKC, Milan subway and Andheri subway.Sanjay Darade, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “We briefed them about the situation and the ground challenges. By the time, rain got lighter, high tide was scheduled due to which rainwater took time to drain out. Our pumps were working fine, and the drains were also cleaned before the monsoon.”Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga said, “BMC spent around ₹100 crore to widen the drain at Hindmata, but despite this, we see flooding there. Several areas were waterlogged till 5pm, when there was no or light rain. This means that cleaning of drains was not done properly.”Meanwhile, starting Wednesday, 20% water cut will be implemented in the city owing to low rainfall in catchment areas. The water level in the seven lakes supplying drinking water to Mumbai was 34.95% as of Tuesday, compared to 91% in 2019 and 83% in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-die-in-house-collapse-waterlogging-witnessed-at-20-spots-in-mumbai/story-ORFyh8BNZylBUauGUkbwxH.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Deadline for second sero survey extended till Aug 7||The results of Delhi’s second serological survey for Covid-19 are likely to be announced by August 10, senior government officials said on Tuesday even as the deadline for the collection of samples was extended by two days till August 7. Around 15,000 blood samples – half of which will be from people between the ages of 18 and 49 -- will be collected from across Delhi between August 1 and 5, according to guidelines released by the state government for the city’s second serological survey for Covid-19 will be carried out, setting a target that is slightly lower than the previous such study.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDelhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said, “We will have to extend the serological survey in Delhi by two more days. Around 15,000 samples will be collected for the survey.” The extension, the official said, is on account of two festival holidays -- Eid-ul Zuha on Saturday and Rakshabandhan on Monday -- that led to a reduction in the number of people who came to centres to get their blood drawn. The findings of the study will help determine how much closer Delhi has gotten to the herd immunity threshold after the first serological survey in Delhi covering close to 21,800 people between June 27 and July 10, showed 22.86% of those tested had antibodies and we thus possibly immune to the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The sample collection for the second round started on August 1 in four districts – North, Northwest, New Delhi and South. In all, 15,015 samples – from a cross-section of people selected to represent Delhi’s population demographic and – will be collected and tested for Sars-Cov-2 antibodies that will indicate a past infection. “The repeated sero-surveillance will help us understand what proportion of people has been exposed since the last round and tell us whether the circulation is still on. It will also help us understand the proportion of cases that actually need medical attention—what it shows so far is that a majority of the cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. However, we still do not know whether the presence of the antibodies will protect against a second infection and whether enough number of people with such protection can create a barrier and protect others from the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at ICMR.“If we go by the experience of other coronaviruses, the antibodies offer protection for a few months to a couple of years. But we do not know whether Sars-CoV-2 behaves like other viruses,” he said.The highest number of samples has to be collected are from the Northwest district (2,200), followed by West (2,145), and Central (1,548). The fewest will be from New Delhi district, where 885 have to be collected, according to the break-up given in the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the government, a copy of which is with HT. Each team, which can collect 25 to 40 samples a day, will consist of ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), a phlebotomist or a lab technician, and a community volunteer. Samples will be processed in 18 laboratories across the Capital, in Delhi government and central government hospitals, including the NCDC laboratory.Unlike the first round of the surveillance, where all of the samples had been collected door-to-door, the government has also allowed collection at selected spots and health centre. All those included in the previous sero-surveillance done between June 27 and July 10 will be excluded from the second round of the survey. A serological survey in Mumbai in July end -- conducted only in three wards as against all 11 districts in Delhi -- found that 57% of those living in slums and 16% of non-slum dwellers had antibodies against the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/deadline-for-second-serological-study-extended-till-aug-7-results-likely-by-aug-10/story-uR9ak8uxz1inG7gUX2zLMI.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Why is Delhi govt resisting court monitoring of testing in city, asks HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said it did not understand the reason for the Delhi government’s “resistance” to the courts monitoring from time to time the ramping up of Covid-19 testing in the city.The remark came after the Delhi government told the court that issues raised (by other pleas) have already been addressed and adequate steps have been taken to manage health care and other services in the national capital.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad, while hearing a plea filed through advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking to increase Covid-19 testing in the city, was told by the Delhi government counsel that last week, another bench of the Delhi high court had disposed of a similar plea during which the court had noted that adequate steps have been taken by the government to fight the pandemic.Delhi government counsel Satyakam also raised questions on the maintainability of the application and said the petitioner should have filed a separate petition rather than filing an application in an already disposed of matter.He said such applications can be filed only for making corrections/modifications in the order but not for raising fresh concerns and hence the matter should not be heard any further.However, the court said the earlier pleas, which were decided by the other benches, were concerned with the treatment, availability of beds, personal protective equipment kits, ambulances and denial of treatment to patients.The bench also said in the course of the past two months, rapid expansion has taken place in terms of testing as the Delhi government understood the breadth of the infection and took measures to deal with it. It also said that taking note of the orders and facts in place, lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal had also constituted a committee to look into Covid-19 testing and care.“...the resistance of the Delhi government to this court monitoring the progress made in ramping up the testing, is incomprehensible when admittedly, this is not an adversarial litigation and it is purely in the interest of the citizens of Delhi that all government departments and agencies act in tandem and work collectively to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic for larger public good. The technical plea taken by the government on the maintainability of an application in a disposed of matter would have engaged this Court had it been a routine litigation between two private parties. This is not so here,” the court said.During the hearing, the Delhi government, in a status report, told the court that the mandate of the Delhi government is to ramp up testing and deploy a combination of both rapid antigen testing and RT-PCR testing in such a manner that all categories of vulnerable groups and areas are covered.It also said the Delhi government, till July 30, had conducted 5,24,431 RT-PCR tests -- 27,604 tests per million -- which are more than double the national average of 13,647 tests per million.It asked the Delhi government to file a fresh status report and posted the matter for August 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-is-delhi-govt-resisting-court-monitoring-of-testing-in-city-asks-hc/story-Is21rNNsPY67SZy5rM5tHK.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Gyms, hotels to stay shut in Delhi||Gyms and yoga centres in Delhi will stay shut which have been otherwise allowed to operate under the central government’s Unlock 3.0 guidelines — to be applicable from August 5 — the third phase of the gradual lifting of curbs announced to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“Currently in Delhi, the government has done away with the curfew hours (10 pm – 5 am) under the Centre’s Unlock 3.0 guidelines. This was notified through an order issued on July 31. The same order also mentioned that other than the relaxation on curfew provisions, the status quo would remain in Delhi until further orders. Which means, as of now, yoga centres and gyms cannot operate in the city, nor can hotels and weekly markets,” said a senior official of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe DDMA is chaired by the L-G. Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.Last week, the Delhi government had decided to allow hotels and weekly markets to operate. But the Lieutenant Governor reversed the decision, saying the Covid situation in Delhi is still “fragile”. A senior government official said, the Delhi government is in the process of redrafting the proposal to be sent to the L-G office.A senior Delhi government official said, “In the proposal that is being redrafted, the Delhi government shall include yoga centres and gyms along with hotels and weekly markets. The final call on this will be the L-G’s. As far as the Delhi government’s opinion is concerned, they are in favour of re-opening of these activities”The central government’s un-lockdown guidelines allowed hotels and hospitality services to be operational from June 8 (under Unlock 1.0 plan). However, yoga centres and gyms were allowed to operate from August 5 (under Unlock 3.0).The Union home ministry issued the plan, “Unlock 3”, on Wednesday prepared after receiving feedback from states and in consultation held with central ministries and departments, to open up more activities outside containment zones. States have to take the final call on lockdown and relaxation norms. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on August 1 wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah, urging him to intervene and allow economic activities in Delhi. Sisodia’s letter has so far yielded no response, said another Delhi government official.Chirag Sethi, vice-president Delhi Gym Association, said: “This is a very tough situation for us and we are very anxious. We expect the government to allow gyms to open as soon as possible because the livelihood of over a lakh people depends on the fitness industry. More wait will cause more revenue loss for the industry which had been completely shut for around four months now.”Sandeep Khandelwal, president of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association, said: “Hotels in Delhi employ around 400,000 people. Hotels have been shut since March 25. The hospitality industry is under a lot of stress and the government must be considerate towards us. We have written to both the Delhi government and central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gyms-hotels-to-stay-shut-in-delhi/story-6P7FnvKZTHkjJbFLoxd4OI.html
05-08-2020||Delhi||Civil services exam results: Delhi and Delhi Police have much reason to cheer||The civil services exam results are out and among those who did Delhi proud are a police constable who joined the force as a high school graduate; a woman topper whose mother encouraged her to appear for the exam and a 23-year-old man who managed to fulfil his grandfather’s much cherished dream. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) announced the results Wednesday and 829 candidates have been recommended for appointment to various civil services this year. Among the top five candidates, two are from Delhi -- 26-year-old Delhi topper Jatin Kishore, who secured all India rank 2, and 23-year-old Himanshu Jain, a resident of Shahdara, who secured all India rank 4 and came second in Delhi. Jain had no chance to celebrate on Wednesday as he was busy with hospital discharge formalities of his father who had been undergoing treatment for the past three weeks.“Now that my father is back home, we can all celebrate together,” said the former student of Hansraj College. “My grandfather wanted me to get into the civil services and that inspired me to take the exam. Getting into the services would provide me with the platform to work for society. When I didn’t clear the exams in my first attempt, I became more determined to do so this time,” Jain said.Kishore, an Indian economic service (IES) officer, was busy at work at the central government’s department of rural development when congratulatory calls started pouring in. Kishore, who lives in East of Kailash, said, “IAS (Indian administrative service) offers more field exposure and we can work on the ground to impact more lives directly. That is why I appeared for the UPSC exams even after clearing IES,” said Kishore. So did he expect to be the Delhi topper? Kishore said, “I don’t think anyone expects this. It has been a good surprise.”Also, on top of the world on Wednesday was Delhi Police constable Firoz Alam, who works with the police control room and secured all India rank of 645 in his sixth attempt. He said, “This was my final attempt at cracking the exams. Seeing senior officers in the force over the years, I too was inspired to serve my country in a better manner which is why I on kept trying.”Alam has been posted with the central police control room in Haiderpur since 2016. Assistant commissioner of police (PCR) Jitendra Kumar, who had background similar to his, in Hindi literature, helped him study. “We never discouraged or stopped him from taking leaves for exam preparations. He was a high school graduate when he joined the force and now, after completing his graduation and postgraduation while in service, he has cleared the civil services as well. We are all proud of him,” the ACP said.When asked if he realised the similarities he shared with the fictional police officer Imran Ansari of popular web series Pataal Lok (he too clears the civil services exams while in service), Alam said, “ I recently saw Paatal Lok and I did happen to think I too might clear the exams while working hard. And that happened today.” Delhi commissioner of police SN Shrivastava also took to Twitter to congratulate the successful aspirants. “Very happy to share that at least 5 successful Civil Services aspirants come from Delhi Police family. Heartiest congratulations to Vishakha d/o ASI Rajkumar (6 rank), Navneet d/o Insp Mann (33), ACP Natisha (37), ACP Garima (459),Ct Firoz (645),” he tweeted.Natisha Mathur and Garima Dahiya are assistant commissioners of police (under training). Navneet Mann, 24, a resident of Naraina Vihar and an engineering graduate from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, said, “My father’s work in the police force inspired me to work in the public service and on ground. During second or third year of engineering, I decided to opt for civil services.” The second all India woman topper is also from Delhi. Vishakha Yadav, whose father is an assistant sub-inspector with the Delhi Police, secured all India rank 6. “It was her mother who encouraged her to get into civil services after some of her friends were talking about it,” said ASI RajKumar, who is posted in Dwarka district.“Vishakha has always performed well academically and so we were confident that she would clear the exams but being ranked sixth countrywide was unbelievable,” Kumar said.Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal congratulated Vishakha and tweeted,“Heartiest congratulations to Vishakha D/o Delhi Police ASI Raj Kumar for securing 06th rank in UPSC 2019. Wish her successful & fulfilling career. Vishakha Indeed a proud moment for @DelhiPolice!”.Thirty candidates who trained at the Residential Coaching Academy (RCA) of Jamia Millia Islamia have cleared the exam this year. “Around 25 of them were residing in RCA and five were trained at the mock interview programme of the centre,” the university’s media coordinator Ahmad Azeem said. Vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar congratulated the students and said she would extend all support to the institute to better its performance in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/civil-services-exam-results-delhi-and-delhi-police-have-much-reason-to-cheer/story-cQzjQ0E8b5nCCE0TCqdjdJ.html
05-08-2020||Pune||15-min power outage at Pune’s Naidu hosp sparks panic, exposes age-old genset||PUNE Patients admitted to Naidu hospital, the only infectious disease control hospital run under the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) ambit, experienced a traumatic 15 minutes on Monday night when power supply to the premises shut down. The civic body is to now install a second generator and appoint a dedicated electrician to ensure no further power supply problems. Following the incident, PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal called a meeting on Tuesday, attended by civic health chief Dr Ramchandra Hankare and the head of the electricity department, Srinivas Kandul.“During the meeting, we discussed steps to avoid a similar incident in the future by ensuring people from the maintenance department are on duty during the night and also, to install a UPS which can act as a quick power backup until the generator takes over,” said Kandul. NCP leader Nitin Kadam said, “At 11:45 pm I got a call from one of the staff at the hospital, who said that there has been a power failure. This was particularly dangerous for those in the ICU. The power failure lasted for 15 minutes and the staff and patients, both panicked. In the last 15 days, the hospital has reported a power failure thrice. Can’t the civic body get a proper generator for the critical patients at least?”According to Kandul, the Naidu hospital has a generator back up of 125kv which, due to being old, takes time to switch on.Agarwal said she has instructed officials to visit the electricity department on Wednesday with a request to ensure no power cuts at key hospitals treating Covid patients. During the meeting, Hankare stated that the hospital ventilators have a 30-minute power back up. “Whatever has happened is a lesson for us. The battery power back up installed started immediately. Only the conversion between the genset and the ventilators did not start, but the battery backup started immediately,” said Hankare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/15-min-power-outage-at-naidu-hosp-sparks-panic-after-age-old-genset-takes-time-to-kick-in/story-qTxpggXiGNlmJN6AOp3pGI.html
05-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s Covid cases cross 63k; eight PMC hospitals remain underutilised||PUNE: When Pune reported Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 positive case during the second week of March this year, the response of Pune Municipal was usual: refer every case to Naidu hospital known for dealing with infectious diseases. While the rise in cases turned Naidu into an overflowing hospital, PMC ignored its other infrastructure, built and lying unused for years. The civic body has not learnt its lesson from previous outbreaks — Sars in 2004 and swine flu in 2009 — to better equip its medical facilities, said health activists, who staged a protest in front of PMC main building on Tuesday. Activists alleged that elected members and civic administration have always been busy building flyovers, cement roads, widen roads, take up mega projects and beautification works and neglected basic sectors like health and education in Pune. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “We are increasing the bed capacity at Dalvi Hospital, Laigude Hospital and other PMC-owned hospitals.” “Despite building infrastructure, many of PMC’s hospitals are lying used at a time when the civic body is spending crores on relatively non-important things,” said Abhijit More, co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. The activists point out that while Covid cases in the city have crossed 63,000 as on August 4, as per the state health department data, PMC is yet to fully utilise the facilities at eight of its hospitals — Balasaheb Thackeray hospital (Mitramandal chowk), Rajmata Jijamata hospital (Mitramandal Chowk), Bindumadhav hospital (Karvenagar), Rajiv Gandhi hospital (Yerawada), Karne hospital (Yerawada), Laigude hospital (Sinhgad road), which is now used as Covid care centre, Dalvi Hospital (Shivajinagar) which has become operational) and underutilised Kamla Nehru hospital. “Instead of spending funds to create jumbo facilities, why does the state and PMC utilise these places as it will remain permanent?” said Kiran Moghe, who along with Sunit SR, Poornima Chikarmane and Medha Thatte, agitated in front of PMC main building. Former municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar, who is now working with the central government and is also the head of the central team visiting the city, accepted that the city’s health sector is neglected. Kumar said, “Even during my tenure as municipal commissioner, we neglected the health sector. A country like India does not have enough testing facility, but we are increasing the numbers. While the elected members discuss many topics at the PMC general body meeting, health issues take a back seat.” PMC and the state government are setting up two jumbo facilities, each at the cost of 70 crore having 800 beds, and a third is also planned. “The example set by the city to handle the swine flu situation was followed by other cities. As municipal commissioner during that period, we focused on contact tracing and testing and it was expected that the health infrastructure would improve to face such outbreaks in future,” said retired bureaucrat and former commissioner Mahesh Zagade. Dr Siddharth Dhende, corporator and former mayor, said, “Many civic hospitals are non-functional. With PMC unable to recruit medical staff, many of its hospitals are run by private parties. Our demand to audit these PMC hospitals run on public-private partnership (PPP) basis is yet to be met.” Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, who was former municipal commissioner, said, “Some of the hospitals and clinics are unused. PMC is trying to utilise it and some have been converted into Covid care centres. We have also strengthened the facilities at Sassoon General hospital.” Medical facility status Rs210 crore: Fund spent to set up three jumbo hospitals 6 months: Functional period of the temporary jumbo hospitals 18 hospitals: Constructed by PMC and lying unused Rs70 crore: Fund released by the state government to strengthen facilities at Sassoon General Hospital The underutilised two hospitals run by the state government — Aundh and Bibvewadi —will be used for Covid care. PMC-owned health infrastructure General hospital: Kamla Nehru Hospital Infectious disease hospital: Naidu Hospital Maternity hospital: 18 Dispensaries: 41 Underutilised and unused civic hospitals Balasaheb Thackeray hospital, Mitramandal chowk Rajmata Jijamata hospital, Mitramandal Chowk Bindumadhav hospital, Karvenagar Rajiv Gandhi hospital, Yerawada Karne hospital, Yerawada Laigude hospital, Sinhgad road (It is now used as Covid care centre) Dalvi Hospital, Shivajingar (becoming operational) Rs50-cr facilities at Kamla Nehru hospital lying unused Pune Municipal Corporation in the last few years has spent more than Rs50 crore to better the facilities at Kamla Nehru hospital. The civic administration purchased medical equipment and set up an ICU ward, but these facilities are not been used for patients yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-covid-cases-cross-58k-eight-pmc-hospitals-remain-underutilised/story-0o5hvAairpH2Y03rfTWVkO.html
