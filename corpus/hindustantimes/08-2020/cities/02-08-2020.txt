Senior officers said the husband, a labour worker, had lost his job during the lockdown and the family had been facing financial problems. The man killed his wife after a heated quarrel, the police said. While the man is at large, the police said efforts to nab him are underway.According to the police, the Narela police station received a call around 8:25am from a woman reporting that her sister has been killed. The police team found the woman, who worked at a factory in Narela Industrial Area, unconscious on the bed. “She was taken to a hospital where the doctors pronounced her dead. Because the prima facie cause of death seems to be strangulation, the body was sent for a post-mortem examination and a case of murder registered,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.A preliminary enquiry revealed that the woman’s husband, Rehmattullah, 28, is on the run. “The woman’s sister lives nearby, and alleged that Rehmattullah killed her sister before fleeing. She said her sister is survived by her three children aged 6,5, and three-and-a-half years old. The woman’s sister and other relatives also told the police that the couple used to argue often,” the officer said. “Rukhsaar had recently also left Rehnattullah’s house and had gone to her parent’s house, but he visited her parent’s house and brought her back for Eid. Even after that, they repeatedly quarrelled over their economic problems, and it appears that during one such argument on Saturday night the man strangled his wife in a fit of rage. The children were all asleep when the murder took place,” the officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Gaurav Sharma said they have formed multiple teams to nab the suspect. “The husband is our prime suspect so far. A case of murder has been registered to probe the matter. We have strong leads and the accused will soon be arrested,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-murders-wife-after-argument-in-narela-suspect-at-large/story-mPzQGceGHJZYOhI7tfemtJ.html
02-08-2020||Gurugram||Gaps in July air quality data in Gurugram, Faridabad||Air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram and Faridabad installed in January failed to transmit or capture over a week’s worth of data in July, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) national air quality index website.The two districts have four air quality monitors each, including the new ones - two in Gurugram and three in Faridabad. They record fine and coarse particulate matter concentrations, while also recording the levels of carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, all of which are calculated to arrive at the air quality index.While the two new Gurugram monitors are located on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road and sector 51, Faridabad’s are located in sector 11, sector 30 and VK Chowk in the New Industrial Township area. After testing, they began operations on March 6.While March and June went off without a glitch, gaps in data on the CPCB website emerged in July -- the Gurugram-Faridabad Road one missed 11 days’ data, sector 51 lost data for seven days. In Faridabad, the one at VK Chowk missed 11 days’ data, sector 30 did not have data for four days, while sector 11 lost nearly the month. JB Sharma, senior scientist and head of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) air quality cell in Panchkula, initially attributed these deficiencies to a possible lack of upkeep since the lockdown, that began on March 25 just days after the new monitors began transmitting data to the CPCB server in Delhi. Sharma later said, “I can’t say for sure as the matter has just been brought to my attention. It may also be a case of poor internet connectivity or erratic electricity supply, because of which the data is not being reflected in the CPCB server. I will have to check up with the regional officers of the districts before making further comments.” Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer in Gurugram, and Dinesh Kumar, his counterpart in Faridabad, did not responded to requests for comment on Saturday. [QUOTE TO BE ADDED IF IT ARRIVES]Sachin Panwar, a city based air quality scientist, said, “Data from new monitors is valuable so long as it is available to researchers, scientists and policy makers. Gurugram and Faridabad are both very data deficient when it comes to air pollution, and we have been waiting for several years for the situation to change. It is good that we have got these new monitors, but maintaining credible data is a hands on process and regular checks need to be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gaps-in-july-air-quality-data-in-gurugram-faridabad/story-QPD8qV6nRo36ypFZ3vrtpK.html

Students have alleged that until last year, hard copies of the college prospectus –which highlights the courses available at the institute and the annual fees charged – were priced between ₹50-250. However this year, some colleges are allegedly charging ₹500 for a soft copy of the same prospectus. “Reputed colleges receive thousands of student applications and charging ₹500 from each means they will earn lakhs without spending on printing of the prospectus. Students are being cheated in this process,” said a statement released by the ASA on Sunday. In a letter addressed to the vice-chancellor of the University of Mumbai and the state education minister, ASA has demanded immediate action against these colleges. “If no action is taken soon, we will hold a protest at the university campus,” added a member of ASA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/colleges-in-mumbai-charging-500-for-soft-copy-of-prospectus-alleges-students-body/story-aSeWW66e7DoKpioEos5qgO.html

According to the police, the owner of the store Anil Jain, in his statement said that on November 19 last year, three gold bars weighing around 1,375g worth ₹50 lakh were sent from his other store in Chennai. The gold bars were locked in the vault of their Vitthalwadi branch at Kalbadevi. “On December 5, when Jain checked the accounts, stocks and details of other business dealings, he discovered that the gold bars were missing from the safe vault. When he enquired with his employees, they said they were unaware about the gold bars,” said an officer from LT Marg police station. The complainant then checked the CCTV footage and discovered that someone tampered the dates of the CCTV camera and it showed the dates of the year 2008, the first information report filed by the police stated. The complainant checked the entire CCTV feed and found the movement of three employees suspicious, said another police officer. He then approached the police. The police first conducted a preliminary probe, which took months. On July 31, the police registered a criminal case against three employees of the store under section 408 (criminal breach of trust by a servant) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The police have also questioned some employees of the store and would be interrogating more employees to find out who stole the gold bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-staffers-of-south-mumbai-jewellery-store-booked-for-stealing-gold-bars-worth-50-lakh/story-u4owu1FBJeNNLG7x15nI1J.html

02-08-2020||Mumbai||Parents initiate social media campaign urging SoBo school to reduce fees||Parents of several students of Gopi Birla Memorial School in Walkeshwar have started an online campaign urging the school management to reduce school fees as several parents have faced losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the past few days, several parents have taken to social media and raised concerns about the school’s fee structure. “The school is charging around ₹1.9 lakh for senior KG which is not an issue for us otherwise, but in the current scenario where so many people have lost their jobs and faced losses in business we had requested the authorities to reduce fees. The school, however, did not listen to our demands,” said a parent of a Class 2 student on the condition of anonymity. Parents alleged that the school has stopped providing videos and online classes to children whose parents demanded a reduction in fees. “This is against the Right to Education (RTE) Act and is unjust. We had requested them to waive off charges for extra-curriculars like yoga, music etc which are not taking place currently,” said another parent. Nearly 500 parents are yet to pay the fees and have said that they would pay it if the school agrees to reduce some charges.When HT tried contacting the school, school principal Veena Srivastava said, “I do not owe you or anyone an explanation about fees. Our Parents Teacher Association has approved the fee structure.” Parents, however, said the school has not formed a PTA by due process over the past three years. “We have requested them to elect a PTA as per the process, but the school has not responded to our demand,” said a parent.The school has scheduled assessments for students in the first week of August and parents are worried about having to give it a miss. An official from the education department said the school cannot stop students from writing their exams in any case. “While fee fixation is the PTA’s prerogative, no child can be denied right to education. Parents can write to the department,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-initiate-social-media-campaign-urging-sobo-school-to-reduce-fees/story-Vn75m20zIB6Z97UqmFvBzH.html

The recent announcement of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) National Defence Academy (NDA) exam clashing with the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains exam on September 6 has led to speculations that the National Testing Authority (NTA) might once again postpone JEE exams, which left students and parents unhappy.On Sunday, parents and students started an online petition to not postpone JEE and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) UG exams any further. At present, JEE Mains is scheduled to take place between September 1 and 6 whereas NEET-UG is scheduled to take place on September 13.By Sunday evening, close to a 1,000 parents and students had signed the online petition. They also took to social media platforms to reach out to the state government, education ministry as well as NTA officials. “These students have been studying more than 12 hours a day for over two years, and every time the exams get postponed, students are losing hope and concentration,” said a parent. Many have also suggested that exams be conducted during lockdown in order to ensure that only those involved with the examination be allowed to step out of their houses. “The government can impose a strict lockdown for a day and spread out all entrance exam candidates across several schools and colleges in the state in order to ensure social distancing. Student could also be asked to present a basic Covid report,” suggested another parent. Some parents have also approached Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, suggesting that any further delay in conducting entrance exams will mentally affect aspirants.No official word regarding the entrance exams has been released yet.The Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation on July 29 filed an intervention in the Supreme Court against the University Grants Commission’s decision to allow final-year exams. The teachers’ union highlighted that Covid-19 cases in the country and in Maharashtra are increasing and added that conducting final-year exams for lakhs of students will be impossible for universities and teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-defer-jee-and-neet-ug-exams-say-parents-students-in-online-petition/story-5bY93R7F63DEWaKLLGOB4L.html

02-08-2020||Mumbai||HC invites complaints against negligent Covid officials||Observing that public servants had not taken adequate measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas which saw a spike in recent days, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has decided to receive complaints against negligent officials. The order was passed after the bench undertook an inspection visit to Jalna court and found that Covid-19 cases were increasing rapidly as officials were not conducting proper checks on persons returning from Mumbai and Pune. The bench, in an earlier order in response to a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL), had said that it would conduct inspection of various areas to check whether reports of public servants not doing their duty diligently were true. A division bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar, while hearing the suo motu PIL initiated after reports that many public servants assigned to Covid duty had been absent or were not contributing towards the containment of the spread, had passed orders asking authorities to take strict action against errant public servants. The court had also said that it would undertake inspection of Covid care centres, hospitals and health care centres to see whether public officials had returned to duty. During the hearing of the PIL on July 31, the bench observed that the Aurangabad administration had done a good job in containing the spread of the virus, but in Jalgaon, Nanded and other areas under the jurisdiction of the bench there have not been efforts to check persons coming from Mumbai and Pune. The court observed that during its visit to Jalna court it had seen that the officials had a very casual approach and were not asking travellers for required passes, which led to a rapid increase in Covid cases in rural areas. The court also observed that unlike cities, rural families did not disclose information if anyone contracted the infection and the authorities failed to anticipate this situation. The court then directed the authorities to follow up on whether their orders were being adhered to. “The authorities may send some persons in disguise to confirm that the officials at such points are doing the duty. Unless that is done, things will not improve,” the bench said. It further said, “This court is now feeling it necessary to allow all those persons who have grievance with regard to the care and treatment of infected persons and others to approach this court directly. They may give grievance in writing to this court either by post or on e-mail or through advocate.” The court then directed the public prosecutor to see that the part of order, particularly the intention of the court to consider individual complaint, is given publicity up to village level and posted the matter for hearing on August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-invites-complaints-against-negligent-covid-officials/story-r6hm86xBZlK8vENkuEQJ3K.html
02-08-2020||Mumbai||Civic body releases video on ‘Chase the Patient’ policy||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has released a video about its “Chase the Patient” policy, which was inaugurated on June 8, by starting ward-level war rooms for decentralised bed management to help Covid-19 patients get hospital beds or medical attention on time. This initiative came soon after BMC’s decision that all laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests must inform the civic body about positive patients first. In May, BMC had asked all laboratories to give Covid-19 test results within 48 hours and inform the civic body by midnight. Civic officials then clean the list of names, such as removing names which are repeated, sorting names of patients who are already in institutional quarantine as high-risk contacts, within 7.30 am. The names are then segregated ward wise and sent to respective war rooms so that they can contact patients post 8am. Based on whether a patient has symptoms, comorbidity and whether he or she has a scope to be quarantined at home, the war room coordinates hospital bed allotment. A BMC official visits homes of positive patients before they are admitted to hospitals or quarantine centres. The move came after BMC received a number of complaints regarding unavailability of hospital beds in April and May where patients had to wait several hours to get a hospital bed. While the process has been ongoing, the civic body termed it ‘Chase the Patient’ and publicised it via posting a video on social media platforms.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said, “This is a unique bed allotment system for Covid patients. Hospital beds are allotted by BMC officials who visit the patients at their residences and either ask them to isolate at home or move them to the hospital in BMC ambulances. Patients need not step out of their homes or call anyone to get a hospital bed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-body-releases-video-on-chase-the-patient-policy/story-rqjTC7DQu574yIzgFhmSpL.html

The incident came to light on August 1 after the mother of the 16-year-old survivor approached Amboli police to file a case against the accused. The girl’s mother, in her statement to the police, said, “My daughter did not speak about it as her father had threatened her of dire consequences if she disclosed his crime to anyone. But after she realised that her father would not stop assaulting her, she finally gathered the courage and confided in me.” The police registered a case under sections 376 (2) (F) (being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman), 376 (2) (i) (commits rape, on a woman incapable of giving consent) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault), 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 8 (punishment for sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Senior inspector Someshwar Kamthe from Amboli police station said,” We are investigating the case further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-arrested-for-sexually-assaulting-16-year-old-daughter-since-2016/story-ID7Scc8dskkwxotBTfA86N.html
02-08-2020||City||July added most Covid cases to Ghaziabad’s tally but lower positivity, fatality rates bring relief||Ghaziabad Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the grim month of July, when Ghaziabad saw the maximum number of cases yet since the virus broke out here, ended with a silver lining for the district, with both, the positivity rate as well as the fatality rate having declined. While the test positivity rate in July has declined to 4.69% from 7.54% in June earlier, the fatality rate, which had touched about 4% in June, has come down drastically to below 1% last month, officials said. However, the district reported the highest number of positive cases in July so far, which stood at 3,322. Officials attributed the sudden spike to increase in the number of tests through rapid antigen kits, through which they discovered Covid cases in the district. According to official records, overall, the district at the end of July had a total of 4,937 Covid-19 cases with a fatality rate of 1.29% and a high discharge rate of 83.32%, with 759 active cases. The first case was reported in the district on March 5. With regards to sampling, the district till June 30 had completed only 21,422 sampling, while a total of 83,787 samples were taken up in July alone. The introduction of rapid antigen kits helped the district achieve overall sampling/testing of 1,05,209 people till July 31. “The month of June alone had about 1,310 Covid-19 cases. But 51 deaths had taken place due to the infection in June, the highest in all the five months, from March to July. The sampling process got a major boost with introduction of rapid antigen kits on June 26. Since then, we have conducted about 61,258 tests with rapid antigen kits. So, this helped us reduce our case positivity rate to 4.69% as against 7.54% in the month of June,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named. “There were nine Covid-related deaths in July, as against four till May 31, and 51 in June alone. So, our fatality rate touched an all time high of about 3.89% in June while it was only 0.27% in July. So, overall, July had the highest number of Covid-19 cases, but we assume it as a month of recovery in terms of reduced positivity rate as well as death rate,” the officer said. The month of July was also favourable for the district in terms of recovery rate, which in May stood at an average of 76.39%, while it fell to 45.69% by the end of June. However, by July 31, the recovery rate improved considerably to 83.32%, with a total of 4,114 patients having been discharged.Notably, the district had just 305 Covid-19 cases till May 31, which rose to 1,615 at the end of June. The district crossed the tally of 1,000 positive cases on June 23. July was the month when the district touched the figure of 2,000 cases (on July 4), 3,000 cases (July 11) and 4,000 (July 20). The district touched the 5,000-mark on August 1. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the case positivity rate declined due to high number of tests. “There was a major focus on ramping up testing across the district, and we used rapid antigen kits on a larger scale. The idea was to identify maximum number of suspected cases and refer the positive patients to Covid hospitals for early treatment. For this, our dedicated control room and our surveillance teams have been working round the clock,” said Pandey. “Our capabilities of testing through RT-PCR method will also be strengthened once our new lab starts at MMG Hospital,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/july-added-most-covid-cases-to-ghaziabad-s-tally-but-lower-positivity-fatality-rates-bring-relief/story-E1xeDa9KC0kZ2IDHe1j8HK.html

Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over the handling of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Raut in his weekly column Rokhthok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, said 10 crore people have lost their livelihoods and 40 crore families are affected by the situation.“How long will people spend their days on mere hopes and assurances? In the past 15 years, not a single problem has been resolved. Israeli PM [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a friend of PM Modi. Due to the economic crisis and Covid-related problems, the people of Israel are holding demonstrations on the streets and are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation. The same situation can also happen in India,” the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) said in the column. Raut added that with so many job losses, economic leadership has become more important than the leadership in the battlefield. “Millions are sitting unemployed today. Innumerable claims of inflation, poverty and unemployment have erupted in the society. So, economic leadership is more important than leadership in the battlefield,” the Shiv Sena leader said, adding, “Nobody is talking about the crisis. It is easy to say that crisis gives rise to opportunity. But they [government] don’t know how people are dealing with the crisis.” In a dig at the BJP, Raut said the central government’s measures to tackle the economic situation include procuring Rafale fighter jets, reciting Hanuman Chalisa , destabilising Rajasthan government and coming back to power in Maharashtra on its own. “The stoves of 40 crore families have been extinguished. What is the solution to their problems? Bhoomipujan of Ram temple will be done. BJP needs Rajasthan, it will happen. Rafale aircraft from France also came to Ambala. But how are those who lost jobs in this period coping with the situation? Will the rulers ever tell them?” the Saamana executive editor asked sarcastically.The Sena leader also criticised the government for “celebrating” Rafale’s homecoming amid the “grave threat” of Covid-19 in India. He wrote previous governments have procured other fighter jets such as Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, but such a “celebration” was never carried out. “Will Rafale jets with the bomb and missile-carrying capacity be able to destroy the unemployment crisis and economic challenges?” Raut asked.He added that the situation will force many citizens to be “slaves” again. “Earlier, the British enslaved Indians and took them to Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana and Suriname. People will be willing to go as slaves to such places even now. And if the rulers do not acknowledge this, then they can continue their celebrations over Rafale,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/people-will-ask-pm-modi-to-resign-if-job-crisis-continues-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut/story-OOZzWUJtoFXLHlslCVhXkM.html
02-08-2020||Mumbai||97% Covid-positive patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic||Maharashtra recorded 150,658 active Covid-19 cases till Sunday afternoon, of which 97% are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Only 2% are critical and 1% are on oxygen support, show data from the state health department.For the last 10 days, the state has reported 7,000 new Covid-19 cases on an average, daily. This has pushed the cumulative number of infections in the state to close to 450,000 cases – the highest in the country. But doctors are relieved as, at present, only 3,111 patients are critical and undergoing treatment in intensive care units (ICU).Experts claim this is a good sign because chances of the spread of infection from asymptomatic patients are less. “The infectious period of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, in symptomatic individuals may begin within two days. It persists for over 10 days after the starting of symptoms. But in asymptomatic patients, the chances of transmitting the virus are less as these individuals don’t sneeze or cough. So, having more asymptomatic patients helps to break the chain of infection,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.Most patients are identified through contact tracing. Dr AR Gita, district health officer (DHO) of Aurangabad, which recorded 4,943 active Covid-19 cases till Saturday, said, “We have appointed teachers and local volunteers to trace close contacts of those infected. It is done in two ways. The teachers call them regularly to check on their health. If anyone complains of symptoms, we immediately test and isolate them. If we fail to track them, our local medical volunteers visit them at home. This has helped in early diagnosis and isolations.”Till Saturday, 2,011 patients with oxygen saturation is below 95% were kept on oxygen support in hospitals. “We have seen that people between the age group of 31 and 40 are prone to Covid-19. As this is a younger group with higher immunity, they often don’t develop symptoms, and gradually recover,” said Dr Awate.A similar trend has been noticed with the rapid antigen testing in Mumbai. Rapid antigen testing helps to identify antigens of Covid-19 in the body within 30 minutes. As HT reported earlier, almost 90% of the close contacts of infected patients who undergo rapid antigen testing are identified as silent carriers of the virus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/97-covid-positive-patients-are-asymptomatic-or-mildly-symptomatic/story-oNgUvQXCU7fRUPVC3yI9mM.html

According to the official figures, the period of July 21-31 witnessed about 30% rise in the testing as compared to that of the previous 10-day period.The district administration has attributed the rise in testing since July 21 to home isolation facility granted to patients and increasing awareness among the masses. According to the figures of the district health department, about 32,120 tests were conducted between July 21 and July 31, while a total of 24,553 tests were conducted during the previous 10-day period from July 11 to July 20. Also, about 27,000 tests were done from July 1 to July 10. Notably, during the period of July 2-12, the UP government had directed for a special surveillance drive across the district to trace patients with co-morbidity and also those having symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). During the drive, special teams were deployed for door-to-door surveys and to figure out the suspected cases, which were later tested. “The rise in testing activities after home isolation was allowed is an encouraging sign. Now, more people are coming in to get themselves tested. It (home isolation) is one of the major factors which have led more people to come for testing. Now, the testing centres are providing walk-in facility where anyone can come for testing. Further, there has been more awareness among the public, and their faith in the administration has got strengthened,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The Ghaziabad district has static testing booths in Vaishali, Indirapuram, MMG Hospital and Women Hospital. Besides, testing centres have been set up at IMS college Dasna, four community health centres and one primary health centre at Bhojpur. The administration has started distributing “testing slips” among the residents. Such a slip, a copy of which is with the health department, carries the details of the resident. “Our survey teams are now distributing testing slips to households. Residents having the slips can go to the nearest centre for testing. We are also monitoring the distributed slips to know whether the residents availed testing or not. We have enough rapid antigen kits, which have a major share in overall testing. Since the kit provides result within 30-40 minutes, people are availing the testing facility,” Pandey added. Till July 31, the Ghaziabad district conducted 105,099 tests, of which 61,258 tests were done through rapid antigen kits. “Initially, the residents were reluctant to come for testing as they knew they would be taken to a Covid hospital if found positive. Now, they know that they have an option to stay at home. So, more people are coming in for testing. For instance, we now have about 40-50 walk-ins per day at our booth in Vaishali, where earlier only 15-20 arrived in a day. Similarly, the number at our booth in Indirapuram has also increased to about 70-80 as against 35-40 per day,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. “About a fortnight ago, we introduced three mobile testing vans. So these vans have also helped increase testing,” the officer said. According to the officials, the district at present has 188 asymptomatic patients who have qualified for the home isolation facility. Residents’ bodies have also echoed the similar views. “The residents have got encouraged for testing as they know they have an option to stay at home. It has come as a major relief for middle and high income group residents and has also reduced the burden on government facilities,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ association. Under the home isolation facility, the UP government allowed asymptomatic patients to stay at home with certain conditions. Prior to the facility, every positive case was getting admitted to an appropriate Covid hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-testing-increases-since-july-21-when-home-isolation-facility-allowed/story-R5buN5DlknYe8RecRKiM5J.html
02-08-2020||Mumbai||IMD predicts heavy to very heavy rainfall in Mumbai till Thursday||After sunny conditions on Sunday and no rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, the city is likely to witness a week-long spell of intense rain from Monday onwards. The regional weather bureau issued an orange alert till Thursday with the possibility of heavy to very heavy rain on Monday and Thursday and extremely heavy rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. A red alert has been issued for Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg for Monday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) headquarters in Delhi issued a red alert (extremely heavy rain warning) for the entire Konkan coast for Tuesday. Pune, Kolhapur and Satara are also likely to receive heavy showers on Tuesday and Wednesday. The weather bureau said owing to the strengthening of monsoon currents under the influence of a low pressure weather system developing over north Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, two major weather factors would enhance rain activity over the Konkan coast, including Mumbai and interior Maharashtra. “Factors such as the east-west wind convergence and shifting off the monsoon trough over the southern portions of the west coast becoming more active are likely to strengthen westerly to southwesterly winds drawing moisture from the sea and paving the way for intense rain spells,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. Independent meteorologists said the city could expect around 500-550mm rain over the next four days. The average August rain for the city is 585mm. “Rain activity is expected to pick up from Monday afternoon and intensify between Tuesday and Thursday. One of these days, either on Wednesday or Thursday, is likely to see more than 200mm rainfall (extreme rains),” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. IMD’s orange alert would not be enough for the disaster preparedness considering the forecast, said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, the United Kingdom. “The entire Konkan coast, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, needs to be put on the highest alert level between Monday and Wednesday. The offshore trough is set to intensify under the influence of this season’s first monsoon depression over Bay of Bengal. As a result, MMR will witness heavy rain, daily rainfall exceeding 100-150 mm, on Monday and Tuesday,” said Deoras. “Water logging and disruptions such as rain water entering houses and damage to weak structures is expected during this period. Those living in low-lying areas need to take necessary precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/imd-predicts-heavy-to-very-heavy-rainfall-in-mumbai-till-thursday/story-khLA31bC1tcDDpsRr1lqJL.html
02-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees dip in Covid fatality rate||The city’s fatality rate due to Covid-19 in Mumbai has decreased to 5.5% by the end of July, from 5.8%-5.9% seen in June and beginning of July. Moreover, the number of daily deaths has reduced to 40 and 60 in the past two weeks, from at least 70 daily deaths or more (on some days) in May and June. According to figures from the state government, Mumbai had a fatality rate of 5.8% on June 30 and until the first week of July. On June 16, the state government reconciled the number of deaths in the state, including Mumbai, and added 862 deaths to the city’s toll, taking the fatality rate to 5.2% from 3.7% in a single day. Citing reconciliation of figures as a recurring exercise that would continue for over one month, BMC periodically continued adding deaths that had occurred in May or earlier in June, to the toll. Subsequently, around 750 more deaths were cumulatively added to the city’s total toll until July 3, taking the fatality rate to 5.8% on July 3. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 49 deaths, taking the toll to 6,447. The fatality rate is now 5.5%. The per-day fatality rate on Sunday stood at 4.4% (calculated from deaths recorded on Sunday vis-à-vis new cases recorded on the day). Mumbai recorded 1,105 new cases, taking the case tally to 116,436. There are 21,394 active cases in Mumbai as of Sunday. On August 1, Mumbai recorded 45 new deaths, 53 on July 31 and July 30, respectively, 60 on July 29, 55 on July 28, 39 on July 27, 57 on July 26, 52 on July 25 and 54 on July 24. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The number of deaths reported per day has gone down to some extent. This is noticed after BMC launched ‘Save Lives’. However, every death is alarming and every life is precious. We cannot become complacent that the number of deaths per day is reducing. We have to bring the number down further. Deaths are still occurring in a scenario where there is late reportage of the infection, especially if patients have comorbidity.” ‘Save Lives’ strategy was launched by BMC on June 30, with nine points to reduce the number of deaths. Kakani said, “Save Lives strategy included locating patients at high risk of dying due to the infection, ensuring they are given the right line of treatment, ensuring all medicines are given the required number of times every day, and nothing is missed, video calls between attending physicians and senior doctors. The line of treatment for serious or critical patients is carefully chosen, and has to be approved by the head of department and head of the institution. We are also giving bed pans to patients at the right time, so they don’t leave their beds to use the washroom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-dip-in-covid-fatality-rate/story-VBkP05tUNvZJ1kOtb50oQI.html

His latest Covid test showed he was negative.According to the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), corporator Sunil Surve, 54, was on oxygen support at his home after he was discharged, as he suffered from breathlessness. Two days ago his health deteriorated and he was admitted to Maxlife Hospital in Ulhasnagar. He died at around 4.30 pm on Sunday at the hospital. “He had recovered from Covid-19 infection and was discharged 15 days ago, after 23 days of treatment. He suffered from breathlessness after being discharged and hence was on oxygen support. He has a history of bypass surgery and heart attack; his immunity was also low,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. A five-time corporator, Surve is one of the senior Sena leaders in the city. He is survived by a wife, a son and daughter. Rajendra Chaudhari, president of Shiv Sena’s Ulhasnagar unit, said, “The party was relieved when he recovered from Covid-19 as he had already suffered from a heart attack and gone through a bypass surgery. He was also a dialysis patient. Doctors claimed both his kidneys have failed in the past two days. We were planning to shift him to some other hospital, but he died before that.” “This is a great loss for the party as he was a senior leader and had worked for the party and the city for long time,” added Chaudhari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sena-leader-dies-15-days-after-discharge/story-vQPUYTUUdTM1FAhCUKyITJ.html

02-08-2020||City||Sushant Singh Rajput suicide: Maharashtra CM meets top cops||Amid a stand-off between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday held a briefing with director general of police Subodh Jaiswal and city police commissioner Parambir Singh at his official residence, Varsha, in Malabar Hill. The CM held the meeting in the backdrop of the tug-of-war over the probe between the Mumbai and Bihar Police as well as Opposition’s demands to transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A senior Sena leader said Thackeray was irked by the allegations made in social media about “so-called lapses” in the investigation and wanted a clear update on the trajectory of the city police probe. Thackeray had slammed the BJP a day earlier for politicising the issue and not showing trust in Mumbai Police’s capabilities. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had called for CBI and Enforcement Directorate probe, pointing out that people had lost faith in police probe, given the number of conspiracy theories and doubts that were floating around. On Sunday, party MLA from Andheri Ameet Satam wrote to the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) probing the case to investigate certain aspects into the deaths of Rajput and Salian to “clear the air and pave the road towards reaching a logical conclusion”. The letter sent to DCP of zone 9, Abhishek Trimukhe, raises six questions, asking the city police to look into the parties that Salian and Rajput had participated in or hosted before their deaths. It sought clarity over the findings of the post-mortem report of Salian as well as shedding light on whether she was part of any party before she died and who were present at this party. “Whom did she speak to or message on the phone 24 hours before her death? Are the mobile tower location of the place she was when she died being probed to find out who all were present and whom she met before she died,” asked the letter. Satam also asked if Rajput’s sister’s statement has been recorded to find out whether the actor was scared or threatened after Salian’s death. He also raised questions over whether Rajput used different mobile SIMs from June 8 to June 14. The letter refers to a party Rajput attended or hosted on June 13, a day before his death. “Who all were present for the party? Is the CCTV footage of his building and surrounding area recorded,” asked the letter. The asked if the police have questioned all three servants in Rajput’s house as well as his two close friends Sandeep Singh and Mahesh Shetty and manager Siddharth Pithani. He also called for reinvestigation into the preserved viscera of Rajput. The issue of parties and presence of others at these get-togethers was also raised by former minister and BJP city chief Ashish Shelar on Sunday. Shelar tweeted: “There is a constant reference about celebrity parties in the context of Sushant Singh Rajput’s case. During lockdown when one could not even attend the last rites of one’s mother, under whose blessings did these parties continue? Ministers? Officials? CBI inquiry must happen.” Even senior Sena minister and a close aide of Thackeray, Anil Parab, raised the issue, a day ago. State home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday condemned the “politicisation” of the Rajput case. He said, “The death by suicide case of Sushant Singh Rajput is being probed by Mumbai police. Even though a case has been registered in Patna, under Criminal Procedure chapter 12 and 13 the investigation is carried out where the incident happens and the trial is also held in their jurisdiction. The Mumbai Police is investigating this case closely and are capable of unearthing the truth. Despite this demand is being made for political dividends to transfer the case to CBI. I condemn this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-suicide-maharashtra-cm-meets-top-cops/story-JL2ISVC1OxpRJ2RmibbERK.html

02-08-2020||City||Film producer held for fraud||New Delhi: Delhi police’s economic offences wing (EOW) on Sunday said they arrested a Bollywood producer for allegedly cheating nearly 100 people by promising them good returns in an investment scheme. At least 88 complaints have been received so far against the person named Chanderkant Sharma, seniors officers said . Joint commissioner of police (EOW) OP Mishra said the complainants said they were trapped into a pyramid investment scheme -- a fraudulent system of making money based on recruiting an ever-increasing number of investors -- floated by Sharma through his company, Cine Mirchi Productions Private Limited.“The directors of the company are Chanderkant Sharma and his wife Neeraj Sharma. Through this company, Sharma produced two movies -- The Great Indian Casino, which has been released, and Lust Wala Love, which is yet to be released. The complainants have alleged that the company lured people with a promise of high returns of more than 70% by investments in entertainment sector and other undefined projects,” Mishra said.Several bank accounts in Sharma’s name were detected and scrutinised. “A lookout circular was issued against the Sharma to prevent him from fleeing the country but it was learnt he was continuing with the investment schemes and relaunching his fraudulent plan from unidentified locations. This input was developed and we zeroed in on him in Chandigarh and arrested him,” the officer said.Sharma was also booked under section 506 of the IPC for criminal intimidation because many complainants said he threatened them, he said.The joint commissioner said Sharma’s modus operandi was to indulge in extensive publicity campaigns of his business. “He used to publish his photographs with leading Bollywood and Hollywood celebrities and actors to lure investors. Complainants said the couple lured investors by announcing they would make one international movie every year. They held seminars and movie launches in luxury hotels in Delhi and Mumbai,” the officer said. Sharma promised weekly payouts to investors. The approximate amount of money invested by the complainants is approximately Rs 6 crore, he said.The website of Cine Mirchi Productions Pvt Ltd displays no contact information. A mail sent to the company’s email address found online remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/film-producer-held-for-fraud/story-AOwUfEOSSxo1mXvTjqNUzK.html

In an instance of this, the Patiala Police recovered 7,420 litre of lahan (raw material used to distil illicit liquor) and registered 31 cases on Sunday. To put this in perspective, over the past two years, the police had just recovered around 19,000 litre or an average of just 27 litre a day. In these two years, the police have confiscated around 2 lakh liquor being smuggled from neighbouring states, around 10,000 litre of illicit liquor distilled illegally in ‘desi distilleries’, 19,000 litre of lahan, 14,600 litre of spirit and 4,800 litre of spurious liquor from the district. There have been around 1,700 arrests for illegal manufacturing and smuggling of liquor.Despite the registration of 1,823 FIRs (First information reports) under the Excise Act in the past two years, the business of illegal distilling of liquor and smuggling of liquor from neighbouring Haryana and state capital Chandigarh continues unabated.Patiala also has links with the state’s Majha hooch tragedy in Ghanour and Rajpura areas as at least four persons have been arrested. Shambu, Samana, Patran and Ghanour, which share border with Haryana, and the villages situated on the banks of Ghaggar river, have turned havens for brewing and smuggling of illegal liquor.“Over 60% of the FIRs are registered in police stations related to these particular areas,” said a senior police official.Last year, in a major haul, district police conducted raids by the Ghaggar river and recovered 5,000 litre lahan and arrested 18 persons from Patiala district’s Marouri village, which is notorious for bootleggers.Sarpanch Gurmeet Singh said over 70% of the population belong to minority communities and most male members of the village are daily-wagers. “These people have not been getting any lucrative employement offers. They are taking up illicit liquor trade to make both ends meet,” he said. Former MP Dr Dharamvira Gandhi had adopted the village under the central government’s Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, but the fortunes of the village did not change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illicit-liquor-flows-freely-in-patiala-dist-despite-1-823-firs-in-2-years/story-CA70lCI3aO2UF9mseXr0HL.html

02-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s positivity rate goes up to 24.65%, but R naught stays low at 0.8||According to state health department officials, Pune’s average positivity rate for the period between July 20 and August 1, based on the number of cases reported, stands at 24.65 per cent. During the same period, the average R0 (R naught) is 0.8 for the city. This means that for every 100 people tested, 24 are positive and one infected patient is likely to infect less than one person. On July 13, Pune’s R0 was around 0.9 while it was at 4 at the beginning of April. Both the positivity rate and R0 depend on the spread of the virus in the city and help the administration make further policies. The positivity rate determines how many people are positive among those tested while the R naught figure tells us how many people will be infected by those who tested positive. Dr Pradeep Awte of the state surveillance office, said, “The R naught and positivity rate help us understand how effective the non-pharmaceutical measures are, including people following social distancing norms, wearing masks and others. Both of these figures are not necessarily parallel, but are linked to the number of positive cases being reported on the day. Positivity rate will go up as the number of tests are increased which is what is happening currently. We have increased testing rate to five times in just one month across the state. However, if the R naught is less than one, it means that one patient is likely to infect less than one person. For example, if the R naught of Pune is 0.88 then for every 100 new positives, it is likely that they infect 88 more people. To bring down the positivity rate, the testing must be ramped up even more.” Dr Abhay Tidke, district surveillance officer, said, “R naught and positivity rate do not necessarily go hand in hand. More positivity rate only means that we are detecting more positives whereas a lower R naught means that the spread of infection is being contained.” Odd-even rule Meanwhile, the federation of trade association of Pune have written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to reconsider the government’s decision of odd-even for shops. The traders body said during the last four days, PMC conducted a drive and carried out tests for 1,439 workers and shop owners, of which only 37 tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-positivity-rate-goes-up-to-24-65-but-r-naught-stays-low-at-0-8/story-yCYauiQqt1w07fom8FhAoJ.html
02-08-2020||City||Mind your own business, Capt to Kejriwal’s demand for CBI probe into hooch tragedy||Chandigarh In a counter to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the hooch tragedy, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday asked his Delhi counterpart to mind his own business and not to exploit the tragic affair for reviving his defunct Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the state. “So many people have died and all you are interested in is making political meat from the incident. Don’t you have any shame?” asked the CM, of Kejriwal, telling the latter to concentrate on maintaining law and order in his own state. Trashing Kejriwal’s claim that “none of the illicit liquor cases for the past few months had been solved by local police,” the Punjab CM asked the AAP leader to verify his facts before speaking. Citing the recent April 22 case of an illicit liquor factory being busted in district Khanna, Amarinder pointed out that eight accused had been arrested and a manhunt had been launched for seven, who were absconding. In another case, the two kingpins behind an illicit liquor distillery operating in Patiala district were arrested on May 22 and June 13 this year, and on July 10, challan had been filed in the court. Expressing full faith in the Punjab Police, which had shown exemplary speed to take quick action in all recent illicit liquor cases, the CM said Kejriwal’s demand was nothing but a political gimmick. Rather than delay investigation and allow the trail to go cold in the present spurious liquor case by handing over the probe to CBI, he was more interested in ensuring swift action against all those whose greed had cost the state around 100 lives, Amarinder added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mind-your-own-business-capt-to-kejriwal-s-demand-for-cbi-probe-into-hooch-tragedy/story-wZaTrfggDED73vk18RIsgN.html

Hakim had sent her resignation as additional advocate general to chief secretary Vini Mahajan on Saturday night, citing personal reasons. “… given present circumstances and for personal reasons, I find myself unable to continue to be of service to the government of Punjab. I have hence tendered my resignation as additional advocate general with a wish to return to private practice,” she wrote in a note sent out to her colleagues. However, the CM asked the chief secretary to reject the resignation. “@CsPunjab had received her resignation late last night & has been asked by CM@capt_amarinder to reject the same as govt can’t let go of advocate of such exceptional calibre & competence,” tweeted CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral. Hakim was appointed additional AG in April 2017 after Amarinder brought in Nanda as his government’s top law officer. Prior to this, both were practising in the Supreme Court. Hakim has played an important role in AG office and has been appearing in many high-profile cases, including 2015 sacrilege related petitions and state’s mining policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cm-rejects-resignation-of-additional-ag-rameeza-hakim/story-gvZzv5zUIV9FknWsTe5IwK.html

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||62 villages in Ludhiana’s Doraha to get waste management plants||In an effort to clean up villages, the Punjab Water Supply and Sanitation department has sanctioned Rs 2.97 crore for setting up solid waste management plants in 45 villages of the Doraha Block. The move follows a positive response from eight villages in the blocks where such plants have been set up. All villages will be covered soon.For the first time ever, all the 62 villages of the Doraha block will get the plants in the next few months, said deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma. Waste will be collected door to door in the villages to aim for removal of rooris (garbage dumps) from there, he added. Interestingly, dumping of garbage in the neighbourhood had led to a number of fights in the village, because of which women had to walk long distances to dispose of waste, said block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Navdeep Kaur. There were fewer skirmishes in places where the plants had been set up, she added. Kaur, a corona warrior who recovered from the virus in May said that by using panchayat funds and under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, this project had already been implemented in 14 villages of Doraha block. The project was running successfully in the eight villages of Landha, Dau Majra, Aloona Tola, Chankoian Khurd, Bharthala Randhawa, Afjullapur, Ghaloti and Ghangas, she added. Six other villages to be a part of the project included Ghurala, Arraichan, Maksoodda, Cheema, Karodian and Begowal. Following effective waste management, Kaur said the block would soon be developed to complete targets under the Swachh Bharat and Tandrust missions. Doraha was the first block not just in Punjab but in north India that had been chosen for this important project.High quality organic manure was being manufactured by using dry and wet solid waste, sales of which were bringing in money for panchayats, Kaur added.It had generated employment avenues in the villages, she added. Organic manure was given free of cost to the small farmers and being sold to the forest and horticulture department. It was certified by the Punjab Agricultural University as well as the Agriculture Department.Panchayats planned to start sale of this manure through self-help groups by launching a brand at block samiti level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/62-villages-in-ludhiana-s-doraha-to-get-waste-management-plants/story-7goAtvVAFL0CipQXd5a6YO.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College: Covid lockdown halts preparations for centenary celebrations||The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown imposed to contain its spread has halted preparations for centenary celebrations of Punjab Engineering College (PEC) scheduled for next year.The institution will complete 100 years in 2021 and had planned a 16-month long celebration from August 2021 to December 2022. PEC had also constituted a committee earlier this year to work on modalities for the celebrations, but the panel could not meet amid surging Covid cases.An event is scheduled in August next year to mark the beginning of the celebrations, but the institute’s director, Dheeraj Sanghi, said they are not sure if it will be held.“This is not our focus right now. We have started semester online and are trying to provide the best education possible to students,” Sanghi said.PEC had sought a ₹750-crore grant from the administration last year to upgrade infrastructure ahead of its 100th anniversary. The proposal was ratified during a meet of the board of governors on October 12 last year.Now, with the lockdown slowing down the economy, there is no clarity if PEC will receive the major grant.“We cannot seek a major grant from the government right now. We haven’t even sent a reminder to the administration regarding our proposal amid the current crisis,” Sanghi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-covid-lockdown-halts-preparations-for-centenary-celebrations/story-k0qCkluS4hikSIN7ME6FcM.html

Some of the elements have already been incorporated in our waste segregation processes, others will be implemented with this notification,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.“Every plastic waste generator will have to segregate the waste at the source and plastic wastes shall be stored separately from other kinds of wastes within the premises of the waste generator. This responsibility shall fall upon the occupier or manager of the premises. The aforementioned entities shall hand over such segregated plastic waste to the collection agency designated/authorised by the Chandigarh MC,” the draft rules further state.NO BURNING OR DISPOSAL IN DRAINS“The waste generators shall not litter or burn the plastic waste. No generator shall dispose of the plastic waste in drains/unauthorised places within the municipal area,” read the rules.Every person responsible for organising an event in open space, which involves service of food stuffs in plastic or multilayered packaging, will have to segregate and manage the waste generated during such events in accordance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, or the amendments from time to time.Waste generators will even have to pay plastic waste management user fees as stipulated by the MC from time to time.Significantly, the door-to-door segregation started by the MC last year in October came to a grinding halt after the coronavirus pandemic started in March this year. Even before that, the civic body was faltering to achieve waste segregation.Special drives will be conducted by the MC for bulk generators of solid waste such as cinema halls, hotels, educational institutions, shopping halls, hostels and schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/segregation-of-plastic-waste-at-source-soon-to-be-made-mandatory-in-chandigarh/story-z27lckaKS8b2LZl1jDA4PM.html

Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the body’s immune system to fight external organisms like viruses.The survey teams went from house to house in the village and took blood samples of 125 persons in a random manner on the first day. Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi became the first Covid hotspot of the district after 46 cases were reported here in April this year. Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh visited the spot and provided all possible assistance to the teams from ICMR. Dr Singh said that the survey was being conducted in five districts of Punjab including Mohali. He said that serological surveys help to assess how widespread Covid-19 could have become in a community.“Since it is not possible to test everyone, it is not clear how many people may have been infected, especially since most of the patients do not even show symptoms. Detecting antibodies in random sets of people is, therefore, an indirect way of estimating the extent of the spread of the disease in a community,” said the civil surgeon.At present, there are no positive cases in the village and all patients have fully recovered. Dr Manjit Singh said the district health department had already deputed doctors and other staff to assist in carrying out the survey. Deputy medical commissioner Dr Daljit Singh, Dr HS Cheema, Dr Vikrant, health inspector Bhupinder Singh were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/survey-to-detect-coronavirus-antibodies-in-residents-begins-in-mohali-s-jawaharpur-village-125-blood-samples-collected/story-TcKZnNFPih2GnaVj864oPK.html

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Orphanages, destitute homes in trouble as funds dry up amid Covid pandemic||Their school fees has to be paid, computers have to be set up for their online classes, many children require clothes, slippers even medical care. But as donations and funds dry up due to the uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic, non-government organisations (NGOs) running destitute homes and orphanages in and around Chandigarh are finding it a challenge to stay afloat. Some homes have even sent children back to relatives.Dr Harminder Singh, founder of Jyoti Sarup Kanya Asra, a home for 135 girls in Kharar, says it has been months since he bought clothes and slippers for them. Even getting ration to feed them is tough.Sending them back to relatives, however, is not an option. “They are my daughters,” he says.To tide over the crisis, Dr Singh says he has been spending from the destitute home’s rapidly depleting savings, as the monthly expenditure comes to about ₹4.8 lakh. With schools shifting focus to online learning, “we have invested in computers for the children so that their studies do not suffer,” he adds.The home now has 20 computers with a new dish to enable children to keep up with their studies, says Dr Singh.Children sent to relatives“We had no option but to send some children to their relatives,” says Kawar Singh Dhami, chairman of Gur Aasra Trust that runs a destitute home in Palsora village in Sector 55, Chandigarh. Of the 40 residents here, now just 25 including 12 children remain. “People are losing jobs, how can we expect them to donate? We are managing with whatever little money we get as donations,” he adds. Kulbir Kaur Dhami, who manages another orphanage run by the Gur Aasra Trust in Sector 78, Mohali, with about 100 girl residents, is worried about their school fees which has not been paid. “We have not been able to buy their books or school bags.”About ₹3 lakh is required to clear all dues when schools reopen, she says. “We have 60 children who go to school and do not have enough computers for their online classes or the money to buy them. The children have about four mobile phones which they share, but that’s not enough,” adds Kulbir.There are additional worries. A few days back a 15-year-old from Saharanpur found in Dera Bassi was brought to the home. “We are insisting on a Covid-19 test before the child is brought to the home for the safety of the other children,” she says.Where will medicines come from? At Prabh Asra in Mohali, which has 450 residents, including 90 children, new inmates are being refused admission.“We don’t have enough staff, as only those staying on campus are being put on duty. So there is a shortage of space too,” says Rajinder Kaur, who manages the home. It is run by the NGO Universal Disabled Care-Taker Social Welfare Society, founded by Shamsher Singh. Kaur is his wife. “There has been a 90% drop in donations, forcing us to rethink expansion plans. Expenditure on medicines and ration has increased. Surgeries of many inmates are pending,” she adds. So much so, when a pregnant teenage inmate developed complications, Kaur had to knock on many doors to get her ultrasound done as her Aadhaar card did not have the Prabh Asra address where she is lodged currently.“We have 35 school going children but we have managed to provide personal phones with WiFi to 13 students in senior classes. We have also hired teachers to help them with studies as connectivity at times is an issue,” Kaur adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/orphanages-destitute-homes-in-trouble-as-funds-dry-up-amid-covid-pandemic/story-ruc3vGezXP40GjDpyyjOzI.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Will not let Congress govt acquire panchayati land for industrial park forcibly: SAD leader||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and chief of the SAD legislature party in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, on Sunday said that SAD will not let the ruling Congress government take over the panchayati land of Sekhowal village forcibly for setting up of industrial park near Mattewara forest area. The setting up of the park has triggered outrage among nature lover in Ludhiana and residents of the village who are dependent on the panchayati land for their livelihood. Residents of Sekhowal village had staged a protest against the state government and district administration on July 31, alleging administrative high-handedness. The protesters claimed that the administration and police forcibly took the sarpanch, Amrik Kaur, and a few others to sub-tehsil office in Koom Kalan, on Thursday evening, and forced them to give consent for acquisition of 407-acre land for the project. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said the allegations were false and baseless. Dhillon, who is also MLA from Sahnewal constituency, accused the administrative officials for working on the behest of ruling Congress leadership in the state. “If required, Akali dal, under the leadership of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, will take stern steps to curb the atrocities of the Congress government”, Dhillon said. Dhillon, who visited Sekhowal village, said he stands by the people of his constituency. He added that he will raise this matter in Punjab Vidhan sabha. He said that the Akali Dal- BJP government had initiated the cycle valley project at Dhanasu village during its tenure with consent of the people and panchayat of the village. He added that the project will generate employment opportunities in Sahnewal constituency in future. The issue snowballed into a political controversy after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) party leader and leader of the opposition, Harpal Singh Cheema, visited the village on Saturday and showed solidarity with the residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-not-let-congress-govt-acquire-panchayati-land-for-industrial-park-forcibly-sad-leader/story-C5VyIJERodz33h8HPQEXRM.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Sectors closer to villages complain of stray cattle troubles||As the roads of the city are mostly cleared out by 10pm owing to the night curfew in place, many residents of the sectors closer to villages complain that stray cattle begin pouring in by evening, causing them a lot of trouble.President of the Sector 46A resident welfare association (RWA) Rajinder Garh said, “Many cows come here from the nearby village of Faidaan. Most of them are herded back by the farmers, but the older animals are left to wander. We have had many cases where animals have damaged parked vehicles and caused accidents of two-wheelers.”President of the Sector 48 RWA JJ Singh added that cows from Faidaan had become a nuisance in their sector as well and the authorities weren’t doing enough to enforce fines on farmers who released them.‘KEEPING GATES CLOSED NOT ENOUGH’President of the Sector 39B RWA Amardeep Singh said, “We keep the gates of the housing board societies closed, but it still is not enough. At night, these animals eat the small plants growing in the green belts here. This menace has increased during the lockdown. Even horses can be frequently seen grazing on the grass in our sector.”Councillors have also been highlighting related problems for a long time. Gurpreet Singh, the local area councillor of Sectors 32 and 46, said that he had asked the municipal corporation many a time to round up the stray animals. “Since people feed the animals, they naturally gravitate towards the residential areas.”Superintendent of the MC’s slaughterhouse, Dr MS Kamboj, said the MC teams had been working regularly rescuing cattle roaming around on roads and taking them to the pound in the Industrial Area, Phase 1. “A fine of ₹20,000 is charged to those farmers who come here to get their cattle back. The unclaimed animals are auctioned off. Since April, the MC has rescued 371 cattle from the roads of Chandigarh. Through the means of challaning and auctioneering, the department has raised ₹3.48 lakh.”REFLECTORS FOR STRAY CATTLEThe traffic police are also working on ensuring that accidents due to stray animals can be controlled. Speaking about this, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic central) SPS Sondhi said, “We have been working with an NGO, Maa, to put radial belts on stray animals roaming around on the roads. The radial belts will act as reflectors at night to prevent any accidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sectors-closer-to-villages-complain-of-stray-cattle-troubles/story-XigHt92fzmrI347TtUZbcI.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Three-cornered contest likely for Mohali MC polls||With the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) throwing its hat into the ring the Mohali municipal corporation is likely to have a three-cornered election in October this year even as the Shiromani Akali Dal ( Badal) and the Congress are gearing up for the contest, highlighting their achievements in the last five years on social media.The splinter Akali group, Azad, floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa last month is yet to decide on contesting. The elections for which dates are yet to be announced will be held in 50 wards with 2.36 lakh people voting. The former councillors of the Congress and SAD have started reaching out to their voter base on social media with details of the work done in the last few years.. The five year term of the MC ended on April 26 this year. Previously, the Congress had won 14 seats and the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance had grabbed 23 seats. The Azad group had 10 seats and two seats were occupied by independents.Then, 27 councillors, including 10 from the Azad group, 14 from Congress and two independents had elected Kulwant as mayor, but he joined SAD in August 2017. On the current elections, AAP leader Narinder Shergill said, “We have decided to contest for all the 50 seats in Mohali. We are in the process of strengthening our organisation in the district and have already begun meeting with local RWA and other groups.” Local MLA and cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Congress was ready for the polls. “The people of Mohali have seen development in the past few years and we are hopeful of winning the elections with a clean majority,” he said. Former mayor and senior SAD leader Kulwant Singh said, “We are ready for the elections and have held a meeting with former SAD councillors. We have also approaching people to list out our achievements in the past five years.” SAD ( Dhindsa) leader Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu said a decision had to be taken on contesting. However, he added that “we will hold a meeting in this regard as we will not allow the Congress to sail smoothly.” The MC has already submitted details of all the wards with populations to the local bodies department. Of the 2.36 lakh voters, 25,000 belong to the scheduled caste (SC) category. Five seats have been reserved for SC candidates, two for women (SC), three for backward classes (BC) and two for women (BC). There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are for women and 20 for men. In April this year, heated words were exchanged when Sidhu said credit for all development works in Mohali in the past eight months should go to the state government. Refuting the charge, Kulwant Singh had said most of the development took place in his tenure and that in the Congress most of the agenda approved by the house had remained stuck at local bodies’ offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/three-cornered-contest-likely-for-mohali-mc-polls/story-bcENWh8McN2JkRXaoGVIAP.html

He counselled the residents and the deceased was cremated,” said ADCP (City 1) Deepak Pareek.“The virus has brought out the worst side of humanity, as due to the fear of infection, people do not even allow the dead to rest,” the patient’s son rued.SAD leader Madan Lal Bagga, who is the chairman of the Shamshan Ghat Committee, said the area was densely populated and the cremation ground was small. “Residents are cautious due to the rising number of cases and want the dead to be cremated at a less congested place,” said Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-prevent-covid-patient-s-last-rites-in-ludhiana-lock-cremation-ground/story-DetclhMZHQoSkzDdT6V6UO.html

02-08-2020||Pune||Prominent Pune Ganpati mandals will not seek public contribution this year||Prominent Ganpati mandals of the city have decided not to seek public contribution this year for the Ganeshotsav which is due in 20 days. The Covid-19 pandemic and its related regulations have called for a muted Ganeshotsav this year, which is otherwise, organised with grandeur in the city. “This year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, everything has changed and it applies to all of us celebrating the Ganpati festival. We have formed a group of all prominent Ganpati mandals in the city, Jay Ganesh Vyaspith. There are at least 300 mandals in the group and we have appealed to all members to keep the celebration simple, not collect varganis (public contribution) and worship the Ganpati idol for 10 days as per tradition without crowding,” said Mahesh Suryavanshi, treasurer of Dagdusheth Ganpati Mandal, one of the prominent mandals of Pune. Every year, a month before Ganeshotsav, some Ganpati mandals start collecting varganis from local residents, shop owners and traders. Through this public contribution, the 10-day festival is celebrated with pomp and show till the immersion procession. The financial turnover of these ten days in Pune city is more than Rs 100 crore. This year, the Ganpati mandals will not install big pandals as well, informed mandal members. “We have started a Covid care help centre near Dagdusheth temple, through which members of Ganesh mandals work with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials and help them with contact tracing of Covid-19 positive patients. A member of a Ganapti mandal is well versed with the local area and hence, he can help the PMC officials conduct better contact tracing. Till now, we have been able to help with at least 400 cases of contact tracing with the PMC team in Peth areas in the last 15 days. Another initiative which we have recently started is a dedicated Covid centre for patients at the Fergusson College hostel by the Pune Ganpati mandals. With a capacity of 400 beds, it has been developed by the contribution of the Ganapti mandals in Pune city,” added Suryvanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/prominent-pune-ganpati-mandals-will-not-seek-public-contribution-this-year/story-0XKGqQysqKFeW19dyvqGMN.html
02-08-2020||City||BSF constable among three arrested for cross-border drugs, weapons smuggling||A BSF constable and two others were arrested in a cross-border drugs and weapons smuggling racket, the Punjab police said on Sunday.A 30-bore, made-in-China pistol, five live cartridges and Rs 24.5 lakh were recovered from the accused, identified as Border Security Force (BSF) constable Rajendra Prashad and two locals, Surmail Singh and Gurjant Singh, said Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta.The BSF constable is a resident of Rajasthan and was posted at a border outpost at Chhina village in Taran Tarn district.DGP Gupta said the police are working on getting the kingpin of the racket, Satnam Singh alias Satta, extradited from Muscat, Oman, where he had fled after being declared a proclaimed offender in two smuggling cases. Satta had used a fake passport and Aadhar card issued in the name of Gurmeet Singh to escape, said the DGP. Satta’s ill-gotten property, which he had purchased in the name of his relative Maninder Kaur, at Sandhu Colony Amritsar, has been frozen, he added.HOW THEY WERE CAUGHTAs per information, the Jalandhar police had apprehended Surmail Singh and Gurjant Singh on July 26 following a tip-off. They were coming in a Verna car from Delhi at the time and police had recovered 25-gm heroin from their possession. During questioning, the duo had revealed that they worked with a cross-border smuggler Satnam Singh, who was closely linked with Pak-based heroin and weapons smugglers. They also disclosed that BSF constable Rajendra Prashad was part of the smuggling racket. On July 28, the police nabbed BSF constable Prashad from his residence in Rawala Mandi in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. During questioning, the BSF constable revealed that he had been roped into the drug smuggling racket by Satnam Singh, who promised him money for ignoring the smuggling of arms and narcotics consignment through his border post. He then allowed the gang to bring in a consignment of 17 kg heroin and two foreign-made pistols in May. This time again, Satnam Singh, in connivance with Rajendra Prashad, Surmail Singh and Gurjant Singh, was to bring in another consignment of heroin and arms from his Pakistan-based handlers. Satnam had allegedly given Rs 5 lakh and a mobile phone to Prashad in advance for receiving this composite consignment.Prashad is the second BSF constable to be arrested by the Punjab police in a cross-border smuggling racket in the past few days. The police had recently arrested another BSF constable, Sumit Kumar, posted at Sambha in Jammu and Kashmir, in another cross-border smuggling case.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bsf-constable-among-three-arrested-for-cross-border-drugs-weapons-smuggling/story-ifGPJxvIPm5RCF8XvzYSPI.html
02-08-2020||City||Sales manager of bank arrested for cheating senior citizen||A 30-year-old sales manager of a popular co-operative bank was arrested weeks after he swapped a senior citizen’s debit card while helping him withdraw money. The accused then stole ₹40,000 from his account. The banker was arrested after police traced him using the CCTV footage. The accused confessed to stealing the money out of greed. On July 11, Ulwe resident Radheshyam Basak, 76, had gone to withdraw money from the ATM kiosk near his residence. Basak was fumbling with the card when the accused Pulkit Kumar, also an Ulwe resident, was in the kiosk. Kumar then offered to help and inserted his card correctly. While doing so, Kumar stole a glance at the senior citizen’s PIN number. He also swapped Basak’s debit card with a defunct card. When the senior citizen left, he siphoned off ₹40,000 from Basak’s account. After registering a cheating case, the NRI Coastal police procured the CCTV footage based on which the accused was identified. Officials said they were surprised by the fact that Kumar was a salaried sales manager at the bank with no criminal history. “He has worked at a private bank for seven years and is now working at the co-operative bank’s Kharghar branch. He has a monthly salary of over Rs 50,000. Even during the lockdown, his job continued and he was drawing his regular salary,” said an officer adding that the accused is married and stays with his wife at their Ulwe apartment. Following his arrest on Saturday, the police alerted the bank where he was employed. The bank has since terminated his employment, said police. “During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime and said he did so out of greed. He has been arrested and been remanded in police custody till Tuesday,” said Ravindra Patil, an inspector at NRI Coastal police station. The police are also probing whether Kumar has similarly cheated other bank customers before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sales-manager-of-bank-arrested-for-cheating-senior-citizen/story-qm0SKBbwQMonQVUBufd66O.html
02-08-2020||City||J&K Congress demands independent panel to probe land deals by BJP leaders||Expressing resentment over the UT administration’s silence on the allegations of land deals involving senior BJP leaders, J&K Congress chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma on Sunday demanded a high-level independent commission to investigate all such deals and assets of former ministers and legislators.Taking a dig at the BJP, Sharma said one of the reasons cited for the abrogation of the erstwhile state’s special status was to check corruption and put big sharks behind the bar, but after one year, top leaders of the party, especially former ministers, are being linked to matters of illegal acquisition of lands worth crores of rupees, disproportionate to known sources of their income.“While none of the big sharks have been booked, it is necessary that all such deals and allegations be thoroughly investigated and brought to light. People have a right to know the truth about these allegations and reports in the media against those they voted to power,” said Sharma in a statement issued here.He said only a fair investigation under an independent commission can bring out the truth and law should take its own course in every case against anyone found guilty, irrespective of party affiliations.He said some top bureaucrats and officers too had acquired huge wealth through illegal means and lived in palatial bungalows and other properties which should be investigated and appropriate action should follow in a time-bound manner.“People are rapidly losing faith in their representatives and the bureaucracy due to the series of allegations against many of them. Thus, it is essential to establish and maintain their trust in the supremacy of law,” he said.Reminding the BJP, he said one of the claims about the abrogation of Article 370 was to end large-scale corruption and put behind the bars those who had looted the state money. But even a year later, there have been no results and corruption goes on unabated and people are being fleeced for their genuine works.“There is no deterrence of any sort, while in the past there used to be some window of airing grievance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-congress-demands-independent-panel-to-probe-land-deals-by-bjp-leaders/story-bMiouvYrQAvDEmMg0756TM.html
02-08-2020||Mumbai||Give more area to Khar resident if she is moved to farther suburbs: HC to BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) last week directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to reach a settlement with a senior citizen living in a structure constructed on a plot of land at Khar (West) which was leased by the civic body to her father in 1949.The court directed the civic body to consider giving her additional area if she agreed to move to an area farther in the suburbs.The court made the suggestion while hearing a petition filed by 67-year-old Bridget Pereira, seeking directions to the civic body to repair her residence which was damaged after a wall built by BMC collapsed and damaged her house. BMC, however, submitted that as the senior citizen would have to be provided with alternative accommodation at some point of time, rather than bearing the cost of repairing the current structure, which was built in 1949, it was offering her alternative accommodation in Santacruz, Versova, Malad, Kandivli, or Dahisar. A division bench of justice KK Tated and justice RI Chagla, while hearing the petition filed through advocate Bhavesh Parmar, was informed that the petitioner was living alone with her dog in the premise admeasuring 667 square feet (sqft), which was earlier in the name of her demised father.Parmar submitted that BMC had increased the height of the compound wall which collapsed on July 17, and damaged the structure in which Pereira lived. As BMC did not respond to her request to either repair her structure or allow her to repair the same, she approached the court. The court observed that as per BMC rules, the senior citizen should get an area equal to her existing structure if she was being offered an alternative place in the vicinity of Khar. However, if she had to go beyond Versova or farther, she should be offered more area.The counsel for BMC submitted that they had offered a 269sqft area in Santacruz as they did not have any accommodation in Khar, and added that the petitioner could choose other alternative accommodation in Versova or farther in the suburbs. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know why BMC was only offering 269sqft area in return for the 677sqft that the senior citizen would have to vacate. “The petitioner should get alternate accommodation in Khar or Santacruz. If that is not possible, it should consider giving her 750sqft area if she decides to move to Versova or beyond,” the court said. The court then directed the BMC to arrive at a settlement by August 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-more-area-to-khar-resident-if-she-is-moved-to-farther-suburbs-hc-to-bmc/story-AJ6NVjLLPXUgWZH3e00eUP.html

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Sector-22 mobile market may get micro-containment zone tag||The bustling Sector-22 mobile market is set be declared a micro-containment zone. The Affected Area Committee has proposed designating the market, in addition to some areas in Manimajra and Dhanas, as micro-containment zones.Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore will take a final decision on the issue, which is likely at Monday’s war room review meeting.“While around 10 houses in Dhanas and Manimajra will be designated as micro-containment zones, the entire Sector 22 mobile market in front of the Sector-17 ISBT is also likely to be sealed,” said a senior UT official, privy to the development.These three areas were discussed in the July 31 meeting of the Affected Area Committee, which comprises the deputy commissioner, municipal corporation commissioner and health experts. “These areas were proposed to be declared micro-containment zones in the meeting. The recommendations have been submitted to the administration for a review by the administrator on Monday,” the official added.In view of the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in July, the UT administration had last week decided to demarcate micro-containment zones and directed the Affected Area Committee to identify areas for this.Under the micro-containment zone policy, even three to four houses within a sector or colony can be designated as micro-containment zones.NEW HOT SPOTSDhanas and Manimajra have the maximum active cases at 36 and 35, respectively. Along with Ram Darbar, which has 15 cases, the three areas account for 25% of the city’s active cases. Apart from Bapu Dham Colony, Dhanas and Manimajra are the only two areas with over 50 cases since the outbreak of the virus in March.The mobile market in Sector 22, one of the most crowded and congested markets in the city, has also reported around half-a-dozen cases. Significantly, the UT estate office last week had sealed parts of two showrooms in the market on account of misuse. Both cases were processed earlier than the scheduled hearing in September following complaints of crowding and violation of social distancing norms.STEPS TO CONTAIN THE VIRUSNo unchecked outward movement of residents from micro-containment zones, except for maintaining essential services All vehicular movement and public transport will be restrictedExtensive contact tracing Enhanced active surveillanceTesting all suspected casesIsolation of cases and home quarantineHouse-to-house screening on a daily basis Random stratified sampling can also be undertakenSocial distancing measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sector-22-mobile-market-may-get-micro-containment-zone-tag/story-VP9SJvM0fZ5oCbhSUI3SJO.html
02-08-2020||Pune||Night curfew, Section 144 lifted in Pune||For the first time after four-and-a-half months, night curfew has been lifted in the city. The Pune police clarified that no fresh order will be issued for night restrictions which were in place since March 24, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown. As per the previous order, travelling for non-essential purposes after 9pm had been prohibited. The city police, however, have appealed to citizens to mandatorily wear masks, practice social distancing and step out only if it is needed at night. The Pune police move comes after the Centre in its notification on July 29 removed night curfews. The state government order which came later, however, did not have specific guidelines for night curfew.Joint commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Shisve has also clarified that Section 144 of CrPC has been lifted in the city, relaxing all the traffic restrictions. When the unlock period began with restrictions being lifted gradually, the city had curfew orders between 7pm and 8am on a daily basis. The curfew restrictions were gradually changed as per the requirement of the city and Covid-19 situation in the city. In July, the curfew remained in force between 10pm and 5am. During the curfew period too, the city police had issued several citizen-centric safety guidelines like mandatory wearing of masks and maintaining physical distance for those stepping outside. The restrictions were strengthened further from July 4 when Covid-19 cases spiked in the city. The city police organised nakabandi at 245 strategic locations and till July 30, booked 4,172 persons for violation of lockdown rules. As many as 2,883 persons were booked for not wearing masks in public while 7,793 persons were booked under Section 188. Also, 1,446 vehicles were seized across the city. “Though the curfew has been lifted, there are things are which are still closed and prohibited according to the law. Citizens should step out only if it is needed and must compulsorily wear masks, use sanitisers and maintain social distancing. Public safety and health is of topmost concern for the administration and citizens must ensure they follow all the norms laid down by the government,” said Shisve. Regarding the odd-even rule, Shisve said that the restrictions have been imposed in the larger interest of public health. “Few activities are banned and few activities are open. If an activity is not allowed and someone violates it then government agencies will take action against them as per the law.

02-08-2020||City||Cremating unclaimed bodies to providing food, Bathinda volunteers fight covid-19||Bathinda Sonu Maheswari, 39, is a known name in the city for cremating unclaimed bodies since 2003, with the help of volunteers of Noujawan Welfare Society (NWS), an NGO he founded the same year. Undeterred by the pandemic, the NGO has also cremated bodies of six covid-19 patients in the district to date. Maheshwari, who runs a fresh juice and shake outlet at Kikar Bazar in the city, says, “Volunteers are our strength. We are contributing the best we can.” From distributing food to washing hospital linen of patients at state-run isolation and quarantine facilities, the team, from diverse professional backgrounds, has been associated with the district administration for four months. On Sunday, volunteers donated blood.“Our team follows medical protocol. By donating blood, we intended to convey that all stakeholders can contribute,” said Sukhpreet Singh, a key member. The NGO receives money and dry ration from Bathinda residents, and cooked meals for 300 on Sunday. “In April, district health authorities were in a quandary as the staff was reluctant to wash hospital linen. After SDM Amarinder Tiwana and tehsildar Sukhbir Brar broke the taboo by washing linen, NWS helped. Our volunteers are doing it every Sunday,” Sukhpreet adds. Volunteers said wearing a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), while carrying bodies from Guru Gobind Singh Medical College in Faridkot was exhausting and dealing with sweat was a major challenge. “The administration provides us PPE kits. We have to wear these for four-five hours from transporting the body till the cremation. Wearing the PPE has helped us appreciate our health workers,” he added. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said NWS volunteers were available round-the-clock for any duty related to covid. “It is the faith of local citizenry that NWS gets the support to provide quality food to patients thrice a day, with tea and milk etc. Regular monitoring of diet that the NGO prepares and supplies shows it to be satisfactory,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cremating-unclaimed-bodies-to-providing-food-bathinda-volunteers-fight-covid-19/story-6MfG5TPJeVUsbrOTTfiWCK.html

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||3% subsidy on interest rate for setting up milk, meat and animal husbandry units||To encourage farmers to diversify from the traditional crop cycle and explore allied occupations, the Punjab government has introduced a new scheme under which 3% discount will be given on the interest rate for setting up units of milk and milk products, meat, cattle feed and silage.The state’s animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy development minister, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Sunday said the scheme will continue for three years and Rs 15 crore has been reserved by the Government of India for this. “With the implementation of this scheme, new industries will come up in the state and consumers will get quality products,” the minister said. Punjab dairy development director Inderjit Singh said that only 30% of milk in the state is procured by organised sector factories. The rest of the milk is purchased by dairies, urban creameries, confectioners, restaurants and caterers. “Nowadays, consumers are opting for Ultra Heat Treated Milk (UHT) and long-kept milk from trusted companies, rather than buying milk on a daily basis,” he said, adding, “But apart from Milkfed, there is no other unit in Punjab that produces and sells this milk. Therefore, this is a golden opportunity to benefit from the scheme and make milk products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-subsidy-on-interest-rate-for-setting-up-milk-meat-and-animal-husbandry-units/story-yZtsYRqCioQOqiyLncY1ZJ.html

According to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, who visited the hospital on Sunday, at least 175 beds will be available at Sassoon General Hospital by August 4, while the rest of the beds will be allotted soon. “We have decided to use 50 per cent of the total oxygenated beds for Covid-19 (coronavirus) patients,” said Ram.

02-08-2020||City||A standardized bill payment due date is need of the hour||Why can’t all utilities in the country have a uniform billing cycle and a common due date for payment of bills? This would relieve consumers of the agony of having to keep tab of a variety of bills that keep coming throughout the month. It would also save time and energy spent in making the payments, besides precious money wasted on late payment fee whenever consumers forget to pay the bill before the due date.I have argued for this in an earlier column too, but the issue has acquired greater importance and urgency on account of the situation arising out of Covid-19. Today, with the threat of the deadly virus hanging over their heads, consumers may be spending more time at home, but the necessity of having to sanitize goods, including groceries that come into the house, has increased their workload at home. Besides, many households are making do with reduced house help. In other words, consumers are already overburdened with additional work and the least the utilities can do is to reduce their stress by facilitating payment of all bills on one day in a month.Today, consumers pay over a dozen different bills every month- power bills, water charges, piped gas bills, fixed line and mobile bills, cable / satellite/DTH/ OTT charges, broadband connection charges, credit card bills, equated monthly installments, service charges if living in a housing complex, well, the list goes on. However, what complicates the payment is the varying payment due dates. Some are in the first quarter of the month, while others are in the middle of the month or the last quarter. So consumers are paying bills non-stop, throughout the monthAnother problem is with the billing period. Take the energy bills, for example. In one city, the energy consumption is calculated for a month from the eighth of every month. In another, from the 27th. These dates also alter in the same city, if the energy distribution companies are different. These varied dates also cause considerable problem to consumers when they move house. One sees similar lack of standardization in the billing cycles of water supply services, telecom services, piped gas connections. Instead, why can’t every service provider calculate the charges from the first of every month to the last and have a common due date for payment?Today, paying your utility bills is certainly far easier than before. If you have an internet connection or a smart phone, you can use a number of options available for online payment. The Bharat Bill Payment System –the centralized bill payment system for utility bills- has also made it easy for even those without these facilities to go to a BBPS kiosk or agent and pay all bills under one window. But these amenities become more meaningful when all bill payments can also be made at the same time or on the same day. Besides the convenience, such harmonization would ensure prompt payment of bills, thereby bringing down considerably, payment of late fee charges by consumers. In fact the penalty imposed by some of the service providers for delayed bill payment is particularly harsh, but the most exploitative are those imposed by credit card companies who also charge usurious rate of interest on the amount due in case of such delayed payments.All this makes it absolutely imperative that we have a standardized bill payment due date across all utilities and certain financial services. And the initiative for this must come from the ministry whose raison de’tre is protection of consumer interest- the union ministry of consumer affairs. It must coordinate with all ministries concerned to enforce a common billing cycle and due date for all services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-standardized-bill-payment-due-date-is-need-of-the-hour/story-CpjFAbszlZy2yMWjOpNWmK.html

02-08-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Virtual learning is a safe option now, say Pune readers||The coronavirus situation has forced the shift towards online classes. Is online education the best way to assess a child’s academic progress? What are the pros and cons of brick-and-mortar and virtual classrooms? Readers share their take on the ‘homebound’ form of education...Redesign entire systemCovid-19 has given us time to rethink and redesign our education system. What is important for our kids nowadays, what they have to learn or understand for survival. The online education can be a substitute for a few days but can’t be a reality as it impacts on an individual in different ways. For living a healthy life, not only food but our surroundings and environment are equally important. Online classes will never be a healthier or fruitful option for human beings as it will somehow stop our thinking and understanding ability. It will affect our nature and behaviour as well. The kids in the future will never be caring, sharing or supportive. Never understand the value of happiness, sadness, fighting and friendship. For being a good human, we need to understand others. And that can’t be possible without meeting each other and when kids are stopped from going to school due to this pandemic. How can we all assure that they are learning the right things or we are nurturing them in a proper manner is the main issue? It will create more depression in our upcoming generation which will affect our future and at the same time our country’s progress. As per my understanding, virtual schools can be a part of our life for some time but never be a reality. Reshu Aggarwaal An alternative, not a normOnline education may be one of the alternatives but shouldn’t be made mandatory. It is not possible for a single family to arrange smartphones or computers for every child in the family. Online education may only give expertise in technology but will reduce the practical, moral and physical movements of the body. Online studies will bring a lot of restrictions on everyone. As a small kid, it is very difficult to cope with such methods of studies. Also, we cannot exclude the fact that the internet is a privilege for many students. So just like there are provisions for minimum ration, a minimum data allowance for everyone should be mandatory. It should be made sure that technology reaches every village and every household if we are thinking about normalising online education. Rohan Shetty Maintaining class decorum a problem With the Covid-19 situation still bothering us, we feel helpless but have moved on with Work from home for adults and online classes for kids. But the only question that arises here is how much are we really benefitting from all this? Though we have come up with ways to keep the kids occupied, online classes seem to be taking a toll over the kids. They are exposed to screen time which parents would avoid as it might affect their eyes. Burning sensation in the eyes and watering of eyes are a few common symptoms. Teachers are also struggling as dealing with children virtually does make much sense, especially for children who are poor in academics. Internet connectivity issues, power cuts are the other problems we have to deal with. Maintaining class decorum is not possible in a virtual situation but the children are adapting themselves to the situation. Definitely it’s going to be difficult to assess the child’s academic progress because most teachers find parents prompting the children with the correct answer when it comes to online classes. The child is just learning without understanding the concepts thoroughly. So yes, in a way virtual classes are a boon and bane as well. Teachers are also stressed to find new methods to engage the attention of the student since being at home the child’s concentration is diverted. With time and new technology, we will be able to do a better job. Once the initial teething stage is overcome hopefully there will be a vast improvement. Till then do the best with what you have. D Fernandes - ShewaleOnline tech not bad, balance is key In a normal situation, before the pandemic, we let technology take over our daily routine quite gradually, but perpetually. It did not occur to us before today, that we have a zillion apps explaining concepts to students, or informing parents about their ward’s progress, that we’re escalating so quickly in this domain- we have the wings of technology to fly. But right now, it’s all happening in our absolute focus. It’s no more peripheral. Virtual classrooms are the future. But is it thoroughly bad? I don’t think so. Yes, the screen time will increase and you can never replace the good old socializing between students in person. But learning might become convenient, with the children comfortable in their own space. Constraints of long learning hours can be replaced with interspersed learning and self-exploration. Yet, the role of a teacher is indispensable. Virtual classrooms can be a challenge for teachers who aren’t used to technology, but choosing technology over their share of experience and expertise cannot be called development. Hence, the focus should be on teachers’ training, not on their replacement. What is ‘normal’ today was not normal yesterday, and hence, we cannot expect tomorrow to be like today either. Change is the only constant, and we have to strive to maintain a balance between technology and older values. Ankita Singh Teacher-student interaction missing As the Covid-19 pandemic has caught us all off-guard, I agree that the situation and time we are dealing with, there is a need to opt for virtual learning class. But, as per my opinion, classroom teaching is preferred over the virtual classes. As daily interaction between teachers and students help them not only to complete their syllabus easily but also helps them to learn another aspect of life such as moral, discipline and this further teaches them how to deal in real life with the people in a society. Adding to this, classroom learning will always remain the key priority as it helps one to be in a disciplined life and it is the best way to impart and share knowledge and education. Wherein, virtual learning provides a good substitute for classroom learning in the current situation where everything is shut due to Covid-19 pandemic. But, along with this, it comes with other distractions as well, as children also try to surf other sites once they are done with the class, and this might have bad impact on their eyes due to continuous gaze on a computer or phone screen. Both virtual learning and classroom learning have their own importance, as the current situation is the best example where students are still learning without hindrance or gap in their education. Shalini Sharma Kids’ screen time has increasedVirtual classes are here to stay for a while till the schools reopen. I am a mother of a 15-year-old and can see how these virtual classes are affecting my child. I do understand that at times like these this is the only option and as a parent we too want our child to be safe at home and don’t want to worry about them, hoping it normalises soon as it’s taking a toll on them. My child is in class 10 and has board pressures so it gets further tricky. He spends the whole day in front of the computer screen. He has his school classes and then his tuitions all are virtual. He complains of his eyes hurting, backache and at times eats his meals in front of the computer. The discipline of the day has taken a back seat as there is no scheduled time for bath, food or relaxing or any other routine. Since they aren’t going out of the house they have started to get hooked on to the games on the computer and phones. When they aren’t studying they join their friends playing games on the screen. One can say the kids are 90 per cent of their time stuck to the screen. If this goes on for a longer time we will have the same physical and mental problems that an adult has who works on computer full day . Saroj SoparkarSchedule online classes for class 5 and aboveI agree that online classes should be taken but only from class 5 to class 10. Online classes are not that helpful for children till class 4 and parents have told kids not to use phone and other electronic gadgets because it is harmful to eyes. How we can force them to study for hours on mobile or tablet. Many schools are only taking online study to take heavy fees from parents. Atul JainHealth is wealth, safety first The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to begin online teaching. In the interest of students’ health, we shifted to online teaching. I feel in order to keep our students safe, it’s best they are at home and we continue with online teaching. There are pros and cons to the virtual classroom. As a teacher, I feel we have lost the personal touch. At the end of the day, we do not enjoy job satisfaction, which we did earlier. From a student’s perspective, they began online learning enthusiastically, but now they are losing interest. and become moody at times. All said and done, the need of the hour is to be safe and health is wealth.

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Death toll in Punjab spurious liquor tragedy rises to 98||The death toll in the Punjab hooch tragedy rose to 98 on Sunday with 12 more people reported dead in Tarn Taran district after drinking spurious liquor. “In Tarn Taran, the death toll is now 75,” Deputy Commissioner Kulwant Singh said over the phone. He, however, said the administration put the figure at 75 on the basis of the information “received from the field” as the victims’ last rites have already been performed by their families in the past a couple of days. Some of them even didn’t come forward for autopsy, he said. Apart from Tarn Taran, 12 deaths have been reported from Amritsar and 11 from Gurdaspur’s Batala, in a tragedy unfolding since Wednesday evening. Officials said some of the families were not even coming forward to report the death of their kin after drinking spurious liquor. A senior police official said they have been persuading them to report the death of their family members. Meanwhile, the Opposition AAP held protests at several places, including Patiala, Barnala, Pathankot and Moga, against the Punjab government. The protesters accused the government of “negligence”, leading to death of people, mostly belonging to poor families. Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann also went to Tarn Taran and met families of the deceased.Mann sought a probe by a sitting judge into the matter. The Punjab government has ordered a magisterial probe into the case. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday had announced the suspension of seven excise and six police officials. He had described the police and excise department failure to check the manufacturing and sale of spurious liquor as “shameful”. The state government has announced Rs 2 lakh ex gratia for each of the families of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/death-toll-in-punjab-spurious-liquor-tragedy-rises-to-98/story-4TzKLJIem95O0kWONIWjdL.html

02-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi, Mumbai Customs to start faceless cargo assessment from August 3||Delhi and Mumbai Customs will begin faceless assessment of certain imported goods beginning Monday, the CBIC has said.On June 8, 2020, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had rolled out in Bengaluru and Chennai the first phase of “faceless assessment” scheme for imported goods, as it prepared for pan-India roll out by January 1, 2021.“Board has decided to begin the 2nd phase of All India rollout of faceless assessment w.e.f. August 3, 2020, by including Delhi and Mumbai Customs Zones and extending the scope of Faceless Assessment at Chennai and Bangalore Customs Zones,” the CBIC said in a letter to Principal Chief Commissioners of Customs and Central Tax.The CBIC said it has reviewed the first phase of faceless assessment at Bengaluru and Chennai and resolved few technical and administrative issues that arose. The board also noted that faceless assessment ushered in a smooth and faster clearance process with uniformity in assessment.Imports of items under Chapter 84, 85 of the Customs Tariff Act were covered under the faceless assessment scheme in the first phase in Bengaluru and Chennai customs zones. In the second phase, Delhi will also be included. Chapter 84 and 85 relates to certain machines and electrical equipment. In the second phase, items under Chapters 89 to 92 and 50 to 71 will also be covered and Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi customs will clear imported goods based on faceless assessment. Chapters 89 to 92 relate to ship, boats, musical instruments, clocks and watches, and photographic, cinematographic, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories thereof. Chapter 50-71 include textile items, carpet, footwear, headgear, umbrella, ceramic products, glass items and pearls, precious or semi precious stones, imitation jewellery, among others.Mumbai Customs would undertake faceless assessment of items covered under Chapter 29. This chapter relates to organic chemicals. Faceless assessment enables an assessing officer, who is physically located in a particular jurisdiction, to assess a Bill of Entry pertaining to imports made at a different Customs station, whenever such a Bill of Entry has been assigned to him in the Customs automated system. To ensure speedy and uniform assessment, the CBIC has nominated Principal Commissioner or Commissioner Customs, including in airports, to monitor the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-mumbai-customs-to-start-faceless-cargo-assessment-from-august-3/story-AdCQL9LpZpCFoiFgn7tNDM.html

Innumerable claims of inflation, poverty and unemployment have erupted in society. Economic leadership is more important than leadership in the battlefield,” Shiv Sena said.“The stoves of 40 crore families have been extinguished. What is the solution to their problems? Bhumi pujan of Ram temple will be done, BJP needs Rajasthan, it will happen. Rafale aircraft from France also came to Ambala. But how are those who lost jobs in this period coping with the situation? Will the rulers ever tell them?” it added.Shiv Sena said that if the corona crisis is not addressed properly there may be protests on the ground against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“How long will people spend their days on mere hopes and assurances? In the last 15 years, not a single problem of people has been removed. Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, is a friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Due to the economic crisis and corona related atrocities, the Israeli people have started demonstrating on the streets everywhere. The people of Israel are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Netanyahu. The same time can also come in India,” it contended.Shiv Sena further said: “Colleges, factories, shops are closed. Malls, restaurants are closed. Local trains, public transport are at a standstill. Agricultural products are lying down. Wherever we go, there is nothing to hear or see except for despair.

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER orders 2,000 antigen test kits for detection of Covid-19||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has ordered 2,000 antigen kits for detection tests of the Covid-19 disease.The kits are expected to arrive by next week.The institute is currently dependent on the time-consuming but more accurate RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) and the GeneXpert tests for the diagnosis of Covid-19.The rapid antigen tests will be conducted on patients who report to the hospital, except in emergency wards and special OPDs that are functional. Besides, patients who report for chemotherapy will also be tested.In the initial stage, however, parallel testing will be conducted on patients for understanding the authenticity of the kits. “The process will be conducted on a pilot basis. All patients who will be tested through antigen kits will also be tested through RT-PCR. The results will be collated. This will give us an experience on how and where the antigen tests will give better results. For now, the tests will not be conducted for emergency patients, but for patients who will be undergoing surgery, chemotherapy or on immunosuppressed patients,” Dr Mini P Singh, nodal officer, Covid, laboratory services and professor at the virology department said. These tests will help in streamlining the health-care services at the premier tertiary care institute, which have been disturbed due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. “Certain high-risk patients will be tested using antigen kits. Around 600 patients are attended to in the special OPDs. We can test them through antigen kits, which can deliver results in just 15 minutes. Primarily because they will save time and are less expensive. Quick, better, and cost-effective results will be beneficial for all. We are preparing for the future,” Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, said. Not only with the detection of infection, the test will also be helpful in stopping the spread of infection in hospitals. This week, 44 health-care workers including two doctors were quarantined after they were exposed to the infection, some of them from the Covid-19 positive patient admitted in the ICU. On different instances, several health workers were quarantined after they were exposed to the infection through Covid-19 positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-orders-2-000-antigen-test-kits-for-detection-of-covid-19/story-Usucye4b3UdKZ7pW1shtkN.html

Two pistols with two live cartridges, four magazines, two country-made .315 bore pistols and ten .315 bore cartridges were recovered. The accused were arrested on a tip-off regarding movement of armed men in Nabha village of Nayagaon late on Friday night. The accused were intercepted on a road leading to the village and after a brief chase three persons were arrested while two gave police a slip.“They are wanted criminals. We managed to arrest three of them while two men managed to escape taking advantage of darkness,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal.The accused were booked under Sections 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity) and 402 (assembling for the purpose of committing dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-arrested-with-arms-in-chandigarh-s-nayagaon/story-6DuzOIaGhAxdBV3EQyGQ7M.html
02-08-2020||City||Tricity Buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making or faking news||PUNJAB SCHOOL EDUCATION BOARD BOSS TAKES TIME LOCATING OFFICE Newly appointed Punjab School Education Board chairman Yog Raj, 59, took time finding his office in Phase 8, Mohali, on Friday as it was his first visit to the PSEB headquarters. He admitted that though he had studied from a school in Faridkot district affiliated to the PSEB, he had never got a chance to visit its office. REPORTING MC PROCEEDINGS A TOUGH JOB IN COVID TIMES In Covid times, Chandigarh Municipal Corporation general house meetings are being conducted via video-conference. Though safe, and convenient, for MC officials and councillors, journalists are finding it harder to cover proceedings because the MC has refused to share the video conference link with them. Journalists who go to the MC office to watch the proceedings on the video screen set up have a tougher task on hand. The video stream quality is so poor that they can hardly make out what’s happening. An MC official admits, “There is one broadband line and more than 300 computers are running on it.” So by the end of the meeting, journalists are struggling to make sense of the proceedings. It’s like putting the pieces of a puzzle together. No wonder Chandigarh is struggling to become a smart city! UT’S OPEN BORDERS ARE A PROBLEM ON THE GROUND, NOT ON PAPER Senior UT administration officials have been blaming Chandigarh’s open borders for the rise in Covid-19 cases. But the latest steps the administration has taken, such as curtailing market timings by an hour and closing Sukhna Lake on weekends, have little to do with the open borders. Though war room press notes claim screening at borders is being practised, the situation on the ground is different. “Some senior officials don’t understand the principle of cause and effect. If you want to stop an effect (increase in cases), you need to address the cause (open borders). Screening at borders should be stringent and a priority,” said a UT official, requesting anonymity. LOW-KEY SENDOFF FOR HIGH-PROFILE DIG, TRAFFIC, SHASHANK ANAND The farewell of high-profile Chandigarh Traffic Police deputy inspector general (DIG) Shashank Anand was a low-key affair amid Covid-19 safety guidelines. The guest list for the lunch hosted for Anand was limited to IPS officers and a DSP of Chandigarh Police. “Being a law enforcement agency, we had to keep all protocols in mind to avoid negative media attention,” said a senior UT police official with a smile. The announcement of Anand’s transfer left many netizens disappointed with some terming it a “grave loss” for Chandigarh. UT adviser Manoj Parida, Chandigarh mayor Raj Bala Malik and SSP Nilambari Jagadale congratulated Anand on his successful three-year tenure. The 2006-batch IPS officer of Haryana cadre has returned to his parent state. FAMILY OF CORONA WARRIORS ALLEGES APATHY Even as the UT administration prepares to honour corona warriors on Independence Day, one such family in home quarantine in Sector 46, Chandigarh, has alleged official apathy. Ravneet Dhaliwal, whose father is a Chandigarh Police inspector, took to social media recently to share the hardship her father faced before his Covid test and once he tested positive. Ravneet and her mother also tested positive. She claimed the authorities at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, were rude and apathetic. 1,200 DUSTBINS FOR PGI CAMPUS HOUSEHOLDS The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Campus Residents Welfare Society and the hospital administration department distributed 1,200 dustbins among campus households. Each household has been given a green and a blue dustbin for wet and dry waste, respectively, to ensure waste is segregated at source.

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Toll in Punjab’s worst hooch tragedy mounts to 86; 13 officials suspended||The death toll in the Punjab spurious liquor tragedy mounted to 86 on Saturday even as chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh suspended seven excise officials and six policemen. The state government also announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for each of the families of the deceased, officials said. Tarn Taran alone accounted for 63 deaths, followed by 12 in Amritsar and 11 in Gurdaspur’s Batala. Till Friday night, the state had reported 39 deaths in the tragedy unfolding since Wednesday night. The chief minister announced the suspension of 13 officials during his weekly ‘Facebook Live’ interaction with public. Among the suspended officials are two deputy superintendents of police and four station house officers. Strict action will be taken against any public servant or others found complicit in the case, said the chief minister, describing the police and excise department failure to check the manufacturing and sale of spurious liquor as shameful. Nobody will be allowed to get away with feeding poison to our people, he added. Most of the people who lost lives in Tarn Taran district were from Naurangabad, Bhullar, Sangha, Pandoori Gola, Kakka Kandiala villages. 25 in police net so far On Saturday, police arrested 17 more persons by conducting more than 100 raids in the three affected districts of Amritsar-rural, Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran, along with several other places in and around Rajpura and Shambu border (Patiala). The total number of arrests in the case has gone up to 25 as eight persons were arrested on Friday. A woman kingpin, a transport owner, a wanted criminal, a mastermind and owners/managers of various dhabas (from where the illicit liquor was being supplied) are among those arrested, said state police chief DGP Dinkar Gupta. The raiding parties have also seized large quantities of ‘lahan’ ( raw material of illicit liquor) from various villages and dhabas in the region around Shambhu border, Rajpura and Patiala, he said, adding that the raids had exposed a massive racket extending across several districts. The eateries --- Zilmil Dhaba, Green Dhaba, Chhinda Dhaba (allin Patiala district) --- have been sealed. 750 litres ‘lahan’ seized Police said 700 litres of ‘lahan’ was seized from Baghaura village from where two accused, Satnam and Rashem, who have been arrested. Their accomplice, identified as Lakhwinder, is absconding. One Darshan Rani alias Faujan was arrested by Batala cops while another key accused Beeri of Deo village in Tarn Taran is also in police net for supplying t spurious alcohol. Prem Singh, the owner of Azad Transport, and Bhinda (wanted by Tarn Taran Police) were arrested by Rajpura police in raids conducted today. Govinderbir Singh, alias Gobinda of Jandiala City, who was bringing spurious liquor from Tarn Taran to Amritsar rural area has been identified as the racket mastermind. As per police, Gurpal Singh of Dhotian village in Tarn Taran, who was arrested in Phillaur on July 9 for smuggling of spirit, is believed to be the kingpin of the racket being run in Majha. Protest by victims’ families The family members of some of the victims protested outside the morgue of the Tarn Taran civil hospital on Saturday. Bhullar village resident Kawaljit Kaur, whose brother-in-law Parkash Singh died after consuming spurious liquor, said, “The health authorities have kept 13 to 14 bodies in a morgue which is capable of storing only three.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/toll-in-punjab-s-worst-hooch-tragedy-mounts-to-86-13-officials-suspended/story-fYJDhslO3XGjl8EOOm49IM.html
02-08-2020||City||Rising Covid cases have little effect on Ludhiana residents thronging markets||Despite rising Covid-19 cases and police action, residents continue to remain unmindful of the pandemic’s threat.Violation of social distancing norms are rampant at various markets, particularly outside shops near Dandi Swami Chowk, Field Ganj, Karimpura Bazar, Dugri, Model Town main market, Jamalpur, Chandigarh Road, Dhandhari, Haibowal Chowk and surrounding areas.The police have already collected Rs 1.4 crore in fine from 30,000 violators for not wearing masks and observing social distancing.But, the FIRs against assembly of five or more people seem to have had little effect.At Dandi Swami Chowk, heavy rush of vehicles can be seen on the road with eatery owners serving eatables to customers in their cars. Similarly, at Karimpura Bazar and Field Ganj, neither shopkeepers nor visitors pay heed to ensuring adequate distance.Shahpur Road in Field Ganj, which is in close vicinity to Karimpura Bazar, was declared a containment zone in July, but has not deterred residents from still venturing out into crowded spaces.Akashdeep Singh, a shopkeeper here, said the market dealt mostly in garments, fashion accessories and grocery items, with women as the largest consumer group. They usually visited the market in groups or with their families, he added.Ravinder Singh, a resident of Civil Lines, said even if some people observed social distancing, most didn’t give two hoots to the safety protocol in public places. “People still remain in a hurry to complete their purchase before other customers and jostle to find a space at the counter,” he added.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said police have already issued a WhatsApp number – 9115-601-159 and asked the people to send videos and pictures of violations around them. “This has helped police check violations and lodge FIRs and issue challans,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-covid-cases-have-little-effect-on-ludhiana-residents-thronging-markets/story-P89eTAuPfHviVYNThaEN4J.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Markets in Chandigarh report dip in sales of sweets, rakhis this Raksha Bandhan||Raksha Bandhan will be celebrated in the city on Monday, but the markets in the city still wear a deserted look. There was almost no rush on the stalls and people were hesitant to touch anything laid out even though bottles of sanitisers were placed alongside for public use.As per Diwakar Sahoonja, proprietor of Dewsun in Sector 11, sales this year have been lowest in the past few years owing to the pandemic. “Due to a cash crunch, many people are not buying gift baskets that brothers would usually get for their sisters. We would sell 5,000 rakhis a day in previous years, but now we are barely selling 2,000 pieces. The sale of greeting cards has also been affected. We have special mailers with a card and rakhi and normally we would sell about a 1,000 of them daily. Now, we have managed to sell only around 200 of them.”Sahoonja also stocks high-end rakhi cards priced as high as ₹1,000 per card which in previous years, he said, some ministers and VIPs would buy from him, but he has not sold a single one this year.Naresh Mahajan, president of the Sector 23 market welfare association (MWA), said that many people had embraced e-retailers this year due to which markets had seen a low footfall. “People are too afraid to come to the markets as so many new Covid cases are being reported everyday. Instead, people are ordering rakhis online.”President of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Anil Vohra, added that shopkeepers weren’t feeling the festive spirit associated with Raksha Bandhan. “The administration and police can be seen constantly patrolling the markets. Many times shopkeepers and their helpers are challaned even if they take off their masks for even washing their faces. Many shopkeepers are feeling harassed,” he said.Vohra added that the traders’ body had also met UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagdale regarding this.NOT TOO SWEETIn any normal year, the festival of Raksha Bandhan would be incomplete without sweets. This year, however, sales of sweets are on the lower side as many people are not celebrating the festival owing to the pandemic. Proprietor of Uttam Sweets and president of the Sector 46 MWA, Balwinder Singh, said, “Sales are only 50% of what they used to be in previous years. We used to get orders for laddoos mostly during Raksha Bandhan, but this time we are mostly getting orders for cashew barfis.”They were hopeful the response will be better on Sunday although they won’t be preparing as many sweets as they did in previous years, Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/markets-in-chandigarh-report-dip-in-sales-of-sweets-rakhis-this-raksha-bandhan/story-c8yx7zzJZ5PkbDVlEHo6hO.html

According to police officials, Ashok Namdeo Gawali (40) molested 35-year-old Covid patient on Saturday by inappropriately touching her. The accused, according to Hadapsar police inspector Ramesh Sathe, was wearing a mask and went near the bed of the victim. He then lowered his mask and told her if she recognized him. The man then shared a personal detail with her due to which she ignored him. The man then demanded her mobile number which she refused. He then physically molested her. At that time, a woman staffer of the hospital came to the spot and recognized him. The accused then immediately left the room. “The victim lodged a complaint with Hadapsar after we sent the team to hospital We have no arrested him,” said Sathe, who is investigating the case.

02-08-2020||Pune||76 employees of Pune’s Chakan firm test positive during mass testing||As many as 76 workers of a multinational firm based in Chakan were tested positive for Covid-19 during mass testing of employees, an official from the district health department said. The firm conducted the mass-testing of around 900 employees earlier this week to check the spread of virus on its campus. Till Saturday, results of 750 employees were received of which 76 tested positive, said Dr Baliram Gadave, the Tehsil Health Officer (THO) for Khed tehsil.“The swab samples of 76 employees out of 750 members found to be contracted with the infection,” said Dr Gadave. This is the first time, mass testing of employees at this level has been carried out in Chakan and has thrown results with large number contracting to virus, an indication that Covid is spreading in rural parts of Pune district besides the city areas.As of July 31, the 13 tehsils of Pune district have reported 7,670 Covid cases of which 4,175 have recovered from the infection while 193 have succumbed to the virus. The recovery rate in these areas stands at 54 per cent. Following the reports, a health team of officials led by Gadave visited the firm on Saturday and asked the firm to separate the cases as per their place of living such as Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune rural.Dr Gadave said that the firm conducted RT-PCR tests of their employees through private labs. “We have now appealed the firms in the Chakan and nearby MIDC areas not to allow workers living in containment areas to come for work.We have also asked the firms to check pulse oxygen saturation of every employee vising the company premise and made the test mandatory for those whose oxygen level is below 95 per cent,” said Gadave.He said that he has suggested the firm to inform the administration before conducting the tests at a mass-scale as the bed management for the positive patients is what needs to be arranged. “In the present case, we have kept some of their employees at the facility in Mhalunge,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/76-employees-of-pune-s-chakan-firm-test-positive-during-mass-testing/story-YxeKsCbFG3nSHGlEDFieVJ.html
02-08-2020||City||July accounted for 76% of Covid fatalities in Ludhiana||While the number of Covid-19 cases in Ludhiana peaked to the top spot in Punjab by the end of July, the month also saw a whopping 76% of the total Covid fatalities in the district so far.Ludhiana has confirmed 88 Covid deaths since the first fatality on March 29. July alone accounts for 76% (67) of these cases.Before the curfew restrictions were lifted on June 8, 11 people had died due to coronavirus since March 29 (70 days).This number burgeoned to 88 by the end of July (53 days) – an eightfold rise.Much worse, 42% of the total deaths, at 37, took place in the last week of July.The health department had confirmed seven deaths on July 25, while two people died on July 26 and five on July 27. The number rose to six on July 28, while July 29 recorded the highest number of deaths so far, at nine. This was followed by two more fatalities on July 30 and another six on July 31.SPURT IN CASESMarch recorded one death, followed by three in April and five in May. As the borders reopened and curfew restrictions were eased in June, allowing public to venture out and businesses to reopen, the Covid positive cases shot up and fatalities rose to 12 in a month. The situation only worsened in July.Besides 67 more deaths, as of July 31, the district had 3,246 confirmed Covid cases – 1,182 among these still active. A significant 72% of these cases cropped up in July.‘NEXT TWO WEEKS CRUCIAL’According to Dr Bishav Mohan, member of the Covid-19 task force set up by the state government, the first two weeks of August were crucial as the pandemic was reaching its peak stage in Ludhiana. “There will be a further spike in Covid-19 cases. Residents need to ensure they follow government guidelines, such as maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and frequently washing or sanitising their hands,” said Dr Mohan.“As the lockdown was lifted, public ventured out in droves, with residents mindlessly also attending large social gatherings. The irresponsibility of a few puts at risk the vulnerable population, including the elderly and patients with comorbidities, leading to more deaths. It’s time to act responsibly to contain further spread of the virus and save lives,” he added. Dr GS Grewal, former president of Punjab Medical Council, said if the cases were not contained, the number of deaths were bound to rise in the near future. “Patients with comorbidities should immediately contact the health department once they notice the Covid symptoms. Delaying hospitalisation can be critical. Doctors should not give in to any pressure and admit symptomic patients swiftly,” Dr Grewal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/july-accounted-for-76-of-covid-fatalities-in-ludhiana/story-LgeRjBeHbIVDvHN20p2PaO.html

The district has witnessed eight deaths due to the virus in the same period.Initially, the Rewari administration received a lot of praise for not letting the deadly virus enter its territory even though it shares border with Delhi, one of the worst-hit cities in the country, but now the source of infection of most cases is Delhi or the industrial labourers who recently came in from other states.Rewari deputy commissioner Yashendra Singh said that they have collected samples of 20,863 persons, of whom 1,815 tested positive while eight succumbed to death.“As many as 433 cases are still active and 419 sample reports are still awaited. A total of 316 patients are in home isolation, 102 in Covid-care centres and 15 are undergoing treatment in various hospitals,” the DC added.The district reported 109 cases and 90 recoveries on Saturday. Rewari civil surgeon Sushil Mahi said most of the cases have been reported from Rewari city and Dharuhera.“The new patients are either Delhi returnees or contacts of the infected patients. The rural areas are not affected in the district. The industrial workers living in congested rooms are the worst-affected and we have identified those specific areas. Majority of the contacts of infected people, who tested positive for the infection are asymptomatic,” he added.A health official said that another reason for the rise in cases is that due to the delay in test results, officials are unable to isolate positive patients, who end up passing on the infection to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-cases-in-rewari-s-tally-detected-in-last-six-days/story-9FkTIxSxv9GnTNuHsQsZCJ.html
02-08-2020||Pune||Milk producers agitate on BJP call for higher prices to their produce||Hundreds of milk producers from Pune district and rest of western Maharashtra took to streets for the second time within 11 days to press for various demands including an increase in milk procurement prices. The latest agitation was carried out on Saturday on the call given by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies including the Republican party (Athwale), Rayat Kranti, and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha. The main demand for milk producers is granting a subsidy of Rs 10 per litre for milk and Rs 50 per kg subsidy for milk powder. BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil while attacking the state government said those in power are ignoring the problems of milk farmers. Patil who participated in agitation in Maval taluka of Pune also sought to know how many times chief minister Uddhav Thackeray went to Delhi to resolve the peasants’ issues. “If Thackeray does not know about farming, then there are others like Ajit Pawar or Balasaheb Thorat. The chief minister should send them to the centre to resolve the farmers’ problems,” Patil said. In Pune and other parts, the agitation passed off peacefully with milk farmers blocking the roads and distributing milk to the needy. RSP chief Mahadev Jankar and Rayat Kranti chief Sadabhau Khot also took part in the agitation by anointing the idol of Vitthal with milk at Pandharpur. The former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “If the state government does not accept the demands of the milk producers the agitation shall be further intensified even more.” Earlier on July 20, a state-wide agitation was organised by the Mahayuti alliance for various demands of milk producers. The dairy development minister had also called a meeting regarding the demands of milk producers. However, no decision was taken in this regard by accepting the demands of milk producers in the state cabinet meeting. Due to the fall in milk prices in these series of crisis, the condition of milk-producing farmers has become pitiable. The crisis facing the farmers in Maharashtra is increasing day by day. The government has not provided any relief to the farmers in various crises such as a denial of loans by banks, double sowing due to fake soybean seeds, shortage of urea fertilizer and black marketing of urea fertilizer, damage to crops of farmers in the Konkan region due to the recent cyclone and damage to crops due to heavy rains in many places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/milk-producers-agitate-on-bjp-call-for-higher-prices-to-their-produce/story-gVozkROwKU6mOPC2j5Sm4J.html

02-08-2020||Pune||Pune Metro project faces disruptions in construction, only 40 per cent workforce available||The Pune Metro which is a crucial project for the city has been badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic as almost 50 per cent of its labour force is yet to return which has delayed the work and led to uncertainties regarding the project. The trial run for the priority stretch between Sant Tukaram nagar and Phugewadi in reach one which was to commence in June end is yet to finish the station works while the priority stretch in reach two between Anand nagar and Garware is yet to be completed. In light of the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, the Mahametro which looks after the work of Pune metro is unable to set any new deadlines as of yet. The Pune Metro project which is undergoing works in two phases, reach one and reach two has been badly affected. Atul Gadgil, director (works) said, “The work force was depleted drastically in this pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had around 5,000 people working for us and currently we have close to 2,000 people including those who returned lately. The labour force is returning daily and weekly around 100-200 labourers are returning. Right now, we are working with only 50 per cent efficiency which has affected our deadline. The underground tunnelling work has completed about 2.5 kms and both the Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) have crossed Shivajinagar. One TBM has reached the COEP underground while the other TBM is about to reach. We are targeting to reach civil court station by this month end and by September we hope that all of our staff will return.”He added that under normal circumstances without the pandemic the priority stretch in reach one between Sant Tukaram Nagar and Phugewadi would have been commissioned while the reach two priority stretch would have been ready by July end. He said, “Under new circumstances the reach one priority stretch would be ready by December and the reach two priority stretch would be about 60-65 per cent complete.”However, the staff for the underground work is available for Budhwar peth, but the area is part of a containment zone which has led to a halt in the work. The civic body is not allowing any construction work there. While the underground work at Swargate end is in progress. Brijesh Dixit, managing director at Mahametro said, “It is true that the pandemic has affected our work but it will not delay the project much. Our labour force is returning now and we have also recruited local force from within the city. However we will not be able to set new deadlines till all our labour returns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-metro-project-faces-disruptions-in-construction-only-40-per-cent-workforce-available/story-oFwOHKanJocjpNe6e8q3rI.html

Pune city’s (Pune Municipal Corporation area) population is 34.02 lakh and it has 41.94 lakh trees. Pune Municipal Corporation published the draft Environment status report for the year 2019-20 and highlighted the existing status of green cover, river, besides noise and air pollution. PMC environment department head Mangesh Dighe said, “Though urbanisation is increasing rapidly in the city and green areas changing for construction activity, city’s tree population is satisfactory. PMC and various organisations are ensuring that city have more trees.” The ratio of trees per person is 1.23 in the city. Garden department head Ashok Ghorpade said, “Pune city have 203 gardens in PMC area. New gardens have been proposed. Along with gardens, PMC is doing a joint programme with forest department. Joint forest programme is going at Taljai Hill, Vetal Tekdi and other places. It is all helping to increase the tree number in the city.” Dighe said, “Everybody knows the importance of trees and how they are useful for humans as well as environment.” PMC environment status report said that there are 111 rare trees in the city. Even some botanical gardens in Pune are also adding to the tree strength. PMC officials said that efforts are on to grow more local species in the city.

02-08-2020||Pune||Decline in open spaces in Pune since 2005: ESR||The 2019-2020 Environmental status report (ESR) released by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Friday has brought out unpalatable reality of rapid, large scale concretisation across the city, resulting in gobbling up of several open spaces during the past 15 years.The satellite images published in ESR maps from 2005 till 2020 clearly shows the yellow cover (identified for open spaces and shown on map) is on decline whereas red spots indicating construction activity has drastically increased. The overall change, according to experts, has put heavy burden on the basic infrastructure, amenities and green cover of the city.The newly added 23 villages, as per ESR, has compounded infrastructural issues of the city, further adding burden of concretisation in suburban areas as seen from the map.The ESR report was put up before the PMC general body (GB) on Friday wherein geographical maps related to urbanisation and loss of green cover have been incorporated in the report. During the past one decade, the urban open spaces which were supposed to be reserved for gardens, parks and urban forests have rapidly disappeared in the concrete jungle.Currently, the city has two development plans - one for the old areas of city and the second for the new city which includes 23 merged villages. A provision for open spaces for public amenities was made, but the maps reveal that those public utilities have been occupied by concrete structures, which according to the civil society members was causing pressure on public amenities of the city.The report mentions that rise in number of private ownership of vehicles, haphazard urban growth, environmental pollution due to building construction activities was causing several environmental damage to the city. The report states that residential purpose of land use was the highest in the city which led to scouting of new lands for residential purposes in the newly merged villages. The land use for hill-cum-biodiversity park was a negligible 7.35%, while the land for residential purpose stood at 38.41 %.“The report has satellite image maps which reflect the 15-year period changes in the city and the newly merged villages with the PMC. There has been a lot of urbanisation and it is not only in the city, but also the peripheral area which are witnessing heavy urbanisation recently. The report has been prepared in alignment with the sustainable development goals stated by the UN,” said PMC environment officer Mangesh Dighe.PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar in his preface, said, “It is essential to preserve biodiversity and natural resources while carrying out development activities. PMC aims at carrying out holistic development in the city and ESR report reflects the current environmental status of the city.”Ecologist Madhav Gadgil said, “City’s open spaces and green cover is on decline for many years and this is due to a powerful lobby which pressurises government and authorities.”“Pune has lost considerable green cover and its public spaces have been taken over through encroachments by business interests. The government buckles under the pressure of corporate nexus which is a very powerful lobby behind environmental destruction in the city. This group encroaches on public space, destroys vegetation for financial gain and they don’t have any care or concern for the environment. We are already into an alarming state where nature is being destroyed with ferocity by human greed,” said Gadgil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/decline-in-open-spaces-in-pune-since-2005-esr/story-GxG52RwCwWY9zTL35m7jLI.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Multiple charges for Gurugram naib tehsildars under scrutiny||Following detection of large scale violations in the registration of sale deeds of properties in notified urban areas of Gurugram district, the Haryana government is looking into the actions of Gurugram deputy commissioner who assigned multiple registration responsibilities to certain naib tehsildars, apparently in violation of government instructions. “Prima facie the vesting of additional charge of sub tehsils Harsaru and Kadipur to Gurugram naib tehsildar Desh Raj Kamboj by the deputy commissioner for registering deeds appears to be objectionable and in violation of existing instructions of the government. Therefore, it is proposed that a detailed report regarding giving additional charge of sub registrars and joint registrars in Gurugram district by the deputy commissioner may be solicited from the Gurugram divisional commissioner in writing,” reads the file noting approved by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The state government had on Friday ordered registration of criminal case against six serving tehsil officials and also placed them under suspension after they were found guilty of flagrant violations of Section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act during the registration of sale deeds. The Act provides for criminal prosecution of the violators. Extent of violations by tehsil officials As per findings of an interim report from Gurugram divisional commissioner, a large number of registrations of sale deeds which took place between April 20 and July 6 were in violation of Section 7-A of the HDRUA Act. The report said that 402 deeds were found to have been registered in Harsaru sub tehsil in violation of Section 7-A by Gurugram naib tehsildar Desh Raj Kamboj, who was also given the additional charge of Harsaru sub tehsil from April 20 to July 6. Similarly, 167 deeds were found to have been registered in Kadipur sub tehsil in violation of Section 7-A. Out these, 93 deeds were registered by Gurugram naib tehsildar Desh Raj Kamboj who was also holding charge of Kadipur sub tehsil during the said period, the report said. The report said Sohna tehsildar Bansi Lal had registered 305 deeds in violation of Section 7-A while Sohna naib tehsildar Dalbir Singh had registered 310 deeds in violation of the urban area law. “In Badshahpur sub-tehsil, 263 deeds were registered in violation of Section 7-A. Badshahpur naib tehsildar Hari Kishan registered 243 of these deeds and 20 deeds were registered by naib tehsildar Jai Prakash,” the report said. Kadipur naib tehsildar Om Prakash (now retired) registered 72 deeds in violation of the law while two deeds were registered by Manesar naib tehsildar Jagdish Chand, who was holding the additional charge of Kadipur sub tehsil, as per the findings of the report. Revenue officials said registration of properties without a no-objection certificate in notified urban area land under Section 7-A led to mushrooming of unauthorised settlements and corrupt practice. The requirement of a NoC stating that land transfer does not contravene any provisions of the Act was to prevent ill-planned and haphazard construction in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multiple-charges-for-gurugram-naib-tehsildars-under-scrutiny/story-tlmiQRHBvlrX9F8MPPfBXN.html

The basic idea was to increase patrolling in hotspots where police presence needs to be enhanced for women safety. A lot of research went into the project before the routes and hotpots were finalised,” said district police commissioner Alok Singh.Police officials also said that inputs about issues and hotspots have also been taken from the public on social media. Comprising sub-inspectors, head constables and constables, who will be women, the police personnel have been equipped with body-worn cameras and batons along with helmets and raincoats for the current weather.Most of these personnel come from various police stations in different numbers in the district. Singh added that for now, they will work during the daytime hours. Most of the hotspots are around schools, colleges, industrial areas with women centric workforce, metro stations, auto stands etc. The department will keep modifying the list of hotspots based on feedback from the public.“For now we have been provided a route chart and a list of specific areas where we need to focus more. As the days progress, there will be certain modifications with our schedule depending on instructions from our seniors,” said Alka Chaudhary, a sub-inspector from Bisrakh police station.She said that for now they don’t foresee any specific challenges and are prepared for any situation that may arise.“We will be in uniform but going forward we will also run operations similar to the anti-romeo squad in plainclothes. The focus will be solely on improving women’s safety in the district,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/special-patrolling-team-formed-for-women-s-safety-163-hot-spots-identified-across-district/story-uKLjbQmSXkcrPUm61CjZvK.html

The burglars took away silver ornaments and statues from the temple, after which we alerted the local police (Sector 39) about the incident,” said Shashi Vaid, chairman of the Arun Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association, (RWA).He said the incident came to light when the temple opened in the morning but from the CCTV footage, they could make out that there were two burglars who broke in around 3 am.In another incident in Zone 1, the mobile phone of a Noida resident was snatched in Sector 31 while he was out for a morning walk.The victim, Manoj Jain, in his complaint has alleged that while he was out for a walk, two men on a motorcycle came and snatched his phone and before he could react, they had fled towards the main road of Sector 61. Based on his complaint, a case of robbery was registered at the Sector 30 police station.“Both incidents are being looked into. We have CCTV footage of the temple incident and are looking at a few suspects. Teams have also been formed for the Nithari robbery and it is being looked into,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma. The third incident was reported from the Beta 2 area when a security guard was allegedly robbed of his valuables on the pretext of a lift. The victim, Mrityunjay Singh, is from Bihar who works in Sector 132. On Friday evening around 6.30pm, when he was on his way to work he was approached by the suspects in a white Swift Dzire near Pari chowk from whom he took a lift.“After some distance, one of them pulled a gun on me. They took my phone, cash and ATM card. They asked for the card’s pin at gunpoint and after I gave them a number (which was wrong), they pushed me out of the car at a secluded spot,” said the victim in his police complaint.A case was registered at the Beta 2 police station and a probe in the matter is underway.“They took his mobile and ₹20,000. The case is under investigation,” said Sujeet Kumar Upadhyaya, station house officer, Beta 2.The Noida police had said earlier that they were going to be on alert this week, with two major festivals – Eid and Raksha Bandhan – around the corner.

Each official will be provided gunmen, reader, driver, telephone operator, wireless operator, orderly and security staff for their residence.The Ludhiana police have around 5,000 police personnel, including 44 IPS officials. Each of these officials has a staff of 25 personnel. Other gazetted officers have teams of 10 to 15 personnel.IPC officer J Elanchezhian has been given the charge of Joint CP (Headquarters). He has already served in Ludhiana as assistant commissioner of police. IPS officer Kanwardeep Kaur has joined Joint CP (Rural) and will oversee zones 2 and 4. Similarly, IPC officer Bhagirath Singh Meena has been transferred as Joint CP (City) for zones 1 and 3.J Elanchezhian has been given the office of deputy commissioner of police (DCP, headquarters), as the post was abolished recently. According to sources in the police department, joint CP (City) can be accommodated in the office of ADCP (Investigation) Dayama Harish Kumar Omparkash, as he has been transferred out of the district. Another option is at the Police Headquarters. The department could vacate the room for clerical staff. For Joint CP (Rural), the department is considering the office of AIG NRI on Chandigarh Road, as the office is vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/appointment-of-three-new-joint-cps-in-ludhiana-raises-challenge-of-more-office-space-personnel/story-lpeKXPkmMBOy8ChrISkJpJ.html
02-08-2020||Delhi||High virus in kids with Covid-19, but are they contagious?||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rarely sickens children, and when it does, it usually causes mild disease. But a new study indicates that infected children with mild and moderate disease carry as much virus as adults, sparking debate on whether they can potentially spread infection as easily as adults.New research shows that infected children have as much coronavirus in their nose and throats as adults, with children younger with than five with mild symptoms having 100 times more virus than adults, according to results of tests that measured genetic material of the new coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) in the nose and throat swabs of children with mild to moderate Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSars-CoV-2 genetic material, or RNA, is not infective like the whole virus, but authors note there is a correlation between higher RNA load and ability to spread disease.“Our study is limited to detection of viral nucleic acid, rather than infectious virus, although Sars-CoV-2 paediatric studies reported a correlation between higher nucleic acid levels and the ability to culture infectious virus,” said the study by researchers in Chicago and published in JAMA Pediatrics, a journal of the American Medical Association.“Young children can potentially be important drivers of Sars-CoV-2 spread in the general population, as has been demonstrated with respiratory syncytial virus, where children with high viral loads are more likely to transmit. Behavioural habits of young children and close quarters in school and day care settings raise concern for Sars-CoV-2 amplification in this population as public health restrictions are eased,” said the study. Also read: Kids in Delhi go without vaccine as Covid crisis unfoldsThe study has public health implications for opening schools and planning vaccination campaigns to include children once Covid-19 vaccination are available in 2021.Children are established drivers of respiratory infections such as seasonal flu and the common cold, but data on whether children are less likely to spread the infection remains sparse.Children and teenagers have half the risk of getting infected by Sars-CoV-2 as compared to adults, according to a large systematic review of at least 6,300 studies published in May in the preprint journal of medical sciences, medRxiv in May. The study is being peer-reviewed.The review said there was weak evidence on the role of children and young people in transmission of Sars-CoV2 at a population level. “Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children,” said the study by researchers at University College London, which analysed data from 6,327 studies published till May 16 this year.“The role of children and young people in spreading the disease depends on several factors, including their susceptibility to infection, severity of symptoms, viral load and social behaviour. We need far better understanding of the role of children in transmission as it has implications on school reopening and restoring some degree social normalcy,” said Dr Navin Dang, director and senior microbiologist at Dr Dang’s Lab, Delhi.“We don’t have data from India yet as very few children have been tested, which means that symptoms and illness even in children exposed to infection within families has fortunately been rare. We don’t have a big enough sample size needed to quantify CT values in children, but it’s data worth analysing,” said Dr Dang.CT stands for cycle thresholds, which are the number of cycles needed to amplify a virus’ RNA during a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test approved to diagnose Covid-19. The higher the viral load, the fewer cycles are needed to get a clear result.Schools across India have been shut since March 21, the weekend before a national lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, which has limited physical interaction between children, but with some relaxation of movement restrictions, social interaction is set to increase.Studies on Covid-19 prevalence in children have produced widely varying results. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and Italy showed markedly lower Sars-CoV2 prevalence among children and young people, but studies from Sweden, the UK and some areas in Switzerland and Germany found no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children.“The JAMA study is particularly significant as you cannot expect very young children to wear masks properly or follow social distancing norms without supervision in crowded classrooms, canteens and playgrounds. This can led to infection clusters in schools, from where children can spread it to staff, families and communities or neighbours without developing severe disease themselves,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor in the department of psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-virus-in-kids-with-covid-19-but-are-they-contagious/story-zAwBM7i0sBt6wX1rdgSc1H.html
02-08-2020||Delhi||Shahrukh to undergo forensic checks to establish ID: Police||Shahrukh Pathan -- the man allegedly caught on camera brandishing a pistol at a policeman during the north-east Delhi riots -- will be brought to Delhi’s Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) on August 5 for his physical measurement, photography and videography to establish his identity and corroborate if he is the same person seen in the video, according to a Delhi Police officer privy to the investigation details.Forensic experts said they use this form of evidence gathering in cases where an accused is caught on tape.The crime branch team probing the riots case got approval for this procedure from a city court on July 29. In their application, police referred to Section 5 of the Identification of the Prisoners Act, which talks about “Power to Magistrate to order a person to be measured or photograph”.“...Accordingly, in view of the submissions made by the IO (investigating officer) as well as the facts and circumstances of the case, this court is of the view that conduct of physical measurement, photography, and videography of accused is essential for confirming the identity of accused as well as the purposes of investigation in the present case,” the court said while directing jail authorities to produce Pathan at Rohini lab on August 5.Pathan, 23, was arrested on March 3 from Uttar Pradesh and was charged by police in June for rioting, attempt to murder and under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act. A purported video of him, pointing a gun at head constable Deepak Dahiya during the riots on February 24, had gone viral on social media. He is presently lodged in Tihar jail. At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured in clashes between Hindus and Muslims in different parts of north-east Delhi in February this year.“It is imperative for the investigating team to collect evidence, establishing his presence at the crime scene, and corroborate its probe that the suspect and the arrested man are the same. In cases where photographs and videos are key evidence, the defence counsel usually contest the police’s investigation by saying the suspect in the video is not his or her client as he was not present at the scene of that crime on that date. But by having an affirmative forensic report linking the arrested person and the person seen in the video, the defence counsel may not be able to use their theory in Pathan’s case,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named.Officials in the FSL said they will compare Pathan’s height, complexion, physique, his walking style, his body position at the time of the incident with the person seen in the video. They said such a procedure is usually adopted by police in cases with electronic evidence in the form of videos and photographs showing the suspect’s crime.“We usually get requests from police for obtaining videography and photography evidence from our forensic lab in their cases. In this case, the IO will be present along with the video tape of the crime and the procedure would be carried out as per his or her requirement,” said Deepa Verma, FSL director.Another expert in the FSL’s photography-videography division, who asked not to be named, said requests for similar procedure have become common in the last couple of years in cases where police get live or recorded video footage of crime.“Most requests are in cases of street crimes, ATM theft and shop burglaries, where video evidence against suspects is available. Sometimes, we visit the crime scene with the suspects, recreate the entire crime, and do photography and videography to establish a positive link between the suspects in the video and the arrested persons,” the expert said.Former IPS officer Ashok Chand, who retired from Delhi Police, explained, “This forensic evidence will positively link and establish that the person arrested in the case is the same person caught on tape wielding a pistol at the policeman. It will be an important piece of evidence against the accused.”Pathan’s lawyer, Asghar Khan, however, said the police was unnecessarily trying to make it a “very special case” and their entire effort was to delay the bail of his client, who he said had been “falsely arrested and charged”.“The whole FIR is false because it is filed on the complaint of the head constable whose statement in a TV channel interview is contradictory to what he said in the FIR. As far as the need for videography and photography of my client is concerned, I want to say he did not fire at the policeman. As my client was surrounded by people throwing stones, he opened fire in self-defence and not to injure or kill anyone,” Khan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/riot-accused-to-undergo-forensic-procedure-to-establish-identity-cops-want-to-match-him-with-man-seen-in-video-footage/story-DiLuhy6RcJpsXIzRxaV4bM.html

02-08-2020||Delhi||Former JNU student Umar Khalid questioned in Delhi riots case, cellphone seized||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid was questioned on Friday in connection with a case related to the north-east Delhi riots, in which he and at least eight others have been booked under the Unlawful Activity Prevention Act (UAPA), and charged with sedition, murder, attempt to murder and rioting. Khalid’s cellphone was also seized, police said Saturday. The case is being probed by the Delhi Police special cell, which is probing “a larger conspiracy angle” behind the riots that took place in February. Friday was the first time that the former JNU student was questioned for his alleged role in the riots that left 53 dead over 400 injured. Joint commissioner of police (special cell) Neeraj Thakur confirmed that Khalid was questioned by his team at their office on Friday and that his cellphone was seized for investigation. Thakur, however, refused to share further details. A special cell officer, who did not want to be identified, said, “Khalid was questioned for nearly three hours. He was questioned regarding the purported provocative speeches he had allegedly delivered at two different places before the visit of US President Donald Trump in February. Khalid had allegedly appealed to the public to come out on streets and block the roads during Trump’s visit,” the officer said. More than eight people, including suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain, Jamia student Meeran Haider, Jamia Coordination Committee’s media coordinator Safoora Zargar, and Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, have been arrested under the stringent UAPA on charges of planning and executing the north-east Delhi riots. The counsels for the arrested persons have accused Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against their clients, only because they were part of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to the special cell submissions before the court, Khalid along with the other accused had hatched a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots just before the Trump visit on February 24 and 25. In at least four charge sheets, police have said Khalid had met councillor Hussain and Khalid Saifi, an activist, on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site to allegedly plan the riots. When contacted Tridip Pais, counsel for Khalid, said he did not want to comment on the case developments.  Khalid was earlier arrested in February 2016 for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans on the JNU campus along with former student union president Kanhaiya Kumar and others. They were charged with sedition. They had denied the charges and accused the police of using doctored videos to build a case against them. The case is being heard by a city court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/former-jnu-student-umar-khalid-quizzed-by-cops-over-north-east-delhi-riots/story-Z95NZ3Li6lENSKG311pA4I.html

02-08-2020||City||Buddha Nullah pollution: Expert committee to chalk out plan for modern dairy complex||A day after local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra constituted a committee to work out shifting of dairy units alongside Buddha Nullah, the special task force (STF) constituted for cleaning the nullah, asked the authorities to also plan a modern dairy complex for the same. A meeting of the STF, which was constituted by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, was held under the chairmanship of head Satguru Uday Singh (head of Naamdhari sect) in Chandigarh on Saturday. The STF directed the committee to deliberate on the facilities which will be provided in the modern dairy complex. The committee was asked to take the final decision within three months. It has the mayor as its chairman, and the deputy commissioner, the MC commissioner, the chief administrator of GLADA and the deputy director, animal husbandry as its members. The dairy shifting project has been hanging fire for a long time. As per the information, there are over 400 dairy units in Haibowal dairy complex while around 130 units are situated in Tajpur Road dairy complex. Around 200 dairy units are operational in different parts of the city and around 50 units are situated outside the MC limits. The STF also discussed the ongoing project of demarcation of Buddha Nullah. The demarcation process is being taken up by the MC, revenue department, and irrigation department. The residents living in its vicinity have been claiming that due to permanent encroachments alongside the nullah, its width has decreased, due to which it overflows during monsoons.The beautification of the nullah was also discussed in the meeting. The PPCB officials apprised the STF of the status of under-construction common effluent treatment plants (CETP) for the Tajpur Road and Focal Point industry areas. The projects are expected to be completed by December. MLA Rakesh Pandey said, “Detailed discussion on shifting of dairy units was held and the officials apprised the STF members of the steps being taken to upgrade the MC sewer treatment plants (STP). We also discussed steps that can be taken for beautification of nullah banks. The detailed report on the demarcation of the nullah is yet to be prepared.” Mayor, 3 Congress MLAs miss the meeting While the STF had invited mayor Balkar Sandhu and four Congress MLAs including, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Rakesh Pandey, Surinder Dawar, and Sanjay Talwar for the meeting, only Pandey showed up. Ashu and Sandhu claimed that they had previous commitments and had therefore informed the task force members that they would not be able to attend the meeting. Talwar said that he had some important work in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buddha-nullah-pollution-expert-committee-to-chalk-out-plan-for-modern-dairy-complex/story-cCju0OdwkYI7mftCID2kcK.html
02-08-2020||Delhi||Police scan 220 vehicles, footage from 100 CCTVs to nab driver of mini-truck that fatally hit senior police officer||After scanning more than 220 vehicles of a similar make, the Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested the driver who had fled after killing a 54-year-old assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in a hit-and-run accident on July 25. Police said they arrested the errant driver, Amit Pulami, 28, on Friday and impounded the mini truck that had rammed the officer, ACP Sanket Kaushik, who was posted with the Dwarka traffic circle, and dragged him for nearly 50m on a service lane near the Rajokri flyover. Kaushik had got out of his vehicle and was clearing the traffic when he was hit by the mini truck.Pulami, police said, originally belongs to Nepal and had come to India for work about one-and-a-half years ago.Footage from more than 100 CCTV cameras was scanned and over 220 mini trucks with a similar make that were found moving through the area at the time of the incident were checked to zero in on the errant vehicle and driver, police said. A broken iron angle bar of the vehicle, recovered from the mishap spot, was the only piece of evidence with the police to identify the vehicle.“We inspected the iron bar and it helped us realise that we could be looking for a mini truck. Footage from CCTV cameras on all possible routes from the spot was checked and that helped us establish that a white mini truck had fatally rammed the officer,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya.Narrating the sequence of events, Arya said on July 25, around 8pm, Kaushik had left his office in his official vehicle along with his driver and wireless operator when they came across a jam on the service lane near the Rajokri flover. Kaushik and his staff went to help clear the snarl. While his driver and operator were busy moving a car, Kaushik walked ahead on the road.“A vehicle hit him from behind and dragged him for nearly 50 metres before hitting the concrete barriers placed on the road. The ACP suffered multiple injuries and was declared brought dead at the AIIMS Trauma Centre. A case of rash and negligent driving causing death under sections 279 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code was registered and the investigation was taken up,” Arya said.Six teams were formed and they collected details of all mini trucks with a similar make and colour that passed through the MCD toll tax booth on the Delhi-Haryana border before and after the mishap. About 50 such vehicles were examined. The records of 52 mini trucks from the cargo wing at the Delhi airport were also obtained, analysed and verified. Similarly, all warehouses in Rajokri, Mahipalpur, Kapashera, Samalkha, and Bijwasan were thoroughly examined and their records checked to ascertain the movement of 120 such vehicles, the DCP said.“The entire effort helped us zero in on a white mini truck attached to a warehouse in Rangpuri. Accordingly, the vehicle was recovered and its driver, Amit Pulami, was arrested on Friday. The truck was examined and its left headlight was found broken -- Pulami had got it replaced at a local garage to mislead the police,” Arya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-scan-220-vehicles-footage-from-100-cctvs-to-nab-driver-of-mini-truck-that-fatally-hit-senior-police-officer/story-3GCPb7HBeWwlJkcEkv9acN.html

On an average 10-11 testing camps will be held in the areas notified as containment zones by the district administration.” The district administration on Saturday issued a revised list of containment zones. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, issued orders creating 64 containment areas in Gurugram, two in Pataudi and six in Sohna.

02-08-2020||Gurugram||How RWAs are helping residents cheer up amidst Covid-19 outbreak||Being cooped up in a home can be tough although it is the safest bet to keep the coronavirus threat at bay as it spreads across the world. Several resident welfare associations (RWAs) across Gurugram, however, have tried to break the monotony.In DLF phase 1, for example, the RWA is holding weekly webinars with residents on a block-to-block basis to help neighbours interact with each other, many of whom had shifted in recently but had not the an opportunity to socialise. “A sizeable number of people live on rent in DLF Phase 1. Since February, there were many who had just moved into our township, but due to the coronavirus outbreak, did not have an opportunity to interact with others. We felt that residents in every block should interact on some online platform and get to know each other better, especially as a lot of them were feeling lonely and isolated,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of DLF Phase 1 RWA.Bansal said that the webinars were a success as it not only had a high turnout, but also led to another idea.“We are thinking of holding small get-togethers in the neighbourhood park for residents while ensuring social distancing measures are followed. We will be replicating the webinars in other blocks of the township as well,” said Bansal. Last month, the RWA of Tulip Violet society held a contest on Facebook where residents were asked to submit entries on innovations for cleaning, recipes, painting and dancing. “We were all huddled up in our homes and society, in general, to fight against coronavirus. All residents were finding new ways to engage our children, coming up with innovative ways of cleaning house quickly, trying different recipes, decoration ideas, paintings or drawing and hence we decided to collect these memories and upload them in our society’s group through pictures and videos. We decided to create a competition and gave the incentive of the top three posts getting rewarded. This way we were able to keep residents engaged for more than a month and had around 310 entries,” said Puneet Goyal, president of Tulip Violet RWA.At The Retreat condominium in South City 1, a group of 12-15 residents got together and distributed baskets containing chocolates, plants, face masks and motivational messages among 300 families of the condominium.“During these difficult times, a few of us got together and were discussing various measures that can be undertaken to elevate the mood of residents and staff. We decided to purchase plants and chocolates in bulk and made cloth face masks as well. Each basket included a motivational message telling residents that they can overcome these difficult times and look at the bright future ahead,” said Kirti Adhikari, a resident who led the initiative. Adhikari further said that t-shirts bearing the name of “The Retreat” and sweets were also distributed amongst the condominium’s staff to keep them motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/how-rwas-are-helping-residents-cheer-up-amidst-covid-19-outbreak/story-wzFu5Py7OA7k9z10ogEPuM.html

02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Private hospitals in Ludhiana told to reserve 50% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients||Principal secretary health Anurag Aggawal met representatives of private hospitals in the district on Saturday, and asked them to reserve 50% intensive-care-unit beds with and without ventilators for Covid-19 patients. The move was taken as the government was facing flak because private hospitals were denying treatment to Covid-19 patients. The death of Covid-19 patient Sanjiv Nagalpal, who was allegedly referred from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and died before reaching the civil hospital, had triggered massive outrage against authorities. Two days ago, deputy commissioner Verinder Sharma had to intervene after a 83-year-old patient was denied treatment at a private hospital near RK Road. Aggarwal emphasised on the importance of tertiary care centres to tackle the rising number of cases. “It is important to lessen the number of causalities in a pandemic. Ludhiana is located in the middle of the state and has a huge network of private hospitals. We have urged private hospitals to spare 50% ICU beds with and without ventilators for the treatment of Covid-19 patient,” said Aggarwal. He said that the district administration had developed a mobile application that will provide real-time data about the availability of beds in the hospital. As many as 3,246 patients had tested positive while 88 people had succumbed to the virus in Ludhiana till July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pvt-hospitals-in-ludhiana-told-to-reserve-50-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-LqJExejrWkKaCwxSzPsulI.html
02-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana residents turn to night vigils to check open dumping of garbage||Fed up with open dumping of garbage, residents of Street 5 in Dhai Marla Colony (near Daresi) have started keeping vigil at night to stop people from throwing waste at the entry point of the street. Apart from being an eyesore, foul smell emanating from the accumulated garbage had become a nuisance for locals. Taking matters in their own hands, locals have cleaned the street and planted saplings in a bid to beautify the area. The residents have been guarding the street against litterers in two-hour shifts since July 14. Aware that residents from surrounding areas dump their garbage at the entry point of the street late at night and early in the morning, residents keep vigil in shifts from 8pm to 1am and 3am to 7am.Residents say a garbage dump had been there at the site for over three decades and despite lodging multiple complaints with the municipal corporation (MC), no relief was provided. The situation deteriorated during the lockdown and the monsoon season. Therefore, residents decided to take action on their own. One of the residents, Vinay, said, “The stench emanating from the site was unbearable. On July 13, a few residents dumped animal waste in the area, which exacerbated the situation.” Residents say a temple and the SDP College for Women were situated a few metres away but nothing was done to rectify the situation. “Some locals dump waste in the open to avoid paying charges for door-to-door collection of garbage,” he said.“RESIDENTS HEALTH COMPROMISED’ A resident, Som Nath, said,”It was shocking to see the residents dump waste in the open at 3am . We requested them to stop this practice. The health of many residents was being affected. Few residents remained adamant but eventually we were able to get the area cleaned.”Residents, Bittu Gaba, Ram Lubhaya, Raj Kumar, Sunny and Rajesh Verma, said after getting the area cleaned they had spent ₹15,000 on beautification of the area. MC supervisor Dhawal Sarswal and area councillor Prabhjot Kaur’s husband Amrik Singh also supported the residents. Councillor Prabhjot Kaur’s husband, Amrik Singh Bhola, said, “The A2Z company has been deputed for door-to-door collection of garbage and a warning has also been issued to residents. The MC supervisor also sat on guard with the residents to stop people from dumping garbage at the point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-residents-keep-nightly-vigil-to-check-open-dumping-of-garbage/story-VDPIw6rLxpRcoJ2a7jIvQN.html
