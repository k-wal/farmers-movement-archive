For the wet waste stream – biological treatment will be required to meet Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM) 2016 rules.”On the working of the existing plant, which was recently taken over by the municipal corporation (MC), IIT experts state that it is currently working at only 10% of its capacity.The plant was constructed in 2008 as per the Municipal Solid Waste 2000 (MSW) guidelines. “All machines are already 12 years old, which is practically the life of such machines. Primary and secondary shredders are not in working condition,” states the report.In a best case scenario for the existing plant, the report states, “For dry waste or mixed wastes, even after repairs/maintenance of existing machinery, shredder, trommels, etc., the existing plant will at best handle 60 to 65 TPD. Hence, if the corporation expects the plant to treat 200 TPD (40% of 500 TPD), additional new equipment will be required.”Terminating Jaypee Group’s contract, the MC General House on March 4 had approved a detailed revival plan that included getting the plant examined from IIT Roorkee.After MC took over the plant in June, it requested IIT Roorkee to visit the plant and suggest measures for improving its capacity and effectiveness.Notably, earlier National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research had also recommended, “complete replacement of the machinery to process MSW with new technology is required”.Poor solid waste management has been among the primary causes for Chandigarh’s poor performance in the annual Swachh Survekshan this year (rank 16) as well as in 2019 (rank 20).BOXFINDINGS IN THE REPORTThe plant is processing around 30 tonne per day waste – only 10 % of the design capacityThe plant is designed only for processing source-segregated dry wasteHousekeeping and regular cleaning, as well as painting, is not up to the markStorm water management is poorNo record of air emissions, compost quality and calorific value of refuse-derived fuel (RDF)RECOMMENDATIONSBy strict enforcement of segregated waste collection rules, the capacity can be increased to 20-40 %Keep the unprocessed waste in the shedFinal RDF should be stored in a covered area with regular testsRoutine operation and maintenance logbooks, and repair schedule should be maintained for all machinesConduct regular stack monitoring for air pollutants of incineratorsAfter incorporating these suggestions, conduct an analysis of all machines in coordination with the manufacturers and IITBut, the best way is to set up a new modern 500 TPD plant for dry and wet waste treatment in compliance with SWB 2016 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-dadumajra-waste-plant-can-perform-at-40-capacity-at-best-iit-roorkee/story-p6XzNAWEuzR1MPq8kk1PDJ.html
26-08-2020||City||Tough times ahead for daily wage workers from tribal villages of Shahpur||Around this time every year, Pandurang Kale, 45, used to return to Sarangpuri village in Shahpur, less than 90km from Mumbai city, after having earned a good sum by working as a daily wage worker in Bhiwandi and the neighbouring cities for six months. He used to help his family in agricultural activities till Diwali, after which he would return to the city. This year, the Covid pandemic and resultant lockdown have changed the pattern for Kale and other men from more than 300 families from the tribal villages of Shahpur and Murbad areas of Thane district, who travelled to cities to work in brick kilns or at construction sites. As daily wage workers, they used to earn around ₹15,000-₹20,000 over three months. Forced to return home in March, their earning took a hit and the extended lockdown is only adding to their financial woes, making even survival tough for many. “This is the time when our children used to be in ashram schools and receive mid-day meals. We would get food at our workplaces, but everybody is at home now. With no earnings and need for more resources, we started to cultivate rice in our front yard. This will help us for the next few months,” said Kale, who has a family of five, his mother, two children and wife. “Usually, the money we earn by working as daily wage labourers helps us sail through, even in case of an emergency. However, we could not earn anything after March this year and have exhausted all our savings. We have extra mouths to feed, with our children having no schools due to the lockdown,” said Vithal Wagh, 40, from Murbichapada village, also in Shahpur. Wagh has three children and elderly parents to look after. Hiralal Sonawane, CEO, Zilla Parishad, Thane, said, “We provide 5kg of grains every month to each person in the villages. We are also coming up with livelihood options for women self-help groups such as making masks, cloth bags or sanitary napkins.” However, the villagers claim they have not been getting food grains, “All that we get we divide it equally among all villagers. We will not be having any other source of income till Diwali now,” said Tulsi, 35, Wagh’s wife, who fears they may have to resort to begging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tough-times-ahead-for-daily-wage-workers-from-tribal-villages-of-shahpur/story-k0FdbgS7MQVejuxscomttJ.html

Throughout the audit, the squad found objection to ₹46.93 lakh in bills, of which ₹24.79 lakh was refunded. Earlier, the civic body had also suspended the license of the two private Covid hospitals and instructed them to refund the overcharged amount and follow all the directions set by the KDMC and state government.The squad had audited nearly 100 bills of these hospitals, following which it served notices to the errant hospitals, asking for explanations. Those hospitals which failed to explain their inflated bills had their licenses suspended and had to refund the overcharged amount to the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-recovers-24-79-lakh-in-inflated-bills-from-16-private-covid-hospitals/story-2NbKAFb6ZXxNBF7HrqLGON.html
26-08-2020||City||26-year-old gunned down in Modinagar, victim’s family names MLA’s husband in conspiracy||The police on Tuesday booked five people for the murder of a 26-year-old man in Modinagar in Ghaziabad on Monday evening and named three others, including the local MLA’s husband, for criminal conspiracy on a complaint filed by the victim’s family. Denying the allegations, the Modinagar MLA hinted at a political conspiracy to frame her husband. On Monday evening, 26-year-old Akshay Kumar was called out of his house near Tibra road in Modinagar town by a few persons who fired several gunshots at him and fled from the spot. The police said the victim was rushed to a hospital run by MLA Dr Manju Siwach and her husband Dr Devendra Siwach, where he was declared brought dead. “The victim suffered several gunshots and succumbed to the injuries. His body was sent for an autopsy. Soon after the incident, local residents, along with the victim’s family, blocked the main road for about an hour but left the spot after being pacified by the police. They gave a police complaint and named eight persons, including three for criminal conspiracy,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The victim was arrested last year in a murder case and was out on bail on health grounds, the police said. The five persons named in the FIR for murder and rioting are Ashwini Singh, Vikas Singh, Sappu Gurjar, Amit Kumar alias Chuhiya and Aditya Kumar alias Vasu. The three named for criminal conspiracy are Ruby Singh, who is the wife of suspect Vikas, Dr Devendra Shiwach and Ashish Kumar, who is the husband of a local pradhan of Tibra village. “The victim has several cases against his name and had been to jail for killing a man named Dipendra Kumar alias Dippan. Akshay Kumar was granted bail in November on health grounds,” Jadaun added. The police said most of the suspects named in the FIR were from Dipendra’s family or were known to him. “Ruby is Dipendra’s sister and Vikas’ wife. Dipendra was murdered in April 2019 and since then Akshay had been in jail and came out on bail in November 2019. Earlier, Akshay and Dipendra were friends but became rivals after a dispute regarding a canteen that they ran together,” Jadaun added. Manju Siwach denied all charges against her husband and said that it was up to the police to conduct a free and fair probe. “I can only say that my husband’s name has been dragged unnecessarily into the incident. The victim’s family had brought him to our hospital and the on-duty doctor declared him brought dead. After that, my husband had a look at the patient but he was already dead. Out of nowhere, on Tuesday, the victim’s family named my husband in the case. I am sure that it is due to some political motives,” the MLA said. “One of the reasons I could think of is that after the last year’s murder case, Akshay’s family had approached us to pressure the police to lodge a counter FIR against Dipendra’s family. But we refused to interfere and to take any side. Now, I want the police to probe the ongoing case in a free and fair manner,” she added. Police on Wednesday said they had come across CCTV footage in which Ashwini is seen talking to the victim outside his house when an I-10 car arrived. “Thereafter a shooting took place and one of the assailants, Anurag Tyagi, sustained suspected accidental injuries to his abdomen. Ashwini took him in the I-10 car to a private hospital in Meerut where Tyagi is in critical state. Ashwini, Vikas, Ruby and others are on the run. We arrested Ashwini’s brother Rahul Chaudhary for providing shelter to the assailants. So far, we have got no evidence against the MLA’s husband,” Jadaun added. Police sources said that Akshay Kumar sustained about 7-8 gunshots fired from a close range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/26-year-old-gunned-down-in-modinagar-victim-s-family-names-mla-s-husband-in-conspiracy/story-Op7k10azSk3vHkOuZVbtKP.html
26-08-2020||City||TMC seals three private hospitals for operating illegally||Nine months after the Bombay high court’s order to seal three private hospitals operating illegally in Kalwa (East), the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) finally sealed them on Wednesday. The three hospitals did not have no-objection certificates (NOC) from the fire department nor NOC for biomedical waste disposal, informed a TMC health officer. In November 2019, the HC had passed an order to seal the three hospitals in Bhaskar Nagar and Waghoba Nagar in Kalwa. “A petition was filed by Amit Mishra and Tribhuvan Singh in 2018 against the three hospitals. The petitioners claimed that the hospitals did not have fire NOC; permission to process biomedical waste; the structures were illegal; the doctors were not well-qualified, and the hospitals were operating illegally. Based on this public interest litigation (PIL), the court asked us to investigate the hospitals,” said Dr Raju Murudkar, civic health officer.The corporation found some of the claims related to fire and biomedical waste to be true and informed the court. “We told the court accordingly, and in November, the court asked us to seal the hospitals if the norms were not followed. We had given time to these hospitals to file for fire NOC, and they had applied, however, the fire brigade rejected the applications as the hospitals were not fire safe. They also did not have any system to dispose of their biomedical waste,” said Murudkar.Thus, a decision to seal these hospitals was taken. “We were going to seal them earlier this year. However, due to the Covid situation, we did not have the required manpower. The civic commissioner now gave orders to seal them,” Murudkar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-seals-three-private-hospitals-for-operating-illegally/story-alIhpvbWzq9vmRRKuRqc6O.html
26-08-2020||Noida||Forest department writes to police commissioner, seeks security for birders||In the wake of three wildlife photographers being robbed at gunpoint last week at the Dhanauri wetlands, the Gautam Budh Nagar Forest Department has written to the Noida police commissioner seeking security for birders.The letter, a copy of which was forwarded to the forest conservator and the regional director Meerut, oh which HT has seen a copy, asserts that a number of wildlife lovers and birders often visit the wetland and it’s important to have some security in the area for their sake.“Wetland Dhanauri in Gautam Budh Nagar is home to a large number of Sarus cranes. Due to this, birders, local residents and others often visit the area. It is therefore requested that you kindly instruct the Dankaur SHO to make proper security arrangements in the area so that birders can freely and fearlessly watch birds,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, while quoting media reports where birders claimed lack of security in the area.On August 24, three armed criminals on a motorcycle robbed two Noida-bases photographers of their camera which was worth Rs 5 lakh, while the duo was in their car. Following the incident, several birders had expressed shock stating that it would project the otherwise peaceful Dhanauri wetlands in a bad light. Meanwhile, police officers have said that they have already taken necessary steps to make security arrangements in the region. Officials said they were unaware about the importance of the wetlands or that it attracts many birders. “After the incident, we took necessary steps and deployed security personnel there. We were not aware that the wetlands attracted so many birders. It was only after the incident that we came to know about it. If necessary, we will also set up a police post in that area,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.Situated in Greater Noida, the Dhanauri wetlands are home to over 211 species of resident and migratory birds. It’s also believed to be one of the largest roosting and breeding ground of Sarus cranes in the region. The wetland has been proposed to be a Sarus crane sanctuary and a Ramsar site for which survey of over 101 hectares of the wetlands is going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/forest-department-writes-to-police-commissioner-seeks-security-for-birders/story-GJLFgrl13V4St8eX0WljeL.html

26-08-2020||Mumbai||Railways, civic bodies consider staggered office timings to curb crowding in trains||Commuters who used to travel in packed suburban trains prior to the lockdown may get some relief once the Railways decides to resume local operations. The Railways is in talks with civic bodies in Mumbai city and the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to see if public and private offices can agree to implement staggered office timings. The move is aimed at reducing the crowds in trains, which is the major reason why the authorities have been reluctant to resume the suburban train operations that were shut in May.The Railways, along with municipal corporations in the MMR are working on creating specific office shift timings and tweaking local train timings to avoid overcrowding inside compartments and on the railway platforms. A plan on the implementation of staggering office and local train timings is being finalised.Local train services were cancelled from March 23 to the general public. A few train services were resumed on June 15 only for those working in essential services in the city. Identification of government and private offices in different wards, along with recording details of employees are being undertaken, and a database will be created, said Railway officials.“We are working alongside different municipal corporations for the introduction of shift timings for offices. After the mapping is completed, staggered office timings along with revised train timings will be implemented,” said GVL Satyakumar, divisional railway manager, Western Railway (WR).The IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry expressed support for the idea. “IMC will fully support any decision taken that looks at lives and livelihood in a balanced manner. Mumbai suburban trains are the economic lifeline of the city and must resume with due care in place,” said Rajiv Podar, president, IMC.The plan to introduce staggered office timings was first floated by former Union railway minister Suresh Prabhu during his tenure in 2015. Prabhu, a resident of Mumbai, was aware of the commuting problems of locals.He had multiple discussions with the state government on ways to reduce crowding in trains. Prabhu had also directed Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) to prepare a report on the staggering of work hours. The report was later submitted to the state government and suggested that organisations which have a less public interface, including back offices, IT, manufacturing, corporate and accountancy firms should encourage their employees to work from home. Offices could also stagger the weekly-off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railways-civic-bodies-consider-staggered-office-timings-to-curb-crowding-in-trains/story-kOwmwskA5lOZZlA9YQsLOP.html
26-08-2020||Noida||Noida: Organic food company duped of ₹38L on pretext of Covid medicine development||A sector 58-based organic food company has alleged that it was duped of nearly Rs 38 lakh by a US-based firm on the pretext of procuring raw material for development of Covid medicine.The complaint was filed by officials of Elworld Agro and Organic Foods Private Limited located in Sector 58. They have alleged that they were contacted by a US-based firm for the import of Pictoria Oil for the development of Covid medication.“The first call came on August 14. They US firm alleged that they work for WHO and the Red Cross. The next call came on August 16 and then on August 18. One of them claimed to be a WHO representative posted in Delhi. They started communicating with our CMD for the import of raw materials,” said the complaint filed by the general manager of the company, Ram Kumar Mishra.The suspects then asked the company to purchase Pictoria Oil from another particular Indian company and supply it to them. Elworld Agro paid Rs 27.99 lakh to the above mentioned Indian company in multiple bank accounts.“They said that we should first send them a sample of one litre and once it is approved, they would take another 100 litres and transfer the money. Meanwhile, we were later asked for an additional Rs 10 lakh by the Indian company to ensure supply of oil on time, which we paid. On August 21, we were asked for an additional Rs 17 lakh. During this time, the payment instruction on the US company’s letterhead showed a figure different from what had been agreed on. The letterhead also showed that we had received payment, when we hadn’t. These immediately raised red flags,” said the complaint.Following this, a case was registered against three suspects, at the sector 58 police station under sections 420 and 406 of the Indian Penal Code and section 66 of the IT Act.Police officials said that despite the phone numbers seeming to be American, they could be local numbers being re-routed through a fake call centre.“The bank account has been traced to Maharashtra and the cyber cell is working on the case,” said Shavez Khan, station house officer, sector 58 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-organic-food-company-duped-of-38l-on-pretext-of-covid-medicine-development/story-ZcuQfCWEJqlxI3UaojfepM.html

According to the police, the suspect was nabbed and arrested following a complaint registered at the Indirapuram police station.Aastha Singh, a resident of Sector 3 in Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara, was on her daily morning run when the suspect, around 6:30am, came to the Budh Chowk area and allegedly tried to snatch her mobile phone. Seeing no one around for help, Singh chased the suspect for about 500-600 metres and nabbed the man red handed.“He was running very fast after snatching my mobile phone and I decided to give chase. When I got near him, I pushed him and he fell down. There was a scuffle and the man fell down. I landed several blows on him and by that time, some locals came. A 12-year-old boy who was cycling nearby also came for help and picked up my mobile phone which broke down,” she said. Thereafter, Singh, the boy and two other locals brought the suspect to a nearby police post but no cops were present, she said. Thereafter, a call was made to the police emergency number and a PCR van arrived. “Before the PCR van arrived, the man fled from outside the police post and boarded an auto which was going towards Sahibabad. The boy told us that he saw the suspect boarding an auto. Thereafter the PCR van arrived and the two cops asked me to board the vehicle and we chased the auto for about a kilometre. Near Sahibabad, the suspect de-boarded the auto and ran towards an area with some shanties. But we traced him and he was arrested,” Singh added. The young student is pursuing her second year of graduation from Hindu College in Delhi. “I was not afraid of the snatcher and chased him with a thought that how could he take away my mobile phone just like that. I was not ready to let him go so easily. So I got into a scuffle with him and finally he fell down before we took him to the police post,” she added.The police said the suspect was identified as Mohammad Faizal who is from Sahibabad. “Based on the complaint by the woman, we have registered an FIR and the man is arrested. He is a resident of Sahibabad. With efforts made by her we finally got the man arrested.

26-08-2020||Gurugram||Cyber City accident: Juvenile booked for drink driving||The police on Wednesday added sections 184 (driving dangerously) and 185 (for drink driving) of the Motor Vehicles Act to the FIR against a 16-year-old boy who was allegedly involved in the road accident that killed a 49-year-old motorcyclist, Alok Gupta, in Cyber City on Sunday morning. Police said the juvenile and his parents have joined the investigations and will be produced before the juvenile justice board (JJB) and a court respectively. Police said they have followed the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 2014, where it has been directed that in offences involving punishment up to seven years’ imprisonment, the police may resort to arrests only when the same is necessary and the applicant does not cooperate in the investigations. Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (east), said that they had sent a notice following which the family joined the investigation and are cooperating with the police. “If the applicant had not cooperated in the investigations, then we could have arrested them,” he said. Mohan said the offence is bailable so they did not apprehend the minor and have given direction to parents not to allow him to travel abroad or outstation without informing the police. “We will send him for counselling to the child welfare committee once his injuries heal,” he said. Police on Tuesday had recorded the statement of the two minor boys who were allegedly involved in the road accident that led to the death of Gupta. A case under sections 279 and 304A of Indian Penal Code was registered at DLF Phase 2 police station on Sunday. Gupta, a resident of BPTP Park Life in Sector 57, was on his way to Jewar in Greater Noida on Sunday morning, when a speeding MUV collided with his bike near Belvedere Towers in DLF Phase-2. Gupta was killed at the spot. He was accompanied by a friend, who was following him in another bike who took him and the two juveniles to a private hospital in an ambulance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cyber-city-accident-juvenile-booked-for-drink-driving/story-4CBObzQatFEp3sJ0xdlJAK.html
26-08-2020||Gurugram||Orange alert issued for Gurugram as authorities brace for rain; over 4,000 cops on standby||With the regional meteorological centre (RMC) issuing an orange warning for the National Capital Region (NCR) from Wednesday till Friday, the authorities are scrambling resources to ensure the city is better prepared against flooding as compared to last week.On August 19 and 20, heavy rains had left at least seven underpasses and most parts of Gurugram heavily inundated.An orange warning indicates high intensity of rain for which disaster management authorities need to undertake requisite preparations to prevent calamities and flooding.In this regard, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh on Tuesday night issued an internal order to all staff members stating that “severe to heavy rain is predicted from tomorrow (Wednesday) to August 29; All officers to maintain station even during weekend.”Singh said he has directed all staff members to be on alert with necessary equipment to ensure response against possible waterlogging can be swift and the impact minimised.“Prior to the monsoon season, we had formulated various teams of officials to undertake counter waterlogging measures. To ensure there is no reduction in their strength, and if additional manpower is needed all staff members have also been directed to remain in the city this weekend. Further, they have been told to keep necessary machinery on-ready so that these can be deployed at waterlogged spots immediately and the impact is minimal,” said Singh.According to MCG officials, over 450 staff members, which would include contractors, would be on stand-by.On Monday, MCG, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), district administration, and traffic police officials had held a video-conference to discuss and decide upon the various measures that can be taken to prevent heavy waterlogging in the city.During the meeting, officials of both GMDA and MCG were directed to clean and desilt drains, and install motor pumps at 18 critical spots across the city, including 11 new ones which were found to be heavily waterlogged last week.“We have installed more than 60 motor pumps at these 18 spots. At each of them, drains had been cleaned prior to the monsoon. However, the volume of rain was so intense on two continuous days last week that the existing drainage lines couldn’t alone suffice. We have once again cleaned these to increase their maximum drainage capacity along with placing additional machinery,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, while also stressing that these are all “temporary and short-term” measures and that MCG is working on long-term solutions as well.These 18 spots include Golf Course Road, Narsinghpur, Hero Honda Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, sectors 39, 28, 15 Part-2, 31, 10A, Sushant Lok-1, and South City-1.GMDA chief engineer Pradeep Kumar said that similar directions, as the MCG, have been sent out to GMDA officials to not venture outside Gurugram on the weekend and remain on standby.Kumar further said that site inspections were carried out at Narsinghpur and Chakkarpur bandh on Wednesday to check their drainage measures, and if any augmentation was required.“Prior to last week’s rains we had placed 12 large capacity motor pumps at different parts of the city. Now we have added 10 more to parts such as Jwala Mill Road, Narsinghpur, Golf Course Road among others to ensure waterlogging is minimal,” said Kumar adding that over 60 GMDA officials have been directed to remain on standby for heavy rains.Gurugram police meanwhile held a meeting on Wednesday regarding flood preparedness with all station house officers (SHOs) to discuss the next plan of action and for assigning duties to officials on-ground.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that tasks and deployment of various police teams have already been shared with all teams and a roster has been prepared with the area in-charges.“All teams have undergone briefing and have been trained to tackle the situation and how to remove vehicles stuck in water or potholes, as well as how to use ropes to remove them. We will also be using the Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) developed by the GMDA to monitor waterlogging and traffic jams for sending information to officials deployed at the affected spots. At least 4,250 police personnel are on standby and will be asked to reach the affected spot as soon as waterlogging begins,” said Rao.Rao said there is feed from nearly 350 CCTVs at the ICCC for keeping an eye on vehicular movement and to look out for water accumulation. Police said most of the important roads have been under surveillance and police teams have identified. “We are using wireless phones to pass on messages. The teams have been trained to coordinate between the ICC and on the spot so that there is no confusion and messages are shared promptly so that action can be taken immediately,” said Rao. At least 28 cars and 35 two-wheelers were removed in last week’s deluge with the help of cranes.The police commissioner said 32 traffic vulnerable points have been identified across the city and extra deployment has been done there to manage the traffic situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/orange-alert-issued-for-gurugram-as-authorities-brace-for-rain-over-4-000-cops-on-standby/story-c8n1uB9MlWvCzvtwcvMyIP.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||CSMT, Churchgate railway stations to get automated control gates soon||In a pilot project to reduce overcrowding in suburban railway stations, the Central and Western Railway will be introducing automated control gates on two railway stations.The gates will be introduced in September at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Churchgate railway stations. The gates will be operated with the help of QR codes that will be given to essential services workers who are currently travelling by local trains. This move comes as both the Central and Western Railway are working on methods to introduce social distancing inside the train compartments. Wearing of facial masks could also become compulsory inside the compartments.“Access control is very crucial in the current situation. The control gates will be introduced as a pilot project. We will attempt to use QR code-based passes to access the gate. If successful, it will be introduced in other suburban railway stations,” said GVL Satyakumar, divisional railway manager, Western Railway.Railway officials said introduction of these gates would be helpful during limited operation of train services. “Implementation of controlled gates is possible now when there are less trains operating with low crowds. The study will further help determine how access control can be implemented once train services resume,” said a senior railway official.Transport experts have suggested the implementation of access control along with capacity reduction in trains, screening of passengers, location mapping of passengers as solutions for the resumption of local train services in the city.“It is very crucial to have crowd and access control inside railway stations and local train compartments,” said transport expert AV Shenoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/csmt-churchgate-railway-stations-to-get-automated-control-gates-soon/story-x9EBTUOviv4TaZucg6UF0M.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||NEET-UG aspirants concerned about distant exam centres||After weeks of delays, the National Testing Agency (NTA) started releasing admit cards to all National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Undergraduate (NEET-UG) aspirants on Wednesday. However, by evening, several students raised concerns over the allotment of exam centres, which in some cases are as far as 85km from their residences.A total of 2.3 lakh NEET-UG aspirants from the state will be appearing for the entrance exam on September 13.Most parents and students are worried about making it to their exam centres in time, especially with the lockdown affecting routine travel in several parts of the state. With trains still non-functional, many students will have to depend on road travel between their residence and the exam centre.“We stay in Jalgaon, and despite seeking an exam centre within the city, my son has been allotted a centre in Malkapur, almost 85km away. We are worried about the commute on the day of the exam,” said R Mhatre, the parent of an aspirant.Similarly, several students in Mumbai are worried about making it to their exam centres as train travel remains restricted to the public. “We reside in Thane, but the exam centre allotted is in Virar, almost 56km by road. Since the trains are non-functional, we will have to depend on a private vehicle. These days traffic is a worry, so we might have to look for a place to reside closer to the exam centre, for a day before the test,” said Archita Shetye, the parent of another medical aspirant.Experts highlighted that this is a common challenge faced by NEET aspirants annually. “When it comes to the common entrance test (CET), students have the choice of choosing sub-centres in Mumbai like Andheri, Bandra, Colaba, etc. In NEET, students are only allowed to choose the city and not the sub-centres,” said Subhash Joshi, owner of a city-based coaching institute for NEET aspirants.Parents and students are now trying to reach out to NTA officials, hoping for a change in their exam centres. However, a senior NTA official told HT that such changes might be difficult this year, especially since every centre will only allow a certain number of students to ensure social distancing during the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/neet-ug-aspirants-concerned-about-distant-exam-centres/story-e3o7auMPURRK6cKfY2ikGM.html
26-08-2020||Gurugram||Virus cases slowly spike again in Gurugram, 54 zones under containment||After a brief complacency inducing pause, the Covid-19 virus seems to be multiplying again in the district — at a rapid pace.Officials said several areas of the district have witnessed surging number of Covid-19 cases, with the number of containment zones shooting up to 54 on Tuesday from seven just a week ago.The administration said that the number of cases had spiralled in areas falling under Tigra, Patel Nagar, Laxman Vihar and Wazirabad urban primary health centres (PHC), most of which are densely populated. These areas continue to be among the worst-affected since the end of June, the officials said. On Tuesday, the district administration was forced to notify Jacobpura under Patel Nagar as a large outbreak region (LOR) and map out a plan to conduct at least 111 testing camps in these areas for the next 10 days. A large outbreak area is defined as localised increase in the incidence of Covid-19 case occurring within a defined geographical area. Data from August 1 till Wednesday (August 26) shows that Tigra PHC has reported almost 1,018 Covid cases followed by 674 in Patel Nagar, 625 in Wazirabad, 549 in Laxman Vihar, 526 in Sohna, 426 in Chanderlok, and 363 in Firoj Gandhi Colony. Other affected areas like Nathupur and Mullahera have 274 cases each. For the last two months, these areas have been continuously reporting highest Covid-19 cases, compared to other parts of the city. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that Jacobpura had to be declared as an LOR as more than 15 cases in a single day were detected from the area. “As per government guidelines, any area which reports more than 15 cases in a single day has to be declared as a LOR. All the 15 cases were reported from the same family. Just like any other containment zone, proper surveillance and contact tracing will be carried out in the area,” said Yadav. In containment zones, maximum precaution is to be exercised, including strict perimeter control, to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones — except for medical emergencies or supply of essential goods and services. However, as witnessed in the past and reported by HT, the implementation of containment zone rules are lax on the ground. According to Yadav, despite announcing a number of measures to curb the movement of people and enforce social distancing, the results have not been satisfactory in the worst-affected areas. “Cases are surging and citizens have adopted a callous approach towards basic preventive measures. Therefore, containment zones had to be increased. The parameter for defining the containment zone has been changed, to impose some restrictions,” said Yadav. The administration can define the boundary of a containment zone, as per the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs while imposing lockdown norms.“Earlier containment zones were declared only if five cases were reported from the epicentre of the infection. Now, if three Covid-19 cases are being reported, we can declare an areas as a containment zone. Currently, the perimeter of the containment zone is 500 metres from the epicentre, which can be increased up to one kilometre if number of cases increases,” Yadav said.In June, the district health department, along with the district administration, has decided to reduce the perimeter of containment zones from 3 kilometres to 1 kilometre. Presently, a containment zone contains only a single lane or a particular floor of a tower from where cases have been reported and is sealed. The boundary of the containment zone in a residential area could be a mohalla or any lane in a congested area where a case has been reported. “It makes contact tracing, testing people with Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) easier. Even house-to-house surveillance becomes specific,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/virus-cases-slowly-spike-again-in-gurugram-54-zones-under-containment/story-HRtErpIi18l2krpHLFyrIN.html
26-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad’s Covid experience: Lessons of June, July help reduce severity in August||Since the Covid-19 disease was first reported in Ghaziabad in March this year, June and July were the worst months in terms of severity of complications, rising cases and fatalities. August has been relatively lower pointing to better detection, isolation and treatment of cases.SeverityTo determine how severe the disease was, HT looks at the number of deaths in these months and referrals from lower care hospitals to higher care hospitals. In Uttar Pradesh, hospitals follow a three-tier system -- L-1 for mild cases (asymptomatic patients), L-2 for moderate cases and L-3 for critical patients who may require ventilator support. According to official records, till August 24, just over three out of four patients who were referred from mild care to higher care hospitals were made in June and July (78% of 217 patients). Of the patients referred to L-3, 161 patients were referred from L-2 facilities.A high referral rate points to many patients not being detected and treated early.Deaths too have been largely curtailed, according to official figures. Of the 67 deaths in the district, only three were in August while June had 51 deaths, and July suffered nine fatalities. Last week, the district’s fatality rate went below 1% for the first time since June.Infections, testingThe district health department officials said that the test positivity rate (TPR, which is the number of positive cases per 100 tests) was at an all time high in the month of June, by when it increased testing in the wake of the Union government relaxing several of the restrictions placed since March 22 lockdown to contain the virus. The much faster but less accurate antigen testing protocols too were deployed widely. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a region with a comprehensive testing programme should have a TPR at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region.According to the figures of the district health department, the TPR in first 25 days of August has ranged between 4.21% to maximum of 4.7%. By comparison, June had almost consistently had a TPR of more than 5%, reaching a high of 7.54% on June 30. By July end, when it was about 4.8%, the district had brought it to “manageable levels”. Officials confident Till August 25, the district has also completed sampling of 180252 and has a positivity rate of about 4.22% which is a declining trend. “The two months of June and July were tough as number of cases and deaths spiked from what we saw earlier,” said Dr. NK Gupta, district chief medical officer. “From experience, we can say that the two months witnessed high viral load which led to complications in patients. Now, there is less severity. The situation now (as on August 24), only two of the total of 243 patients admitted to (10) private hospitals are on ventilator support.” Two severe months gave a reality check to the administration which swung into action to detect cases faster, establishing rapid response team and improving interaction with patients to monitor their health.“We enhanced contact tracing, focussed testing, surveillance and tracing of suspected cases to control infection. Presently, twice daily review meeting is held to assess daily situation. We have also stopped referrals to Meerut and have improved quality of treatment with high value medicines and equipment like high flow nasal cannula,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “We are monitoring hospitals and patients in home isolation daily. We are looking to keep the fatality rate below 1%.” Helping the administration is the state government’s decision earlier this month to allow home isolation of asymptomatic patients, which encouraged more people to be tested. The government also provided free medicines to treat the symptoms of the disease.Experts weigh inExperts say that Ghaziabad’s experience is similar to what was seen nationally-- effective measures brought down the growth rate, improved recoveries and prevented deaths. Now they have to watch out for complacency, they said.“If we got by figures, they indicate that things are under control. But the administration should not be complacent,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “There are examples where the infection has declined and cropped up again. The testing, tracing and treatment should continue besides people taking up precautions like wearing of masks, hand washing and maintaining social distancing, among others.” “The severity or the virulent effect of the virus is low right now. There are people who get mild infection but are getting treated at home. The severity has definitely decreased in present month,” said Dr Deepak Verma from department of internal medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-s-covid-experience-lessons-of-june-july-help-reduce-severity-in-august/story-xpYsdq4oxAw6SypbAKH0OI.html
26-08-2020||City||Assault on tea vendor in Noida: SI suspended for dereliction of duty||Noida A sub-inspector of the Noida police was suspended on Wednesday for dereliction of duty, days after a tea vendor alleged that he was assaulted by two policemen. The incident had come to fore on Monday when a purported audio of the vendor, who runs a tea stall at Noida’s Atta market, was circulated on social media. In the audio, the victim, Durgesh, claimed that a sub-inspector and a constable from the Atta police post assaulted him on Saturday when he tried to open his shop. He had also alleged that the two cops demanded ₹5,000 from him as a bribe.A purported video of the alleged incident had also surfaced. In the video, the sub-inspector is seen assaulting the vendor, the police said.Taking cognizance of the matter, the Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner had ordered an inquiry which was carried out by Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Zone 1. “The cops in question had gone to the area for a raid to ensure that guidelines of the weekend lockdown were being followed. The vendor had kept his shop open beyond permitted time and the sub-inspector had brought him back to the police post. However, he was not booked for the violation which was a mistake on the part of the SI. This is why he was suspended for dereliction of duty. He was seen assaulting the victim in the video,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1. However, police officials said that a probe in the matter has not yet revealed the role of any other police personnel. “Even the allegations of extortion or any money being exchanged have not been proven yet,” said the DCP. The DCP also said that if any violations are found during the weekend lockdown, the department will immediately take action against offenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assault-on-tea-vendor-in-noida-si-suspended-for-dereliction-of-duty/story-Nkh8iiQcFWwsrSaXRvdX2M.html

The highways authority decided to stop the work for a week from August 25 after an inspection of the ₹1,300 crore project was conducted by NHAI officials and some independent consultants. The authority has also imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 per day for seven days on the contractor and directed it to put the safety measures in place immediately. Ashok Sharma, NHAI project director, said that work on the entire road project has been stopped to ensure seamless barricading is done in all the areas where construction is being carried out. “NHAI has also imposed a penalty on the contractor and directed that proper barricades are installed, traffic marshals deputed along the road and potholes repaired regularly,” Sharma said. In the letter to the contractor, Sharma stated that he had inspected the project and found the work vulnerable to the road users from the safety point of view and that’s why a notice was being issued to suspend the work. The letter also said that the contractor will have to ensure seamless barricading and in case of any loss to third party bear the cost as per the contract. A span, which had been cast and fixed between pier 10 and 11 opposite VIP Green condominium in the first week of August, collapsed with a loud bang on Saturday night. The incident led to questions being raised about the quality of construction and processes followed by the contractor Oriental Engineering.A senior official of Oriental Engineering, the contractor, said that they have already started barricading the stretches where construction is taking place and more traffic marshals will be deployed. “Around 50 men have already been deployed. We are taking all steps to ensure safety of commuters and workers,” he said on the condition of anonymity. The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project (from Rajiv Chowk to Sohna) has two parts. The first part includes an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk to a point beyond Badshahpur. The second part comprises the expansion of 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and will involve construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch. On August 22, three girders of the elevated section of the project had collapsed near Vipul Greens condominium, injuring two labourers.NHAI officials said that the four-member committee of technical experts that has been formed to probe the collapse will visit the project site on Thursday for an inspection. The committee comprises VL Patankar, former director general (road) in the ministry of road transport and highways and ex-member, NHAI, AK Srivastav, advisor, NHAI, and two eminent bridge experts -- PG Venkataram and Vinay Gupta. The committee has been asked to identify shortcomings to ascertain probable causes that led to the collapse. It has also been asked to revise methodology of pre-stressing and erection of spans, measures to ascertain quality of spans already mounted and recommend measures to prevent such incidents, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhai-suspends-work-on-sohna-road-project-contractor-fined-for-inadequate-safety-measures/story-udj58FKchCvP3CmVGbUF3K.html
26-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram traders protest weekend restrictions to close all non-essential shops and markets||Citing loss of customers and earnings , over 150 traders, and mall and shopkeeper associations from various parts of the city gathered at Galleria Market in DLF Phase 4 on Wednesday to protest the Haryana government’s decision to close all non-essential shops and markets as well as malls on weekends. The group together addressed a letter to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the district administration asking for the restrictions to be revoked. They also carried placards against the government and also shouted slogans against the same.On August 21, the Haryana government had ordered all public and private offices, shopping malls and markets, except those dealing with essential services, to close on Saturdays and Sundays. It did not restrict movement of people. It was meant to control the coronavirus disease Covid-19 after the government saw that people were not following social distancing and other health protocols.As per the traders’ letter, in both July and August they the low footfall in the markets meant there was enough space to ensure social distancing and other Covid-19 safety precautions. They argued that markets and malls were not centres for the spread of the coronavirus. The traders, mall and shopkeepers associations gathered at the Galleria Market, had shops located in areas such as DLF Phases 1-2-4, sector 46, Sushant Lok 1, MG Road, and Ambience Mall.“The decision of the Haryana government is completely incorrect. We were already adversely hit by the shutdown of non-essential shops during the lockdown, and subsequent low footfall upon reopening. Many shops had to close down as a result. The little sales we were getting after reopening, a majority of this have been on the weekends. Thus, the closing on Saturday’s and Sunday’s will lead to more shops closing down,” said Neeraj Yadav, president, Galleria Market Association.Mukesh Kumar, a trader in sector 46 market, said that a two-day restriction to stop the spread of coronavirus defied logic.“From a logical perspective, the closing of non-essential shops for two days is not going to stop or limit the spread of coronavirus. There needs to be at least two weeks of continuous closure, including restriction in movement, to have any effect. Since this is not the scenario, we feel this entire weekend closure makes little sense,” said Kumar.Sanjay Bakshi, a member of The Shopping Mall, Arjun Marg in DLF Phase 1, one of the organisers of the protest, said that with the growth of online retailers, amidst the coronavirus outbreak, the businesses of markets and malls was further hit, and any further restriction will result in the dipping of sales.“When we reopened after the lockdowns were eased, we realised that online retailers had got a strong foothold in our businesses, during the time we were closed. Some of our customers had switched their practice of purchasing and this was affecting our business. Amidst this growing competition with online retailers, thus, another part-closure will give them another opportunity to fill in and capture our customer base,” said Bakshi. Despite calls and text messages, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri could not be contacted for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-traders-protest-weekend-restrictions-to-close-all-non-essential-shops-and-markets/story-OVrZTTDKlnKVfxBlEqtV0I.html

Short supply is causing the prices to go up,” UT market committee officials said.Explaining the plight of farmers, Prahlad SIngh Bhamia, who is based in Punjab’s Ferozepur district, said, “Farmers have been the worst hit due to shutting down of mandis. We didn’t plant enough crops due to uncertainty of sales. The recent rain only compounded the problem. It kept us from planting more vegetables and also spoiled the ripe ones.”Meanwhile, with the season for mangoes and pomegranates wrapping up, their prices have also spiked. Available for Rs 50-Rs 70 a kg two weeks ago, mangoes are being sold for up to Rs 130 a kg now, while the price of pomegranates has risen from Rs 120 to Rs 140 per kg. Market committee officials said both fruits may not be available in September, as their supply had decreased, which had led to the jump in prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vegetable-prices-soar-in-chandigarh-as-heavy-rain-spoils-produce/story-Z4osyOixXF8i2trBobbo0O.html

Interrogation of Rajinder led to the arrest of his brother-in-law, Chirag Rathi from Muzaffarnagar, and Karamjit Singh, a police constable from Muktsar, currently posted as driver with deputy director, chief chemical examiner, Kharar, said director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta. He added that the racket had been traced to associates of now dead notorious terrorist Harmeet Singh aka PhD.The DGP added that Rajinder belonged to Jandiala Guru, Amritsar, and is reported to be a close associate of absconding notorious drug smuggler Navpreet Singh, aka, Nav from Wazir Bhullar village, Beas, Amritsar. Rajinder was apprehended from Zirakpur on August 19. A .32 bore pistol and four cartridges were recovered from the possession of Rajinder, with 530gm heroin seized later from his flat at Riverdale Aerovista, Zirakpur. A criminal case under the Arms and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act has been registered at a Mohali police station against Rajinder, who has several other FIRs registered against him in the state. He has also been involved in recent hawala transactions to the tune of Rs 12 crore, according to the police. Rajinder has told the police that he was associated in the distribution network of drug supply, arranged by Navpreet. The DGP added Rajinder used to receive consignments, mostly from Srinagar and Delhi, to distribute it further in the state. The funds generated out of drug business were sent back to Navpreet through hawala channels. In April 2020 too, Police Commissionerate, Amritsar, had arrested one Hizbul terrorist Hilal Ahmed Wagay when he came to collect drug money on the instructions of Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo, a slain Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist.

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Reconsider Punjab food commission chairman’s house allotment issue: HC tells Chandigarh administration||Quashing the order asking former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and Punjab State Food Commission chairperson DP Reddy to vacate his government-alloted accommodation, the Punjab and Haryana high court asked the UT administration to re-consider the matter. Reddy had moved the high court (HC) in 2019, challenging the UT administration’s notice asking him to handover the Sector-16 accommodation that was allotted to him while he was serving as an IAS officer with the Punjab government. Reddy had taken premature retirement the same day he was appointed Punjab State Food Commission chairperson in 2018. In 2019, he had made a representation before the UT administration requesting that he be allowed to retain the house. The request was declined and Reddy was asked to vacate the accommodation, following which he had sought judicial intervention. Now, the HC has quashed the order, in which he was given a week’s time to vacate the premises, and the house allotment committee has been asked to re-examine the issue within 15 days and make an allotment as per his entitlement. Till the time, status quo has been ordered.Reddy had argued that being a chairperson, he is entitled to a higher category house against what he was occupying. He had also questioned why he was being asked to first vacate the house and then seek allotment as it would result in undue hardship and harassment.The UT administration had told the court that the house allotted to him stood cancelled and he was no longer entitled to any government accommodation on account of his appointment and is only entitled to house-rent allowance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reconsider-punjab-food-commission-chairman-s-house-allotment-issue-hc-tells-chandigarh-administration/story-ZrnusyC09i9fXWIHHA2QLL.html

The proposal was floated by MLA Surinder Dawar, following which mayor Balkar Sandhu and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma visited the fort on Wednesday after they flagged off mobile testing vans from the Daresi area. Established in the 15th century, Lodhi fort, also known as ‘purana qila’, is situated near Daresi and is said to be the last standing structure from the Lodhi dynasty. However, the fort is in a dilapidated state and a large section of the new generation is unaware of the existing qila. The authorities are mulling to develop it as a tourist spot.“The fort needs to be restored to its original glory as it is one of the historic places in the city and people should know about its history. I had also taken up the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu in the past and he has shown a positive demeanour towards the project. It can be developed as a tourist spot,” MLA Dawar said.Despite attempts were made to reach mayor Balkar Sandhu, he was not available for comments. The over 500-year-old Lodhi Fort was constructed by Sikander Lodhi in the last decade of the 15th century in Ludhiana, which itself got its name from the Lodhi dynasty, and was formerly known as Lodhi-ana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/smart-city-mission-ludhiana-admn-planning-to-renovate-lodhi-fort/story-BQiwSUJLZPkzIo1gKp8zyO.html

We want the Khattar government to reinstate the withdrawn 50% incentive. The central government pays Rs 1,000 per month to Covid warriors, and as promised, the Haryana government owes us its 50% (Rs 500 per month), which they are not paying,” Bhagwan said.They gathered in Panchkula at around 11am and started their march towards Vidhan Sabha at around 1pm.

26-08-2020||City||Two IGMC interns suspended for ragging||Two doctors interning at Indira Gandhi Medical College & Hospital, were suspended on charges of ragging on Wednesday after they were accused of abusing, manhandling and beating up a third-year student. The victim, who was at the hostel to appear for his supplementary examinations, said around 11.30pm on Monday two of his seniors abused him and beat him up under the influence of alcohol near the hostel gate. The victim was accompanied by his batch mates and the incident was also recorded on CCTV camera. He said seniors had been harassing juniors for the last three years and that juniors were forced to make seniors’ assignment files.IGMC principal Rajneesh Parhania said the college had zero tolerance for ragging. “The matter has been handed over to the anti-ragging committee, which has submitted its report to the police. We have heard both parties, who are blaming each other for the incident.”Shimla superintendent of police (SP) Mohit Chawla confirmed the report and said the police were conducting an investigation.

26-08-2020||City||Control of Vaishno Devi Shrine: HC issues notice to J&K, shrine board over Hindu Baridars plea||Pursuant upon a petition filed by Hindu Baridars, whose forefathers had the control over the Vaishno Devi Shrine, the high court on Wednesday issued notices to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. Justice Javed Iqbal Wani issued notices to the UT of J&K and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board to reply within four weeks. The petition has been filed by Baridar Sangharsh Committee through its president Sham Singh and 54 others. “The notices have been issued to secretary law department of J&K administration and CEO Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Ji Shrine Board,” advocate Ankur Sharma said.The petitioners through the writ petition challenged the constitutional validity of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board Act, 1988, which took away the control of the shrine from the hands of Hindus (Baridars) and vested it in the hands of the government. “Apart from this they have also sought a complete handover of the management, administration and governance of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine and its endowments and all other properties to the Hindus (Baridars), in true letter and spirit of Article 26 of the Constitution of India,” he added. Alleging mismanagement by the government controlled shrine board, the petitioners have also sought conduct of external audit of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Ji Shrine funds since 1986 through a reputed audit firm or an audit institution which should be constitutional or statutory in nature. The petitioners via their counsel stressed upon enforcement of fundamental rights as guaranteed under Article 25 (2)(a), 26, 29, 14 and 31 A (b) of the Constitution of India.Advocate Sharma stressed that in all these decades, Hindu religious institutions in Jammu and Kashmir have been under the control of state and the ability of the Hindu community to administer its own institutions has been systematically clipped and pared down. “The state in brazen violation of Article 14 has exercised its authority only against Hindu temples,” he said. The holy shrine of Vaishno Devi was discovered and established by Baridars under the spiritual guidance of Pandit Shridhar Ji in 10th Century A.D. Pandit Shridhar used to live in village Hansali at the foothill of the Trikuta Mountains. This village is in close proximity to the present town of Katra. The discovery of the Shrine dates back to the age of Mahabharata. There is sufficient anecdotal evidence available in public domain validating the veracity of this fact, he added.The management, administration and governance of the holy cave shrine including right of offerings always remained with the Baridars before it was taken over by the state in 1986. The temple administration was taken over by the government allegedly on the grounds of mismanagement and maladministration. Citing other reasons of the petitioners, advocate Sharma said the state must maintain the same degree of distance from Hindu religious institutions as it does with Muslim and Christian institutions. “There is no sanction in the Constitution for the state’s imposition on Hindu religious institutions alone,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/control-of-vaishno-devi-shrine-hc-issues-notice-to-j-k-shrine-board-over-hindu-baridars-plea/story-RSnQyX81RKVcXvQytwGmzO.html
26-08-2020||City||Give all teachers opportunity to serve in district, tehsil headquarters: HC to Himachal govt||Taking strong exception to the practice of influential teachers forming a cartel to ensure postings in and around district and tehsil headquarters in Himachal Pradesh, the high court on Wednesday asked the state government to ensure that maximum number of teachers, especially those whose children are to appear in the board and professional courses examination, are given an opportunity to serve in the district and tehsil headquarters or wherever requisite infrastructure like adequate band width, facility of tuition are available.The division bench comprising justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua, passed these orders on a writ petition filed by lecturer Sheela Suryavanshi challenging her transfer from GSSS, Sanjauli to GSSS, Theog, alleging that she was transferred on the basis of Demi Official note obtained by respondent Rita Chauhan, that too, during the ban imposed by the state government on transfers.While hearing the case, the court observed that both the petitioner and respondent, despite holding a state cadre post, remained posted in and around Shimla only throughout their entire service and it could not have been possible without the active support of official respondents.The HC said there has been a spike in cases relating to transfer and majority of these pertain to the respondent department i.e. education department and it is for this reason that the court in an earlier writ petition, decided on March 18, had recommended the state government to implement online transfer in its departments, boards, corporations etc having over 500 employees by framing an online transfer policy on similar line as that of the adjoining state of Haryana.The court said granting indulgence to any of the parties in this case will be causing manifest injustice to other teachers who are desirous of serving in Shimla and other district and tehsil headquarters but have failed mainly because of the cartel formed by the influential teachers like the parties in the instant case.Disposing of the petition, the HC directed the respondent state to transfer both the petitioner and respondent outside their home districts within two weeks and ensure that it should be a meaningful transfer and not mere adjustment.The court has listed the matter for compliance on September 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/give-all-teachers-opportunity-to-serve-in-district-tehsil-headquarters-hc-to-himachal-govt/story-de4XOrR4LyLT1CBIIMMz3O.html
26-08-2020||City||‘It’s our duty’: Karnal cops take lead in plasma donation||At Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College here, only 12 people have registered themselves for plasma donation and all of them are cops. After defeating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which they contracted in the line of duty, men in khaki from Karnal not only decided to donate his plasma for the treatment of the other infected patients, but also agreed to do it again in the next 15 days.Of these 12 policemen, seven have already donated their plasma and doctors claimed that these seven units (500ml each) of plasma can be used to treat 14 Covid-19 patients.The Haryana police department’s figures revealed that so far, 893 officials have got infected while on duty, while three of them succumbed to the virus. Currently, 273 police personnel are undergoing treatment and 336 of them are under isolation. WHAT MOTIVATED THEM TO COME FORWARDThese cops extended their support at the time when the Haryana government received a lukewarm response to its plasma donation call. Only 952 patients have so far donated their plasma at 14 plasma banks in the state despite the number of recovered patients going past 45,000 in Haryana.Karnal medical college blood bank in-charge Sachin Garg agreed that the response to plasma donation appeal was quite poor. “We need to encourage more people to come forward for plasma donation as this is the best available treatment for Covid-19.”He said 26 people were contacted for plasma donation. Twelve police officials were found fit for the donation and they got themselves registered voluntarily, Garg added. “I have donated my plasma voluntarily as I think it is our duty to serve the country at this crucial time. I did not face any problems post-donation. As per the doctor’s advice, I will again donate my plasma after 15 days,” said Devi Dayal, a head constable with the Karnal police. Another donor, who did not wish to be identified, said, “I am happy to learn that the plasma I donated could help two people. People should come forward to donate their plasma to help those in need.”Karnal SP Surender Bhoria said, “We are requesting our personnel, who have recovered from the disease, to donate their plasma. We have been getting a good response. Now, I would request more cops to contribute.”As per Kurukshetra SP Astha Modi, 35 cops in Kurukshetra were found infected till now. “But the number of recovered policemen is very low. However, we will motivate them to donate plasma,” she added.Mohit Kumar, a lab technician at Karnal’s plasma bank, said it takes only 30 minutes for donation. “We collect around 500ml plasma, which can be used for the treatment of two people. The donor can again donate after 15 days if he or she is fit,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-s-our-duty-karnal-cops-take-lead-in-plasma-donation/story-VHa6tKJF9LGlAnNg3abLaI.html

26-08-2020||Bangalore||How Bengaluru saw its Covid-19 success come undone||On June 9, an Indian health education minister posted an infographic on Twitter showing Covid-19 infections and deaths in the city of Bengaluru were running about half the rate in New Zealand, a country acclaimed globally for reining in the disease.The city — which has more than double the population of New Zealand — “stumps the Kiwis,” said the caption to the image posted by Sudhakar K., who is responsible for medical education in the southern state of Karnataka. Bengaluru, known to many as Bangalore, is the capital of the state.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHis tweet was liked and retweeted by thousands. But the celebration was short-lived.At the time, only about 450 cases of the novel coronavirus had been recorded among Bangalore’s population of more than 12.5 million, compared with more than 260,000 cases across India and about 1,150 in New Zealand.Thanks partly to a high-tech testing and tracing system monitored by masked officials on giant screens in a city “war room,” Bengaluru had contained the outbreak better than cities like Mumbai, which had tallied more than 100 times as many cases.Two and a half months on, Bengaluru, dubbed India’s Silicon Valley for its tech firms and startups, has reported more than 110,000 cases. Where its infections in early June rose by 25 a day on average, the rate is now more than 2,500. In New Zealand, the total caseload stood at 1,339 as of Aug. 25.Sudhakar did not respond to requests for comment, but his tweet remains online.Bengaluru’s early response was lauded by India’s government as a model, for its use of health surveys combined with efforts to tap tech expertise and cutting-edge software to analyse the spread of the disease.But after India eased a nationwide lockdown in early June, epidemiologists and government officials involved in the city’s response to the pandemic said they realised they had not planned enough. The experience illustrates the extent of the challenge faced by large cities across the globe, showing how rapidly an outbreak can snowball out of control.“The city had three to four months to plan for a surge in cases, but the city did not plan for the future. They mostly assumed that the lockdown implementation was sufficient,” said Giridhara Babu, an epidemiologist advising the state of Karnataka.Curfew and contact-traceIn late March, India enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns. Karnataka state was ahead of that with its own measures.It collaborated with software lobby NASSCOM to mobilise 150 employees from half a dozen IT firms to feed 20,000 international traveller records into a central system every day. Karnataka conducted a mammoth health survey. More than 40,000 government health workers roamed the state in pink uniforms and masks, surveying nearly 16 million households.Residents submitted to a curfew that emptied parks, malls and the city’s notoriously clogged roads, and officials tapped companies such as Intel , Alphabet’s Google and Mumbai-based Fractal Analytics for expertise and tools to help trace, predict and control the spread.Many surrendered personal information: At thousands of drugstores, officials collected contact details for people who bought drugs like paracetamol, to keep tabs on their health.A federal government study shows Karnataka on average tested 47.4 contacts of every Covid-19-infected person between Jan. 22 and April 30, compared with the national average of six.‘That many people’But in June, lockdown restrictions eased. People flooded back to markets that sell fresh produce and flowers.Besides locals, officials say tens of thousands of travellers streamed in from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, many unwittingly bringing the virus. The neighbouring states have been the two worst hit by Covid-19 in India.“We were sandwiched between these two states which already had a very high viral load ... so we were bound to get affected,” said Pankaj Pandey, the health commissioner for Karnataka.An estimated 45,000 people from Maharashtra and another 20,000 from Tamil Nadu’s capital, Chennai, streamed into Bengaluru in June, he added.“In the initial phase, the case numbers in Bangalore were so few, that people all over the country felt Bangalore is the safest. That may also have caused people to ‘reverse-migrate’ back to Bangalore,” said one official involved in Bengaluru’s response.“We didn’t look at the inbound travellers as a major source of infections,” the official said. “We never anticipated that many people would come.”Officials from Bengaluru’s municipal body, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), did not respond to queries on whether it failed to address gaps in its modelling systems.But Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, a bureaucrat running the Bengaluru “war room” said easing lockdown complicated the city’s efforts.Since late June, Bengaluru has been sealing areas where cases jump, said Korlapati, noting this involves placing barricades at entry and exit points - in effect quarantining entire neighbourhoods.“Aggressive testing of contacts and home isolation is the way to contain the spread,” she said. “That is being taken very seriously and is being done right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/how-bengaluru-saw-its-covid-19-success-come-undone/story-DFK7EwETVPOfMBT94ZWVkL.html
26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Frontline workers become first plasma donors in Ludhiana||Frontline workers, who were infected in the line of duty, have also become the first people in the district to donate their plasma to aid treatment of critically-ill Covid-19 patients in Ludhiana. Ludhiana Special Branch assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Dinesh Kumar and head constable Davinder Jeet Singh were the first to donate their plasma on Tuesday. Seven people, including five cops from Punjab and two healthcare workers affiliated with Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) have donated their plasma over the last two days. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said so far 298 cops had tested positive, of which 192 have recovered, and 104 are recovering. Two police officers, including ACP Anil Kohli, have died due to the virus.Similarly, 74 healthcare workers were infected in August, said district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh. Wish to payback society, says first plasma donor Davinder, who had contracted the infection in June, said, “Not many people get a chance to save other people’s lives and therefore, I was happy to donate my plasma and do something for society.” He suspects he contracted the infection when he came in contact with a man with fever and chills against whom a woman had filed a police complaint. “When I tested positive, I initially thought my life had come to an end. There was a lot of fear as ACP Anil Kohli had succumbed to the virus. However, I was more concerned about my family, especially my five-year-old son and my grandmother, both of whom fall in the vulnerable group,” said Davinder, who holds a masters degree in physical education. 53 cops willing to donate plasma Additional deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Rupinder Kaur Sra, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19, said around 50 cops are willing to donate their plasma. Sra said, “People in need of plasma can contact the police control room at 78370-18500. We have a list of 53 cops who have recovered from the disease and are willing to donate plasma.” Sra said around 6,000 patients had recovered so far. “Even if a few hundred of them decide to donate their plasma, it will go a long way in saving lives,” said Sra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/frontline-workers-become-first-plasma-donors-in-ludhiana/story-VTSnXuNMpec6tPeH2JzKmK.html
26-08-2020||City||Tarn Taran Cong chief quits party over ‘inaction’ in hooch tragedy||Blurb: Manjit Singh Ghasitpur said he has no right to remain in a party whose leaders are directly involved in illicit liquor tradeTARN TARAN Tarn Taran District Congress Committee (DCC) president Manjit Singh Ghasitpur resignedn from the post and the party on Wednesday over the government’s “inaction” in the recent hooch tragedy that killed 123 people.Ghasitpur, who had also fought 2007 assembly polls on the party’s ticket from Tarn Taran constituency, said “he has no right to remain in a party whose leaders are involved directly in the illicit liquor trade”. He also attacked the Amarinder Singh-led state government for “not fulfilling” the promises made to the people before the 2017 assembly election.Ghasitpur was appointed DCC chief in January 2019. His father Mukhtiar Singh Ghasitpur was a staunch leader of the party. From the sarpanch of Ghasitpur village, Mukhtiar rose to head the block samiti and served the party for several decades. After Mukhtiar’s killing in 1988, Manjit became active in the party and also served as a general secretary of the Punjab Youth Congress.“It has been nearly four years since we were voted to power. Amarinder Singh had taken an oath by taking Gutka Sahib in his hands to eradicate drugs in the state. But, ironically, our government couldn’t fulfil any of the promises in four years,” he said.He said smuggling of illicit liquor and drugs is still rampant. “Tarn Taran district was the worst affected in the hooch tragedy. I had recently talked to the Punjab president Sunil Jakhar and requested him to ensure prompt and strict action against drugs. It is shameful that some legislators of our party and their personal assistants are also involved in the illegal trade. The government didn’t take any action against the drug smugglers and those who sold and smuggled illicit liquor. Police are also sheltering the accused,” Manjit Said.Ghasitpur also said that he had sought time from Amarinder Singh for a meeting on hooch tragedy, but it was not given. “I am sad that the CM has no time for me. Tarn Taran district will be ruined if the illegal trade is not stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tarn-taran-cong-chief-quits-party-over-inaction-in-hooch-tragedy/story-lJTUFHXnsAkwSKOQtLWEWI.html

From 70 ST buses running on day 1 post-lockdown, the number has now reached 150 and buses are plying across the Pune division. Pune division is now gradually increasing the routes across the state and the number of buses while following all safety measures and social distancing norms at bus stands. “We are getting good response from passengers for all types of buses which started in Pune division. When we started the service on August 21, around 70 buses undertook a journey on various routes. As of today, we are plying more than 150 buses from the Pune division across the state. We will increased the number of buses and routes gradually. As the Ganesh festival is going on people will travel more after the Gauri visarjan day (day 5 of the festival). Once the festival ends, the number of passengers will also increase,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Yamini Joshi. Prior to the lockdown, daily 850 buses used to ply from the Pune MSRTC division across Maharashtra on an average. Majority of the buses would start from three major ST stands in Pune – Swargate ST stand, Wakdewadi ST stand (earlier it was at Shivajinagar) and Pune railway station ST stand. “We will be trying to reach our earlier daily count of 850 buses on the road. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have allowed occupation of only 22 seats per bus, so it affects us financially. Hence, we will be restarting routes as early as possible. We will be focussing on crowd-centric or revenue-generating routes like Kolhapur, Nashik, Aurangabad, Latur and Solapur. Once the people come to know that all types of buses are running on their regular routes, the passenger count will also increase and accordingly, the number of buses will increase,” added Joshi. Ashok Shewale, secretary of ST bus passengers’ group, Pune, said, “Lakhs of students come to Pune city for education and hundreds of youngsters come here in search of job opportunities. For them, the most affordable way of travelling are the MSRTC buses, as they can frequently travel to their villages and hometowns. Now with the ST buses plying, it has become easy for all of us to travel from Pune to other parts of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/msrtc-pune-division-plans-to-increase-number-of-buses-routes-post-ganesh-festival/story-MYRBSPhA5po3oLo2cgD3RO.html

Besides seeking punishment to the accused for committing offence of money laundering, the ED has also prayed for confiscation of his attached assets worth Rs 8.50 crore in the form of movable and immovable properties in the name of him and his family members Kumari Asha, Rahul Anand, Manorama Devi and others. During its investigation, the ED found that Thakur and his family members misappropriated the fund or grant-in-aid to the tune of Rs 7.57 crore for his NGO, which was eventually used for acquiring movable and immovable properties, including payment of fees for his younger son Mehul Anand’s medical education. The ED had initiated investigation under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of two separate FIRs registered by Mahila Police Station, Muzaffarpur, and by CBI in Patna against Thakur and others for misappropriation of funds received from government and other agencies in the name of NGO Sewa Sankalp Ewam Vikas Samiti and its sister NGOs, where Thakur was the de facto owner.The Muzaffarpur shelter home run by NGO Sewa Sankalp Ewam Vikas Samiti had hit the headlines after it was found that its female inmates were sexually exploited for years with the connivance of Thakur and others.Earlier this year, Thakur and others were convicted in the case by a Delhi court, where the case was transferred from a court in Bihar on the orders of the Supreme Court.Thakur is currently lodged in a Delhi jail, where he serving his sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-files-charge-sheet-against-brajesh-thakur-in-money-laundering-case/story-rt85FY9rnIkkBBdiBI9XqI.html

Participating in the video-conference of non-NDA chief ministers with Congress national president Sonia Gandhi, Singh said that all MLAs have been asked to bring their Covid-negative report before entering the assembly to attend the session. It isn’t clear how many tested positive before this, how many have recovered, and how many tested positive in the latest round of testing. “If this is the state of legislators and ministers, one can only imagine how grave the situation is on the ground (in the state),” the chief minister added. Punjab assembly Speaker Rana KP Singh said legislators are still in the process of getting themselves tested at the district level or at Chandigarh ahead of the session and the total number of members found positive will be available by Thursday evening. A Cobid-19 negative report is required ahead of the session called to adhere to constitutional requirements. State rural development minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa was the first minister to test positive for coronavirus but he has recovered and has been attending meetings.

26-08-2020||Delhi||St Stephens’ Math graduate bags title of world’s fastest human calculator||Any mention of Mathematics is often preceded by jitters. Nervous students try every trick in the book to evade taking up the subject and it is often seen as a necessary evil to pass grades. But Neelakantha Bhanu Prakash, a 20-year old graduate of Mathematics (Hons) from St Stephens College, is out to change this perception.Bhanu has become the fastest human calculator in the world after bagging the gold for India in the Mental Calculation World Championship at Mind Sports Olympiad. The event, held annually in London, saw virtual participation from 30 geniuses across 13 countries. “It feels that the efforts have paid off, but it’s also a lot of responsibility. There is a lot to do now,” he says. His tryst with maths began when he was five years old and had an accident. “Doctors said that I will be cognitively impaired if I didn’t keep working on these skills. So my mom brought me puzzles and that’s how I knew my inclination was there. I realised that calculations are something that I loved doing,” he shares. Growing up, he would practice for about 4-6 hours every day, but toned it down later. “There are other skill sets that I need to hone. If I was just a mathematics calculator and didn’t know how business worked or how policy worked, I wouldn’t be able to contribute anything at all,” says Bhanu who has 50 Limca Records and four world records to his name. Read: CBSE allows students who took basic math to pursue subject in classes 11-12 Not one to flaunt his skills, he never told his teachers or peers at the college the things he had undertaken. “They knew that I did something along the lines of calculations but I would just smile when they would ask me,” he says. Growing up a prodigy, was he ever asked to perform anything for relatives or neighbours? “It used to happen a lot when I was a kid, but after a time, even the people got tired. None of it is a surprise for them. In Delhi, I have posed as a magician and done shows at bars, without revealing that I have these records,” he says. Stressing on the need to promote the subject at a National level, he feels that films have played an important role in getting people’s attention. He says, “I am proud to say that Bollywood has successfully made it popular. My favourite movie on Math is The Man Who Knew Infinity (2016). The traction that I am getting now has been because this was preceded by all these films. Had it been anything else, or had the event not been called the Olympiad, this would not have happened.” Read: New math option helped govt school students score better in CBSE class 10 boards “Just like walking is good for the heart, math is for the brain. If we can convey this to people, then the fear for arithmetic will go away. Once these waves of fear go away, then it is a calm ocean,” he adds.When not doing calculations, Bhanu likes to read books, travel and play video games. “I am passionate about desserts and headed an ice-cream start-up in the past. I write codes and give business consultations. I like it when I am exhausted at the end of the day and sleep with a smile on my face because I have contributed something.

Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth medical college, hospital and research centre said, “We have asked for about 300-350 vials of the Covishield vaccine being manufactured by Pune based Serum Institute of India.” The vials arrived on Tuesday evening at the hospital at its Katraj campus. “Once the vials arrive, we will check the temperature logs of the vaccine. We have also called about five volunteers who will be tested for Covid and presence of antibodies on Wednesday morning. The eligibility criteria is that the person must be aged between 18-99 years without any comorbidities. Also, he or she has to be tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 and tests negative for the antibodies of the virus. So, the person must not be currently or previously infected with Covid. Among the five volunteers, whoever is deemed fit for the vaccination process will be vaccinated.

Dr Lalwani added, “We have got approval for first 100 patients and after that we will wait for a week as per the guideline prescribed by the drugs controller general of India and then the rest of the volunteers would be administered the drugs based on the analysis of the vaccine and its impact.” Among the five volunteers, whoever tests negative for the virus and Covid-19 antibodies will be administered the vaccine on Wednesday. The volunteers will be called on a daily basis to check for symptoms including nausea, fever and other symptoms. During the trials, the hospital will be responsible for data collections and also lookout for any symptoms or reactions that the volunteers experience due to the vaccine.

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM for filing review petition in Supreme Court on NEET, JEE||Chandigarh: With just days to go for the NEET and JEE exams for admission to medical and engineering colleges being conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday directed state advocate general Atul Nanda to coordinate with his counterparts in other opposition-ruled states for filing a collective review petition in the Supreme Court, seeking deferment of the exams. Amarinder gave the direction after a virtual meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with the chief ministers of seven opposition-ruled states to discuss this and other issues of common concern, including delay in GST compensation release and the farm ordinances by the Centre, according to an official release. “There is no time to seek time from the Prime Minister to discuss the issue. Let us all get together to move the Supreme Court for postponement of the exams, which are threatening the lives of lakhs of students,” he said in response to a suggestion in this regard. Pointing out that world over, exams were being held online, the Punjab chief minister suggested that JEE/NEET and other professional exams could also be held online and there was no need to put the students at risk. STATES NOT CONSULTED ON NEP: CAPT Referring to the New Education Policy, Amarinder said that it was thrust on the states without consultation. He said his government would be setting up a committee soon to assess the impact of the New Education Policy on the state’s education system and finances. “Every state has its own system, which the Government of India failed to take into account before announcing the policy,” he said.

26-08-2020||Pune||PMC to increase artificial tanks amidst demand to open visarjan ghats||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) after learning lessons from the Ganpati visarjan on Sunday, has now decided to increase the number of artificial tanks for the next visarjan days during the ongoing Ganeshotsav. An urgent meeting was called on Tuesday by PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar with all ward officers to plan and make arrangements of the immersion days ahead. Currently, there are 30 artificial tanks in the city which will be increased to 45 by PMC for the 5th, 7th and 10th day of visarjan. Also, it has been appealed to all city corporators to make arrangements for artificial tanks in their own wards as per the need of the public. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane and other senior officials were also present for this meeting. “On Sunday which was the first visarjan day, 679 Ganpati idols were immersed in artificial tanks in Pune city and 610 idols were donated at various idol donation centres. Last year, on this day only 15,000 idols were immersed in the tanks which mean more than 14,000 citizens have immersed their idols at home. So looking at the response we have planned to increase the number of tanks to 45 in the city. A review of the current situation of tanks and arrangements was taken in today’s meeting,” said Mohol. “On the 5th, 7th and 10th day of Ganeshotsav, the number of idols for immersion is high. On the last day itself, around 3.5 lakh idols are immersed across the city and if this number is taken into consideration, there will be a huge crowd that would come on the road for immersion. So our request and appeal to Punekars is that they should immerse their idols at home and the necessary things like ammonium bicarbonate will be provided to them on the ward office level. This will certainly help to prevent the spread of virus during the crisis situation in Pune.” said Rasane. Meanwhile, there has been a demand to open up the visarjan ghats for the public and make necessary safety arrangements for those people who want to immerse idols in the river.“If PMC is making arrangements for artificial tanks then they should also make safety arrangements at the visarjan ghats too. People are ready to follow all safety measures and social distancing norms and willing to immerse their Ganpati as per tradition in the river. PMC cannot force and suppress the religious sentiments of the public by telling them to immerse idols only at home or in the tanks. There were incidents of people riskily going to the riverside to immerse their idols on Sunday. If something happens to them will PMC take responsibility?” asked Sunil Ghanwat, Maharashtra state spokesperson of Hindu Janjagruti Samiti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-increase-artificial-tanks-amidst-demand-to-open-visarjan-ghats/story-3oGctKAqz3DbhFWKxHGqaP.html

In addition, he was also planning to clear his housing loan, which has now been postponed. “I initiated a door-to-door campaign in the worst-hit slums of Mumbai. We initially focused on Borivali and Dahisar, and my team personally visited zero-income families in these areas with daily and weekly deliveries of food supplies.

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Annual Manimahesh Yatra comes to symbolic end with priests performing rituals, taking holy dip||The annual pilgrimage to the glacier-fed Manimahesh Lake in tribal Bharmour valley of Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh has concluded with only priests performing the rituals and taking the holy dip. Manimahesh Yatra, which began on August 12, was held symbolically this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak. A handful of devotees and priests were allowed at the lake at the start of the yatra, which was not open for the public this time in view of the social distancing norms. Bharmour additional district magistrate (ADM) Prithi Paul Singh said that only 60 people, mainly priests were allowed at the lake on the concluding day on Tuesday. He said that the priests had reached the lake on Monday with the holy mace of Lord Shiva. “The yatra concluded with priests performing the rituals of crossing the lake and then taking a holy dip,” Singh said. No commercial activities were allowed this year. However, facility for the stay of priests was set up and a rescue team was also deployed. Last year, more than 3 lakh people had visited the holy lake. This year the number was not more than 100. TREK OF FAITH Every year, pilgrims trek to the oval-shaped lake, located at a height of 13,500ft above sea level, to catch a glimpse of Mount Kailash, believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva, and offer prayers. The uphill journey starts from Hadsar, a hamlet located about 12km from Bharmour town that serves as a base camp of the annual pilgrimage. Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of this pilgrimage. A rock formation in the shape of a Shivling on Kailash is considered to be the manifestation of Lord Shiva. The snowfield at the base of the mountain is called Shiva’s Chaugan. Mount Kailash is considered invincible. No one has so far been able to scale this peak. Manimahesh is approached from different routes. Pilgrims from Lahaul-Spiti come through Kugti pass. Some from Kangra and Mandi come via Kawarsi or Jalsu passes. The easiest route is from Chamba and runs through Bharmour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/annual-manimahesh-yatra-comes-to-symbolic-end-with-priests-performing-rituals-taking-holy-dip/story-Q2TTEYiwcXFtWuVNS1eyCL.html

Amravati jail officials alerted Samta Nagar police authorities about him going missing and the latter started a search for the absconding convict.He was arrested on Monday and the following day a local court sent him to Thane jail, said Raju Kasbe, senior inspector, Samta Nagar police station.Soon, Amravati jail authorities will take Saujani’s custody. Amravati jail superintendent will conduct an investigation and prepare a report about his offence.He may be blacklisted from the prison’s maafi system, which ensures speedy reform of a prisoner by legally awarding h/him remission, as an incentive on the basis of good behaviour.“He is unlikely to get the monthly seven-day (annually 84-days) remission that a prisoner gets while serving a sentence because he is guilty of flouting the rules. He will be deprived of the 30-day AGCR (Annual Good Conduct Report) remission. Altogether, he stands to lose his annual 114-day remission. His name is also likely to be deleted from the maafi register that keeps a record of every inmate’s remission,” said a DIG-rank official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/murder-convict-who-jumped-furlough-arrested-after-40-days/story-v4gsnBUVZ3ovAwJlYH2klL.html
26-08-2020||Lucknow||Increase daily Covid-19 tests to 1.50 lakh, says CM Yogi Adityanath||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday expressed satisfaction over daily 1.46 lakh novel coronavirus tests being done in Uttar Pradesh and issued directions for increasing the capacity to 1.50 lakh per day. In a meeting with senior officials, Adityanath said there was a need to think “two steps ahead” to effectively check the coronavirus spread. He said 1.46 lakh tests were done in the state on Tuesday and it should be increased to 1.50 lakh per day, adding that testing plays the most important role in controlling the infection. Work on enhancing the testing capacity should be continued, he said. The chief minister said it was because of the strategy adopted by the government that the fatality rate in the state was “much less” than elsewhere in the country and the world. He stressed on adopting an effective strategy for bringing the fatality rate to its lowest. There is a need for more studies and researches to understand the nature of the virus. There is a need for a detailed study on medical treatment of the patients who have recovered from the virus as this would help in formulating the strategy ahead, Adityanath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/increase-daily-covid-19-tests-to-1-50-lakh-says-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-7H1tR3xvvxRhU8bCrvZTmM.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||HC refuses to entertain plea against ICAI’s decision to transfer money to PM CARES Fund||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the decision of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to transfer Rs 15 crore to the PM CARES Fund.A division bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan heard the matter through video conferencing and while refusing to entertain the plea, said how a PIL can be filed when the members of ICAI were not aggrieved by the transfer of funds.The court later asked the petitioner Navneet Chaturvedi to either withdraw the matter or face dismissal with cost, so the counsel for the petitioner then decided to withdraw the plea and the court dismissed it as withdrawn.The petition claimed that the decision was taken by the ICAI on a request made by the then Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs.If the members of ICAI are not opposing the decision of contribution towards the PM Cares fund, then what are the grounds for a PIL, the bench said while raising contention of the petitioner.Earlier, the Delhi High Court had rejected a PIL seeking directions to bring the PM CARES fund under the ambit of Right to Information (RTI) Act for more transparency.

Special prayers were organised at multiple places in the state including the capital city of Kolkata and Siliguri’s Pradhan Nagar. “Let us always meet each other with a smile, for the smile is the beginning of love,” Banerjee tweeted.Mother Teresa, who was born in a family of ethnic Albanians in Skopje in 1910, left home at the age of 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland’s Rathfarnham with the hopes of becoming a missionary. "Let us always meet each other with a smile, for the smile is the beginning of love."Fondly remembering Mother Teresa (Saint Teresa of Calcutta) on her birth anniversaryShe moved to British India in the late 1920s and started teaching history and geography for a decade and a half at the St Mary’s High School in Calcutta, as the city was known then. Soon, she realised that helping those who belonged to the unfortunate sections of the society was her calling and decided to leave the church in 1948. Two years later, she founded the Roman Catholic religious congregation which is now referred to as the Missionaries of Charity. #WestBengal: A homage prayer was offered in front of #MotherTeresa's tomb at The Mother House Of the Missionaries Of Charity in Kolkata today, on the occasion of her 110th birth anniversary. pic.twitter.com/E3wJ2cTwamShe had a long association with West Bengal. Whether it was educating the poor children and providing them food and healthcare despite the lack of financial resources, Mother Teresa had always helped those in Bengal and across India who felt they were ignored and considered a liability.She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace”. Mother Teresa refused to accept the prize money worth $192,000 and insisted that the amount should be spent on helping the needy in India.She was declared as the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Calcutta in 2017 by the Vatican for her selfless service towards helping the underprivileged in the city.(With inputs from ANI )||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/smile-is-the-beginning-of-love-mamata-banerjee-remembers-mother-theresa-on-her-110th-birth-anniversary/story-jjRb65VRWApKQTrcTijAgP.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Double the number of Covid tests in Delhi, orders Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that he issued directions to double the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests in the national capital within a week following a spike in the viral outbreak cases being recorded since August 17.Delhi recorded 1,544 and 1,693 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. The CM said he gave directions to strengthen enforcement of rules such as wearing of masks in public places and strict adherence to social distancing norms in a bid to keep the raging contagion at bay.He said that the Delhi government would provide pulse oximetres and oxygen concentrators, if needed, to Covid-19 patients after they recover from their viral infection. Several cases were reported, where Covid-19 patients continue to suffer from respiratory complications even after they had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, which caused the disease, he added. “For nearly one and a half months now, the Covid-19 situation in Delhi is under control. But, since August 17, Covid-19 cases have been on an upswing. On Wednesday’s health bulletin, Delhi recorded 1,693 new Covid-19 cases. While on Tuesday, 1,544 new Covid-19 cases were recorded,” said the CM while addressing media persons on Wednesday afternoon via a video-conference.“However, other parametres are in good shape. For instance, the death rate is low. The case fatality rate (CFR) has come down to 1.4% and continues to be among the best in the country. We have adequate hospital beds as well. At present, there are 14,130 hospital beds, of which 10,448 beds are still lying vacant. The recovery rate is good. The the home isolation model is also doing well. No Covid-19 patient has died during home isolation since July 14,” Kejriwal said.Tuesday’s 1,544 new Covid-19 cases reflected the highest single-day spike in the viral outbreak in Delhi in 40 days. The surge comes at a time, when the state government has urged the Centre to resume Metro Rail services in the national capital region (NCR) that have been suspended since end-March in a bid to contain the pandemic.“Today, we held a meeting, where I issued directions asking for the number of Covid-19 tests be doubled within a week. At present, we are conducting 20,000 Covid-19 tests a day. It will be 40,000 from next week. Our strategy remains the same – test and isolate,” said Kejriwal while urging the public to get themselves tested for the pathogen, if they feel the mildest of influenza-like symptoms.A senior government clarified that the CM referred to both real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests as part of the state government’s aggressive daily testing mechanism.Soon, the Delhi government is likely to formulate a way to ensure a proportionate increase in both types of tests.“We have noticed another trend. Covid-19 patients are developing respiratory problems after their recovery. There have been a few instances of death as well. We have decided that Covid-19 patients discharged from hospitals after their recovery would now be given pulse oximetres for a certain period. Oxygen concentrators will be sent to them in case their oxygen levels drop at any point in time,” the CM said.Covid-19 patients under home isolation already get pulse oximetres. The provision to request for oxygen concentrators would also be available for them. In each revenue district, the district magistrates (DMs) are the custodians of the oxygen concentrators, said an official in the chief minister’s office (CMO).Kejriwal said that he also directed the authorities to strengthen enforcement of rules. “People should wear masks and maintain social distancing. Confidence is good, but it should not lead to complacency at any cost. We hope nobody is penalised. In case a person gets fined, that person must understand that it is for a greater good,” the CM added.Earlier on Wednesday morning, the CM had called a meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev and senior health department officials.Dr Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), welcomed the Delhi government’s strategy. “Covid-19 cases are going up in Delhi. At this stage, the government must go for aggressive testing, isolate infected people and strengthen its surveillance mechanism. The public should always wear masks, adhere to social distancing norms and follow respiratory etiquettes. There is no room for complacency,” said Dr Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/double-the-number-of-covid-tests-in-delhi-orders-kejriwal/story-bwN6z7j85fzi6Lo3pfYChL.html

The survey claims that 825 of these beggars are illiterate while 39 are literate and other 193 have gone to school. The five beggars to have earned at least a post graduate degree are located in Ramniwas Bagh, C-Scheme and the Walled City. While one is a post graduate in arts, another has a post graduate degree in commerce and three have graduated in arts. Two out of the five are between the age group of 50 and 55, two are between 32 and 35 years of age and the fifth beggar is 65-years-old. The survey was conducted with an aim to make Jaipur city free of beggars by imparting them necessary skills where possible; and introducing others to un-skilled professions. The five beggars with college education said they were ready to work at hotels, construction sites and in other un-skilled avenues. “I am from Jhunjhunu and I did my graduation 25-years-ago from a government college. I came to Jaipur to find a job but I didn’t find one. Things got difficult for me in the city. For many days I had nothing to eat and no place to sleep. I had nobody in the family, so I was forced to beg in front of others on the streets for my survival,” said one of the graduate beggars. He said he will be obliged if given an opportunity to earn his bread with dignity and pride. “I am open to any work or job, from a labourer to any other work like cleaning, hotel staff etc. I only expect a decent return through which I can buy my butter and bread and pay rent to live. Everybody wants to live a dignified life and we would be thankful to the administration if they do that,” the beggar said. 419 of the surveyed beggars in the city echoed the sentiment and said they didn’t want to beg but didn’t have any other work, 27 of them said they wanted to study. The survey also revealed that 119 beggars live in Kotwali police station area, 180 in Ashok Nagar, 85 in Moti Dungri, 58 in Lalkothi, 64 in Sindhi Camp, 39, in Gandhi Nagar, 37 each in Brahmpuri and Shastri Nagar, 46 in Pratap Nagar and rest in other parts of the city.

He submitted the woman did not want to pursue the criminal proceeding and urged the court to quash the first information report (FIR) against the boyfriend.Additional public prosecutor, Aruna Pai, opposed the prayer and requested the court to impose a fine on the petitioner if at all the court was inclined to quash the FIR.The bench accepted the prosecutor’s request. It said the claim of the petitioner that the complaint was filed under pressure could not be accepted. The bench agreed to quash the FIR as the woman did not want to pursue the case any further but on the condition of making a contribution to the welfare fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-quashes-rape-case-on-complainant-s-request-fines-her/story-XA8bKdqUwF2pX1zmVBWCoL.html

National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) officials said the boy was rescued after 19 hours and Kazi after 27 hours of the collapse on Monday. They added nine people were found alive while bodies of 16 men, women, and children were recovered from the site.NDRF public relations officer Sachinand Gawade said they were carrying out a final search to ensure that no body is buried although the administration said all missing people have been traced.The Mahad police on Tuesday booked five people, including the builder of the building, for the collapse. According to the First Information Report filed in the case, the building had 40 flats and was constructed in 2013 after a two-year construction.District collector Nidhi Chaudhari said most residents ran out of the building as it started trembling.

26-08-2020||Delhi||Khosla ka Ghosla, real-life edition: 65-year-old held for property fraud||A senior citizen (65) was arrested for his alleged involvement in his bid to sell a plot of land in south-west Delhi’s Dwarka while using forged documents. His alleged crime has an uncanny resemblance with the 2006 Bollywood flick Khosla Ka Ghosla.Delhi Police explained the arrested accused Abhay Veer Batra’s modus operandi. Batra would grab an unoccupied piece of land, forge documents to show the property in his name and then use the papers to either compel the actual owner to strike a deal or sell off the plot to him at a throwaway price, said RP Meena, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) (Dwarka), Delhi Police. Batra’s criminal act has echoes of Khosla Ka Ghosla, where a greedy property dealer had used fake documents to grab the land of an unsuspecting common man, whose role was essayed by actor Anupam Kher in the film, said the police. However, there was a primary difference between the reel and the real. In the film, Kher’s family had staged an elaborate drama to deceive the usurper and got back their plot, but in reality it was the Delhi Police that cracked the case. Batra has been accused of 17 similar cases of cheating and fraud registered against him since 1999. Most of the cases were filed in areas in west Delhi such as Hari Nagar, Janakpuri, Vikaspuri, and Nangloi. He has also been charged for a similar offence in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. Batra’s luck ran out, when he got busted in the latest case.On June, 2019, his latest victim, Kishore Chand Aggarwal, visited Dwarka (North) police station. “Aggarwal told us that he was the owner of a 209-square metre plot in Sector 13, Dwarka. But he had come to know from property dealers that another man was trying to sell the property by an illegal possession over his plot,” said ADCP Meena. Aggarwal had found about the illegal occupation of his property upon a visit to the plot, where he saw building materials were lying scattered in a bid to erect a boundary wall around the land, said Meena. “Our preliminary probe revealed that a man named Batra was trying to sell the plot. Prima facie, it is a crime because both the parties were producing documents to claim an ownership of the property. We registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy,” he said. Soon, the police verified the authenticity of the documents of both the parties. Aggarwal’s documents showed that he had purchased the property from its previous owner through a sales deed on August 3, 2004. “Batra’s documents showed that he had purchased the property from a woman through a general power of attorney (GPA) and a sale agreement on January 7, 2004. The documents showed that the woman had bought the land from its previous owner,” said the ADCP. The police visited the previous owner of the plot and allegedly confirmed that he had sold the property to Aggarwal. “He identified Aggarwal’s signatures on the documents and said he didn’t know the woman in question,” said Meena.Later, though the police tried to trace the woman, who was mentioned as the owner of the plot in Batra’s documents, she turned out to be a fictitious character.“Batra had forged all the documents related to Aggarwal’s plot ,” said the ADCP. Batra, who lives in Hari Nagar with his family, was arrested last Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/khosla-ka-ghosla-real-life-edition-65-year-old-held-for-property-fraud/story-tZbJXpuVnli7AHJilHQHgP.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Yamuna continues to flow near warning level in Delhi||On Wednesday morning, the water level of the river Yamuna at Delhi’s Old Railway Bridge was recorded at 203.78 metres. The warning level is 204.50 metres. This was after 13,433 cusec water was released from Haryana’s Hathni Kund Barrage in the Yamuna around 8am. However, this is still lower than Monday’s level of 204.38 metres, the first time this year it was recorded close to the warning mark. Officials in the Delhi government’s Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) department said that the level recorded Wednesday is below the warning mark at present and is likely to remain so unless a higher volume of water is released. “Water is released into the barrage every four hours. On a regular basis, only 350 cusecs of water is released. During the monsoon, because of the higher volume of water in the barrage coupled with rainfall in the hilly regions, more water is released, which leads to a surge in the Yamuna. It takes about 36 to 72 hours for the released water to reach Delhi. We are continuously monitoring the water levels,” said Sanjeev Kumar, SDM (Preet Vihar) and officer-in-charge, Flood Control. Last year, Haryana had released over eight lakh cusecs of water in a day, after which the water level breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres. Kumar said that preparations are already underway in case a higher volume of water is released and evacuation operations need to be launched. “We have identified locations for pitching tents. Besides, since social distancing is the norm during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have also identified schools where people can be moved with enough space to maintain physical distance,” said Kumar.Delhi had witnessed major floods in 1978 when the water level in the Yamuna rose to its highest-ever level, recorded at 207.49 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/yamuna-continues-to-flow-near-warming-level-in-delhi/story-hZCdkT2uYsIoMUFIUXDAdP.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Yamuna continues to flow near warning level in Delhi; water level likely to increase further||The Yamuna was flowing close to the warning mark in Delhi on Wednesday morning and is likely to swell further with more water being released into it from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, officials said.  The water level was recorded at 203.78 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 8 am. Water was being released into the Yamuna at the rate of 13,433 cusec at 8 am from the Hathnikund barrage, an official of the irrigation and flood control department said. One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litre per second.The water level was recorded at 203.98 metres at 6 pm on Tuesday, precariously close to the warning level of 204.50 metres, according to the official. The river had swelled to 204.38 metres on Monday, which was just a metre below the danger mark of 205.33 metres.“The flow rate was 36,557 cusec at 5 pm on Tuesday, the maximum in the last 24 hours. The water level is likely to increase in the next 48 hours,” he said. The water discharged from the barrage — which provides drinking water to Delhi — usually takes 72 hours to reach the capital.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.Last year, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 meter-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 meters.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.Also read: IMD forecasts moderate to heavy rain in Delhi starting todayDelhi’s water minister Satyendar Jain had Monday said the government was ready to deal with any flood-like situation.The India Meteorological Department has also warned of “heavy to very heavy” rainfall in northwest India, which is likely to increase water levels of the river.“Heavy to very rainfall is likely in northwest India over the next three to four days due to the northward shifting of the monsoon through,” Kudeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/yamuna-continues-to-flow-near-warning-level-in-delhi-water-level-likely-to-increase-further/story-9YjaKD3pfvMtNN6eufTZwM.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||12-year-old Mumbai boy tracks missing mobile phones||Mansoor Nasir Shaikh, 12, had not used a smartphone until about four months back. He started using a laptop only two months ago when his school switched to online classes because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The boy was immediately hooked on the gadgets so much so that he learnt tracking lost mobile phones by reading about the technique to do so on the internet much to the surprise of his parents, constables Nasir Shaikh and Rehana Shaikh. The parents came to know about Mansoor’s ability to locate lost phones when he tracked his cousin’s phone after she had left it in a taxi while travelling from Mumbai Central to Mahim on August 19.Mansoor began working on tracking the phone as he overheard his aunt seeking his mother’s help in finding it. He immediately contacted his cousin, Muskan Bagwan, and took her phone’s unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number and began tracking it. Within 35 minutes, he located the phone worth Rs 27,000 to an area in Mumbai’s Malad. Mansoor zeroed on the location of the phone and asked his mother’s friends, Archana Bhosale and Madhavi Bhosale, who live in Malad to locate the taxi. But by the time they reached the spot, the taxi had moved from Malad to Goregaon.Archana spotted the cab parked near Oberoi Mall and it matched with the description that Muskan had given, said Nasir Shaikh. But the driver had by then left the cab after parking it, he added. Mansoor then remotely locked the phone and sent a message which reflected on the screen of the phone saying: “I am a policeman and this is my daughter’s mobile phone.” Nasir said he did this to scare the cab driver, and also to prevent personal photos or videos from being misused. “And also to ensure if some other person finds it, he or she may return it to the actual owner,” said Nasir Shaikh.The next day Nasir Shaikh went to Goregaon with his niece and recovered the lost phone.“The cab driver, who was in his 60s, told us that he had planned to hand over the phone to a taxi union’s office in Mumbai Central. He did not even know how to use a smartphone. The driver was not lying so we did not make any complaint and allowed to go him,” Nasir Shaikh said.Mansoor had come across the hidden mobile tracking system of his phone while exploring its applications. “I then thoroughly read about it on the internet and learnt how to use it. The system is generally hidden in the phone and people are not aware of it. It uses the IMEI number of the device, a phone user’s email ID and password,” he said. “The system tracks the email and the device through IMEI and GPS. The system can be enabled by putting a phone’s details in it and once enabled the system gives control to the owner to active ringtone mode from vibration mode, lock the phone’s screen remotely and post an emergency message on the mobile’s screen.”Mansoor said stories of people like slain Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Ashok Kamte, who was killed in 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, inspire him. “I heard his stories from my parents and read about him on the internet. I want to become an IPS officer like him.”Mansoor has also demonstrated his mobile tracking skills to Mumbai cyber police department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-year-old-mumbai-boy-tracks-missing-mobile-phones/story-HK9BbZFxQ06Mg3CUimvizN.html

Both followed a special routine and training and exercise schedule but Raja has already left a mark and helped the police solve two cases in a short time. Also read: Don’t allow processions in public, says YogiOn August 23, one Jitendra was killed by his brother, Chhotu, who later committed suicide by jumping before a train. But police were unable to trace Chhotu’s body. When Raja was taken to the crime scene, he sniffed Chhotu’s slipper and then straight away ran towards the tracks where Chhotu’s body was lying.Earlier on June 2, one Irfan and his wife, Husna, were killed and their bodies were buried by their kin. Raja was called to Irfan’s residence in the Mehandauri area, where he sniffed some blood spots and reached the house of Irfan’s brother Rizwan. The dog pulled out a blood-stained shirt of Rizwan’s son, Shiraz. Police detained Shiraz, who confessed to his involvement in the murders.Police dog squad in-charge Santosh Kumar said of the two tracking dogs, Raja is exceptional. “Both follow a special routine which includes training sessions and exercise. Their diet includes milk, eggs, and meat.”Kumar said they were impressed with Raja’s extraordinary ability to sniff clues and leading them to the suspects.Tracking dogs have heightened olfactory ability to detect, recognise, and follow specific scents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/boss-raja-the-new-star-of-prayagraj-police/story-LcFplIZrzSy2FJLYwVIYaO.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi couple arrested, foster son apprehended for conning pedestrians||The Delhi Police on Tuesday arrested a couple and apprehended their 13-year-old foster son for allegedly conning pedestrians, mostly elderly women, and tricking them into exchanging their ornaments with bundles of fake currency notes.The trio was wanted in three cases of cheating that were registered at the Rajouri Garden police station in west Delhi between March 11 and August 9. The arrested couple has been identified as Raju alias Mango (28) and his wife Poonam (24). Raju has been involved in 19 crimes, mostly cheating and robbery, the police said.The police explained the trio’s modus operandi. Each member of the family was assigned a specific task to execute the crime. Initially, they would identify a potential target, which in 90% of the cases were elderly women, and kept a tab on their daily routine, the police said. Then, the couple would send their foster son to strike up a conversation with their potential target. The child would show a bundle of currency notes wrapped in a newspaper and tied with a thread and tell the person that he had stolen the money from his employer’s home, the official said.“The child would trick the person into believing his cock-and-bull story. He would make an offer to exchange the currency notes against some other items. Soon, Poonam would arrive at the spot and join the conversation pretending to be a stranger and showing her eagerness to finalise the deal with the child. She would estimate that the value of the bundle of the currency notes to be almost double the worth of the jewellery that the person is wearing,” said the official.Later, Poonam would plead helplessness citing that she did not have ornaments of that worth and would convince the potential target not to miss out on the lucrative exchange offer.Typically, Raju would make his presence felt and trick the potential target to cut a deal. The target would figure out that s/he was conned only after opening the bundle of currency notes. White papers were put between a couple of currency notes on both sides, the police said.According to an investigating officer (IO), who spoke on condition of anonymity, multiple teams of Delhi Police were working on the three cases. An analysis of the footage of 70 closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras related to the crime scenes showed that the suspects in all the cases were the same, he said.“We activated our network of informers and one of them helped us identify the suspects. On Monday, we caught the trio, while they were busy swindling another person at Khyala,” the IO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-couple-arrested-foster-son-apprehended-for-conning-pedestrians/story-X8mZoOaO7j5v2umpSZhtHJ.html

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Monsoon session of Haryana assembly lasts barely three hours in shadow of Covid-19||Chandigarh:The monsoon session of the Haryana assembly lasted barely three hours on Wednesday afternoon before the House was adjourned sine die. Marred by walkouts by opposition members, the curtailed session, which began at 2pm, was held in the absence of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is the leader of the House, and Speaker Gian Chand Gupta as both of them are undergoing treatment for Covid-19.The session was originally scheduled to have two sittings, one each on Wednesday and Thursday, but the duration was cut to a few hours after the business advisory committee (BAC) of the assembly met in the morning.Deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa presided over the session that began with the leader of opposition and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda from the Congress and state home minister Anil Vij reading out the obituary references. Hooda and Vij were part of the business advisory committee besides deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala from the Jannayak Janata Party and parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal of the BJP.Soon after Gangwa apprised the House of the business advisory committee’s decision to only table the replies of questions and the calling attention motion instead of verbal replies, Congress MLAs Kuldeep Vats and BB Batra opposed the move.Vij asked the Congress MLAs to respect the decision of the committee in which the Congress Legislature Party leader represented them. Hooda reiterated that only important bills and supplementary estimates should be laid in the House and the remaining business, including adjournment and calling attention motions, should be kept pending for the next sitting of the assembly whenever it is convened.Question hour was waived with no discussion on the calling attention motions. Only written replies got tabled for listed questions.Congress MLA Geeta Bhukkal interrupted the proceedings, demanding that higher education examinations should be put off in public interest, a point Hooda backed, saying the issue raised by her was valid.Kanwar Pal, who is also the state education minister, said that the Khattar-led BJP government will make appropriate arrangements to ensure exams are held smoothly. “We don’t want these students to get labelled as corona degree holders,” the minister said.He went on to take a dig at Hooda, saying Congress MLAs were interrupting and not adhering to the business advisory committee’s decision of which the CLP leader is a part. “You are not speaking against the government but against your own leader,” he told the Congress leaders.Earlier Hooda interacted with Khattar, who is hospitalised in Gurgaon for treatment of coronavirus infection, and assured him of a truncated session amid the Covid-19 pandemic.LONE INLD LEADER’S OBJECTIONIndian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Chautala was not impressed. He said that he was not satisfied with the written statement tabled by the government in the two calling attention motions submitted by him.He said that the government did not invite him or any independent legislator for the business advisory committee meeting. “Are you the only ones running the assembly? What about lone MLAs like me?” he said.“No one is dying of coronavirus here. Why can’t we have a discussion on corruption issues? Why did you call us from so far when all you wanted was a shortened session?” said Chautala, who had requested of a calling attention motion on the issue of registries.Congress MLA Neeraj Sharma opposed the move to shut down shops on weekends to check the spread of coronavirus. LAND REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL TABLED The bill to undo a 2017 amendment in the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act was tabled in the House. The amendment has watered down Section 7-A of the Act. The stipulations in Section 7-A pertain to grant of a no objection certificate (NoC) by the town and country planning department before registration of land in notified urban areas.The amendment bill was tabled in view of large-scale violations in the registration of sale deeds of properties without obtaining NoCs in notified urban areas in Gurugram district.Narnaund MLA Ram Kumar Gautam said that there should be no ban on the registration of sale deeds.Rohtak MLA BB Batra said that new stipulations brought by this amendment pertaining to Section 7-A of the Act needed a relook. “ Please review the definition of vacant land under Section 7-A,” Hooda said, supporting Batra.Some Congress MLAs walked out over the tabling the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (amendment) Bill. The Haryana appropriation bill was the final legislative business of the day tabled in the House by the parliamentary affairs minister after which the assembly was adjourned sine die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-session-of-haryana-assembly-begins-today-likely-to-be-one-day-affair/story-0gdEBWahevYoLAY64FnG2N.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal calls for Covid-19 assessment meeting||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called for a meeting on Wednesday morning because of a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital, a government official said.“The CM has called for an assessment meeting at 11 am because of a surge in Covid-19 cases. The meeting will be attended by the health minister (Satyendar Jain), chief secretary (Vijay Dev) and all the senior officials of the state health department,” said the official.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 1,544 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in the viral outbreak in the national capital in 40 days, according to official data. The spike in daily Covid-19 cases is a worrying statistic, as the state government is pressing for the resumption of the Metro Rail services in the national capital that have been suspended since end-March. Experts have warned the Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government against complacency, which, they said, could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-calls-for-covid-19-assessment-meeting/story-vkCG3KtX2KaHtKk9wQhevM.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Amid Covid-19 outbreak in Mumbai, a dip in swine flu cases this year compared to 2019||Amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak in Mumbai, the first cases of which were reported over five months ago, the number of fresh cases of H1N1 swine flu virus has gone down in the first eight months of 2020 compared to 2019. Mumbai has reported 42 cases of swine flu between January to August 2020 compared to 432 cases during the same period in 2019, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data.According to BMC officials, several factors contributed to the fall in the number of cases, of which one is the infection pattern, and another is extra hygiene precautions citizens are taking owing to the spread of Covid-19. In 2019, Mumbai recorded a total of 451 swine flu cases and five deaths. In comparison to this, 42 cases have been reported until August 25, 2020 with zero deaths, according to BMC.Until February 2020, Mumbai saw 21 cases of swine flu, and the remaining 21 cases of swine flu were reported from March 1 to August 25, 2020, amid the Covid-19 outbreak. However, BMC has said the data from the last five years indicates a pattern—cases increase one year and decrease the next.For example, in 2015 over 3,000 cases of swine flu were reported, followed by three in 2016, 995 in 2017, 25 in 2018 and 451 in 2019. In terms of deaths due to swine flu, in July and August 2020, Mumbai recorded zero cases of swine flu compared to 159 cases and two deaths being reported during the same period in 2019.Dr Mangala Gomare, the executive health officer of BMC, said, “There have not been many swine flu cases this year, and in July and August till now there has not been a single case. There are a lot of reasons for low cases of swine flu, but what is different is that this year people are not moving like earlier, which could be a reason for a dip.”Dr Gomare added, “Also, the main reason could be citizens taking respiratory precautions. Further, hand and general hygiene are better.”The first few cases of swine flu appeared in India in 2009; it was declared a pandemic at that time by the World Health Organization (WHO). Swine flu is caused by the H1N1 virus, and is a strain of an influenza virus that generally originates in pigs, but spreads primarily from person to person.The primary symptoms of swine flu include fever, lethargy, headache, cough, sore throat and nausea. While most people recover within a week, people with low immunity and chronic diseases can face severe symptoms. However, in case of swine flu, unlike Covid-19, a vaccine is available and lakhs of citizens countrywide have been given the vaccine.On the decline of swine flu cases, Dr Om Srivastava, infectious diseases expert and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said, “This is the nature of the virus. We cannot predict the exact reason, but the annual peak for swine flu starts from mid-August, so we still need to wait and see before reading much into this. However, cases going down in general is a good thing.”Meanwhile, Mumbai reported 587 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday and 35 new deaths, taking the total to 1,37,683 cases and 7,477 deaths. Till now 1,11,962 patients have recovered in the city and the mortality rate of Mumbai stands at 5.43%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-covid-19-outbreak-in-mumbai-a-dip-in-swine-flu-cases-this-year-compared-to-2019/story-TWyKRQhxORslWeUEdNL8VJ.html

26-08-2020||Delhi||Menstrual hygiene: PM’s speech motivates social workers to debunk myths better||When the words ‘menstrual hygiene’ were recently heard from the Red Fort as part of Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech, it was surely a first. And this has given a new shot of energy to the social workers who had been working for the cause of menstrual hygiene for years, as they notice a visible change coming through in people’s mindset.  Our @PMOIndia talking about sanitary pads in his Independence Day speech today is true progress...made menstruation a mainstream topic. Also kudos to the government who has so far distributed sanitary pads to about 5 crore women at Re. 1 👏“When PM addressed the issue to the nation from the bigger podium, it certainly gave an impetus to the cause, and has started helping us in destigmatising period talk,” says Anchal Sharma, founder of an NGO Meals of Happiness sharing how this move is aiding the NGOs who have been working in this regard. She adds, “PM Modi is the only PM who spoke about menstrual hygiene on such an important day. It shows that the health of half of the population (the female population) of India is officially a national issue! And menstrual health is not a topic to be shoved inside black polythene. Now, it has definitely started normalising menstrual health discussions... When someone like him talks about it, it infuses renewed life and energy in people like me, who have been trying to normalise people about it. Ab ghar-ghar discuss hoga, dabi awaz mei nahi, khulke!”Sharma, who has been serving meals to the underprivileged in Delhi-NCR, and has also taken up the cause of menstrual hygiene, adds, “In the present time (of pandemic), it’s difficult for many to even get two square meals a day; buying sanitary pads has become an unthinkable luxury. So, we decided to help women have menstrual hygiene by offering them free sanitary pads. PM’s motivational speech has pumped us to do more since only 36% women have access to sanitary pads, and millions are still forced to use husk or dirty clothes. And it’s proven that poor menstrual hygiene can lead to fatal infections, urinalysis tract infection and even cervical cancer.” Delhi-based Anurag Chauhan who has been trying to spread awareness about periods through Break The Bloody Taboo campaign, says, “I want to thank PM for striking up a conversation on this topic, which is till date many a times not even discussed inside with family in a living room... Once I was in Chomu village of Rajasthan, to address a female gathering about this subject. And one of the ladies, must be in her 60s asked me if I also menstruate! Initially, I thought she’s making fun of me, but soon I realised that she was serious, and was shocked to hear her say, ‘Kya pata jaise main chupati hun, vo bhi chupate ho’. Imagine the level of unawareness on this topic in women like her who are married and have kids... So when a man, and that too the PM of this country talks about periods on I-Day, it not just boosts our morale but also helps us spread more awareness.” Chauhan runs an NGO, Humans for Humanity and the campaign is one his projects. A similar sentiment is echoed by a social worker Lalitha Yadav, who provides basic hygiene utilities to sex workers and underprivileged in GB Road and Najafgarh, as part of a Delhi-based NGO, Society for Participatory Integrated Development (SPID). “When a prominent figure like the PM addresses the nation on subject like periods, it does create an impact! There are a lot of stigmas attached with it, especially among the males. Now, whenever we will address the issue among our audience, we happily take reference of Modiji’s speech and this helps us take the conversation ahead,” she says sharing how just a mention has set the ball rolling.

26-08-2020||City||Son-in-law held for Navi Mumbai woman’s murder||A day after the body of a 45-year-old woman, with her throat slit, was found at her home in Navi Mumbai, the Taloja police on Tuesday arrested her 28-year-old son-in-law for the murder. The accused committed the crime because he was upset over the fact that his pregnant wife visited her mother regularly, said the police. The victim, Rekha Sharma, was found dead at her second-floor Taloja apartment in sector 11. The accused, Praful Siyali, works as an electrical technician married Sharma’s younger daughter two years ago and the couple stayed at Taloja phase-2 and was expecting their first child. Based on preliminary investigation, police said Siyali arrived at Sharma’s house shortly after her husband left for work in the morning. He wore a raincoat and covered his face to prevent getting captured in the building’s CCTV cameras. When the police went through the CCTV footage of the people who visited the building around the time of the murder, they were surprised to find a person wearing a raincoat as it was not raining at the time. After initial rounds of inquiry with the family members, and rummaging through the call detail records, the police suspected Siyali’s role in the murder. Once the police confirmed that Siyali was the main wearing the raincoat, the police arrested him. “Along with technical analysis and CCTV footage, we zeroed down the accused and arrested him on Tuesday. We are investigating the case further to put together the sequence of events and to recover the murder weapon,” said senior inspector Kashinath Chavan from Taloja police station. On Monday, Siyali’s wife tried calling Sharma on phone after 10am, but after she did not answer the calls, the couple went to the victim’s house. “Sharma used to often insult Siyali. His wife had been regularly visiting Sharma in the since a while and it irked the accused. He asked his wife not to visit her mother’s house but when she did not agree to it, he decided to kill Sharma,” said inspector Raju Adagle from Taloja police station. Siyali’s wife also used to spend Sundays at her mother’s house, which further angered him, said police officers. Siyali has been booked for murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He will be produced before a magistrate court on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/son-in-law-held-for-navi-mumbai-woman-s-murder/story-WfyJkaM7XNuT8bW2DwkChO.html

26-08-2020||City||‘Staged’ abduction case: Newlywed woman testifies against kidnappers in court||A day after being allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint by car-borne miscreants in Kalanaur here, police produced the newlywed woman before a court here on Tuesday.Though the police had earlier said that the woman concocted her own abduction with the help of her lover and his friends, she testified against her kidnappers.Rohtak police spokesperson Sunny Lora said, “We have conducted her medical examination and a report is awaited. The woman is in the police custody and her abductors are still at large. We have recovered the Safari car which was snatched by the accused at gunpoint when the couple was travelling to Bhiwani just two hours post-wedding.”Meham DSP Shamsher Singh Dahiya and Kalanaur SHO Sohan Lal, who are investigating the case, did not respond to calls and text messages.A senior police officer requesting anonymity said the woman while recording her statement said one of the abductors used to stalk her on her way to school, while the main accused had also tried to misbehave with her. She said a village panchayat was also held in this regard where the accused’s parents had assured that their son would not repeat the misacts.“We are investigating whether the bride is 18 years old or not,” the officer added.The woman comes from a poor Dalit family, while the miscreants belong to the upper caste.However, her parents alleged that they had given a police complaint against the main accused a few months back after he tried to misbehave with their daughter. “The police did not take any action so later a compromise was struck in the village panchayat. Had the police acted in time, it wouldn’t have come to this,” they added.Meanwhile, the groom’s family is waiting for the outcome of the investigation. “If she was in fact abducted, we will accept her. Else, it would be difficult for us to take her in. We are tensed right now and waiting for police action,” a relative of the groom said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/staged-abduction-case-newlywed-woman-testifies-against-kidnappers-in-court/story-ga9FYBwOvYApf1QIKxFINL.html

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana monsoon session begins under Covid shadow today, may be cut short||The Haryana Vidhan Sabha session that begins on Wednesday could be wrapped up in a single sitting due to the lurking threat of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa indicated on Tuesday. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta, transport minister Mool Chand Sharma, Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia and four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators — Aseem Goyal (Ambala City), Laxman Napa (Ratia), Harvinder Kalyan (Gharaunda) and Ram Kumar Kashyap (Indri) — have tested positive for coronavirus ahead of the session scheduled for 2pm on August 26. Khattar is undergoing treatment at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram. The monsoon session is being convened to meet the constitutional requirement of holding a session within six months of the previous session and to introduce some bills. “Due to the pandemic, some MLAs have also suggested to limit the house proceedings to one day. Due to the prevailing circumstances, the MLAs are reluctant to stay back overnight here,” said Gangwa, who will preside over the assembly proceedings in speaker Gupta’s absence. The final decision about the duration of the session, Gangwa said, will be taken by the business advisory committee (BAC) that will meet before the session on Wednesday. According to deputy speaker, Covid-19 test reports of all other MLAs, who will attend the session, was negative. In the 90-member house, one seat is vacant. The monsoon session will begin under strict social distancing protocols. The house has been sanitised twice and the MLAs will be seated in the audience gallery and the speaker’s gallery, maintaining physical distance. While only one MLA will sit on a bench as against two earlier, the speaker’s as well as visitors’ galleries have been converted into a sitting place for the legislators. Visitors will not be allowed to watch the assembly proceedings this time. The house was first sanitised on Saturday and the exercise was repeated on Tuesday evening. The deputy speaker said 365 employees and officers of the Vidhan Sabha had undergone Covid test, six of whom tested positive. Gangwa said 187 questions were received from MLAs, besides 30 calling attention motions, one private bill and four adjournment motions that were under considerations. He said among the 10 bills likely to be introduced in the house was a bill to reserve 50% seats for women in panchayati raj institutions. Hooda interacts with KhattarLeader of the opposition in Haryana assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who had an interaction with Khattar, said he could consider the plea for a shortened session in view of the Covid-19 situation. “However, it all depends on the quantum of legislative business. The number of adjournment motions, calling attention motions and bills tabled will be a factor in deciding the duration of the session,” Hooda said. The Congress has submitted four adjournment motions and 10 calling attention motions. Deputy speaker Gangwa said 40 starred questions have been taken up for the question hour. However, all starred questions have been converted into unstarred questions. A reply to an unstarred question is merely tabled in the house, not expressed verbally.Two calling attention motions raised by INLD MLA Abhay Singh Chautala on the issue of registries and infant mortality rate have been accepted and others are under consideration. Hooda, meanwhile, said the adjournment motion will be brought by the Congress to discuss three new farm ordinances. Another adjournment motion will also be brought to demand a discussion on the registry and the liquor scam. “We will also bring an adjournment motion in the House to discuss the issue of sacked physical training instructors,” he said. Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT Neeraj Sharma said he has also submitted two calling attention motions regarding the retrenchment of employees by an earth moving equipment company and on the fresh weekend restrictions imposed by the state government entailing closure of shops. Private sector job quota, ‘right to recall’ bills to be tabled in assembly: DushyantChandigarh Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Tuesday said theirs will be the first state where villagers will have the power to recall panchayat members for not doing their duties.He said a bill in this regard will be tabled in the assembly on Wednesday. He said a bill to reserve 50% seats for women in panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) will also be tabled in the assembly.Dushyant said he will also table a bill to give 75% reservation to local candidates in private sector jobs in the house. An ordinance in this regard approved by the cabinet has been reserved by the governor for the consideration of the president. The bill will also be sent to the President.Citing an example, he said many a time a sarpanch is accused of misusing his post and people want him removed. “In this scenario, the right to recall law will give power to people to remove him,” he added.Dushyant said the bill to reserve 50% posts for women in PRIs will open new doors for the women of rural areas in politics. Similarly, a bill to provide 8% reservation to BC -A in PRIs will be presented in the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-monsoon-session-begins-under-covid-shadow-today-may-be-cut-short/story-AanElkW3NfQ80MfIBLcNyH.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Gandhi family is Congress’s Aadhar card; Rahul can lead his party: Sanjay Raut||A day after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) met in the shadow of a letter written by 23 senior figures questioning the current situation pertaining to the party leadership, Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut backed Rahul Gandhi’s leadership abilities and said that Gandhi family is the “Aadhar card” of the Congress party”. Raut also said that no one outside the Gandhi family can lead the party. “The Gandhi family is the Aadhaar card of the Congress party. Be it Soniaji [Gandhi], Priyanka Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. The demand for a non-Gandhi leading a party is not appropriate. As of today, I don’t see a leader outside the family who can lead the party,” said Raut, while speaking to media persons on Tuesday. The Rajya Sabha member also said that the Congress continues to be the principal opposition in the country and has workers in almost every village of the country. Raut further stated that the party should end their internal differences and rise as an opposition.The Sena leader praised Rahul Gandhi for his leadership role as the party president in the past. “Rahul Gandhi led the party well in the past. The Congress won the Assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh under his leadership. After the defeat in Lok Sabha [polls], he walked away from the post of the Congress president… But even today, Rahul Gandhi has the ability to lead the Congress,” said the Sena MP.Meanwhile, responding to Maharashtra minister and Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar’s comments stating that if Rahul Gandhi takes over the reins of the party and directs the state Congress to leave the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, the party would do so, Raut said, “Well, Rahul Gandhi has no such wish; Wadettiwar thinks so. We have good interactions with Rahul Gandhi. The Congress ministers know the reason behind having a coalition government in Maharashtra. And Rahul Gandhi is also of the opinion that this government should run effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gandhi-family-is-congress-s-aadhar-card-rahul-can-lead-his-party-sanjay-raut/story-aJcqnsBIIrrFB7HTItAxjN.html

The circular said directed minority junior colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan region, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Amaravati and Nagpur zones to adhere to this rule, first introduced in 2014 by the department of minority affairs. While the rule has been in place in degree colleges, it is being implemented in junior colleges only now, said an official from the education department. As per this rule, if any seats reserved for religious minority students are vacant after the third and the final round of admissions, they should be allotted to students belonging to any other religious minorities on merit. If the college is still unable to fill the minority seats, they need to be allotted to students belonging to linguistic minorities. The same process needs to be followed for linguistic minority seats. Such colleges need not reserve seats for backward classes Minority junior colleges can reserve up to 50% of their seats for a religious or linguistic minority. For instance, HR and Jai Hind Colleges are Sindhi linguistic minority colleges. If seats reserved for the Sindhi-speaking community remain unfilled, they will be allotted to students from another linguistic minority such as Tamil or Gujarati. If seats still remain vacant after that, those will be allotted to a religious minority candidate. In Mumbai, there are 3.2 lakh total seats, of which 86,905 are reserved under minority quota, 2,071 under in-house quota and 16,037 under management quota. The zero round for quota admissions was held up to August 22 and so far only 9,811 minority quota seats have been filled. A total of 7,027 candidates have been admitted to in-house quota and 751 in management quota. Quota admissions are currently underway and will end on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-vacant-minority-quota-seats-to-other-minorities-before-surrendering-them-first-year-junior-colleges-in-maharashtra-told/story-SHJg9dgrWRK7YesD2ogJ4I.html

26-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai got highest August rain since 1983, says IMD||With 1,044 mm rain between August 1 and August 25, the city has received its highest August rainfall this year since 1983 and recorded the second-highest monthly rain since 1959, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Tuesday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 1,044 mm rain so far in August, crossing the August 2010 rain record of 1036.5mm. In August 1983, Mumbai had recorded 1,243.8mm while the all-time highest August rain of 1,254mm was recorded in 1958. The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, has recorded its highest August rain since 1991, with 934.1mm. During August 1990, it had recorded 1,041.2mm rain in the entire month, while the all-time high was recorded in August 1983 (1,187.6mm). Between 8.30am on Monday and 8.30am on Tuesday, the suburbs recorded 13.4 mm rain while 1.8mm rain was recorded in south Mumbai. So far, the excess rain has been 64% and 63% for Mumbai suburbs and south Mumbai respectively. Maharashtra has recorded 17% excess rain this monsoon. Mumbai is 57.6 mm short of the 3,000mm mark this season, with 2,942.4 mm rain between June 1 and August 25. The monsoon is expected to continue into September. “After no low pressure weather system formed over Bay of Bengal in July, five well-marked systems were witnessed in August. Combined with this, recurring occurrence of a mid-tropospheric circulation over south Gujarat and north Konkan coast simultaneously led to active monsoon conditions for Mumbai,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD. The city surpassed 50% of its August average of rain (585.2mm) in the first four days of the month, with 293mm rain. The bulk of this (271mm) was recorded over 28 hours between August 3 and August 4. The monthly mean rain mark was crossed on August 9. In July, Mumbai witnessed its highest monthly rain (1,502.7 mm) since 1944, when IMD began collating readings. However, June saw the lowest monthly rain in five years after monsoon onset was declared on June 14. The city recorded 395mm rain, against the monthly average of 493.1mm. “The monsoon trough was active over central and north India for most of August, resulting in good rain for the west coast and interior Maharashtra. This helped bring all the lakes to optimum levels,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B). He said Mumbai may witness a few heavy spells in September. “The break phase with subdued rain for the last six days in August is needed. By the first week of September, active rain will be back for Mumbai, owing to weak La Nina [cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, which is opposite to El Niño] likely to emerge during September. This will result in slightly above-normal rain,” said Balasubramanian. IMD has predicted occasional spells of light to moderate rain till the end of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-got-highest-august-rain-since-1983-says-imd/story-eD0URmpkv5UCnDhaaBBwBK.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||PMC Bank fraud: Bombay HC directs jail authorities to get Rakesh Wadhawan admitted to KEM Hospital in 48 hours||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused the request to transfer Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) promoter Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan to a private hospital. Instead, the superintendent of Arthur Road Jail has been directed to send Wadhawan to KEM Hospital within 48 hours. Wadhawan is an accused in the case of fraud at Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank and suffering from cancer. Last week, a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) had directed jail authorities to transfer Wadhawan to a civic-run hospital after Wadhawan submitted a plea to be admitted to a private medical facility to undergo a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Wadhawan then moved HC with his plea. A division bench of justices RD Dhanuka and VG Bisht said on Tuesday that Wadhawan should be taken to KEM Hospital for tests and treatment within 48 hours. The bench has directed the civic-run hospital to carry out the necessary medical tests within a week. Wadhawan’s counsel, senior advocate Amit Desai, said Wadhawan’s health is deteriorating and as a patient of colon cancer, he has been in and out of hospital for the past six months. Desai urged the court to allow Wadhawan be admitted to a private hospital as KEM Hospital has not been able to conduct an endoscopy and colonoscopy on him so far, despite court orders. HC, however, refused to accede to the request. The same bench also gave the Enforcement Directorate (ED) three days to provide a copy to Wadhawan of its complaint and other documents against him and the other accused in the case filed by the ED. Wadhawan is among the accused in the case of fraud at PMC Bank, registered by Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) on September 30, 2019. An audit conducted by the Reserve Bank of India uncovered 44 loan accounts at PMC Bank that were used to carry out a fraud of Rs. 7,457.49 crore, most of which went to HDIL.

26-08-2020||Mumbai||All legislators to take RT-PCR tests ahead of monsoon session||Amid the Covid pandemic, the Maharashtra government has decided to conduct RT-PCR tests of all legislators for the monsoon session, starting September 7. Only those with a negative report will be allowed to attend the session, which will be conducted following social distancing norms. In a first, legislators will also be seen sitting in galleries reserved for visitors and students. After being deferred twice, the business advisory committee (BAC) of the state legislature approved a session of two days, from the usual two-three weeks. Legislators can attend the proceedings, but amid several restrictions, officials said. The first condition is to get the RT-PCR test done on September 6. “We have decided to follow all social distancing norms while holding the proceedings. Seating arrangement of the legislators is going to be changed and some will be made to sit in galleries reserved for students and visitors,” said an official from the state legislature. All of them will be provided a kit with a face shield, mask, hand gloves, sanitiser, etc. Further, their personal secretaries will not be allowed to enter the legislature building. Separate arrangements will be made on the premises for their secretaries and drivers. However, one secretary from the staff of each minister will be allowed to enter the building, the official said. Legislators having co-morbidities will be asked to decide whether they want to attend the proceedings or not. Group leaders have been asked to speak with these legislators, he added. “Earlier, there were plans to conduct online session. The session is now only for two days, so it makes no sense to hold a hybrid session,” said another official. A hybrid session allows legislators to attend the proceedings through video-conferencing, even using their smartphones. Supplementary demands and seven bills will be tabled during the session apart from appropriation bill and unstarred questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/all-legislators-to-take-rt-pcr-tests-ahead-of-monsoon-session/story-O3u82c8lEQ0L5e3i0P0olI.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||HC allows first wife and daughter of cop who died of Covid, to file compensation claim||After the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday was informed by the first wife and daughter of a Maharashtra railway police force police personnel, who succumbed to Covid-19 in May, that they were not aware of his second family and required time to counter the family’s claims to the compensation due to him, the court granted the first wife and her daughter two days and asked them to bring a lawyer. The court also indicated that as per past judgments, the legacy of a policeman could be shared by three people including the first wife and daughter, and the daughter from the second wife. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition of a 21-year-old woman, the policeman’s second daughter, seeking equal and proportionate distribution of the compensation and dues accruing in the name of her deceased father, was informed by advocate Prerak Sharma that as per court orders the first wife and daughter were appearing in person. The policeman’s daughter from his first wife said he used to reside with her and her mother continuously and also made a statement on record that neither she nor her mother knew of the existence of the second wife and daughter. Though Sharma informed the court that the second wife’s daughter had posted information about herself and had referred to the policemen as her father on the Facebook page of his first daughter, the latter refuted the claim. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the first wife and daughter to file their counter claims through an affidavit in reply to the petition within two days and also directed them to hire a lawyer to represent them. The bench also directed the state government to deposit the compensation amount with the court within a week and posted the hearing on Thursday. On the request of additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan, the court allowed the authorities to withhold the gratuity amount accruing in the name of the deceased policeman and not deposit it in court. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Pradeep Chavan of west zone said that the compensation amount from the police welfare fund and other outstanding dues of the deceased policeman would be deposited in the court within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-first-wife-and-daughter-of-cop-who-died-of-covid-to-file-compensation-claim/story-6Hny2wh6EVcJQOmkX4WboN.html
26-08-2020||City||101,715 patients recovered in Thane district so far||More than 1 lakh Covid-19 patients have now recovered in Thane district, taking the recovery rate of the district to 81.85%. The number of cases in rural and urban areas has seen a decline since the start of this month. As on Tuesday, 101,715 patients had recovered, according to data released by the state government. Thane district has reported 124,261 cases of Covid-19 so far, of which 1.01 lakh patients have recovered. At present, there are 18,921 active cases in the district. The daily case count in the district in July was 1,000 to 1,500; this figure has decreased to 700 to 800 cases in August. On Tuesday, 762 new cases were reported from Thane district.Rajesh Narvekar, Thane district collector, claimed that early detection and the new discharge policy are the reason for the increase in recoveries. “We have managed to decrease cases in some of the cities like Thane, Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar across the district, while the situation in other areas is also improving. This has been possible due to early detection of cases through extensive tracking, early identification, isolation at fever clinics and increase in testing,” said Narvekar. Early this month, Thane started a district-level patient management system, to manage the surplus hospital beds available and ensure no patients are left without beds. “Earlier, most patients who tested positive in private labs used to get admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital on their own. Those patients who required these beds were devoid of them, leading to delay in treatment. Now, we assess the condition of each patient and only then allot them beds in the hospital,” added Narvekar. This, he said has improved the recovery rate as critical patients receive prompt treatment. While cases have reduced in cities like Thane, Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar, Kalyan- Dombivli and Navi Mumbai are still a cause for concern as daily cases in these cities are still between 250 and 450. “We did not have city-based laboratories in these two cities earlier, which led to delays in getting test results. The results were submitted after two to three days, by which time the infected persons would have infected several more. We now have testing labs in these cities, and we have increased the daily testing capacity. Results are delivered in a day, leading to quick isolation. We are confident that cases here will decrease too,” Narvekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/101-715-patients-recovered-in-thane-district-so-far/story-T4F14TK2WERkI1gVSsZR8M.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Sero-survey: BMC starts second round in Mumbai’s 3 wards||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday began the second phase of sero-survey in the city, as part of which blood samples of 5,840 individuals from slums and non-slum areas from three civic wards will be collected. The study will mostly be concluded by the end of this week. The civic body, along with NITI-Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), conducted the first serological survey in July among 6,936 people living in the same three wards—M-West (Tilaknagar and Chembur), F-North (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R-North (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar). Of the 4,234 individuals randomly surveyed in slums, 56.5% had Covid-19 antibodies. In non-slum or residential areas, of the 2,702 examined, only 419 came positive, showing 15.5% prevalence of antibodies. BMC needs to conduct the second study in the same wards within a month to gauge the spread of the virus among the population. Under the sero-survey, a group of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies. IgG antibodies are produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a virus. A sero-survey helps identify individuals who were previously infected with the virus and silently recovered. Dr Sandeep Juneja, one of the researchers from TIFR who was part of the study, said, “Many people who have contracted the infection are asymptomatic, so through this survey, we can understand to what extent the virus has spread in Mumbai. We need two sets of data to make the comparison. With the conclusion of the second survey, we can compare the data of the first study with the latter one. This will help us know if the spread of the virus has been controlled or flattened.” The second study will cover 3,700 individuals in slums and 2,140 in non-slum areas. Till Tuesday afternoon, the volunteers have met 68% of their target by collecting samples from 3,976 individuals living in slums and non-slum areas. As HT reported earlier, in the first survey, only 20% of people residing in non-slum areas cooperated with the volunteers. “For over 10 days, we sensitised people in different societies and buildings in the same three wards, so they cooperate with us. We have taken contacts of people who are keen on participating in the survey, which is helping us collect samples quicker without much resistance,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “If things go as planned, we will conclude the survey by this weekend,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sero-survey-bmc-starts-second-round-in-mumbai-s-3-wards/story-YeRh0YvevHLjAa0ETqQoRJ.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Ajit must respond to Congress legislators’ claims over funds: Sena||In a move to corner Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar on the issue of unequal distribution of development funds, the Shiv Sena, in an editorial in Saamana, said the state finance minister must respond to the allegations of Congress legislators. In the past, Shiv Sena legislators have voiced their disappointment to chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray over unavailability of funds for their constituencies. They have alleged that NCP legislators get priority over legislators from the two other parties. Speaking to the media, Sena MP and Saamana editor Sanjay Raut told reporters that although Pawar is the finance minister, the three parties within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi can sit together to resolve the issue. Raut said that earlier Thorat and senior Congress minister Ashok Chavan have spoken to the chief minister about the distribution of funds. “Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat called me and said that Congress MLAs are unhappy with unequal distribution of funds. He said it is important that funds are distributed equally as this is a three-party government. I think the stand he has taken is appropriate. At the end of the day, when a legislator develops his constituency, it leads to the development of the state…,” Raut told reporters. In an editorial in Saamana, the party had said, “Congress leaders say that the NCP gets more importance in the government and that the NCP has taken more of the development funds. What do we say on this? Finance minister Ajit Pawar alone can respond to these allegations.” Meanwhile, Congress’s Jalna MLA Kailash Gorantyal threatened to go on a hunger strike over constituency development funds. He has claimed that he has the support of 10 other Congress legislators, who he has not named. However, Pawar reportedly spoke to Gorantyal on Tuesday and the legislator has decided to call off his protest. The Sena also took a dim view of the 11 Congress legislators from Maharashtra protesting against the government and said that it is akin to raising questions against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, who supported to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ajit-must-respond-to-congress-legislators-claims-over-funds-sena/story-GdXMDZqUhgJTua0O8w8T9J.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records only 587 cases; BMC says tech issue||The city has reported 587 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, its lowest daily figure in the past 105 days since May 12, when Mumbai’s daily count was 426. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) clarified in its daily evening media bulletin on Tuesday, that the low number of cases is due to a “technical issue” on the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) website. “Complete case data is not available today, it will be uploaded tomorrow,” the bulletin mentioned.“[The numbers are] based on information received from various hospitals and data uploaded on the ICMR portal by certified labs/Covid portal of GOI (Government of India) by district,” said the civic body, adding that the data is subject to change after scrutiny and an ongoing verification process.

The case fatality rate in Mumbai is 5.4% and the recovery rate is 81%.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “We should wait and watch before coming to any inference. We cannot be complacent and should never lower our guard.” On August 24, Mumbai conducted 5,960 Covid-19 tests, lower than the average daily of 8,000-9,000.“We are conducting 8,000 to 9,000 tests every day. BMC is trying hard to make it to 12,000 to 14,000 tests daily, but unfortunately, people are not coming forward to get tested. Around 80% of the people are asymptomatic, and the number of symptomatic people has reduced,” said Chahal.Of the 35 deaths on Tuesday, 27 patients had comorbidities; 22 were men and 13 were women; seven deaths were of patients between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and 28 victims were above 60 years of age.The overall growth rate of Mumbai is 0.79%, and the doubling rate is 88 days.

26-08-2020||Mumbai||Few takers for medical posts in Ratnagiri: State to HC||The state, in its reply to a petition in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking directions for urgent filling of vacant posts of medical officers and health workers in Ratnagiri, has said that while some posts have been filled, a majority of them remain vacant as there are few takers.In its affidavit, the government further said that it had initiated the process of recruitment. However, it would take time as it involved verification of documents submitted and other formalities. Hence, it was not possible to fulfill the prayers of the petitioner immediately.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Khalil Wasta, a fisherman from Ratnagiri, was informed by advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that with the commencement of Ganeshotsav, Ratnagiri could see a surge in Covid cases as many people would return to their hometowns to celebrate the festival. Bhatkar submitted that as many posts of medical officers and health workers were vacant in the civil hospital, it would be difficult to treat residents in the event of a spike in Covid cases, as those persons returning home were reaching there from Covid hot spots like Pune and Mumbai. Responding to the directions of the court in an earlier hearing, wherein the state was asked to submit the measures it was taking to address the issues the state, through additional government pleader Reena Salunkhe, submitted an affidavit which stated that additional medical officers and health workers had been dispatched to Ratnagiri for the festival period.The affidavit by Dr Sadhana M Tayde, director, commissioner of health services, informed that the Ratnagiri Civil Hospital was a 200-bed hospital, and the process of filling up posts was ongoing. It further stated that 59 appointment orders were issued after a December 2018 advertisement; 32 joined, including 15 MBBS doctors and one general surgeon. However, the affidavit pointed out that later, 27 candidates resigned, and as of now, there are only four MBBS and 22 specialist doctors at the hospital.Similarly, in response to a July 2019 advertisement, 108 appointment orders were issued, and 71 joined, of which 37 candidates resigned later. In response to a May 2020 advertisement, 53 medical and para-medical staff were appointed, but only 26 joined.The affidavit further stated that the latest advertisement of July 2020, has received fewer applications. Completing the recruitment process would take time, which the court accepted. When Bhatkar objected and said that the initiatives were insufficient and sought an update on the actual number of medical officers and health workers who had reached Ratnagiri, the court asked the state to submit the details and posted the matter for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/few-takers-for-medical-posts-in-ratnagiri-state-to-hc/story-rNO82wtULVW8UbPFn37iTK.html
26-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid tally crosses 700K; city sees 587 cases, lowest since May 12, due to tech glitch||Maharashtra on Tuesday went past 700,000 Covid-19 cases, 170 days after the first infection, with 10,425 more patients taking the tally to 703, 823. The latest 100,000 cases took only eight days. The state took 96 days for the first 100,000, 22 for the second, 14 for the third, 11 for the fourth, 10 for fifth and ninth for the tally to move from 500,000 to 600,000.Meanwhile, Mumbai, which was the country’s worst-hit city in the initial stage of the outbreak, has reported its lowest daily caseload after 105 days. The city reported 587 cases on Tuesday, taking its tally to 137,683. Mumbai had reported 426 cases on May 12. The fewer number of cases, however, is owing to the technical glitches it faced with the ICMR website, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has clarified. The city has, however, witnessed a fall in fatalities over the past four days, as it reported 121 deaths at a daily rate of 30 fatalities, against the daily average of 45 in August. The city reported 1,124 deaths between August 1 and 25. The state reported 329 new fatalities on Tuesday, taking the toll to 22,794 at a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.24%. Of them, 241 deaths were reported in past 48 hours, 44 in the past week and remaining 44 were from the period before it. Pune district reported the highest fatalities at 58, of which 36 were in Pune city, 13 in rural parts of the district and nine in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Kolhapur district saw 37 fatalities, while Mumbai and Raigad rural reported 35 fatalities each. Nagpur and Aurangabad districts reported 24 and 21 fatalities each. Pune district remained on the top even in daily infections, by reporting 2,528 cases in the past 24 hours. Of them, 1,228 were in Pune city, 458 in rural Pune and 842 in Pimpri-Chichwad. Nashik and Aurangabad cities, too, continued to be top contributors in daily infections with 675 and 605 cases respectively on Tuesday. The total of recovered patients reached 514,790 after 12,300 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours, taking the recovery rate to 73.14%, against national rate of 75.27%. Maharashtra has 165,921 active patients. Maharashtra has 12,53,273 patients under home quarantine, while 33,668 are institutionally quarantined. 61,423 tests were performed in the state in 24 hours at a positivity rate of 16.97%.While cities like Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Aurangabad have succeeded in bringing down the number of new cases over the past few weeks, state authorities have been treading very cautiously. The authorities are wary of the resurgence owing to the festive season if due precautions are not taken. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked the district and civic administrations to be more vigilant to avoid any new surge due to festivals and monsoon-related ailments. The state authorities are not happy with the pace the contacts are being traced and tracked in the districts and civic bodies where the cases are more. “The only effective way to stop the spread and emergence of new cases is aggressive tracing, testing of the contacts, where we are lagging badly. The fatigue the healthcare system is facing over the last six months could be one of the reasons for it, but it should be intensified. In some parts of the state, the health infrastructure is poor, which is leading to more deaths,” said an official from the health department.Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of Mumbai-based KEM hospital and member of the state committee appointed to recommend steps to curb the spread, said that in Mumbai and MMR, the rise has been controlled well. “There could be a couple of months more, when we can expect the downward trend. We have controlled it in Mumbai with weekly cases coming down to 6500 from 10,500 cases in May. Similarly the situation in MMR is under control, but its spreading peripherally, and the trend is expected to be witnessed at least for next two months. The emergence of the second wave of the infection depends on how carefully it sustains during the festive season,” he said.Dr Supe said that strengthening of public health, supporting therapy and care of the elderly, and comorbid patients is the 3-point mantra that could help the authorities to keep the spread under check. Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, past national president of Indian Medical Association has attributed high fatality rate to the poor health infrastructure. “Besides the issues with the tracing and tracking, the poor infrastructure in mofussil and rural areas is one of the reasons for the high number of cases and deaths. In districts like Dhule and Nandurbar, the turnaround time for the test report in more than 2 days. The spread is now more in the rural areas where the infrastructure is in a shambles. Fear among the people for the treatment is another reason for the high rate of fatalities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-tally-crosses-700k-city-sees-587-cases-lowest-since-may-12-due-to-tech-glitch/story-THzXrE5EXdWINbPJrTWd1J.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi assembly panel to probe Facebook ‘inaction’ on hate speech, bias charges||The Delhi assembly’s Committee on Peace and Harmony will seek an investigation into Facebook to determine whether the way the social media company polices content is biased, if it threatens India’s democratic processes, and if its alleged inaction on purported hate speech contributed to the communal violence in the Capital earlier this year, its members said on Tuesday.The decision was taken following a meeting in which multiple experts and journalists who have looked at the issue offered their assessment. The matter is being examined after the panel, according to its members, received multiple complaints accusing the US-based company of acting in a partisan manner and not doing enough to remove hateful content. On August 14, the Wall Street Journal reported that some Facebook executives purportedly bent rules to shield individuals from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who made posts qualifying as hate speech. The company denied the allegations.“After the detailed examination of the witnesses, the committee has been posed with extremely useful and significant insights on the issue at hand which must be delved into meticulously… The witnesses also affirmed that a free and fair investigation must be conducted by independent investigating agencies to painstakingly investigate the alleged inaction of the Facebook in curbing the hateful content and palpably inflammatory content, with a view to ascertain if there was any complicity of Facebook officials in the alleged deliberate inaction,” said a statement by the committee chaired by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha.According to one of the members of the committee, the panel could seek a probe into three specific aspects: if Facebook content had a role in the Delhi riots and whether it acted in time to remove these; if there was any collusion between Facebook India officials and members of the BJP; and if Facebook poses a threat to free and fair elections in the country. The leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri denied there was collusion between the BJP and Facebook. “Facebook has never supported the BJP. The Aam Aadmi Party leaders have no business here. They have a majority in the assembly. They are taking advantage of it through the peace committee and they are making a political issue out of nothing just to hide their own failures in governance and Covid-19 management,” he said. “As far as hate speeches are concerned, no BJP leader has indulged in hate speech. When it comes to the Delhi riots, the Delhi Police is investigating the matter. Interestingly, a leader of the AAP (Tahir Hussain) is among the accused. The party should rather cooperate in the ongoing probe instead of indulging in gimmicks,” said Bidhuri, the BJP MLA from Badarpur.The WSJ report stated that Facebook officials, especially its top public policy executive in India, Ankhi Das, allegedly cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence. The two expert witnesses present in Tuesday’s meeting of the committee were Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a journalist who has co-authored a book titled ‘The Real Face of Facebook in India’ and Nikhil Pahwa, a journalist with Medianama. “Eventually, the committee will submit the report of the legislative enquiry to Speaker Ram Niwas Goel. The speaker can forward the report to the police for a case to be filed or send it to the Election Commission,” Chadha added.The statement issued earlier reiterated the assembly will summon Facebook officials. “Hence, the committee will soon issue notices to top officials of Facebook with a view to examine them on record. The committee aims at redressing the issue at the earliest, therefore, the proceedings shall be expedited in order to put this issue to its logical conclusion.”The company did not respond to emails from HT seeking a comment on the committee’s position. Facebook India head Ajit Mohan on Friday issued a statement saying the company is an “open, transparent and non-partisan platform”. The BJP has rejected the allegations and said that social media companies such as Facebook crack down harder on right wing content. The party’s IT cell head said the company removed 700 pages last year and has not reinstated them since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-panel-to-probe-facebook-inaction-on-hate-speech-bias-charges/story-7N8RiHHpmADx5mxoot85vL.html

26-08-2020||Gurugram||Cyber City accident: Cops record statements of minors, book parents||The police on Tuesday recorded the statement of the two minor boys allegedly involved in the road accident that led to the death of a 49-year-old motorcyclist, Alok Gupta, in Cyber City on Sunday morning. The police said that the juvenile, who was behind the wheel, has been identified. He allegedly told them that he was driving at a high speed and lost control over the wheel, following which the car hit the median and turned turtle several times before hitting Gupta.Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of police (East), said that police will produce the boy before the child welfare committee (CWC) on Wednesday and later before the juvenile justice board (JJB). “The juvenile have been booked under section 304A (causing death by negligence). It’s a bailable offence,” he said adding the doctors have confirmed that they were in inebriated state when admitted to the hospital. The police said they are waiting for the blood sample report based on which a section will be added to the FIR. After the crash, both the boys were allegedly taken out of the car by two passersby, who are also the eyewitnesses in the case. They were taken to the hospital in the same ambulance as the deceased motorcyclist. The two were discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. “The minor has told the police that they had gone to a friend’s house for a night party in Sector 67 and were partying till early morning. Parents of the host were also present in the house but had fallen asleep, while they kept partying and consumed alcohol. They left the friend’s house in a borrowed car around 4.30 am and were driving in Cyber City when they met with an accident,” he said. The juveniles are students of classes 11 and 12 in a private school of the city. The police, however, refused to either name or reveal the ages of the minors. However, they have collected their identification cards and have confirmed that they are minors. The police said the parents of the boy also recorded their statements and they are conducting investigation. They have been booked under sections 279 and 304A of the Motor Vehicles Act on Tuesday evening, after their statements were recorded. Mohan said the car belongs to another friend’s father, and is registered in Faridabad. Mihika Wahi Gupta, wife of the deceased, said they would fight for justice to ensure the culprit is punished for his negligent driving. “The police should add more sections to the FIR now as the suspect himself has revealed that he was in an inebriated state and was illegally driving,” she said. Anurag Gupta, brother of the deceased, said if the boy behind the wheels gets the benefit of being a juvenile, they will ensure he is tried as an adult in the juvenile justice board and gets the maximum punishment for the damage he has caused to his brother’s family. “We will fight to get justice and will not let him get away by being a minor,” he said. The family will move a petition once police produce the boy before the juvenile justice board. “The police have not informed us with the updates on the case. We want to check the documents with the police before they file the charge sheet,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cyber-city-accident-cops-record-statements-of-minors-book-parents/story-Ta6Zh1zkt9WJhjxoe1fwWL.html

All of them recovered by the first week of August. Touched by the efforts of the doctors, nurses and other Covid warriors, the family decided to honour them innovatively. Using paper, cardboard and toys, the family made a corona monster who is defeated by the nurses, doctors and policemen, who are at the forefront during the Covid-19 situation.Deepak Yadav, 36, along with his brother-in-law decorated the Ganpati mandap based on his experiences during the lockdown. He said, “We were worried about the elders in our family when almost all of us tested positive. The doctors and nurses helped us get through this difficult situation. Hence, the theme of decoration is based on them this year.”“The police personnel were feeding those who did not have food and the clean-up marshals sanitised each nook and corner of the city. They also have a prime spot in our theme. Actor Sonu Sood helped stranded labourers in reaching their hometowns. We have shown him as a superhero through our decoration,” said Yadav.Similarly, Niharika Singh, 11 and Mahi Singh, 9, residents of Manpada, decided to give out a message of taking precautions to reduce your chances of contracting the virus. Niharika said, “We used our dolls and craft materials to create a hospital scene, where a girl is being treated for Covid. We have also shown another girl wearing a mask, using sanitiser and drinking hot water. We have put up placards giving out general information about Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-corona-monster-being-defeated-by-docs-to-masks-for-dolls-team-bappa-joins-the-fight/story-bAJMD3AXyX7mfaOV8h5tFK.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Businessman, son held for assaulting cops||A 53-year-old businessman, his 21-year-old son and another person were arrested for allegedly assaulting police officials at south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park (CR Park) police station following a fight the three had with the owner and driver of an SUV over a collision between their vehicles on Monday night, police said. The three persons were booked for rash driving and assaulting policemen on duty, a case regarding which was registered under Sections 279, 186, 353, 332 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The accident and the assault took place around 9.30 pm on Monday at a market near I-block in CR Park, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police control room received a call regarding an accident in CR Park area after which an inspector and three policemen reached the spot and found two vehicles – an SUV and a hatchback – in a damaged condition.Two occupants of the hatchback, the businessman’s son and his friend of the same age, were allegedly assaulting the driver of the BMW and arguing with an elderly man sitting inside the SUV. When some people tried to intervene, the two men hurled abuses on them and asked them to stay away, a police officer associated with the case said.“When the four policemen tried to intervene, the two men began assaulting them. They tore their uniform. In the meantime, the businessman arrived in his car and allegedly joined them in assaulting the policemen and the SUV driver and misbehaved with the public,” said the officer, requesting not to be named.Reinforcements were sent to bring the matter under their control. Both parties were taken to the police station, where the trio allegedly created a commotion, slapped police personnel and fought with them, DCP Thakur said.“We registered a case arrested the three men. Their cars, including the damaged BMW, were impounded,” the DCP said. The complaint was filed on the SUV owner’s complaint.HT could not contact the arrested businessman and his son for their version of the incident.DCP Thakur said the businessman manufactures railway track clips while son and his friend are studying at a private institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/businessman-son-held-for-assaulting-cops/story-hgOw3wtePbZHUQohGv1edI.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||DMRC, CISF say they are ready for Metro’s reopening||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) are planning a series of measures to be put in place when the Metro resumes operation. People familiar with the matter had indicated on Monday that the government may allow the resumption of Metro services after over five months in September, when the fourth phase of a plan to restart businesses and activities restricted in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) kicks in.Some of the measures planned by the DMRC includes the use of smart cards for contactless and cashless travel, thermal scanning at entry points, earmarking designated spots for passengers to stand while waiting for trains or at customer service counters, use of face masks among others. The use of Aarogya Setu mobile application is likely to be mandatory.But the guidelines for operations will be finalised once the Union ministry of home affairs allow Metro operations and issue necessary guidelines. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “We shall follow all guidelines set by the government in this regard.” The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in charge of security at the transit stations, said that the basic arrangements are in place and they are ready to resume operations as and when directed.With a majority of commercial activities being allowed in the city, people have been facing problems while commuting due to inadequate public transport and the restriction on the number of passengers who can travel in a public bus at a given point of time. With nearly six million passenger journeys daily, the Metro is the transport lifeline of Delhi and National Capital Region. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently urged the Centre to resume Metro in the national capital. Speaking at a webinar with traders last week, Kejriwal said, “People of Delhi have been requesting us to start metro services. We have taken this up with the central government on several occasions. We have urged the Centre to explore the possibility of resuming metro services in Delhi while keeping it prohibited in other states as of now. Delhi is a special case because we have the covid situation under control.”From the moment a person enters the metro station to the end of the journey, there are a series of measures which DMRC and CISF have planned to ensure social distancing. Movement in MetroThe travel time is likely to increase as the DMRC plans to increase the stoppage time at each station to ensure social distancing when passengers board or de-board a train. Also, crowding inside the train will not be allowed. The current stoppage time at each station is 10-20 seconds which Dayal said “will suitably be increased to ensure comfortable boarding/ deboarding”.As per the measures announced by the DMRC in March this year, just days before the nationwide lockdown was announced, trains will skip crowded stations and its frequency will be altered. This was suggested to ensure social distancing. But the norms, which come into force from March 23, couldn’t be implemented as Metro operations were shut from March 22. DMRC has put stickers on alternate seats in all its trains that have to be left vacant. It has also put markings on the floors at the platform and near customer service or ticketing counters so that people don’t crowd and maintain a distance of one meter. The temperature inside trains is likely to be maintained at 26 degrees Celsius.The Metro also plans to conduct thermal scanning of passengers and wearing a mask will be mandatory within the station premises. Even if the Centre allows Metro operations, the decision whether the interstate Metro movement will be allowed or not will be taken by the state governments of Delhi and neighbouring states. While there is no restriction on movement in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have lockdown during weekends.Dayal said the DMRC will abide by the guidelines set by the government.Frisking and securityAn officer familiar with the arrangements, who wished not to be named, said as per the tentative protocol as of now, the number of entry and exit gates to be opened at each station will depend on the footfall. “As precautionary measures, the moment a person enters the station a CISF personnel will check their temperature using a thermal scanner. Only those with normal temperature will be allowed access. The CISF personnel manning the door frame metal detectors will also mandatorily wear a face shield, face mask and gloves,” a senior CISF officer said.Before their frisking, the passengers will be asked to take out all metallic items he’s carrying in his pockets, the officer said.The CISF personnel have been directed to make sure the handheld metal detector shall not touch the passenger. Another officer said these protocols are tentative and subject to change as directed by the government.Earlier this month the CISF staff posted in the DMRC unit had been directed to be prepared to resume services at a short notice. They had been asked by their seniors to mobilise force and ensure that metal detectors and other equipment such as X-ray scanners are kept at the ready.Directions included ensuring the availability of enough face shields, gloves and other protective equipment as need be to enforce social distancing and safe frisking of passengers.Experts voice concernsWhile community medicine expert Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department at Safdarjung hospital, said that it is about time to start the services as people are facing inconvenience, other medical experts advise caution.Dr Kishore said, “People are using their own vehicles which is causing air and sound pollution. People will use the Metro but should follow all the necessary precautions such as the use of face masks, social distancing, etc.”Pointing to the rise in the number of cases and the positivity rate, some experts also called for deferring opening of Metro. “How will social distancing be ensured at stations? Currently, a lot of people from neighbouring areas are not able to come to Delhi as Metro operations are closed. Starting it would only allow more movement of people and increase the chances of infection,” said Dr PK Sharma, epidemiologist and former medical health officer with the New Delhi Municipal Council. Dayal said, “Adequate manpower will be deployed to ensure the smooth resumption of services. Alternate seating will be allowed inside the trains. We would also request our passengers to cooperate with us and follow all social distancing norms while travelling.”As per the second serological survey, 28% of Delhi’s population has been exposed to Covid-19. “This means that nearly 2/3 of the population is still unexposed. The positivity rate is already on a rise and if you create opportunities for people to mingle, then it will increase the chances of transmission of the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmrc-cisf-say-they-are-ready-for-metro-s-reopening/story-nxRm1V6AOtJ4GWDDYE0I4I.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Last week, Delhi recorded rainfall enough to meet 13 per cent of its water demand: CSE||Just a seven-day spell of rain in the national capital, between August 13 and August 19, produced enough wastewater to meet nearly 13% of the city’s daily water demand, analysis by an environmental think tank has found, highlighting the need potential for groundwater recharge.The analysis, by the Centre for Science and Environment, showed that in those seven days, Delhi received nearly 118.4 millimetres of rainfall —143% more than the average. Such a heavy spell can produce around 87,000 million litres of water, the analysis showed. Sushmita Sengupta, programme manager (water programme), CSE, said the demand for water in Delhi was estimated to be 2,765 million litres per day, or 644,225 million litres (at a rate of 175 litres per capita per day) annually. “The volume of rainwater generated in the past week, calculated by multiplying the area by the rainfall received and the co-efficient of the rainwater run-off, was almost 13% of the city’s total daily water demand. This was estimated taking into account 18.8 million population of Delhi (according to the 2011 census) and 1,483 square kilometres area,” Sengupta explained. Using a tehsil-wise assessment of groundwater resources by the Central Ground Water Board (CGBW), CSE also said the total annual groundwater recharge of Delhi was assessed to be 320 million cubic metres (mcm), with annual extractable groundwater resources at 300mcm. Sengupta implored that such heavy rainfall be used to recharge the city’s groundwater table. To this effect, she added, stormwater drains that carry rainwater should be clean and managed well. “The urban water bodies are the main recharge points in a city — they act like sponges. They can absorb flash floods as well as recharge groundwater. While rooftop rainwater harvesting systems are very important, they are only dropping in a bucket. We need to harvest water from all our green spaces,” she said. In a 2015 order, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) made it mandatory to ensure that no government project, including flyovers and bridges, be approved until they have a provision of rainwater harvesting systems. At present, there are 544 rainwater harvesting systems installed in Delhi Jal Board buildings, 1305 in government buildings, 3,675 in schools and colleges and 1,869 systems in private buildings. Sumukhi Venkat, a social activist who has worked extensively with the governments of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to promote rainwater recharge methods, said heavily concretised cities were a primary factor behind rainwater going to waste. “Delhi’s data shows that comparatively deeper water levels are only found in south and southwest districts, but as we come into central, northern and eastern parts, the groundwater levels get shallower. When rainwater falls on a concrete ground, it essentially goes to waste. With more concrete based development, we are only reducing open spaces where soil can absorb rainwater and help regain water,” Venkat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/last-week-delhi-recorded-rainfall-enough-to-meet-13-of-its-water-demand-cse/story-t2emsksfrhhjH1oEVJKoPM.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi, north-west India to see intense rain from August 26-28, says IMD||Intense monsoon showers are expected in many parts of north-west India, including Delhi, between August 26 and 28, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Tuesday.The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is active and lying south of its normal position and is likely to remain active for the next two or three days, the IMD said. In addition, there is a convergence of lower level south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea over north-west India till August 28. “The Monsoon trough is shifting northwards and will stay very close to Delhi-NCR between August 25 and August 28. Under its influence, the convergence of lower-level easterlies from the Bay of Bengal and south-westerlies from the Arabian Sea will take place over north-west India. One or two spells of moderate rain accompanied thunderstorm is likely to hit Delhi between August 26 to August 28,” Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD, said.“As a result, widespread and very heavy rain is likely over north-west India till August 28,” the IMD said in its Tuesday bulletin.In its severe weather warning, the IMD has said that along with heavy rain, moderate to severe thunderstorm and lightning is likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Rajasthan, east Madhya Pradesh, and Vidarbha, among others, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.The low-pressure system over north Bay of Bengal is likely to move west-north-west over the next four to five days. Under its influence, widespread and very heavy rain is very likely in Odisha, the Gangetic West Bengal, and Jharkhand till August 28; and over Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Rajasthan between August 26 and 28. Isolated extremely heavy rain is also likely in Odisha on August 25 and 26 and in Chhattisgarh on August 27.In the past two days, many parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan had seen extremely severe rain. Abdasa and Naliya in Kutch each recorded 22cm of rain while Gondal, Bhanbad and Lakhpat in Kutch recorded 16 to 18cm of rain on Monday. Kadi and Umerpada in Gujarat recorded 33 and 26cm of rain, respectively. Nine persons died in the heavy rain, while 1,900 people were shifted to safer places in Gujarat on Monday, according to a report by PTI.On Monday, 24 stations (15 in Bihar, four in Uttar Pradesh, two in Assam, one each in Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal) are in severe flood situation. Twenty-four of 45 storage dams in the country are at over 90% storage capacity.Delhi only has a 6% deficiency while north-west India has 14% deficiency in monsoon rain since June 1. Rain within -19% and +19% category during monsoon season is considered to be in the normal category.Monsoon rain since June 1 over the country is 8% excess with 5% excess over east and north-east India; 14% deficient over north-west India; 14% surplus over central India; and 25% surplus over the south peninsula.Last week, the national capital had received three days of heavy rain, which left the city’s roads inundated causing long snarls on several arterial roads. On Thursday, Delhi recorded the heaviest spell of rain this season, with its Aya Nagar observatory receiving as much as 122.8mm of rain in just 24 hours, which according to IMD is “most likely” the highest rainfall recorded in Delhi in over a decade. Rainfall between 64.5 – 115.5mm is considered “heavy” rain, while a reading between 115.6 – 204.4mm is considered “very heavy” rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-north-west-india-to-see-intense-rain-from-aug-26-28-says-imd/story-bzLpRfT2lq8nhD9SJIqCzO.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt job portal evokes keen interest, more than 1 million register||Nearly 15% job seekers registered on a Delhi government portal launched a month ago have postgraduate degrees. Around 35% are university graduates, data shared by Delhi government showed.As of Tuesday, at least 1,053,356 people had registered themselves on the government portal – aptly titled Rozgar Bazar – for 808,582 job posts that had been advertised, government data said.Of the total number of active job seekers, 152,722 had post-graduate degrees, 70,892 had post-graduate diplomas and 369,793 had bachelor’s degrees. The government, said a senior official, is currently compiling a list of job-seekers who have had prior work experience along with those who are freshers.The job portal was launched with the primary aim of helping people who lost their jobs during the lockdown. However, it is open for all and anyone can get themselves registered. So, the registered job seekers include freshers as well as people with work experience who may have been unemployed from before the lockdown or those who are looking out for better opportunities, the government official said.So far, employers have either hired people or shortlisted candidates for more than 1.1 million jobs, which were posted in the portal, said the senior official, adding that the highest job openings happen to be in fields of marketing and sales, back office and data entry along with customer support.Among job seekers, data entry, teaching, customer support, business development and accounts are the most sought-after fields, said the official.“The fact that there are so many academically qualified people among job seekers, suggests that people are in distress. It shows the importance of having a job portal like this. The portal offers a great diversity of jobs – from accountants, salesmen, telecallers to employers looking for chefs, who specialise in certain cuisines, and photographers,” said Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the dialogue and development commission of Delhi, which acts as an advisor to the Delhi government.Shah further said, “For people who are graduating this year, this portal can be a big opportunity. Under the current circumstances, there is not much hope for campus placements. The portal has also been of great help for people with experience who were looking for better work opportunities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-job-portal-evokes-keen-interest-more-than-1-million-register/story-NGOUdxED5AGFjExx5JtpjJ.html

Following Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar’s instruction, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh conducted a review meeting on Tuesday. Rao said, “We are proposing four options for land acquisition. Administration would prepare a detailed land acquisition plan for both international airport and railway line and submitted to the guardian minister by weekend. If necessary, the proposal would be submitted before a high-power state-level committee for approval.” “The Pune-Nashik railway work could start soon as four proposals for land acquisition in Haveli taluka of Pune district have been received. The Pune-Nashik railway line is passing through four talukas of Pune district. The total land required for the plan is 1,470 hectares with 575 hectares falling under Pune district. Administration would start a land survey soon and identify details of the land required for the railway,” he said. The senior official said that surveys related to airport plan are already completed and approved. Airport plan For the proposed Purandar international airport in Pune district, land falling under seven villages — Pargaon, Ekhatpur, Munjwadi, Kumbharvalan, Udachiwadi, Vanpuri and Khanavadi —has been earmarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/land-acquisition-proposals-for-purandar-airport-and-pune-nashik-rly-line-projects-to-be-ready-in-a-week-rao/story-aPvONIny3qKPfl2hSzSvWO.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||No fines in Delhi for driving with expired driving licence, RC till December 31||People driving with an expired licence or a vehicle registration certificate will not be prosecuted in Delhi till December 31 as the state transport department has issued orders to its regional transport offices (RTOs) to not process any application for renewal of such documents in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and in light of the Centre extending their validity till the end of the year.The directive comes a day after the ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) issued an advisory to all state governments to further extend the deadline for renewal of transport documents. This is the third such extension after earlier advisories on March 30 and June 9.Senior transport officials, however, clarified that the exempted expired documents do not include pollution under control (PUC) certificates.“We request people not to queue up at RTOs in Delhi unless one has to get a learner’s or permanent licence. The ministry has extended the validity of fitness, permits, licences, registration or other documents under Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 till December 31, 2020,” a transport official said on condition of anonymity.Normally, driving without a valid licence attracts a penalty of Rs 5,000 as per the MV Act.Unlike other government agencies such as SDM offices that are generally witnessing a low turnout of people, the state transport department said it is burdened with a deluge of queries regarding driving licences, fitness certificates and permit renewals.Services such as making a DL now entail a long wait, which can drag as much as up to two months in RTOs such as Rohini, Sarai Kale Khan and Dwarka. At the Sarai Kale Khan RTO, for example, one of the busiest in Delhi, as many as 250 driving tests used to be conducted on its semi-automatic driving test tracks every day during pre-Covid times. Now, only around 80 tests are conducted there on a single day. The number of online tests for a learners’ licence has come down to 50.“Due to social distancing norms, which cannot be compromised with, we have capped the number of daily driving tests being conducted at every regional transport office (RTO). Hence, the demand is naturally much higher. We are trying to make people aware of the Central government’s latest relaxed rule for expired transport documents. So, there is no need to panic and come to the RTO for renewal as of now,” said a second senior transport official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-fines-in-delhi-for-driving-with-expired-driving-licence-rc-till-december-31/story-vizNyeCoWzzkrfQ0rmPfXN.html
26-08-2020||Delhi||BJP launches mega drive against mosquito-borne diseases, AAP says drama||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led municipal corporations of Delhi, with an eye on the 2022 civic body elections, on Tuesday launched a mega campaign to create awareness about dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases, a move that triggered a war of words with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Delhi’s ruling party termed the campaign as “drama” and accused the civic bodies of purchasing anti-larvae chemicals at a higher rate of Rs 3,256 per kg, compared to the Rs 2,500 per kg paid by other municipal corporations for chemicals of similar quality, a charge the BJP denied outright.With municipal elections scheduled in 2022, the BJP, which is ruling the three corporations since 2007, has put its entire state machinery behind the campaign as it hopes to win a fourth consecutive term. A similar campaign launched by the AAP government had led to a tussle between the two parties last year. As part of the 10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute” (10 for 10 weeks at 10 am) campaign last August to tackle dengue, chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had urged the public to check their residences every Sunday for mosquito breeding. Several celebrities had lent support to the campaign.Leaving nothing to chance and looking for a head start this time, the BJP asked its senior leaders, including all seven members of Parliament, and MLAs, to participate in the month-long campaign.On Tuesday, north corporation mayor Jai Prakash and BJP national vice-president Shyam Jaju participated in a drive at Flagstaff Road, where the Chief Minister’s residence is located. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and SDMC mayor Anamika Mithilesh started the campaign from the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the north and south Delhi municipal corporations. Taking pot shots at AAP’s 2019 campaign, the Delhi BJP chief said, “Municipalities here do not work for 10 minutes but round the clock to control the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. We are committed to keeping the city people healthy and safe. Our DBC (domestic breeding checkers) workers will visit households to spray anti-larvae medicines and health department officials will conduct a written assessment of mosquito breeding in every household.”Launching the campaign at Flagstaff Road, Jai Prakash said, “It was the municipal corporations that did everything to control dengue and chikungunya. We were doing the work on the ground but the government took credit. They hijacked it. This time we are set not only to take measures to control dengue, chikungunya and malaria, but also to spread awareness among masses. The public should know that the MCDs are working for them tirelessly.” The Delhi government’s campaign last year had led to a political fight between the two parties. While the BJP had accused the ruling party of taking credit from municipal officials, AAP had accused the BJP of trying to negate the Delhi government’s campaign to combat dengue by “politicising the seasonal disease”.Jai Prakash said the importance of this year’s campaign could be gauged from the fact that all seven MPs, BJP MLAs and the state BJP leadership would take part and “convey the message” to the masses.BJP MPs Manoj Tiwari, Meenakshi Lekhi and Hans Raj Hans led the campaigns at Civil Lines, Karol Bagh and Narela, respectively.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak described the BJP’s move as “drama”, saying a similar campaign for cleaning garbage yielded no results. “This campaign is nothing but a drama. It is also a way to make money. The MCDs had in July last year purchased the chemical sprayed on mosquito larvae at a price of Rs 3256.8 per kg. The same drug was bought by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation for Rs 2,500 per kg. Where this money has gone? It’s a scam. They don’t have money to pay their teachers and doctors but buy things on higher rates,” Pathak alleged.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta refuted Pathak’s claims. “These are baseless allegations. They are in the habit of making such allegations to tarnish the image of MCDs and BJP leaders,” Gupta said.Speaking on the political row, Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Studies of Developing Societies (CSDS), said it looks like a “healthy competition” on an issue that concerns the common man. He, however, said the BJP’s move of putting its entire machinery behind the campaign reveals an element of politics in it.“Kejriwal’s campaign against dengue last year resonated well with the public so the BJP is trying to pick up the public concern issue early this time before AAP. It is good that instead of doing politics by blaming MLAs or party leaders, the BJP has picked up an issue that concerns the people,” Kumar said.Mosquito-borne diseases are a major health issue in Delhi. According to civic records, in 2015, as many as 15,867 dengue cases were reported and 60 people lost their lives. The number of dengue cases in 2019 was controlled at 2,036 and two deaths were reported.This year, according to civic records, 51 cases of dengue, 28 cases of chikungunya and 53 cases of malaria have been reported till August 22. No deaths have been recorded yet.The AAP has also started its preparations for the civic polls.

Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Wednesday undertook a meeting with medical oxygen suppliers and retailers to ensure that there is a smooth supply in the district. Rao said, “Oxygen is key for Covid-19 treatment and many critical patients require it. The demand for medical oxygen increased more than three times in a month. In June and July, the demand for oxygen had been 42 metric tonnes per day which has now shot up to 135 metric tonnes per day in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.”“With the boost in medical infrastructure and beds due to the jumbo Covid-19 facilities, the requirement of oxygen is also increasing. We received some complaints as well regarding oxygen supply, but they were related to transportation and unavailability of the cylinders,” Rao added.The divisional commissioner appointed the food and drug commissioner as the nodal officer to monitor the smooth oxygen supply in Pune district. The food and drug administration will monitor the prices of oxygen regularly.Rao said, “We warned oxygen suppliers that there should be no artificial shortage in the future even if there is no price hike. If the oxygen suppliers create an artificial price hike, then, action will be taken against them under the Essential Commodities Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/medical-oxygen-demand-sees-three-fold-rise-in-a-month-pune-administration/story-42hDCOcte4674OUzv6uJJK.html
