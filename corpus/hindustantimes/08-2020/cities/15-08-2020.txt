15-08-2020||City||Covid warriors recognised for their efforts||GurugramFrom doctors, lab technicians and ASHA workers, who have been at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus disease, to members from the police force that played a crucial role in the enforcement of lockdown restrictions, individuals from different organs of the administration and departments were recognised by the government for their efforts in curbing the spread of Covid-19 on the occasion of Independence Day on Saturday. A total of 42 corona warriors from police, health and education departments and MCG were recognised for their efforts by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala as part of the Independence Day celebrations at Tau Devi Lal stadium in sector 38. Appreciating the efforts of the Covid warriors, Chautala said they had played a crucial role in tackling the outbreak of coronavirus and congratulated them all. Members from the Civil Defence Committee, Red Cross, and various panchayats were also awarded by Chautala for their contribution. Geeta Sharma, a lab technician at the Wazirabad Public Health Centre, was among the health workers who were awarded. She is involved in the collection of samples from those suspected of having Covid-19 and was recognised for her contribution in the testing process. The 49-year-old has been on duty since the pandemic broke, sometimes working without any leave for 15 days at a stretch. At the forefront of the testing process, Sharma takes a Covid test every month. “Ours is a high-risk job. We are in direct contact with patients, which necessitates that we get ourselves tested every month,” she said. Sharma, who has been working as a lab technician with the Wazirabad PHC for the past 11 years, said that the initial phase of the pandemic was challenging since most people had not estimated the outbreak would last for so many months. “The initial few months were challenging but things are being brought under control gradually. Increased public awareness has made our job easier than before. People understand the consequences of the diseases and cooperate with us,” said Sharma. Her day begins around 9 am and continues till evening, until a particular number of samples are tested. She conducts around 40-50 tests every day and keeps a record of patients’ details. Sharma said she was happy about receiving the award since it was a recognition of the efforts of health workers. “We have been working tirelessly since months. Getting this award will motivate us to continue with our efforts,” she said. Sangeeta, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), is another front line warrior who was awarded for her efforts in the testing process. The 31-year-old stays in touch with a Covid patient starting from the contact tracing stage till the recovery. “We trace the contact history, reach out to the family, provide them with masks, oximeters, medicines and keep a check on the patient throughout the home isolation process,” said Sangeeta, who has been on duty since March 22, when the first Covid case was detected in the city. Talking about the increased work pressure during the pandemic, Sangeeta said she and other ANMs were on duty throughout the day since their job required addressing all immediate concerns of the patient. “While officially, the public health centre timings are from 9 am to 6 pm, we have been working round the clock during the pandemic. We need to be available at all times for any duty that may arise,” said Sangeeta. For the past four months, she has been following a strict sanitisation routine and isolating herself from the family. “After returning from work, I stay in a separate room and only step out after disinfecting my clothes and belongings,” she said. Among the various challenges that she faced in the past four months, juggling work responsibilities with household chores cautiously without spreading the virus was the toughest. “First two-three months were very difficult. It took some time to make the family understand what my job was and why I had to be out at odd hours. They feared that I might end up spreading the infection at home. However, they gradually understood and cooperate readily now,” said Sangeeta. She said that the recognition was important since health workers had been working in challenging circumstances since the pandemic started. “Apart from the work pressure, there are emotional challenges of staying away from children. This award will make my family happy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-warriors-recognised-for-their-efforts/story-WmPtiXcPcMSUV1p4kPtNkL.html

Those students who get more than 90 per cent marks will be chosen for this assistance and the goal is that Haryana should increase its share in central government employment from present 7-8 percent to 12 to 15 percent,” said Chautala, adding that this will ensure that youth are able to get jobs outside the state as well. Haryana government on July 6 had approved a draft ordinance requiring private companies, societies, trusts and similar bodies to reserve 75 percent of new jobs with less than ₹50,000 salary to those domiciled in the state, with some exceptions. Under the proposed Haryana State Employment to Local Candidates Act-2020, all private units with more than 10 employees would be covered under this.On Saturday, the deputy CM also inaugurated 17 development projects in the district which have been developed or are being developed at a cost of ₹10.44 crore. Six of these projects are located in village Naurangpur, six in Bajghera, two in Dharmpur and one each in Nakhrola and Maujabad. Around 100 women from the Panchayati Raj institutions were gifted scooters for doing a commendable job during their tenure. Chautala also said that their government was working hard to bring foreign investment in the state to boost the industrial sector and a lot of work was being done in this regard. He also said that the state government has given three options to Maruti to shift its plant in Gurugram to either Sohna, Jhajjar or Kharkhauda in view of its planned expansion. Referring to the recent issue of illegal registries, he said that efforts are being made to ensure a better and foolproof registration system with minimum human intervention.Prior to his address, Chautala unfurled the national flag at Tau Devi.Lal stadium. He also felicitated the Covid 19 warriors from different departments for their efforts to contain the virus spread. The Independence Day celebrations were also held across the city with RWAs, NGOs and other civil society organisations hoisted the national flag, planted trees and distributed face masks to residents to mark the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-i-day-event-in-gurugram-chautala-shines-light-on-job-quota/story-knQRZ6TPVjvDiv3OnL3EhN.html
15-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police to involve residents in its drive against drug abuse||leena.dhankhar@htlive.com  In order to crack down on the growing menace of drug peddlers in the city, the Gurugram Police has decided to rope in city’s residents’ welfare associations (RWA) and allow their members to share intelligence regarding the sale of narcotics in their areas. The police said a special team has been formed to interact with residents and conduct raids in those areas where drug peddlers might be active. A helpline number to share intelligence will be launched soon to report information pertaining to drugs, said the police. Officials added that the number would be monitored by a senior official, and people can even share information through WhatsApp calls and messages. The name of the resident sharing information will be kept a secret. The resident will also be rewarded on the basis of the information provided, the police said. Police commissioner K K Rao said a committee will be formed, involving experts, officials and local residents, in order to curb the drug menace in the city. “We have identified areas from where drug peddlers have been arrested in the last one year. Starting Monday, mufti-clad policemen will keep a vigil in these areas to keep a check on narcotics being supplied. We are hoping to crack these supply routes and arrest people supplying narcotics to peddlers in the city,” he said. The police said since school and colleges are closed due to the ongoing lockdown, peddlers have become active in residential areas. As such, a need was felt for greater engagement with the community so that this menace can be curbed. Rao said any information that could provide a tip-off pertaining to the sale of drugs in residential areas could be sent through messages or shared with the station house officers(SHOs) of the respective police station. “We will take prompt action on the tip-off and the informer will be rewarded based of the recovery and arrest,” he said. More than five teams, comprising five personnel each, will be deployed in 45 suspected residential areas to try and check the supply of drugs. The officers have also told their informers to stay alert and keep them posted. According to the police, the demand for drugs has gone up since the imposition of the lockdown in the city. Local drug peddlers sell marijuana in pouches of 100 grams that cost anywhere between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 depending on the quality and type of customer. Earlier the cost of one pouch used to be ₹2,000 only, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-to-involve-residents-in-its-drive-against-drug-abuse/story-EFTz3c2VkLyo6Xo3q2cL1J.html
15-08-2020||Gurugram||Badkal lake rejuvenation project delayed by a year||The Badkal lake rejuvenation project, first conceived in April 2018 as part of the Faridabad Smart City Mission, has been inordinately delayed on account of clearances from the forest department and land acquisition issues , and work on filling up the empty lake bed with recycled sewage water is now slated to commence only in August next year, confirmed officials privy to the matter. The project was initially supposed to be completed by October 2020. Rajesh Joon, additional divisional manager, Haryana tourism department and nodal officer, Surajkund Mela Authority, who is also closely involved in the Badkal lake rejuvenation project, said, “The clearances required from the forest department were a significant hurdle, but in-principle approval has now been granted. We are currently parsing through revenue records to establish the ownership pattern of the land, and are expecting final clearance from the forest department within the next two or three weeks. Work on filling up the water body itself will only start by next August.”Hindustan Times had reported, on November 21 last year, that the tourism department had sought diversion of 76 acres of forest land for the project. As per documents available on the Parivesh portal for environmental clearances, the forest department’s nod is in now in its final stage. Moreover, while the proposed sewage treatment plant (STP) that will supply the lake with water had been approved by the state government in November last year, land acquisition issues in the area where the STP is slated to be constructed also threw a wrench in the proposal’s progress, confirmed a senior technical advisor with the Faridabad Smart City Mission Limited (FSCML) , seeking anonymity. “We have begun construction of boundary walls, but the plant itself is yet to come up,” the official said. Emerging as a popular tourist spot in the late 1960s, the Badkal lake bed has been bone-dry for over a decade. In 2010, it was briefly filled up ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, but a subsequent report by the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DPGS), in 2014, declared the lake to be completely dry. By some estimates, there hasn’t been any water there since 2006.The lake’s 42-odd hectares are now overrun with scrubby mesquite trees. Rampant mining in the adjoining Aravalli hills has altered the region’s hydrogeology, ravaged the catchment areas and damaged the underlying groundwater aquifer. A 2010 research survey led by geologist Sudhanshu Shekhar, titled ‘Conservation of hydrogeological heritage : A case study of Badkhal lake’, stated, “Mining activities, including blasting over the years, have denuded the catchments areas, which led to soil erosion, creation and opening up of secondary porosity. Mining also generated huge amounts of debris which block the flow of rainwater into the lakes.”According to the current proposal, which was submitted to the government by IIT-Roorkee in March last year, the lake bed will be freed of all invasive tree species and compacted with a slurry of bentonite clay, to impede groundwater recharge. Following this, an STP will supply the lake bed with about 9.5 MLD of treated water per day, for about 200 days, which would result in a water body with a depth of six metres. “We will start clearing the lakebed of trees and shrubs as soon as we get a go ahead from the forest department,” Joon said.Joon also added that the Badkal lake rejuvenation project, if successful, will serve as a model for reviving tourism at other water bodies in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad. “Similar plans are underway to revive the Saras tourist complex at the nearby Damdama lake, but we have to get everything right with Badkal first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/badkal-lake-rejuvenation-project-delayed-by-a-year/story-SuMXv6Mt5Dwr5ICXN7KpKP.html
15-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram sanitisation worker tests positive||An employee of the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Friday just a day before he was to be felicitated on Independence Day by Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautat as one of the many “corona warriors” The official was deployed at its health wing in Sector 38 and was responsible for executing sanitisation and disinfection procedures in Covid-19 affected areas.The district’s Independence Day celebrationswas held at the Tau Devi Lal stadium near Rajiv Chowk . MCG officials privy to the matter said that besides sanitising and disinfecting areas with Covid-19 cases since March, the worker was also carrying out fumigation drives and anti-larvae operations across various parts of the city.A senior MCG official in the health wing said that the civic body has shared relevant information, including the locations where the employee was recently deployed, to the district health department for contact tracing. “Our worker is self-isolating and we have reached out to all our employees that came in contact with him recently to get themselves tested as a precautionary measure. We will be continuing our operations without any interruption,” said Ashish Singla, CMO of MCG and the civic body’s coronavirus nodal officer.This was the sixth case where an MCG employee tested positive since the outbreak was first recofded in the district in March. Last month, three officials including the zonal taxation officer (ZTO) in the taxation branch of MCG’s sector 42 office tested positive for coronavirus. In June, an official each at MCG’s audit and IT branch in sector 34 office had also tested positive. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of the district health department said, “Around 45 people who were being felicitated on Saturday were tested through rapid antigen testing on Friday evening as a precautionary measure. The MCG worker was the only one whose result came back positive.” He declined to comment further on the matter.Following the result, the worker was immediately directed to self isolate. MCG officials said he would be felicitated on a later day after he has recovered.“All sanitisation officials have been provided with basic safety equipment such as masks and gloves. In case, they are cleaning locations outside households of Covid-19 cases, they are also provided with PPE kits. The equipment only reduces the chances of contracting the infection, it does not safeguard a person 100%. Even in this case, despite following all the requisite safety measures, our worker contracted the infection,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-sanitisation-worker-tests-positive/story-qEj4Znf1Im64xQ2bkNLf0H.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi courts may open on a rotational basis from September 1, says HC||The Delhi high court on Saturday said it may resume physical on-site functioning at all seven of its district courts, as well as the high court itself, on a rotational basis from September 1. The reopening, being done on an experimental basis, would depend on the complete availability of public transport and provided that the Covid-19 situation in Delhi remains stable. The high court also said to begin with, only one-fourth of a court’s total capacity, in terms of benches and judges, may resume functioning. “On an experimental basis, around one-fourth of the courts can resume physical functioning on a rotational basis while the rest can continue taking up matters through videoconferencing,” an office order, issued by the high court registrar Manoj Jain, said.All courts have remained shut for nearly five months since the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19, and although lockdown restrictions were eased from June onwards, courts have been holding only virtual hearings via video conferencing so far.The administrative and general supervision committee of the high court, headed by chief justice DN Patel, directed the committee for preparation of graded action plan, which was constituted for the phase-wise reopening of courts, to draw up a plan for the gradual opening of on-site courts from September 1 onwards.HT earlier this week reported that the Supreme Court may also start holding in-person hearings in at least two or three of its 15 courts as early as next week, as demanded by the Bar association, even as the top court wants additional safety measures put in place before the reopening.The administrative and general supervision committee of the high court has also decided to restrict its functioning as well as that of the district courts to urgent matters till August 31, in view of the pandemic. Earlier, the high court had restricted its functioning and that of the district courts till August 14.The order issued on Saturday further said courts of registrars and joint registrars have been directed not to pass any adverse order in non-urgent or routine matters, wherein the advocate or litigant concerned is unable to join the proceedings through video conferencing, till the time the physical functioning of the courts resumes.It also said that all cases listed before the high court, between August 17 and August 31, except those before the registrars and joint registrars, have been adjourned to the period between October 9 and October 23.Similar directions were issued with regard to restricted functioning in lower courts till August 31 and their gradual reopening from September 1 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-courts-may-open-on-a-rotational-basis-from-september-1-says-hc/story-LNGDuQz9Ft0A8PMMlYZGbI.html

Total number of active cases, marking an upward trend and a negative indication for the national capital looking at a road to recovery, rose to 11,489 on Saturday. At present, Delhi has over 16,500 beds available for those infected by the virus, out of which 3,901 beds in dedicated COVID care centre have been occupied by people under quarantine including those who have travelled to the city via Vande Bharat Mission and Bubble flights. After 18,271 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, Delhi’s total number of tests conducted rose to 12,91,411. The state authorities have conducted 67,969 tests per million, the health bulletin stated. Total number of containment zones in Delhi, as of Saturday, are 538. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that the Delhi government will not open schools unless it is “fully convinced” about the improved Covid-19 situation in the city.Delivering his Independence Day speech at the Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal said the Covid-19 situation in the city is “quite under control” as compared to what it was two months back and thanked all the stakeholders, including the central government, ‘corona warriors’ and different organisations.He said in view of reports that some patients collapsed due to drop in their oxygen level even after recovering from the disease and testing negative, the Delhi government will start providing oxygen concentrators to them from next week.The chief minister said the safety and the health of school children are very important to the AAP government.“I meet people and get messages from them asking not to open schools. I want to assure them that we care about their children as much as they do. Unless fully convinced, we are not going to open the schools,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-1-276-new-coronavirus-cases-kejriwal-says-situation-quite-under-control/story-By5WQIMYUGFpr0K42PsJNI.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Over 1,500 birds injured by kite strings in the last fortnight||Feathers snapped, throats slit and strings entangled in their claws—a large number of birds in the national capital have reportedly fallen prey to kite strings in the last fortnight.Veterinarians and animal rescue groups have observed that this year, the number of birds injured by manjhas (kite strings) has increased.Sunil Jain, manager at the Charitable Bird Hospital in Chandni Chowk, said that between August 1 and August 15, they received at least 1,000 cases of manjha-related injuries. Last year in the same period, the hospital received around 700 such cases.“We have definitely admitted a higher number of birds injured by kite strings to the hospital this year. We assume that since more people are working from home these days, they are entertaining themselves by flying kites. However, a lot of varieties of strings are extremely dangerous for birds; many die during treatment from serious injuries and others are maimed for life,” Jain said.Other animal rescue helplines and veterinary hospitals have also observed a similar trend. The Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre has admitted at least 580 birds injured by kite strings during the same period.The Delhi Police said that they have been conducting raids at popular markets to book kite sellers who sell banned varieties of kite strings. Last week, ahead of Independence Day when the sale of kites was at its peak, the police raided over 50 shops in areas such as Chawri Bazar, Chandni Chowk, Lal Kuan and Chand Mohalla, and booked around 15 sellers. A Delhi Police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that the sellers were booked under Section five of the Environment Protection Act (1986), which gives the government the power to issue directions and orders for the protection of environmental interests.Experts said that the reason behind such cases is the rampant and unchecked sale of Chinese manjha, which is made of plastic and nylon, and Bareilly ka manjha, which is coated with crushed glass or metal. The Supreme Court, in November 2017, had refused to lift the ban on these types of kite strings brought into effect by the National Green Tribunal in 2016. The Delhi government had also given a separate order for a ban in 2017. “These kite strings are not only fatal for birds and animals but have also caused serious injuries to human beings. After many such incidents in 2017, the Delhi government banned the sale of both Chinese and Bareilly ka manjha. But they are still openly sold at local markets and, every year before the Independence Day, innocent birds become victims,” Sujata Singh, an animal rights activist, said.Explaining the injuries caused to birds by these dangerous varieties of kite strings, Singh said that most birds’ wings are damaged. Though there may not be immediate repercussions, if birds continue to fly, the injuries worsen and get infected.“The Chinese manjha and the Bareilly ka manjha are popular among people because they make it easier to cut an opponent’s kite easily. It is the sharpness of these strings that causes grievous injuries,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/over-1-500-birds-injured-by-kite-strings-in-the-last-fortnight/story-V8tGPeq5xOPOYwE20pjJTJ.html

Thane civic body officials appealed to citizens to maintain social distancing. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had issued an order on Thursday for shops to remain open while maintaining social distancing. The shop owners were asked to ensure everyone wore masks and adhered to social distancing norms. “We kept sanitisers at the entrance of our shops and not more than two customers were allowed at a time. We did markings to ensure social distancing norms were followed,” said Rasik Chedda, chairman, Ram Maruti Road Shopkeepers Association.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC said, “We had our officers patrolling at regular intervals to make sure all lockdown rules were followed. We also made regular announcements at popular shopping areas like Naupada and Manpada junction to wear masks and maintain social distance.” R Somavanshi, senior police inspector, Thane Nagar police station, said, “The lanes are narrow; hence it may seem crowded, however, we did not observe any violation of social distancing norms on Saturday.” Neeta Gaikwad, 52, a resident of Naupada, said, “The weekend and holiday made it an apt time to step out on Saturday. The roads were crowded than usual, but everyone maintained social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-shops-open-thane-residents-crowd-markets-tmc-monitors/story-tmQ0VWJ3bwTSeyrknXS6JJ.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal exhorts people to donate oximeters for villages||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday appealed to the public, members of the civil society and party workers across the nation to donate pulse oximeters to the AAP so it can set up ‘oxygen testing centres’ in rural India to reduce the number of Covid-19 deaths. Digitally addressing AAP volunteers across the nation, Kejriwal said the Covid-19 situation of Delhi is under control, but the situation in other parts of the country, especially villages, is still bad. Sunday being Kejriwal’s birthday, the chief minister appealed to AAP supporters to donate oximeters instead of sending him gifts. He also said AAP volunteers will be trained to check oxygen saturation levels in Covid-19 patients in these villages. “I want to appeal to all the AAP volunteers, supporters, donors, and well-wishers of the country to help us. We are planning to distribute responsibilities among our volunteers of providing oximeters in villages. This is a private effort. The person responsible for oximeters in a village will send them to the houses of the people in need, and they can test their oxygen level. They can then get admitted to a nearby hospital if the Covid testing centre is at a distance,” Kejriwal said.The AAP chief said he was concerned that over 60,000 fresh cases and around 800-1,000 deaths are being recorded in the country every day. “I would not say that we have won the battle against Covid-19 in Delhi, but we are in a much better position today, compared to two months ago, which has reduced the fear among people. We have taken several measures—we created plasma banks, introduced home isolation, increased testing, and beds in Delhi. But the number of cases are steadily rising in the entire country,” he said. “Every government, be it State or Centre, is addressing the situation in different ways. Now that Covid-19 is spreading in villages, it is a great matter of worry because, in the last 70 years, we have not been able to provide good healthcare facilities in our villages. It is easier to find doctors and hospitals in cities, but if Covid-19 spreads in villages, it will prove worrisome,” he said.Kejriwal said that after launching home isolation in Delhi, his government learned a lot of lessons. “For example, of 10,000 cases, only 1,000 cases were serious (on an average) and we treated the remaining 9,000 cases at home. If we had admitted all the 10,000 cases to the hospital, we would have required 10,000 beds which were not available,” he said. Along these lines, the AAP chief also suggested a three-step strategy that can be implemented in villages. “By implementing home isolation, asymptomatic people or people with mild symptoms will be treated at home. Second, if the village panchayat sends oximeters or oxygen cylinders to people’s houses, they can be saved if their oxygen levels fall,” Kejriwal said.The AAP chief continued that the biggest problem with Covid-19 was the reduced oxygen levels, which result in the loss of life. He urged the public to donate as many oximeters as they could to the AAP so it could distribute them in villages. “We will also set up oxygen testing centres in villages. We will train people on all precautions to take. We will explain how to wear a mask, sanitisation and other steps. First, if you want to donate oximeters to the Aam Aadmi Party, please contact us. And second, if you want to take the responsibility of your village, please let us know. All the state coordinators, district coordinators, please open as many oxygen testing centres in your villages as possible and try to save as many lives as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-exhorts-people-to-donate-oximeters-for-villages/story-lScKDSfSnPhGwKMAFj491I.html
15-08-2020||City||I-Day celebrations go online in Delhi colleges and universities||New DelhiUniversities and colleges in Delhi organised virtual events to mark the 74th year of independence even though the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory social distancing norms limited the celebrations.Institutes such as Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi University, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi held small-scale flag-hoisting ceremonies on the campus. Delhi University colleges such as Delhi College of Arts and Commerce (DCAC) conducted virtual events to celebrate Independence Day.Anuradha Gupta, DCAC principal, said, “The flag-hoisting ceremony happened through web application and the national anthem was played online. We commemorated the sacrifices of freedom fighters and lesser-known scientists and entrepreneurs. Students recited poems and we screened a short film on nation-builders. We brought forward educationists, teachers and students on the platform. Discussions ranged from the National Education Policy to Atma Nirbhar Bharat and the need to be self-reliant.”Jamia organised a virtual poetry symposium on Friday evening. “Teachers and officers working in different departments of the university recited poems in six languages, including Sanskit, Persian, Hindi and English,” said media coordinator Ahmad Azeem.The JNU unit of the National Service Scheme conducted an online competition. “Generally, we have cultural performances but that was not possible due to the pandemic. So we have a contest inviting video submissions from across the country on people who have been social change makers. The videos will be uploaded on our social media platforms and the ones with most views and likes will be awarded on August 20,” said Abhivyakti Vivek, a postgraduate student and the NSS convener at JNU.The Delhi University Students’ Union organised virtual Independence Day celebrations throughout the week.

15-08-2020||Delhi||Happiness curriculum improved students’ outlook: Think tank||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said that the happiness curriculum had led to an improvement in students’ outlook, according to a recent report published by a global think tank. “A study by the global think tank Brookings Institution has found that the Happiness Curriculum launched in Delhi’s government schools led to positive improvements among our children. The Delhi education model continues to make all Indians very proud,” Kejriwal said. On Saturday, global think tank Brookings Institution released insights from its report on the happiness curriculum—the Delhi government’s flagship programme implemented in over 1,030 government schools. “The happiness curriculum has already shown an improvement in relationships both in and outside of classrooms in Delhi schools. Students are more reflective about small arguments with their peers, and more insightful in understanding home dynamics. We are excited to see what other changes will take place in the long term and how it may inform policies nationally and internationally,” the think tank stated in the summary of the report published on its website. The report—Development of student and teacher measures of happiness curriculum factors—also stated that students initially found the curriculum “very different from their traditional classroom experiences” and the Happiness Classes provided them “with opportunities for interesting activities and discussions.” Launched in 2018, the happiness curriculum is taught from nursery to Class 8. The classes include activities like meditation, street plays, story-telling sessions and other interactive exercises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/happiness-curriculum-improved-students-outlook-think-tank/story-I52P6c9IFRbvSE3dITeLdN.html

The move is aimed at strengthening police and people interactions and controlling crime.Besides, police personnel have also been equipped with tablets and smartphones to do people-centric works online, senior officials said. Alok Singh, GB Nagar police commissioner, said that beat policing makes a strong local network and helps in checking crime. “The police department has also distributed 292 tablets/mobile phones to the police personnel, including beat constables. They will visit their areas and make strong network. These cops will be connected through Prahri mobile app developed by the UP Police,” he said. “Also, senior police officials will supervise their junior colleagues. The technology-led policing will facilitate works like tenant verification, domestic help verification, character certification, etc, which will be done online,” Singh said. The police commissioner further said that the local people can download a mobile app – UP COP – through which they can file online complaint, get information about their police station, senior citizen’s registration, cyber awareness, etc. The UP Police had launched the new -- UP Cop -- in June last year for better policing in the state. “People can fill the application form online. The police will deliver the certificates online after verification,” he said. The police commissioner said that the new experiment will immensely help people in getting better services and also maintaining social distance at the same time. In January this year, the district police had launched the beat policing in Bisrakh police station area. In beat policing, police personnel are deployed in their respective areas for a specific time period each day to meet residents in that particular area and cultivate sources and strengthen the policing network. They also meet local people, shopkeepers, and others and gather inputs. The police can act swiftly on the basis of inputs and pre-empt crime. The Noida Police Commissioner also inaugurated a police check post in ACE City in Bisrakh. The Uttar Pradesh government in January approved the commissionerate system of policing in Noida, which aims at giving more powers to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/beat-policing-starts-in-gb-nagar-cops-equipped-with-electronic-gadgets/story-f95hLlu2DWcVyZFyjlHZCI.html

Of them, 345 patients, or about 55.73%, have been declared cured and discharged from isolation. Not only that, inspired by the success in curing the home isolated patients, teams of doctors from other neighbouring districts have also started visiting Gautam Budh Nagar district to learn the model. According to the daily state Covid-19 bulletin, of the 867 active cases (till Saturday) in Gautam Budh Nagar district, 274 are in home isolation, which is 31.60% of the total active cases. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said taking cognizance of the success of the district’s successful model of home isolation, teams of doctors from other districts have also started visiting the district to learn their ways. “Recently, doctors from Baghpat and Bulandshahr districts visited our district. They visited our facilities as well as the integrated control room to understand our model of evaluating the fitness criteria of asymptomatic patients put on home isolation. Many other districts have also expressed their desire to visit us to learn its model,” he said. The district’s additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Lalit Kumar, who is also the nodal officer of the home isolation, said it is mandatory for all asymptomatic positive patients to report to L1 centres. “Our team of expert doctors thoroughly evaluate their fitness for home isolation at these centres. Once found fit for home isolation, the patients are asked to fill a Google form, listing all their personal details and health status along with their medical history. Then, the patients sign an undertaking and our doctors issue them the home fitness certificate. After completing this procedure, the patients are allowed to go on home isolation. If they remain asymptomatic, they are discharged from home isolation after 10 days,” he said. Dr Kumar further said a detailed database is prepared for all patients and a team of doctors, paramedics and teachers monitor these patients round the clock. “Our trained operators make audio and video calls to all these patients at least three times a day, to know their complaints, oxygen saturation levels, temperature and other details. In case the patient develops any symptom or if the oxygen level drops, then (s)he is assisted by the integrated call centre for hospital admission as two dedicated ambulances remain ready 24X7 for such patients. Till the date, five home isolated patients have been transferred to the Covid-dedicated facilities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-55-of-gb-nagar-s-home-isolated-patients-cured-of-covid-19/story-kDC2mwi7BkEtby0Edk68gK.html
15-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad gets its own lab, to ramp up RT-PCR testing||Ghaziabad Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the district on Saturday got its own laboratory for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at the MMG District Hospital. The new laboratory will help increase number of RT-PCR tests and reduce time in getting test results, officials from the health department said.According to the officials, the RT-PCR lab has a maximum limit of conducting about 700 tests per day and reports can be received on the same day. Until now, samples were being sent for RT-PCR testing to different laboratories in Delhi, Noida and Meerut, they said. “We were getting RT-PCR test reports in two-three days from the neighbouring districts. Now, our new laboratory will be able to give results within a day,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Apart from the Covid-19 tests, we will be able to conduct tests for other diseases once the Covid situation declines,” he said. Till August 14, the district took up 149,961 samples, out of which test reports of 147,358 were received. The total number of testing includes 84,533 tests (about 56%) conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits, according to the official data.The Ghaziabad district at present is conducting about 3,000 Covid-19 tests per day. “As we have planned to increase RT-PCR tests in high incidence areas, the new laboratory will be very helpful. For the false negatives in rapid antigen tests, we have started conducting subsequent RT-PCR tests for symptomatic cases, and also for all (symptomatic and asymptomatic) patients with co-morbidities. Now, we are expecting that test positivity rate will also increase in comparison of the rapid antigen testing,” Dr Gupta added. Currently, the overall test positivity rate of the district is about 4.28%, according to the official figures. The 84,533 tests conducted with the help of rapid kits have yielded 2,114 positive results with a positivity rate of about 2.5%, while the 62,825 RT-PCR tests found 4,195 positive cases till August 14, with a test positivity rate of about 6.67%. According to experts, the RT-PCR tests have high sensitivity and can detect even minutest traces of dead viruses in the samples. “Since the RT-PCR test has more sensitivity, increase in number of testing will help us find more positive cases. This will help in better detection of suspected cases. On the other hand, the rapid kits have low positivity but their higher use will bring down the overall test positivity rate,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. The UP government on July 1 had given its nod for a new RT-PCR laboratory for the Ghaziabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-gets-its-own-lab-to-ramp-up-rt-pcr-testing/story-3X4llqDOxOiOv97k6UMKaL.html

According to the police, prime suspect Dinesh Kumar worked as a collection agent at Loha Mandi and had gone to Meerut on August 13 to collect a payment of ₹23.78 lakh on behalf of his employer, Vikas Jain. However, his mobile phone went switched off around 7pm on August 13. “When Kumar failed to return home, his wife approached the police with a complaint and a case was lodged under IPC Section 365 (kidnapping). Investigations were underway when Kumar turned up at the police station on the evening of August 14 and told the police that he was robbed. Upon detailed questioning, he broke down and told them that he had planned to steal the money in order to pay his debts to different people,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad. According to police, Kumar had allegedly planned to fake the robbery along with his brother-in-law Pappu Singh, a resident of Aligarh. The officers said while returning from Meerut, Kumar went to Singh’s house in Aligarh and stashed the cash there. “Then he approached the Vijay Nagar police on Friday evening and told them that some men had robbed him of the cash and dumped him near Dasna. However, on the basis of questioning and electronic surveillance, police realised that Kumar’s story was false. Later, he broke down and told them that he had planned to steal the money,” said an officer from Vijay Nagar police station. Based on Kumar’s employer Vikas Jain’s complaint, Kumar and SIngh were arrested and booked for criminal breach of trust and cheating. The police said the two spent about ₹24,000 from the stolen amount while the rest of ₹23.54 lakh was recovered from Singh’s house in Aligarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/employee-makes-up-robbery-story-to-steal-23-78-lakh-arrested-along-with-brother-in-law/story-wDfh8G43jLgt87W72zbHMO.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Uniform, stationary sales plummet as schools remain shut||Santacruz-based uniform manufacturer Mahesh Parmar is faced with a dilemma – he has thousands of school uniforms stocked in his godown and shops, but barely any customers so far. In November 2019, Parmar had started planning for the upcoming academic year (2020-21). With thousands of pre-orders lined up, he hoped to begin selling uniforms from April, as most schools reopen either in April or June. However, with the growing cases of Covid-19 in the city and the resultant lockdown, Parmar was unable to sell most of the uniforms this year.“I have been in this industry since 1983, but we have never seen such bad days. Our entire business requires investment from our own pockets first, which is later recovered when the uniforms are sold once schools begin. But since schools haven’t reopened physically yet, almost all of our business has gone down the drain. Our stocks are lying in godowns or shops, unsold,” said Parmar, owner of Arsey Uniforms.As schools in Maharashtra remain closed for nearly five months, connected businesses are witnessing challenging times. These businesses include uniform vendors, book distributors, stationery shop owners, and school bus operators.While many schools under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) boards began their new academic year virtually in April, schools under the state board reopened online in June. The initial few months, however, have gone into figuring the new teaching-learning medium, as a result of which most students are yet to buy school essentials.“There are multiple issues which have led to low business. The lockdown and resultant restrictions meant shopkeepers could not sell their products. But even after they reopened, demand had fallen as most parents chose to make do with existing stationery and notebooks. As far as textbooks are concerned, students have access to PDF copies, which they often use for online learning, thus leading to a dip in demand for physical copies,” said Narendra Nandu, president of the Bombay Booksellers’ and Publishers’ Association. As several parents are already facing financial challenges, buying school essentials is not their top priority.“We bought a few textbooks and are using leftover notebooks from the last year. This year, we did not buy new uniforms because the school has not made it mandatory to wear them for online classes,” said Sanika Jain, a Borivli based parent. At Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle, students are required to attend online classes wearing their uniforms. “It is not mandatory for parents to buy a new set. They can use the old ones if they wish to. If they want to buy a new one, we have facilitated it,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal.Uday Nare, teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School, said students can wear what they like as long as the clothes are not too informal. “We have just asked them to wear decent clothes. There is no compulsion to wear a uniform,” he said.Early this month, the School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) also urged the state government to provide a relief package, claiming that more than 50,000 school buses and around 1.5 lakh bus staffers were in financial distress.“It’s a bleak situation, with transport fees not coming in. In the absence of business, staff associated with buses cannot be retained,” said Anil Garg, president, SBOA, in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uniform-stationary-sales-plummet-as-schools-remain-shut/story-ZQQzhRr0QoC4MxLLoqXLVP.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Let JEE, NEET be held in September: Students from Maharashtra, Gujarat in Apex court||A week after undergraduate (UG) medical and engineering students from 11 states across the country filed a petition in the Supreme Court (SC) seeking the postponement of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), students from Maharashtra and Gujarat have filed an intervention in the matter.The intervention requests the court to allow the two national-level entrance exams for professional courses to be held as per schedule in September. It further states that any further delay in conducting these entrance tests will cause more anxiety among students who have been studying and preparing for the exams from the past two years at least. Advocate Shrirang Choudhary, the briefing lawyer for students from the state, who have intervened in the matter at SC, said, “The state of Maharashtra has already postponed MPSC (Maharashtra Public Service Commission) exams which had been scheduled for September 13 in order to avoid any clash with the NEET exams. Postponing the NEET exam would be detrimental to the interest of lakhs of students who are placed in a similar situation with that of the present applicants. Lakhs of students have invested more than two years of their efforts and time in preparation. The applicantshas faced uncertainty for more than three months before the NEET exam schedule was announced. Any further postponement of the exam would result in further agony.”Around 16 lakh students have registered for NEET-UG this year, while close to 9.3 lakh students had registered for JEE-Mains (Paper I) that was conducted in January. An equal number of students were expected to appear for the second phase of the exam, which are scheduled for April-May each year. This year however, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the National Testing Agency (NTA) kept postponing the exam dates. In NTA’s latest circular, both the exams have been scheduled to take place for September. While several students and parents around the country have shared their concerns over conducting exams for lakhs of students across the country even as the Covid-19 cases are on a rise, an equal number of parents of students are also hoping that the exams are held as per the schedule so that the delay in the postponement of exams comes to an end. “Medical admissions are time bound, and therefore, it makes no sense to further delay NEET, which will eventually delay the admissions process as well. Leaving an entire batch of medical seats vacant will be unfair because next year, the intake capacity of medical institutes will remain the same but the applicants will double in number, which will lead to more chaos,” said activist Sudha Shenoy, who is the parent of an aspirant. She added that students should be given the option to either appear for the exam in the month of September or give the entrance exam and take admissions for the next academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/let-jee-neet-be-held-in-september-students-from-maharashtra-gujarat-in-apex-court/story-hyFeZ1KP6qS6fEwj824yvI.html
15-08-2020||Noida||Health dept introduces SOPs for effective surveillance in containment zones||The health department on Saturday brought out a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for teams taking up surveillance activities across 327 containment zones in the district. Officials said the idea behind introducing SOPs for containment zones was to make surveillance more effective as several symptomatic patients in recent times have escaped the surveillance cover in recent times. Officials said one of the vital aspects of the SOPs is to involve the local police in case people do not cooperate with the teams conducting door-to-door surveys. At present, surveillance activities are being taken up by 862 teams in the district who visit the containment areas to trace suspected patients, such as people suffering from influenza-like illnesses, those having symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and people having co-morbid conditions. “People often refuse to cooperate with the teams and do not pass on the correct information. This leads to suspected cases slipping out of the surveillance cover. Now, as part of the SOPs, our teams have been asked to make inquiries from the nearby households or influential local people about suspected cases if they refuse to cooperate,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO). “In case the teams find any suspicious information, they have been asked to pass it on to the local police. Every suspected case can turn out to be a potential Covid-19 case. Further, there is also a possibility that suspected patients might develop severe health complications later. As such, involving the local police will strengthen our surveillance mechanism,” he added. Out of the 862 teams, comprising of two members each, specified teams are sent to the containment zones once the cases are reported. After a special drive was conducted between July 2 to July 12 on the directions of the UP government, the containment activities were beefed up after July 13. According to official records, about 5,860 teams have been deployed so far who have taken up surveys of 4,76,559 houses, covering a population of 18,89,405. They have detected 500 symptomatic cases so far. Out of them, 451 have been tested. A total of 53 persons have turned out to be positive, while test results are awaited for the rest. “As part of the SOPs, each team has been given a written set of instructions about the question they will ask during household visits. For people in home isolation, they teams will check if the sticker pasted on the house is intact or not. Apart from general inquiry of the immediate neighbours, the teams will also inquire from other locals about the patients in home isolation,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, nodal officer (Covid), state health department. According to official records, till August 15 about 563 symptomatic patients have been allowed permission for home isolation and 306 of these have already completed a period of 10 days. At present, the district has 1,026 Covid positive patients, of whom 257 patients are in home isolation. A total of 25 persons in home isolation so far have been warned for not following home isolation rules.“Under the new rules, the surveillance teams can also approach registered and unregistered clinics in residential areas to find out the names of the patients who have come to these clinics complaining of symptoms. They have also been asked to approach local chemist shops to find out who all are buying medicines related to cough, cold or fever, etc. The idea is that no suspected case should be left out of the surveillance cover,” Dr Gupta added. Recently, several cases were reported in which patients who could not be traced by surveillance teams developed complications later on. For instance,a 37-year-old man who was running high fever was admitted to an L3 hospital in the district but succumbed to his medical conditions on August 9 after five days of treatment. In another case, a 30-year-old woman, who was having health complications for about 10 days, had come to district women hospital after having delivered at her home. She died on night of August 10 after she was referred to a hospital in Meerut, where she tested positive for Covid-19. Both the cases went undetected by teams of the health department carrying out surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-dept-introduces-sops-for-effective-surveillance-in-containment-zones/story-1srhvtkTj1JdADlMzE9ZZI.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||To save cash, SDMC may rent community halls to private firms||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation will rent out more than a fourth of its community halls, as part of a series of moves to reel in its expenses and generate more revenue. Under the plan, approved by the civic body’s standing committee on Tuesday, halls that saw few or no bookings will be outsourced to private agencies. However, corporation officials said the halls can only be turned into select facilities, such as coaching centres, banks, ATMs, among others.SDMC officials said the civic body was spending more money on maintaining these properties than the income generated. The civic body manages around 95 community halls with a total expenditure of around ₹5 crore to ₹6 crore. While the civic body has not fixed a timeframe for the plan, it will depend on when the SDMC House rubber stamps the move. However, officials said it may take a few months before it is finally implemented. “As per our assessments, nearly 25 of the 95 have seen very few bookings, and we are losing money on them. So we have decided to outsource these facilities to private companies for different type of activities such as installation of mobile towers on rooftop, opening of coaching centres, banks and ATMs among others. This will bridge the revenue deficit,” a senior SDMC official said. Officials in the north and east civic bodies said they had no such plans for their community halls. The SDMC has put in motion a slew of plans to replenish its coffers. Earlier, it passed a proposal to levy a professional tax on self-employed persons — a first for Delhi, and doubled the tax on rented commercial property. It also increased de-sealing fees for big businesses. The official added that the civic body undergoing losses after the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. The official, however, did not specify the amount.Another SDMC official said booking charges depend on their location. Halls have been divided into categories A, B,C, D and E, based on the area. The booking charges for an event for a category A community hall is ₹42,500 (for areas such as Greater Kailash and Defence Colony), while the cost is ₹27,000 for a category B hall, ₹22,000 for a category C hall, ₹13,000 for D category halls, and ₹8,500 for E category halls. Raj Dutt Gahlot, the SDMC’s standing committee chairman, said some community halls saw fewer bookings due to their locations, as well as residents’ preference for banquet halls and lawns for weddings and other such events. “Outsourcing will be started on pilot basis with only four community halls — at Meharchand Market, Katwaria Sarai, Gaushala Road in Najafgarh and A-Block Hastsal in Uttam Nagar. Other such halls would be added after witnessing the response of the pilot project. These community halls will be outsourced for the maximum period of five year on one contract. After ending of the lease, fresh tendering will be done for the purpose,” he said. Atul Goel, president United Residents Joint Action (URJA) — an umbrella body of RWAs across the city — accepted that SDMC needed to find alternative sources of revenue, but said it should not affect the social utility of such facilities. “There is no problem in outsourcing such community halls, but the weekly meetings of the RWAs, which take place at community halls, should not be affected. The low usage is mainly because facilities are not good at community halls as compared to banquet halls. The civic body should improve facilities and maintenance there and make them more affordable,” he said. KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MCD hailed the idea. “The civic bodies’ finances are in a poor state, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. This move will bring more revenue to the corporation. There is no harm, and there is a need to evolve and make the best use of the resources to generate more revenue.” Gahlot said the proposal will be placed in the body’s House meeting for a final approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-save-cash-sdmc-may-rent-community-halls-to-private-firms/story-quwxdEDUcbT38N1n4ZXRLP.html
15-08-2020||City||Thane’s recovery rate 89%; doubling rate up to 90 days||In the past month, the Covid-19 situation in Thane city has seen a marked improvement. The city, which had a doubling rate of 24 days in July, now has a doubling rate of 90 days. The recovery rate has also increased to 89%, which the Thane civic commissioner claimed is the highest in Thane district.The number of new cases has decreased over the past week. Among the 22,934 positive cases within Thane city, 20,299 have recovered so far. There have been 729 Covid deaths so far, and currently, there are 1,906 active cases in Thane city.According to statistics provided by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), around mid-July, Thane city saw a spike in positive cases with 400-417 new cases reported daily. However, within a month, the figures have halved to 200 to 250 cases daily in the past week. The citywide lockdown implemented from July 2 to 19 helped to bring down the number of positive cases.Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “At 89% recovery rate, we are the highest within Thane district. This has been possible due to a specific discharge protocol set up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which we follow apart from other measures. As per the discharge protocol, we ensure that every patient is monitored for 15 days after being discharged. Moreover, we ensure that there are no symptomatic patients at home before we discharge the recovered ones.” Vishwanath Kelkar, civic health officer, said, “We have a protocol wherein each positive case is contacted within 15 minutes of the test report, and the contact tracing process begins immediately.”The ‘Test, Track, Trace, Treat and Isolate’ protocol is executed by over 600 individuals working on the ground level. “We have around 150 teams only for conducting containment screenings and surveillance. The results are updated in real-time. To date, we have screened over 16 lakh residents of Thane. We have another team of 150 who are focused on testing; this includes identifying those who require testing, getting them tested, and based on the results, assigning them to home or institutional quarantine, or moving them to a Covid treatment centre,” said Sharma. Another team of 150 goes door-to-door to check on those who are quarantining at home. Based on their situation, Covid staff suggests medical care or further assistance. A 150-member team is on tele-calling systems to keep a check on those in home quarantine as well as the recovered patients.“These are methods to ensure no one is left out, and any critical patient is identified immediately,” said Sharma.These teams include staff from Thane Municipal Transport (TMT), various government departments, contractual staff from TMC, teachers, volunteers from social organisations and members of political parties. Fewer cases in slums, high-rises a concernThe doubling rate in Ghodbunder area, which houses some upscale residential complexes, is now 30 days, though the civic body is still concerned about the case count. The corporation claimed that since the lockdown was eased, cases have increased in high-rises, as opposed to slums.“Soon after the unlock mission was announced in June, those in high-rises started stepping out. This led to an increase in the number of cases. As exposure began at a later stage, the spread of infection increased in these areas. With the help of our survey and efforts based on the Dharavi model, we managed to bring down the cases in high-rises as well,” said Sharma.As of now, Naupada and Kopri ward have the highest number of cases but Majiwada-Manpada ward witnessed a spike in cases in the first week of August. Anuradha Babar, assistant commissioner, TMC, said, “Initially, we focused on institutional quarantine of positive cases and high-risk contacts from slums. We are following the same plan in high-rises now.” More vacant beds at Covid centresWith fewer positive cases reported and only 1,900 active cases within the TMC jurisdiction, 1,083 normal and 134 ICU beds are vacant. The dedicated Covid facilities are now being opened up for other municipal corporations. Around 20% occupancy of the Thane civic body’s Covid beds is from neighbouring areas now.This has not stopped the civic body from increasing its bed capacity. In the past week, 150 ICU beds were added at Global Hospital and 10 beds with ventilators have been included across Thane city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-s-recovery-rate-89-doubling-rate-up-to-90-days/story-5ocD5ittp0hyaIXRu61ozO.html

The Bulandhsahr police, however, have not made any official confirmation about the detentions. Jitendra Bhati, Sudeeksha’s father, said he received a call on Saturday afternoon from the Bulandshahr police saying they have detained some suspects in connection to his daughter’s death. “Sudeeksha’s cousin has gone to Bulandshahr along with some villagers to identify the suspects. We do not know more about the suspects, and just hope they are the same persons who killed our daughter,” Jitendra said. Diksha Singh, circle officer, Bulandshahr, said the police have verified the details of over 350 Royal Enfield motorcycles registered in the neighbourhood of the accident site and questioned their owners. “We have questioned some suspects and got some leads. We can’t comment on detention or arrest at this stage,” said Singh who is heading the investigating team probing the accident. Sudeeksha, 19, a class 12 topper in Bulandshahr, was pursuing a graduate degree in the United States. She died in a road accident on August 10 when she was going to her maternal uncle’s place on a motorcycle. Her family had alleged that two motorcycle riders were chasing her on before the incident took place.Bulandshahr police registered a case of rash driving and death due to negligence in this case and the charge of harassment was not pressed in the FIR.

15-08-2020||Mumbai||Rain pushes up lake levels to 71%; Mumbai civic corporation to review water cut decision||Good rainfall in catchment areas that supply water to Mumbai has resulted in resulting water levels going up to 71% on Saturday. Two days ago, the water level of the seven lakes that supply drinking water to Mumbai was at 60% of total capacity. According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the seven lakes have 10.37 lakh million litres of water at present, which is 71.72% of their total capacity of 14.47 lakh million litres. The overall lake level for the corresponding period in 2019 was 93.15 % and 89.42% in 2018. Bhatsa dam, which caters to 55% of the city’s total water requirement, is at 70.93% of total capacity, compared to 91.60% at this time in 2019. BMC supplies 3,750 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. Aside from Tulsi and Vihar lakes, which are located within Mumbai’s limits, the other catchment areas of lakes and dams are in neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. Tulsi and Vihar lakes have already overflown. On Sunday, the water level at the lakes crossed 50%. The levels have doubled over the past 20 days. On August 6, the levels stood at 37%.

Police said the two were caught as they were going to board a train to Amritsar, adding that the two men were using the fake ID cards to get free rides inside trains. Police identified the two as Martand Rubab Kamble, 21, from Sangli in Maharashtra and his associate as Omkar Bairagi Waghmode, 20, from Raigarh, Maharashtra.Deputy commissioner of police (railways) Harendra Kumar said the security at the railway stations in capital had been tightened because of Independence Day. “Tickets and IDs of passengers were being checked at main hall entry gate of Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station. Our staff spotted two suspicious men who were stopped for checking. When asked for their identity cards, the duo introduced themselves as railway staff and said they have to board Golden Temple Express train,” Kumar said.The DCP said, the policemen posted at the entry gate, however, found the two men suspicious. “The two men were asked to produce their government ID cards and when their ID cards were minutely examined it was found to be fake,” he said.During interrogation, the DCP said, Martand Rubab said he used to earlier work with a railway vendor in a cyber cafe. “He was aware of the railway operations and how he could disguise as railway employee and travel far of destinations. He then made a fake railway employee ID and started travelling for free. The two then sold items inside the train. He then also roped in his cousin Omkar and using fake IDs started travelling in trains. We are probing of they used their identity cards for any other illegal activities,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-held-for-forging-railway-id-cards-taking-free-rides/story-hwafUzbjKSWhtTXihP6hiM.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||DU takes ‘strong exception’ to graft allegations, govt stands its ground||The Delhi government on Saturday reiterated its stand that it had received from parents and students complaints of financial irregularities in 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges funded by the state.The government’s remark, the second time in over a week, came a day after DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said in a statement late Friday night said the university had taken “strong exception” to allegations of graft levelled against the 12 colleges.Last week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said the “inability of the Delhi government-funded DU colleges to pay salaries to staff despite a 70% increase in budget allocation in the last five years indicated corruption”. He said around 23% of the funds allocated for 2020-21 had been released.Reiterating the charges, the government said on Saturday, “Why has DU not paid staff salaries for the last three months is a matter that raises doubts… the people of Delhi have the right to know where the money released by the Delhi government went.”The government said it had ordered a financial audit of seven government-funded colleges, of which six are fully aided while one gets partial funds. “For a long time, many parents and students of these colleges have been complaining about financial irregularities,” the government said in the statement. “If Delhi University feels that there is no financial mess, then there is no need to fear; the truth will come out in the audit.” On Friday, Pani said that annually, three types of annual audits are conducted—an internal audit (by auditors from an approved DU panel), an ELFA audit (by Delhi government) and an AGCR audit (by CAG) -- in each college and all reports so far reflect that the financial affairs had been managed according to existing norms.Pani said there had been an 80-100% increase in salary expenses over the past five years due to many factors, including an increase in the pay of contractual non-teaching staff and ad hoc faculty, implementing the seventh pay commission and EWS quota, annual increments, increase in dearness allowance as well the addition of new courses.The university also said that inflation, and an increase in water, electricity, sanitation and security bills of four colleges that shifted to new campuses had led to a 300-500% increase in non-salary expenditure.“The governing bodies of all 12 colleges have been formed as per DU rules and regulations. According to DU rules, there is no link between the formation of governing bodies and the release of grant-in-aid,” Pani said, appealing to the government to release funds and “end the suffering of the staff of these colleges.”Last week, HT had reported that while some of the 12 colleges had paid salaries to their teaching staff for May by diverting funds from other accounts, a majority of them were yet to be paid for the last three months.The DU administration and Delhi government have been at loggerheads over the formation of governing bodies in government-funded colleges for over a year now. The 10-member governing bodies comprise people nominated by both the university and the government and take decisions such as the appointment of staff members.On March 13 this year, DU’s executive council recommended sending the names of six Delhi government nominees back to the state government for reconsideration. A week later, the government said these six names were to remain on the list. On May 13, the university forwarded a list of nominees to colleges, except for the six names in contention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-takes-strong-exception-to-graft-allegations-govt-stands-its-ground/story-jjbXaHV2hVEqRzY3ndjHoK.html

We will also file an affidavit. We stand by the marking system,” said a senior official from the institute. On Thursday, the HC stayed admissions to Masters courses at the institute after a group of aspiring candidates filed a petition claiming discrepancies in scores. In July, after the first list of selected candidates was announced, several candidates pointed out that the weightage of their scores in the National Entrance Test (NET) and the personal interview were miscalculated. The administration has maintained that there was no discrepancies in the marking of selected candidates except for three courses - Masters of Arts in applied psychology (with specialisation in clinical and counselling practice), media and cultural studies, and library and information science in Mumbai. HT had reported on July 26 that the institute added a few seats to these three courses to accommodate candidates whose scores in the evaluation process was miscalculated and rectified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-to-file-an-affidavit-reaffirming-no-discrepancies-in-scoring-pattern/story-5wmiBb39lmnCpGTrm23AlL.html

15-08-2020||Mumbai||60 ONGC workers from single platform test positive; 31 infected earlier||As many as 60 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) employees from a single platform at Bombay High have tested positive for Covid-19. Sources said the infected employees were being brought back to Mumbai and the management was contemplating closing the platform due to a large number of infected workers. However, ONGC has denied shutting down any platforms on the oil rig. ONGC said that it has been maintaining a stringent Covid-19 compliance operation system. “Recently some employees of two offshore platforms (BHS and Neelam) have been found Covid positive, even though they have passed through a very stringent system of crew changeover procedure for over a month back when they had gone to the respective platforms,” read a statement issued from ONGC.However, a source informed that atleast 60 workers were tested positive from BHS platform alone apart from Bedlam platform.Additionally, 31 of the ONGC workers had tested positive for Covid-19, last week. Most of them belonged to Neelam Complex offshore platform and were admitted to a Mahim-based hospital. A senior ONGC official said that during the lockdown, ONGC had picked up its crew from their vehicles up to the designated exclusive hotel near the hub-airports (in their respective cities) where they stayed in separate rooms before they flew to Mumbai. ONGC flew their employees and contractual staff travelled by special chartered aircraft were arranged for bringing the crew to Mumbai. “After arriving in Mumbai, these crews were put in exclusive hotels in isolation. After five days of stay, their Covid-19 samples were collected by authorized labs and only after ensuring Covid negative results, they were again transported to Juhu helibase and were then flown to offshore installations. Similar actions are also being taken for the secondary workforce and contractual staff. This practice of crew change has been continued since then,” said an ONGC official.The company’s spokesperson said, “It is pertinent to mention that due to the nature of the job and limited space on offshore installations, proximity is imperative in oil field operations. Despite that, because of adhering to stringent standard operating procedures, we have been successful in keeping our almost entire operation unaffected by the pandemic. However, some cases have surfaced in recent times. Particularly, the prevalent asymptomatic cases have made the situation more challenging. Some cases have surfaced after more than a month of crew joining the duties at installations. Therefore, it is very difficult to trace the origin of such infections”The crude oil and gas corporation, however, denied shutting down its operation at any of the affected platforms and emphasized that the infected workers were both permanent and contractual. The spokesperson said that effective crew management is being done to ensure the safety of employees and the workforce who tested positive have been brought to the base and are being provided with required medical care and treatment.A plastic sheet has been recently placed to mark partition between the cockpit and the passenger area in helicopters that have been ferrying the Covid-19 positive patients. However, few pilots have raised concerns over their health. A retired helicopter pilot said, “A helicopter is not designed like an aircraft to have no contact with any passenger. Hence pilots worrying for themselves while flying the infected is justified. However, the use of PPE surely helps reduce the stress of being infected by Covid-19”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/60-ongc-workers-from-single-platform-test-positive-31-infected-earlier/story-LxaMEZt2HHM6GBXDtKNkQK.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||HC grants bail to 18-year-old booked for raping friend||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday granted bail to an 18-year-old, who was arrested for raping his girlfriend, after observing that the survivor did not complain about the alleged crime till their relationship turned sour.“The first information report (FIR) prima facie reveals that the survivor did not complain about the alleged rape till the relationship took a turn for the worse and both mutually decided to part ways,” justice Bharati Dangre said while granting bail to the man, booked by the cyber cell of Mumbai Police on July 7.The survivor complained that she was introduced to the accused while she was in junior college when the two were minors. When they got into a relationship, the two used to visit each other’s residences. She alleged once when she visited the house of the accused, he allegedly sexually assaulted the woman.Though she maintained that the act was without her consent, she did not lodge any complaint about the incident at the time. She approached the police only after their relationship turned sour and they decided to part ways in the last week of June. The trigger for lodging of the complaint, the girl claimed, was that the accused sent some of his intimate photos with the survivor to her mother, and also threatened to send the photos to other family members.“This is a typical case of teenagers moving too fast and being eager to explore the world,” said justice Dangre.Justice Dangre has now ordered the teenager to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of ₹25,000 and surety of the same amount.The court said the accused’s mobile phone has been seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-bail-to-18-year-old-booked-for-raping-friend/story-NYta508xCUTfZJIOICGm7H.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||‘70% wetland loss key reason behind monsoon flooding’||The city’s annual flooding woes can be attributed to the loss of more than three-fourths of its wetlands due to rapid urbanisation and illegal encroachments, a member of the national wetland conservation governing body said on Saturday.Afroz Ahmad, member of National Wetland Committee and advisor to Maharashtra government’s environment and forest departments, presented his views while inaugurating ‘Wetlands of Sindhudurg’, India’s first wetland website (sindhudurgwetlands.in) that documents inland wetland sites across the south Konkan district. The website provides information on environmental and socio-cultural aspects of wetland conservation as well. The environmental scientist highlighted how Mumbai had witnessed wetland reclamation, more than any other major Indian city over the past 50 years.“Mumbai’s shoreline itself, which has a 6-metre depth, is also termed as a wetland. Reclamation there has made the city vulnerable. Moreover, river floodplains and catchment areas have already been built upon. This is the reason why maximum flooding takes place. There is no water absorption anymore,” said Ahmad, co-author of the Centre’s guidelines for Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017.Ahmad’s assessments were in line with a study by Wetlands International South Asia (WISA) that showed Mumbai had lost 71% wetlands from 1970 to 2014, followed by Ahmedabad (57%), Bengaluru (56%), Hyderabad (55%), Delhi and National Capital Region (38%), and Pune (37%). “Comprehensive wetland inventories are not yet available, but some datasets indicate Mumbai witnessed very high wetland loss through reclamation but so have other major cities. Post 1970s when cities started expanding, they started eating into the wetlands,” said Ritesh Kumar, director, WISA. According to the National Wetland Atlas 2011 (Maharashtra), made under the 2010 wetland rules, Mumbai had 475 wetlands — 412 in the suburbs and 63 in south Mumbai — spread across 14,045 hectare (ha). However, under the amended 2017 rules, Mumbai will have only one major notified wetland — spread across four zones at Powai Lake (181.9ha), according to the state environment department.“It is advisable that all wetlands, including those identified in the atlas, and lakes be protected as heritage sites. Develop brief documents and action plan for their management immediately,” said Ahmad. He added that with 373 wetlands covering an area of 13,979ha comprising 33% creeks and 31% rivers, Sindhudurg was among the first districts in India to develop community-driven wetland brief documentation committee and listing wetlands taluka-wise as an inventory. “The findings are available on the website, which will be a handy tool for policy makers and state officials to oversee conservation. It can also help in developing appropriate area-centric policies for tourism, skill development and resource utilisation,” said advocate Omkar Keni, one of the website contributors.The Sindhudurg model, which is now on a public platform, needs to be replicated for Maharashtra and across India, said Dr Ahmad adding, “With the pandemic giving its message to India to not toy with nature, conservation is the need of the hour as natural wetlands are being lost rapidly.”WHY KONKAN NEEDS TO PROTECT ITS WETLANDSNatural wetlands are permanently or seasonally saturated in water and create habitats for aquatic plants. They retain large volumes of water and their slow release makes them important for combatting extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts. Wetlands also contribute to water purification, water regulation, biodiversity, aesthetics and recreation, according to the United Nations. According to the National Wetlands Atlas, published by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2010, the Konkan region of Maharashtra has 4,799 wetlands. However, experts said they are at threat across the state due to natural factors. “Owing to low organic matter, there are limitations in the form of soil, mostly of basaltic origin and lateritic soil, along the Konkan region. Due to this, they have poor water-holding capacity while seasonal river systems have small length. The soil explodes in the form of springs during heavy rain events. Wetlands in such areas are indispensable and deserve top priority,” said Dr Ahmad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/70-wetland-loss-key-reason-behind-monsoon-flooding/story-cvSIRYCvDI3fmJyVnkVJaM.html

15-08-2020||City||Maharashtra accounts for one-fourth of India’s cases, Fadnavis calls state a new Covid capital||PUNE Maharashtra leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis termed the state as the latest Covid capital of India citing the rising number of cases and fatalities.The former chief minister was in the city on Saturday to inaugurate a 15-bed Covid care centre for journalists.“Unfortunately, Maharashtra has become the Covid capital of India with 24 per cent of patients and 41 per cent deaths being reported from the state alone,” he said, adding that the government needs to increase testing to control the situation.As on Friday, Maharashtra has reported 5,72,734 cases with 19,427 deaths compared to 2,520,987 cases and 49,108 deaths in the country. Within the state, Mumbai, Pune and Thane have reported maximum cases.Fadnavis insisted on increasing RT-PCR tests in Maharashtra saying that the current focus is on rapid antigen tests.“While there is a need for an increase in overall testing, more RT-PCR tests should be carried out in Maharashtra. The current ratio of 1:2 RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests should be brought to 1:1,” said Fadnavis.The BJP leader also insisted on small Covid facilities instead of jumbo centres being set up in the state. In Pune, two jumbo facilities are coming up following the state government’s nod.‘Whatever my party will decide for me, I will work accordingly’On shouldering the crucial role for upcoming Bihar polls just when Sushant Singh Rajput’s case has heated political discourse, the former chief minister said that the case has nothing to do with his appointment and it is “just a coincidence”.“In our party, various leaders are tasked with various responsibilities during elections. Similarly, I have been asked about the polls there. Whatever my party will decide for me, I will work accordingly,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis also praised the Maharashtra police saying there is no comparison between them and Bihar counterpart. He was replying to a query about his views on Maharashtra police after Bihar alleged that Mumbai police are not probing Sushant’s suicide case properly.“I have already said that we fully believe in Maharashtra police. I have worked with them for five years and I know their capability. However, on various occasions, police have worked under political pressure and we expect them to work freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-accounts-for-one-fourth-of-india-s-cases-fadnavis-calls-state-a-new-covid-capital/story-aQB1Ms40kAZ4IPZZ29v33J.html

15-08-2020||City||Tax charter: Answer in details, procedures and strict implementation||Twenty-two years after the first Charter on taxpayers’ rights and income tax department’s obligations came into existence, there is promise of these entitlements finally becoming a reality. While the earlier charters were purely voluntary and were not enforceable and remained mostly on paper, the new charter unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday has the backing of the Income Tax Act. With the incorporation of Section 119A in the Income Tax Act, mandating the Central Board of Direct Taxes to adopt and declare a Taxpayers’ Charter and “ issue such orders, instructions, directions or guidelines to other income-tax authorities as it may deem fit for the administration of such Charter”, the voluntary charters of all these years give way to a mandatory legal requirement, enforceable by law. This is a very positive development. One looks forward to the Board drawing up not only stringent service delivery standards with specific timelines, but also an effective mechanism for strict monitoring and compliance. The Board should also draw lessons from the reviews of the earlier charters and ensure that tax payers are fully aware of the details of the charter and have an effective redress mechanism for complaints on non-compliance. The government also has to keep in mind the reasons for the failure of the Income Tax Ombudsman and create an effective and independent system of time-bound grievance redress.It is equally important to ensure that the tax authorities comply with the Charter in letter and spirit. In fact complaints of non-compliance from tax payers should form an integral part of the performance appraisal for the income tax department staff. “The department shall hold its authorities accountable for their actions”, says the Taxpayers Charter. It should also hold them accountable for their inaction or failure to conform to the Charter. It was in November 1998 that the income tax department first came out with a Taxpayers or a Citizens Charter. It was part of an overall administrative reform programme (similar to the Citizens Charter programme of the United Kingdom) initiated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances ( DARPG) to improve service delivery by all government departments and ministries and bring in transparency and accountability in the administration. The Income Tax department described the Charter drawn up by it as “A declaration of our commitment to excellence in our service to taxpayers”. The one-page charter promised to be a) fair, b) helpful and c) efficient. Under its promise of efficiency, for example, the department said “it would acknowledge all communications from taxpayers on the spot and in any case within seven days and furnish final replies within 30 days”. It promised to redress all complaints within 30 days, issue refunds within 30 days of determination, and also keep all personal and business information/materials furnished to the department, confidential.The promises, however, remained unfulfilled-- in fact a review of the Citizens Charter programmes of various departments and ministries, done by the Indian Institute of Administration in 2008, at the behest of DARPG, made scathing observations about the poorly drawn up charters and an even poorer implementation. Subsequently, many departments reviewed and revised their Charters. The Income Tax department too revised it in 2007, again in 2010 and subsequently on April 29, 2014. However, two factors -- absence of statutory backing and the taxpayers’ lack of knowledge of the Charter -- allowed the income tax officials to often ignore the promises made. In fact a letter written by the Central Board of Direct Taxes in January 2014, asking assessing officers to respect the Citizens Charter in respect of TDS matters, is a case in point.Now that the Charter has been enshrined in the Statute, will it usher in a tax regime that respects the taxpayer and guarantees a fair deal, devoid of corrupt or unfair practices? The answer lies in the way the details are drawn up , the procedures and mechanisms provided and the strict implementation of the Charter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tax-charter-answer-in-details-procedures-and-strict-implementation/story-cZN63Pj8Nm2npUoAaDDk5K.html
15-08-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Of Parottas, Pizzas & Presidential ‘running mates’||What’s with this seeming the season of ‘running’! While particular Princes of British royalty have been running (never mind if it’s only as far as the palatial portals) to fetch Poppadums landing from an Indian takeaway and while US Presidential wannabe Joe Biden has been dabbling in the other kind of running – unveiling a “running mate” of Indian descent Kamala Harris, any guess what our Lollitas, Lamba jis and Lally Singh jis have been running after?Remember, Lamba jis and Lally jis being fixated over frozen foods of Lockdown called Parotta or the lighter Parota (lighter not in terms of calories but only lighter by a letter)? Well, ever since their moment of the “Mirror, mirror on the wall,” reminding them to mind their middle-class middle anatomies, they petulantly parted with their Parota partiality and did its copious consumption stall.The Parotta’s loss has been the Pizza’s gain (not to say the Pizza isn’t itself contributing to gain, the one accruing on bulbous bellies built by the Parotta or Paratha). That exactly is what the Lollitas, Lamba jis & Co are running after – their Big Fat First Post-Lockdown Pizza.Alas, if you thought all that India Quarantining’s readymade frozen Parotta gorging and gluttony has now propelled Lamba ji or Lally ji (L&L) to go gallivanting – bestirred out of bloating by a Jog-the-Hog kind of workout wisdom – to fetch that post-Lockdown Pizza from the nearest takeaway, perish the thought.Blame it on Duke of Cambridge Prince William who sort of set a precedent of purely perambulating to the palatial portal for Poppadums, the only place Lamba ji or Lally Singh ji are breathlessly running to too – hold your breath – is the door!And how!So, the stage is set for the arrival of the Big Fat First Post-Lockdown Pizza, thanks to Domino’s or Zomato’s contactless delivery in Unlock. Thence begins the countdown, the minutes being clocked by Lamba ji or Lally ji with as much bated breath as if it were the legendary Sachin Tendulkar staging a spectacular stadium comeback.Going by the adrenalin and anatomical animation defining their body language, it would surely seem so, that it is Sachin and not “Supreme” (pizza) that’s staging a return – Lamba ji or Lally ji squiggling to sprint out of their sedentary state every time the smartphone trills, the way a cricket-crazy fan squirms in the seat with his sights straddling the pavilion and pitch in a pupillary pining that only a ‘sport-a-holic’ or ‘Sachin-a-holic’ soul knows (in case of L&L, a pizza-holic soul).Else, Lamba ji or Lally ji may be seen navigating a brisk walk while waiting for the delivery boy. Good for the middle anatomy of the middle class, one would think. But the catch being, the only places Lamba ji or Lally ji usually seem to stroll about in semi-Lockdown and in (pizza-pining’s) semi-stupor is from room to room, up and down the corridors (which are the New Normal’s Miniature Parks) or, oops, on Lollita’s toes.When the call from the security guard finally comes intimating the arrival of the delivery boy from Swiggy, Domino’s & Co, Lamba Ji and Lally ji jounce up as if it were the Umpire’s voice booming, bellowing the breathtaking ‘Return of Sachin’. Their sentiment again is so akin to that of a Sachin-o-holic sports fan who may be sighted heaving and hurling himself out of the stadium seat to scurry towards the pavilion for Sachin’s wishful comeback. In similar style, sprinting towards the door is Lamba ji or Lally ji even before the landing of the lift that’s ferrying the delivery bloke. But before the sprinting for “Supreme”, Lamba ji & Co may be seen spraying sanitiser on the skin as liberally as if partaking in Kumbh Ka Shahi Snan. Or, worse, Lamba ji & Co’s lavishness with the liquid looks as if they’re going on a date with Pizza and the sanitiser is New Normal’s Eau De Cologne.By the time the bell rings and Lamba ji or Lally ji lunges for the last leg of the ‘pizza-thon’, the delivery boy has done his deed and dashed off. It’s a blink-and-miss date.Lo behold, even before Lamba ji & Co land at the landing, there is someone already tearing ‘n’ tucking into the Big Fat First Post-Lockdown Pizza standing at the gate.The Curious Case of being checkmated by his chit of a Chihuahua called Chameli, the ‘running mate’!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-of-parottas-pizzas-presidential-running-mates/story-WeBi5U6Ch0Py6phAreoKZN.html

Pawar on Friday took a review meeting at the council hall and appealed to all elected members to appeal to Ganesh mandals and citizens to not carry out any processions during Ganesh festival. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “The Central government on Thursday did a video conference with 18 district collectors from Maharashtra including Pune and instructed to not allow any religious and political functions in the coming days.” Rao said, “The Central government has clearly instructed that as the unlock process has begun and the economy is coming to normal, it is difficult to maintain the containment zone policy. On this background at least there should be strict actions for not allowing religious, political or any other functions where more people will come together.” Rao said, “All the administrative officers including the police clearly took a stand to not allow any processions during this year’s Ganesh festival.” Rao said, “The five main Ganpati mandals and other Ganesh temples are cooperating with us and assuring that they would not carry out the processions. Even we are in touch with most of the Ganesh temples. We are appealing the people to cooperate voluntarily, even if it isn’t allowed legally.”Pune is famous for its Ganesh festival and a big immersion procession in the state. The Dhol, Tasha and long processions are an attraction but this year nothing will be allowed in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-ganesh-immersion-processions-this-year-in-pune-ajit-pawar/story-olaXTrNuHQQSj1UIJp7FHJ.html

Administration must make efforts to increase plasma donations.”Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “Till date, a total of 500 plasma donations have been made in Pune, of which 154 plasmas have been used. It is true that plasma therapy is helping, but it’s not a complete solution as seven patients who were given plasma died. The administration has decided to start driving its plasma donation campaign from August 15.”Rao said, “Doctors said that the main reason for poor plasma donation is that citizens think that if their relatives require it, they should be ready. To overcome this, we decided that if someone donates plasma, whenever required, plasma will be given to such a person’s close relative on a priority.”The administration’s donation drive is aimed at plasma donations from police personnel and government employees first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-district-administration-to-prioritise-donors-relatives-if-they-are-in-need-of-critical-care-plasma-donation/story-RYEWhaNecf3cWr1DiL4qfM.html

15-08-2020||Delhi||Independence Day 2020: Readathon, lit meets in virtual plans of RWAs||“Before the pandemic, every year on August 15, the residents of my society would get together in the morning hours around the common assembly area, and hoist the Tricolour while singing the National Anthem in unison. And then, there would be a round of sweets to seal the Independence Day celebrations,” says Santi Sankar, a resident of MG Road, Gurugram.” This year, though the celebrations will be virtual, it hasn’t doused the spirit! Sankar adds, “We have found unique ways to salute those who laid down their lives for the nation.”  A number of societies and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) are celebrating I-Day virtually this year, such as by hosting virtual readathons. “Women in my condo will have a get together over video call to read out patriotic poems or sing nationalist songs. I’ve even rehearsed the lyrics of Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon,” adds Sankar. . . Some residents also plan on holding digital conferences to discuss Indian literature. “I’ve a book club in my residential area, as part of which we have decided to discuss our favourite piece of Indian literature over a video call, to celebrate I-Day. This way, not only will our book club remain active in times of social distancing, but we will also get to celebrate the works of Indian writers and remember their contribution during the freedom struggle,” says Urmika Sahai, a resident of Vasant Kunj, Delhi. Some youngsters are looking forward to listening to real-life stories from the elderly, as the latter have been invited by heads of their societies to share personal tales of freedom. “My RWA has organised a wonderful initiative, wherein we are getting videos recorded from our grandparents narrating their partition stories and India’s struggle for independence. Our RWA will compile and stream them on video portals and also mail them to us,” says Niranjan Rao, a resident of MG Road, Gurugram, adding, “My dadi is super excited to participate in this!” And the kids have also found a way to not let their excitement fade due to celebrations going online. “A couple of my society friends and I have decided to connect virtually and cheer the kids as they perform over video call,” says Priti Dogra, residing in Gurugram sector 23, adding, “My kid will dance to Rang De Basanti (Rang De Basanti; 2006), while my neighbour’s kid will play Teri Mitti (Kesari; 2019) on his piano.

15-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants bail to teenager booked for raping girlfriend||The Bombay high court on Thursday granted bail to an 18-year-old, arrested for raping his girlfriend, after noticing that the survivor did not complain about the purported crime till their relationship turned sour.The FIR, prima facie reveals that the survivor never complained about the physical relationship till the relationship took a U-turn and both mutually decided to part ways, justice Bharati Dangre noted while granting bail to the teenager, booked by Cyber Cell of the Mumbai police on July 7.The survivor complained that she was introduced to the accused when she was studying in junior college. The acquaintance slowly turned into a love affair, and the two used to visit each other’s homes. She alleged once when she visited the house of the accused, he took advantage of the fact that no one else was present in the house and established a physical relationship with her. Though she maintained the act was without her consent, she did not lodge any complaint about the incident. The complaint was lodged only after the relationship turned sour and they parted ways sometime in last week of June. The trigger for lodging of the complaint, the girl claimed, was that the accused sent some of his intimate photos with the survivor to her mother and also threatened to send the photos to her other family members.“This is a typical case of teenagers moving too fast and eager to explore the world hurriedly,” said justice Bharati Dangre talking about the entire episode.“The sheer hurry without maturely understanding each other is typical of adolescence and before the relationship took a concrete shape, the applicant and complainant became physical,” said the judge. “The applicant, one of the party to this hurried relationship is in trouble as he is arraigned as an accused for a serious offence of rape and is booked under one of the stringent laws – POCSO Act.”Justice Dangre ordered the teenager to be released on bail on furnishing personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a surety in the same amount.Before ordering his release on bail, the court confirmed that the investigation officer has seized his mobile phone and that he has not forwarded the intimate photos to anyone else.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-teenager-booked-for-raping-girlfriend/story-wHr9d7g3ge5XimDenp3icI.html

15-08-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka CM vows to build ‘Kalyana Rajya’, asks people not to fear Covid||Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Saturday called on the people not to worry or be afraid of Covid-19 infection, as he vowed to build a “welfare state” with development as the only mantra, while fighting the pandemic.In his message to the people of the state on the occasion of 74th Independence Day, the chief minister while pointing out the challenges faced by rain, floods and drought along with Covid-19, also defended the reforms brought in by his administration.He also remembered and paid tributes to all corona warriors, including the government machinery, private establishments, industrialists and volunteers who have been working relentlessly in these trying times.“Our aim is to build a Kalyana Rajya (Welfare state) with the avowed principle of development as the only mantra.While fighting the global pandemic Covid-19, we are taking giant strides towards realizing Mahatma Gandhis dream of building a Ram Rajya and will practise Rajadharma in true earnest,” Yediyurappa said.Realising the responsibility thrust upon us and keeping in mind the welfare of people in these critical times, we have taken many pro-people decisions, he said, adding “the people of the state have given complete support to the decisions that my government has taken. I am indebted to all of you.” It was a subdued Independence Day celebration in the state capital with no school children or public in attendance, only select invitees including elected representatives, officials, also some Covid warriors and those who have recovered from the infection were present.Noting that Covid-19 was a global pandemic, a global scourge, the CM said this has affected not just the health sector, but continues to affect every single industry, and the pace of life that had slowed during the lockdown is slowly recovering now.“I too was infected by the coronavirus, and I have fully recovered. I would like to send a message on this occasion that the people need not worry or be afraid of this infection,” he said.The 77-year old leader was on Monday discharged after about 10 days in the hospital, following his recovery from the infection.Besides record rain, floods and drought, the centurys most disruptive and dangerous pandemic, Covid-19 has posed huge challenges, Yediyurappa said with economic recession, job losses, loss of revenue to the government, and social and economic activities grinding to a halt, people of the state are in distress. “Our government has implemented many schemes and projects to ensure peace, relief and tranquillity in society and help people see a ray of hope in this hour of gloom,” he said. The chief minister said his government has been giving a boost to entrepreneurs through the Industrial Facilitation Act, which greatly improves the ease-of-doing business and encourages industrial development in the state. Not just that, we have been encouraging the youth of the state to develop skills.Along with that, rules have been simplified to purchase agricultural land that’s required for industrial purposes, he said, adding that we have created an opportunity for both farmers and industrialists to mutually benefit from the direct purchase of land.Also noting that the government has made big changes in the co-operative sector which is the backbone of the agriculture economy, Yediyurappa said, with an objective of allowing farmers to sell their produce at a market of their choice, the government has made changes to the APMC Act.Opposition Congress and JD(S), also few organisations have been critical of government’s ordinances amending land reforms, APMC and industries related laws, calling them anti farmer, people and labourers.Highlighting measures taken by his government to remove regional imbalance and for the development of the backward Kalyana Karnataka region, Yediyurappa said airports in Bidar and Kalaburagi have commenced operations to encourage industrial activities in this region.Work on setting up an airport in Shivamogga has gathered pace, and the government has given administrative approval to launch work on Karwar and Vijayapura airports, he said.Observing that agriculture, welfare of backward classes and minorities are among the priorities of his government, the CM also said the Centre’s Aatmanirbhar Scheme is a ray of hope for all of us, and as PM Narendra Modi has said, Karnataka too has been taking bold steps to convert every crisis into an opportunity.Pointing to the talks held with more than 40 prominent companies during the World Economic Forum summit held in Davos, seeking their investment in Karnataka, he said, later during Covid-19 too we have approved 101 industrial projects worth Rs 27,000 crore at the state level.Also complementing Prime Minister Modi for the construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Yediyurappa revealed his government’s plans to build a Yatrinivas in Ayodhya for devotees from Karnataka who travel there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-cm-vows-to-build-kalyana-rajya-asks-people-not-to-fear-covid/story-qsVC2Bz905xsHjJrAr0CKI.html
15-08-2020||Chandigarh||Will not rest till Punjab’s economy is back on track, says chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh||Mohali: With Punjab’s revenue dipping by half in the first quarter, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh vowed to bring the state’s economy back on the growth track and announced a slew of welfare measures, including the creation of six lakh jobs for youngsters in two years, while addressing the state-level Independence Day function in Mohali on Saturday. “Despite the economic slowdown resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to 50% decline in revenue collection in the first quarter of this financial year, the state government has successfully initiated several steps to combat the crisis. A Rs 26,000-crore boost was given to the farming sector to ensure efficient wheat procurement,” Capt Amarinder Singh said after unfurling the Tricolour. The event at Government College, Phase 6, Mohali, was a low-key affair with the function, attended by government officials and police personnel, limited to the unfurling of the flag and speech of the chief minister amid Covid-19 curbs. The speech was streamed live on social media. VIRTUAL MEGA JOB MELA NEXT MONTH He announced that 50,000 government jobs will be provided to youngsters next year and another 50,000 in 2022. “A virtual mega job mela will be organised next month with the aim of the placement of 50,000 youngsters in the private sector,” Captain Amarinder Singh said, adding that the Punjab government has already helped 13.6 lakh youngsters get employment/self-employment under its flagship Ghar Ghar Rozgar scheme. Reiterating his government’s commitment to providing incentives for the industry to attract more investment to the state, he said that investment worth Rs 63,000 crore had been realised on the ground with the potential of two lakh jobs. DEBT RELIEF, NEW LAND LEASING LAW The chief minister said that the state government will give debt relief of Rs 520 crore to landless farmers and workers. A sum of Rs 4,700 crore had been disbursed among 5.62 lakh farmers under the debt waiver scheme. “Punjab will soon enact a new land leasing law to secure ownership of farmers and the rights of tenants on agriculture land,” he said. With the launch of the smart ration card scheme soon, he said 1.41 crore beneficiaries will become eligible to get ration from fair price shops. Capt Amarinder Singh announced the construction of 1,300 km of state and national highways with an investment of Rs 12,000 crore in two years. While 28,830 km of rural links roads have been repaired over three years at a cost of Rs 3,278 crore, the next two years will see repair of another 6,162 km of link roads with an investment of Rs 834 crore, he said, adding that patchwork of an additional 17,000 km of link roads will be undertaken for Rs 82 crore. RESTORING SPORTING GLORY Underlining the need to restore Punjab’s glory in sports, the chief minister announced the construction of 750 rural sports stadiums in two years. He declared a Rs 2,500-crore investment in Phase II of the smart village campaign (SVC), for which Phase I covering 19,132 rural works has been completed at a cost of Rs 835 crore. All rural households will have piped potable drinking water in two years with an expenditure of Rs 1,200 crore. Citing the importance of online education, Captain Amarinder Singh said 1.74 lakh Class 12 students of government schools were being given smartphones this year. WEAR MASKS, GET TESTED, PROTECT ELDERLY Expressing confidence that Punjab would overcome the Covid pandemic, the chief minister urged people to take special care of the elderly, while ensuring strict adherence to wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings besides frequent washing of hands. He said early testing was the first step towards defeating Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-not-rest-till-punjab-s-economy-is-back-on-track-says-chief-minister-capt-amarinder-singh/story-oVy9ezBYczd1OWFp9TfcrL.html
15-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugramwale: A life in everyday feminism||Her days are so hectic that she hasn’t really found the time to look back and trace the arc of her life. Therefore, Sunita Kushwaha has never thought of herself as a feminist. But that’s what she is. She was raised in a conservative UP village where women would hardly get out of their homes, and would appear in public only in a ghunghat, their face completely hidden beneath the veil. But look at her now—everyday she interacts face-to-face (these days it’s mask-to-mask, though) with hundreds of strangers. She is a “ladies security guard” in a Gurugram mall. She is 32. It’s her third year on the job. Though she has been living in the city for eight years.“I’m also a wife and a mother,” she says, talking on WhatsApp video this afternoon, during a small break in her 11am to 7pm shift.Like many women with day jobs, Ms Kushwaha enjoys the benefits of having a supportive child. “By now, Akansha has learnt to like her own company in the house during the day.”Ms Kushwaha’s husband, Ram Milan, is a maintenance man in a motor showroom, and he too is out during the day, working. In any case, her “bhabhi” (sister-in-law) lives just next door and keeps an eye on the daughter, who often crosses over to the relative’s house to pass her hours—especially during these days when the schools are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Ms Kushwaha insists that her husband is a very helpful mate, respects her co-role as a family breadwinner and helps her partly with the household chores.“We wake up every morning at 5.30 and prepare the lunch together—I make the atta dough for the rotis and he chops the vegetables.” The couple’s home comprises of a single room, and the kitchen has a gas range placed upon a corner table. Ms Kushwaha’s residence is in Wazirabad, a 15-minute walk from the shopping mall. In the pre-corona era, she would first drop her daughter at school but now she leaves for work alone, while keeping lunch and snacks, like biscuits and namkeen, in accessible parts of the house, so that her daughter’s hands can reach them easily. “Every day after lunch, when my daughter feels bored, she calls me—we have given her a mobile—to ask how I am doing and to chat for a bit,” she says, laughing.Ms Kushwaha reaches home not long after 7pm, and straight gets down to the household job—washing the laundry (by hand) and cooking the dinner.But isn’t she already exhausted after her day of work?Ms Kushwaha doesn’t make any comment. She later says: “This job is important for me because it helps with our expenses.” She waited for her daughter to start the school before launching herself into her current career. And here the lady adds that she has a dream for her girl. “Actually it’s Akansha’s dream.... I think she saw it in some TV serial... she wants to be a doctor and wishes to open a clinic in a village because she thinks that villages have no good hospitals.”But now, Ms Kushwaha must get back to her duty. Today she is stationed by the mall’s entrance. A visitor enters. She quietly measures his temperature and squeezes the sanitiser spray on his hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugramwale-a-life-in-everyday-feminism/story-pO9WQGvf5T0mk0frCCDr3J.html

He warned that teams will come and inspect these places, and violators will be penalised. Further, all persons who have high social contact will be tested within the coming week, and Corona conquerors (who have recovered) from health, police and other departments will be put on frontline duty, said the chief minister. The directions came amid continuing increase in Covid cases, with the last 7 days reporting an average of 1,000 a day. The maximum cases last week came from Ludhiana, Patiala, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Mohali. The chief minister said the mortality due to Covid can be checked if people go for early testing and report to hospitals within 72 hours once detected positive. “Treatment should begin within this period if lives are to be saved. Don’t be a doctor yourself, leave it to the doctors to diagnose the problem and suggest the treatment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-brings-all-cities-under-night-curfew/story-NqiAhm5CJsNXcr8H1fRL2M.html

It will resume on Monday. The petitioners have challenged the merger of six MLAs--Sandeep Yadav, Wajib Ali, Deepchand Kheria, Lakhan Meena, Jogendra Awana and Rajendra Gudha--with Congress and sought a stay on the execution on the order passed by the speaker. The MLAs submitted an application for the merger on September 16, 2019 and the Speaker issued an order on September 18, 2019.

15-08-2020||City||Custodial death of Ludhiana man: SHO among three cops booked after six months||Almost six months after a vehicle-lifting suspect died in police custody in February, police have booked the Division Number 5 SHO and two ASIs for his custodial death.The action came after a local court on Friday dismissed an application filed by the police seeking a stay on a previous court order to lodge the FIR.The trio – SHO sub-inspector Richa Rani, ASI Charanjit Singh and ASI Jaskaran Singh – have been booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and the Contempt of Court Act.Deepak Shukla, 27, an insurance company employee, had died at the civil hospital on February 27 after being allegedly tortured by the Division Number 5 police in custody.His family had approached the court on February 26, hours before his death, alleging police torture. Though Deepak was moved to the civil hospital on the court’s order, he had died on February 27.Following protests by his family on February 28, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal had suspended the SHO, the two ASIs and one constable Mandeep Singh. But, the SHO was reinstated after a few days.On the family’s plea, a court on March 6 had ordered the police to lodge an FIR against the SHO, the two ASIs and other police personnel, but the police did not take any action and sought a stay by the court on lodging the FIR.Dismissing their plea on Friday, the court of additional session judge Arun Kumar Aggarwal stated that though the accused cops had claimed that it was the jail authorities and not them, who failed to follow the court order and jail manual, the factual aspects of the case were a matter of investigation after registration of the FIR.ANOMALIES IN PROBEDeepak’s uncle Rakesh Shukla had informed the court that on February 22, police had called Deepak’s wife Preeti and informed her about his arrest in a vehicle-lifting case. Even though Deepak was arrested on February 22, police did not present him in court until February 24, when he was sent to judicial custody.Even then, the police kept him in illegal custody and shifted him to the jail only on February 25. Rakesh had also claimed that the police had earlier sought a bribe of Rs 1.15 lakh for not registering a case against Deepak, and that they had paid them Rs 25,000.The police had subsequently informed the court that they were late in taking Deepak to jail due to delay in his medical examination, following which the jail staff refused to admit him.To this, the court had questioned them that if they were late in taking the accused to jail on February 24, why did they wait till 1pm on the next day to transfer him.Further, the jail record did not have any mention of Deepak being taken to jail on February 24. The record reflected that he was taken there at 5pm on February 25. There, Deepak had complained of severe pain in his legs and nausea and was taken to the civil hospital for treatment on February 26, but he died. The autopsy report had suggested that the body had seven injury marks.The family had later also filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking FIR against the errant cops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/custodial-death-of-ludhiana-man-sho-among-three-cops-booked-after-six-months/story-sD4xaIYARGoGlTuux8FtDN.html

A senior police officer said that those from containment zones could not apply for the e-passes.“The passes are mostly issued for groups of people, so the actual number of devotees travelling outside the city would be more than 10,000-12,000,” another police officer said.The police said they are strictly ensuring that the devotees implement all safety measures and social distancing norms are followed while travelling. “As the rules were announced in advance, we received a good response from the devotees. Only those applications in which all mandatory norms are complied with are accepted. Vehicles with high capacity are allowed to ply only with half the capacity,” said Viresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (central region).All the zonal deputy commissioners of police in Mumbai are the nodal officers for issuing the e-passes.Inter-district movement is restricted owing to the lockdown imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.However, as lakhs of people annually travel from Mumbai, Thane and Pune to their hometowns in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts for the 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi festival – which falls on August 22 this year – the state government provided certain exemptions for devotees to travel to their hometowns.Last year, around 6 lakh people from Mumbai visited their hometowns for the festival. Last year around 2 lakh devotees visited Konkan and other districts for Ganeshotsav in private vehicles, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-000-apply-for-e-passes-from-mumbai-for-inter-state-travel-ahead-of-ganeshotsav/story-cPsXKA5M8FOlnIB7iMZJtK.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||AI Vande Bharat flight from Mumbai delayed as pilot sacked a day before operations||Air India flight AI1993 that was scheduled to depart to Dammam, Saudi Arabia, from Mumbai airport as a part of the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) was delayed on Friday morning by three hours after the pilot who was to operate the aircraft was terminated by the airline the previous night. The pilot is among the at least 50 other Air India pilots who were who were sent termination letters on Thursday around 11.30pm in which the airline blamed the Covid-19 situation for its financial condition. An Air India spokesperson said, “The pilots, who were employed on permanent and temporary basis, had resigned for better opportunities. Their resignations were accepted by the airline, which they [pilots] had later requested to revoke. Their requests, however, were not accepted. The matter is sub judice and nothing more can be said about it.” The termination letter accessed by HT stated that the airline is no longer accepting the withdrawal of termination letters. According to airline sources, these 60 pilots had resigned in December, but over the course of the next few months, took their resignations back before the expiration of their notice period which is six months as per civil aviation rules laid down by aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).As per the national carrier rules, pilots can withdraw their resignations during their notice period. Earlier this year, some among the 50 pilots had moved the Delhi high court (HC) after the airline refused to revoke their resignation letters before their notice period ended and continued to operate evacuation flights. The current lot of pilots said the termination of permanent employees raises concerns over job security at a fully-owned central public sector undertaking (PSU). The Indian Commercial Pilots’ Guild (ICPA) – Air India’s union of Airbus pilots – wrote to the airline’s chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal, requesting his immediate intervention on the “illegal” termination of the pilots. The union stated that even the pilots who tendered their resignations in July last year and later withdrew them within the mandatory six-month notice period, have been relieved from service all of a sudden on Thursday night. The union mentioned that the crew was not informed of the acceptance of resignation.Stating the fact that terminated pilots operated flights on Friday, the letter read, “For the safety of our traveling public alone if not on humanitarian grounds, these pilots should not have been made to operate flights under such traumatic circumstances. This vengeful exercise carried out by personnel department last night [Thursday night] to illegally terminate pilots directly compromises the safety of our flights. This has been done brazenly against the official commitment of the board and MoCA [ministry of civil aviation.”The airline did not comment on rostering the terminated pilots on Friday. Airline sources said terminated pilots operated two domestic flights early on Friday morning. “The airline sent the same termination letters to all these pilots around 11.30pm [on Thursday]. As a result, two Bangalore-bound flights from Delhi were operated by the terminated pilots, which is not only a result of mismanagement by the airline but is also illegal,” said a Delhi-based staffer. A senior pilot pointed out that it is not only illegal but also unsafe to terminate a pilot hours before he operates a flight, as human factors such as stress can cause safety concerns to the journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ai-vande-bharat-flight-from-mumbai-delayed-as-pilot-sacked-a-day-before-operations/story-oh4OaJ2w5p76wMeoxaalfN.html
15-08-2020||City||Heavy rainfall inundates fields in Sonepat, Rohtak||Rainwater has inundated major portions of bajra, guar, cotton, sugarcane and paddy fields in low-lying areas of Rohtak and Sonepat. With the water showing no sign of receding even after a week in Rohtak and two days in Sonepat, farmers are worried that their crops have been destroyed.They have blamed the district administration for not clearing the drains.Dalel Dhaka, a farmer from Sundana village in Rohtak, said he had sown bajra on 13 acres and cotton on four acres.“The heavy rainfall has damaged my crop and 4-5ft water is still logged in my fields. The state government should provide us a suitable compensation so that our expenditures can be borne,” he added.However, the situation worsened in Sonepat as several parts of the district saw flood-like situation after Thursday’s downpour. Another farmer Sunil from Kharkhauda block said he had shifted to cotton and bajra from paddy after getting inspired from Haryana government’s ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’ scheme this year and both of his crops were ready for harvesting by the first week of September.“The rain has brought misery to us as the water is still standing in my fields and it is likely to damage nearly 90% of the crop. The exact crop loss will be determined in the next three to four days once the water resides. At one stage, we were very happy to shift to alternative crops instead of paddy and hopeful of getting good profit, but the rain has ruined our plans,” he added.Ashok Kumar, a farmer from Rohtak’s Ritoli village, said paddy on his five acre land is under water for the last six days.“Heavy rainfall was beneficial for the early sowing of paddy, but it damaged the late varieties. Every year, we have to bear losses as water level is high in our area and the government has failed to make any arrangements,” Kumar added.Sonepat deputy director (agriculture) Anil Sehrawat said they were getting complaints of crop losses from Gohana and Kharkhauda farmers.“The exact loss will be accessed once the water is drained out. We have directed agricultural and revenue officials to visit the affected areas,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-rainfall-inundates-fields-in-sonepat-rohtak/story-MBh8vY40HTSY7ZV2DHM3aP.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid situation in state not yet conducive to reopen temples: Bombay HC||Reiterating that the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra is not yet conducive to reopen the places of worship, the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday refused to interfere with the state government’s decision to not allow temples to reopen as of now. The two-member bench, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Surendra Tavade, was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Associate for Aiding Justice, seeking the reopening of places of worship of all faiths. Advocate Dipesh Siroya, representing the NGO, submitted that as the central government allowed the reopening of temples and the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra has also improved, the state government should permit temples to reopen. He said that the government may not allow religious functions to be held in temples and also restrict the number of devotees entering the religious institution, but can certainly allow people to enter temples to worship the deities. Assistant government pleader Nisha Mehra opposed the PIL by pointing out that the state government had rejected representations for opening up of temples on August 12, and a co-ordinate bench has refused a prayer for interim relief to reopen Jain temples for a nine-day festival of the community. After hearing the petition, the bench refused to accept the claim that the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra has improved. “Please pray at home, and if you have some love left for humanity, please don’t press these prayers,” said the bench. “If the situation improves, this court, being the temple of justice, will be the first to reopen, before any other temple opens up for devotees,” it added. When the bench opined that it will accept the decision of the co-ordinate bench, Siroya claimed the decision was only as regards Jain temples, but the PIL was seeking reopening of all places of worship. However, Mehra clarified that the decision was not restricted to only Jain temples, but was applicable to other faiths as well. The bench has now posted the PIL for further hearing on August 18. It directed Siroya to clarify the status of the petitioner body, after noticing that it has been registered as a company. “How can a company espouse cause religious rights?” the bench asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-situation-in-state-not-yet-conducive-to-reopen-temples-bombay-hc/story-CK4fGHpbAkQEY9eFtiwSKJ.html

After the lockdown, the civic bodies had permitted shops to remain open on odd-even basis. Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “The shopkeepers and customers need to maintain social distancing and other norms. The order is not applicable in hot spots and containment zones, where shops will remain open as per the odd-and-even system.” PCMC commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh said, “We have been receiving a lot of representations and requests for allowing shops to remain open on all days. Thus, we have permitted them to remain open on all days. Barring malls, market complex, gyms and swimming pools, all other shops within PCMC jurisdiction will be allowed to open everyday from August 15 as per the specified guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shops-can-remain-open-on-all-days-in-navi-mumbai-from-today/story-IpGJdGjeEnSceqGLN4QesI.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Students unhappy with Bombay HC’s refusal to stay final-year PG medical, dental exams||The Bombay high court’s decision on Friday to deny interim relief to final-year postgraduate (PG) medical and dental students has not gone down well with many. While the court has clarified that final exams for dental and medical students will be conducted as per schedule in August, students said they are unprepared, especially since most of them have been at the forefront of Covid-19 relief work for the past five months, across state hospitals.“Students worried about their health and safety of their family members since they had to sit for examinations along with hundreds of other students. Additionally, most of them have been working 12-14 hour shifts every day for the past few months. This should have been considered by the court before denying them relief from exams this year,” said the parent of a PG medical student, adding that most students are under a lot of stress because of the uncertainty of the situation.According to the last circular released by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) exams are slated to commence from August 17, while PG medical exams are scheduled to start from August 25.Medical aspirants have been seeking relief from final-year exams for some time now. MUHS, however, had been very clear on its decision to hold exams, with some delay due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation in the state. At present, colleges have been asked to finish submitting internal marks of all students and MUHS has started issuing hall tickets to all registered candidates.“The Ministry of Home Affairs has been very clear that education institutes in Maharashtra will remain shut until the end of this month. How does MUHS plan to hold exams this month,” said Siddharth Ingle, president, Maharashtra Students Union (MASU).At present, the Supreme Court (SC) is already hearing a set of petitions filed by various student groups from Maharashtra, seeking directions to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to withdraw its decision to make end-of-term final-year exams compulsory. However, these petitions do not include medical exams. “Medical students might have to approach SC for help now,” added Ingle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-unhappy-with-bombay-hc-s-refusal-to-stay-final-year-pg-medical-dental-exams/story-uMk4jiD4ZFguHCSDNj5ZfK.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to stay medical, dental examinations in Maharashtra||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday refused to stay final-year examinations for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses, starting from August 17 and August 25, respectively.“We don’t think it is proper to stay the examinations,” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Surendra Tavade. “There could be students, other than the petitioners, who are willing to appear for the physical examination and might have prepared for the same. It would not be proper to stay the examinations behind their back.”The bench was hearing a petition filed by 24 students of Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) courses from different districts of the state, challenging the decision of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to hold final-year examinations, requiring physical presence of students for both, practical and theory papers.Their counsel, advocate Kuldeep Nikam, submitted that due to the unprecedented and alarming situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic in Maharashtra, it would be difficult for the students to physically appear for the examinations.He added that the petitioners and other students were not averse to appear for online examinations, as has been suggested by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Nikam also pointed out that on Thursday, two medical students tested positive for Covid-19.“You are doctors. If you are not prepared to appear physically for these examinations, how will you treat patients in hospitals?” the judges asked.It also clarified that if any of the petitioners do not appear for the examinations starting August 17 and August 25, and later the court finds that they were justified in refusing to appear for the physical examinations, it will order MUHS to hold separate examinations for them.MUHS counsel, advocate Rajshekhar Govilkar, however, pointed out that all deemed universities in Maharashtra have already held their final-year examinations, and if postgraduate students do not appear for these examinations, they will not be able to apply for admission to super-speciality courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-stay-medical-dental-examinations-in-maharashtra/story-IlC8DmMsi41KkZfBEQOnXO.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||5,583 Covid patients are in critical condition: Maharashtra health department||Maharashtra has 5,583 Covid-19 patients who are in critical condition and have been put on oxygen or ventilator support across various facilities in different parts of the state. Around half of these patients (2,589) are in Mumbai and Pune, followed by Jalgaon, Solapur and Nashik, where the growth in cases and fatality rates are high.According to the health department data submitted to the government on August 10, the state has 687 critical patients on ventilator support. There are 2,960 patients in critical condition who are on oxygen support inside intensive care units (ICUs), while 1,919 patients are on oxygen support outside ICU. The total Covid-19 patients who are in a critical condition form 3.77% of the total active cases (147,735) in the state on August 10. Seventeen patients who are in critical condition are also Covid patients but they have been given ventilator or oxygen support primarily because of complications from another ailment that they are ailing from. Of the critical patients, 69% are in the 41-70 age group, while 28% are 51-60 years. Seventy-one percent of these patients are male. According to the data, the districts or municipal corporations which have recorded high Covid fatality rates also have high number of critical patients. In Mumbai, 1,355 patients in critical condition are undergoing treatment at 67 hospitals. In Pune City there are 801 critical patients, while the number is 207 at Pimpri-Chinchwad and 226 in Pune Rural. Jalgaon has 404 critical patients, while Kolhapur and Solapur have 219 and 321 critical patients, respectively.Dr Sadhana Tayade, director, directorate of health services, said, “We admit most of the serious patients in the ICU so that they are given utmost attention. We have been giving oxygen support to the patients who require it, as lack of oxygen level is the foremost symptom of the disease. Patients with pneumatic patches are kept on oxygen support. The percentage of the patients on the ventilator is less than 2% of the total number of critical patients. However, it is true that the recovery of the patients on the incubative ventilator is the tough job.”According to the officials from the health department, some of the distant districts, where the growth and fatality rates are high, the health services support is not upto the mark. “The late referral of patients to Covid facilities is the major reason why the number of critical patients is high. In rural and semi-urban areas, the unwillingness to report the symptoms is a major hurdle,” an official said, adding that the number of critical patients in Mumbai will always be high as patients from neighbouring districts are referred to the city for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-583-covid-patients-are-in-critical-condition-maharashtra-health-department/story-QjjoEGJ4BstGhVW5XscAnI.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai saw most Covid-19 deaths in May; fatalities on decline, says civic corporation||Following an exercise to map recorded Covid-19 deaths to the dates on which they actually occurred, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) said that the city’s case fatality rate peaked in May and has since sloped downward. With 2,269 deaths, the city saw the highest number of Covid-19 casualties in May, followed by June (1,922) and July (1,773). BMC estimates August may see between 1,300 and 1,400 deaths. On August 14, Mumbai recorded 47 deaths from Covid-19, taking the toll to 7,038. There were 979 new cases, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 1,28,535, of which 19,337 are active. The case fatality rate in Mumbai is 5.4%, compared to 3.3% in Maharashtra. The recovery rate is 79%. According to BMC, prior to the spike in fatalities in May, the city had 15 deaths from Covid-19 in May and 475 in April. The civic body has attributed the improvement in case fatality rate since May to interventions such as the Mission Save Lives, started by BMC on June 30; timely testing for Covid-19; and an evolving line of treatment for serious and critical cases of the infection. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who is also in charge of BMC’s health department, said, “Our medical interventions, evolving treatment protocol and other interventions by the civic body have helped bring down the deaths. We are now administering tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir, among other drugs. Plasma therapy has also helped. People are now more aware too.” BMC has been mapping deaths due to Covid-19 on the actual days they occurred, instead of when they were reported to its epidemiology cell by private and public hospitals. In June and July, the civic body faced flak for reconciling deaths from April and May. On June 15, the state government disclosed that 862 additional Covid-19 deaths had occurred in Mumbai. BMC later clarified these deaths had occurred in April and May, but there was delay in the hospitals conveying this information to the epidemiology cell. Until July 3, BMC had reconciled 751 more deaths from May and June. Kakani said, “The civic body is concerned about the date that a death occurred, instead of the date that it was reported to BMC. Now we know which month had the most deaths, even though some death figures were reconciled later.” Although May saw the highest number of deaths, the case fatality ratio (number of deaths in comparison to number of cases) was highest in March. The case fatality rate in March was over 9.5% while in April and May, it was over 6.5%. In June, the case fatality rate was 5%, followed by 4.5% in July was 4.5% and 4% as of August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-saw-most-covid-19-deaths-in-may-fatalities-on-decline-says-civic-corporation/story-624LosXcu1mSSdJM5BdyHP.html
15-08-2020||City||Covid-19 testing: 0.17% false negatives in Maharashtra, reveals data||Amid scepticism over high false negatives in rapid antigen test, the state government data shows that 0.17% of the samples tested in Maharashtra failed to identify Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. At 3.4%, Mumbai suburbs recorded the highest false negative cases in the state. A false negative is when the antigen test identifies an infected person as negative for the presence of the virus, but the report comes positive in the RT-PCR test. As per rules of Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), those with symptoms who test negative for Covid-19 by RAT should be tested sequentially by RT-PCR to rule out infection, whereas a positive test should be considered as a true positive and does not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test. Since the end of June, 675,035 individuals have undergone tests using antigen kits. Of the 592,167 who tested negative for the virus, 4,235 symptomatic individuals had to undergo a confirmatory reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), considered the gold standard. Of these, 1,011 tested positive for the virus in RT-PCR. “No test provides a 100% guarantee, and this too has its loopholes. Thus, we conduct follow-up RT-PCR tests to rule out any chances of infection. So far, results have been promising. When Delhi started using the kits, there was similar scepticism,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. In Mumbai city, of the 47,931 people who tested negative, 275 (0.57%) turned positive in the RT-PCR test. However, Mumbai suburbs has the highest false negative cases in the state. Of the 5,571 negatives, 194 or 3.4% turned positive in the follow-up test. “Every day on an average, we test over 3,000 people with the kits. False negatives are extremely uncommon. Now, we have also tied up with private labs to provide the facility at home,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “The false negativity rate for RT-PCR is almost 23% but overall, the rate is not even 1%. How is it possible,” asked Dr Abhijit More, who is co-convenor of the Jan Arogya Abhiyaan. A health officer said , “We will soon hold a meeting along with private labs to form parameters to conduct the test.”Mumbai is followed by Thane with 0.7% false negativity rate, where out of the 57,260 individuals tested, 401 turned positive in RT-PCR test after testing negative in the antigen test. It is followed by Palghar (0.51%). In Pune, of the 96,086 individuals who tested negative in antigen test, only 67 (0.06%) of them have turned positive in RT-PCR. Even though it is a sign of relief for government officials, health experts claim the “abnormally low” false negative numbers don’t show the real infection rate.For instance in Nashik, where 41,085 tested negative in antigen test, only one of them tested came positive in RT-PCR. Similarly, in Aurangabad, where 99,700 people got negative reports in antigen test, only 4 were tested again in follow-ups. Out of them, one tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-testing-0-17-false-negatives-in-maharashtra-reveals-data/story-rlCfWqOpWSeMwmBQIg3QHO.html
15-08-2020||City||The state of rapid antigen tests: Positivity rate in Maharashtra stands at 12.28%||More than a month after the introduction of rapid antigen tests to boost testing in Maharashtra, the state’s positivity rate, which indicates the prevalence of Covid-19 infection, using the kits stands at 12.28%, according to the data from the state health department. Rapid antigen tests involve checking nasal swab samples for antigens (foreign substances that induce an immune response in the body) that are found on or within the virus Sars-Cov-2 that causes Covid-19 virus. It is performed outside the conventional laboratory setting, and gives results within 30 minutes. RT-PCR, the gold standard for Covid testing, takes over eight hours. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing is be treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples of symptomatic people will have to be mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process. Positivity rate is the percentage of people testing positive compared to the total tests. Of the 675,035 individuals tested across 36 districts in the state till August 13, 82,868 have tested positive for the presence of novel coronavirus. A total of 56,852 individuals have been tested with antigen kits in Mumbai city and suburbs, of which 3,350 have tested positive – a positivity rate of 6%. In the rest of the state, high positivity rates were recorded in Ratnagiri (37.20%) and Parbhani (32.47%), despite fewer cases compared to other parts of the state, a cause for concern for government officials. Mumbai city, once the epicentre of the Sars-Cov-2 virus outbreak, has recorded a positivity rate of 6% which is among the lowest in the state, while it is almost 13% in Mumbai suburbs. Health experts said the difference in positivity rate in the city and suburbs is because the pandemic curve has shifted to the outer boundaries of the main city. “A positivity rate of 12% in the state is on the higher side because Delhi has around 7% positivity rate using rapid antigen tests. As many districts like Pune and Thane are at the peak of the pandemic curve, it is expected to have a higher positivity rate. It will come down gradually, just like Mumbai,” said a senior officer from the health department. The city comprises areas from Churchgate to Bandra on the western railway line, CST to Sion on the central line and CST to Chunabhatti on the Harbour line. Mumbai suburbs extend between Khar and Dahisar on the western line, Kurla to Mulund on the central line and Kurla to Mankhurd on the harbour line. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with the intention of testing aggressively to identify people with Covid-19 started the antigen tests from July 3. Till August 13, 50,462 people underwent the test in Mumbai city, of which 2,531 tested positive. During the same period, in Mumbai suburbs, 6,390 took the test, and 819 came positive. “When the pandemic started, it was mainly limited to south Mumbai with international travellers, but gradually started to spread. Now, the suburbs have more active cases than town, which explains the high positivity rate. With the gradual unlocking of the lockdown, the movement of people has increased. Thus, the virus which was limited till south and central Mumbai has shifted to the northern side,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “The test has helped us increase daily testing to more than 10,000 samples. Earlier, we started it in the northern wards of Mumbai and a few Covid-19 specific hospitals, but now, it is being conducted in all wards. Unlike RT-PCR, it is easier to use and we have plans to procure more kits,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, warned against overuse of the kits. “As per ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), antigen tests have a moderate sensitivity of around 50%. So, if we start using it more than RT-PCR, we might lose many infected patients” he said. Ratnagiri, a port town which is around 350km away from Mumbai, has recorded 2,449 Covid-19 cases since March, far lower than Mumbai, but it the highest positivity rate in the state. Till August 13, 414 people were tested using the kits, of which 154 (37.20%) were positive. Health officers attributed the high positivity rate to the presence of more number of asymptomatic patients. Dr Kamalpurkar, district health officer (DHO), said, “We are getting maximum number of positive cases from containment zones and hospitals. Despite having lower number of Covid-19 cases, we are trying to expand our daily testing of antigen kits for faster diagnosis.” It is followed by Parbhani with 32.47% positivity rate (661 of 2,036 tested positive). It is followed by Pune. Of the 124,533 tests, the highest in the state, 28,447 (22.84%) came positive. Kolhapur stands fourth with 21.81% positivity (1,116 of 5,117 positive). Jalgaon recorded 20.29% positivity rate, with 3,729 of 18,382 coming positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/the-state-of-rapid-antigen-tests-positivity-rate-in-maharashtra-stands-at-12-28/story-5g2cEBvdtKk4qHRdadccqN.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects rape convict’s bail plea||The possibility of consent cannot be countenanced in case of a 13-year-old rape survivor, the Bombay high court (HC) said while rejecting the bail plea of a rape convict during pendency of his appeal.“The prosecutrix (survivor) at the time of the incident was 13 years of age, and therefore, the argument that it could be a consensual act cannot be accepted,” said justice CV Bhadang while rejecting the application of Sagar Sahi, a driver of a non-governmental organisation working for the welfare of children.Sahi has been convicted last year for raping a 13-year-old in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment. He had moved a plea before HC seeking bail during pendency of his appeal against the conviction and the sentence.It was argued on his behalf that the medical report would show that there were no external injuries on the survivor. Expressing possibility that the act could be a consensual one, the convict’s lawyer submitted that it was necessary to bring on record the call data record of the conversations between the convict and the survivor and added that the investigating officer had not done so.Justice Bhadang, however, refused to accept the contention regarding consent and added that absence of external injuries cannot be, prima facie, considered material in favour of the accused in view of the definition of rape under section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The judge further said that it was an irony that a driver employed by an NGO working for the welfare of children has been charged and convicted for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-rape-convict-s-bail-plea/story-YxEvR62mtFbqPTSxoPnRuK.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Four cops suspended for assaulting 22-year-old to death||Four constables attached to Juhu police station have been suspended on Friday for allegedly assaulting a 22-year-old to death. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Bandra division had informed the Bombay high court (HC) in July that he had identified the four police personnel from Juhu police station who assaulted the victim Raju Velu Devendra.The accused are naik Santosh Ganptrao Desai, naik Anand Sitaram Gaikwad, constable Digambar Sakharam Chavanm and constable Ankush Ambadas Palve.Police sources said internal inquiry revealed that the four policemen assaulted Devendra after he was found outdoors during the Covid-19 lockdown. Devendra was subsequently found dead.Juhu police had, however, maintained that in the intervening night of March 29 and 30, Devendra was spotted by locals while allegedly trying to enter a house near Mutthi Swami Chawl in Vile Parle.According to Juhu police, he attempted to flee by climbing the roof but slipped and fell on the ground. A mob chased him to an open space and beat him up, which led to him losing his consciousness. A patrolling police van later took him to Cooper Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival, Juhu police claimed. The police had also registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 141 (unlawful assembly), 142 (intentionally joining unlawful assembly), 143 (member of unlawful assembly), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon) and 147 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code against eight people.The matter, however, reached the high court later when advocate Firdause Irani brought to the notice of the high court Devedra’s death, which according to his family members, was caused due to police brutalities, in an attempt to highlight the police high-handedness in enforcing lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.It was only after the high court took serious note of police brutalities that the ACP of Bandra division admitted that Devedra’s death was not a case of mob lynching and that he was assaulted by four policemen. The ACP had also assured to take disciplinary action against the erring policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-cops-suspended-for-assaulting-22-year-old-to-death/story-KcnwBNgzvq7ThlIfkLPhiK.html
15-08-2020||City||Two Navi Mumbai cops awarded medals||Two Navi Mumbai senior police inspectors, both of whom hailed from poor economic background, have been awarded the Union home minister’s medal and the President’s medal. Navi Mumbai Police’s crime branch officer Kondiram Popere was awarded the Union home minister’s medal for cracking the improvised explosive device (IED) attack near a Kalamboli school in 2019, while senior inspector Ashok Rajput was awarded the President’s medal for 27 years of service. Popere, 58, joined the Maharashtra Police in 1991 as a sub-inspector at Chembur police station. Belonging to a scheduled tribe family from Akola, Popere is the youngest of three siblings. His elder brother retired as a government teacher while his sister owns a farm now. “My father died when I was two. At times, I used to work with my mother on a farm as a labourer. I studied in a government school and went on pursue a master’s degree in Law. I joined the police force in 1990 after working as a clerk at a government bank. I always wanted to serve the public and do something better with my life,” said Popere. Popere worked in Mumbai, Nashik, Thane and the state’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID), before he was posted in Navi Mumbai in 2014. His experience in the CID proved handy when an IED was planted near New Sudhagad School in Kalamboli in June last year. Posted in the unit-2 of the Navi crime branch, Popere led the investigations amid the terror scare. The anti-terror squad was roped in too. “Fortunately, the IED was not wired properly and did not explode when the bomb timer went off. After rummaging CCTV footages and checking for terror activities in online chat rooms, we found a vehicle near the hand-cart on which the bomb was planted. The vehicle led us to the main accused,” added Popere. Navi Mumbai Police on July 3 arrested the mastermind Deepak Dandekar, 44, along with Manish Bhagat, 45, and Sushil Sathe, 35. The trio had planted the IED to extort ₹2 crore from a builder who lived near the school. Popere’s 28-year-old son is an assistant manager at a bank, while his daughter, 24, has completed her engineering studies. On Friday, Rajput, senior inspector of Panvel rural police station, was among 40 police officers from Maharashtra to get the President’s medal for meritorious service on the eve of Independence Day. Like Popere, Rajput too was brought up in a poor family. He studied at zilla parishad school in Shindi village, Jalgaon before he joined as a sub-inspector in Nagpur. Rajput has worked in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad as well as the CID and the anti-corruption bureau in Aurangabad. Rajput, 52, has helmed various sensitive murder and dacoity cases including the 2010 murder of deputy sarpanch Prakash Kandekar who was gunned down due to political rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-navi-mumbai-cops-awarded-medals/story-aaiWkBUr7cM1vy0un3tAiN.html

The authority is looking to appoint a consultant to create a plan for a transit system at BKC. MMRDA metropolitan commissioner, RA Rajeev, said, “We are looking at a cost-effective solution and are open to various modes as we want to ease the commute between the two stations and BKC.” While MMRDA had signed a memorandum with a private bike-sharing company to roll-out services between the two stations and BKC before the Covid-19 outbreak, Rajeev confirmed that the proposed system will be in addition to the bike-sharing facilities. Despite being Mumbai’s top commercial hub, the connectivity to BKC is a task if one does not own a private vehicle. The traffic scenario in BKC is also a huge concern. A 2017 study of the G block of BKC indicates that around 50,000 vehicles enter the block during peak hours in a day. MMRDA is laying special focus on establishing last-mile connectivity across Mumbai. It recently approved a plan for establishing a multi-modal integration at 30 stations of Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) corridor and Metro 7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East) corridor, expected to be operational by May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/smoother-commute-mmrda-plans-transit-system-to-from-bkc/story-oRYiYcSNsVkBo7uEkW0hDK.html

The party had alleged that ventilators were lying unused at the Gymkhana for over a month.Kadam and four others were booked for criminal trespass under section 447 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint lodged by the security guard of the Gymkhana with police states that Kadam along four others entered the Gymkhana premises on Tuesday, took the ventilator box and kept it on their vehicle and again returned it back to the Gymkhana. Kadam also shot a video of the unused ventilators. “Our intention was just to expose the civic body on their failure to provide proper facilities to the Covid patients. When there is a requirement for ventilators, there are several ventilators lying unused for months and we wanted to expose that. If the Gymkhana Covid centre is yet to be ready, then the civic body should use the ventilators at other centres,” said Kadam. “Based on a complaint received from the security person of the Gymkhana, we have booked five of them. The investigation is on,” said an officer of Tilaknagar police station, who did not wish to be named. Followed by this MNS MLA Raju Patil, met the KDMC commissioner, Vijay Suryavanshi on Friday asking him to withdraw the complaint against Kadam and four others. “We have asked the civic body chief to withdraw the case as the party workers were just exposing the negligence by the civic body,” added Patil.

15-08-2020||City||Heavy rain leads to 1,016 craters on Thane roads||With Thane receiving heavy rainfall for the past one week, the condition of the roads in the city is pathetic with potholes developed in most roads. A total of 1,016 potholes, covering a total area of 2,268 square metre (sqm), were found over the past one week in the city, according to a survey conducted by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The civic body has started the work of filling up potholes since June end, however, the work is moving slowly due to unavailability of labourers in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The budget for this year’s road repair work is also lesser as compared to previous years. The budget for filling potholes and monsoon road repairs was ₹3.5 crore in 2019 whereas this year’s budget is ₹2.25 crore.In 2019, three pedestrians, including a five-year-old boy, lost their lives in pothole accidents. A TMC official said, “Till Thursday, the city had 1,016 potholes covering an area of 2,268 sqm. Most of these potholes are on the roads in areas such as Ghodbunder, Diva, Wagle Estate and Naupada-Kopri wards. We have filled 686 potholes covering 1,376 sqm road surface and are yet to fill 330 potholes in different parts of the city.” The official added, “The budget (for road repair works) has decreased. However, we have not compromised on the repair works. Most of the potholes on roads under TMC are filled. We have also written letters to other authorities such as the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, public works department and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority to repair roads under their jurisdiction.” Ankush Hadkar, a 38-year-old Kalwa resident, said, “This year traffic congestion due to potholes is less as not many people are commuting. However, potholes can still lead to major accidents as most roads in the city are in bad condition. The road near Kamgar Hospital is riddled with potholes, as are some of the roads in Naupada and Teen Hath Naka. Most roads in Kalwa, too, are in pathetic condition. Commuters will have to face a nightmare if the lockdown is raised.” BOX Total Potholes: 1,016 Area of potholes: 2,268 sqm Potholes filled: 668 Area of potholes filled: 1,376 sqm Potholes yet to be filled: 330 Area of potholes to be filled: 891.8sqm Past incidents August 15, 2019: Five-year-old Vedant Das was killed after his father’s two-wheeler skidded over a pothole between a cement concrete and asphalt road on Ghodbunder Highway.

15-08-2020||Mumbai||MahaRera: Parking space builders’ contractual obligation towards buyers||Builders who fail to provide proper parking spaces to homebuyers could face stringent action from the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera). In a significant ruling, on August 7, MahaRera came down heavily on a Pune-based realty firm for failing to provide standard-size parking space to the complainant buyers, saying parking space was a contractual obligation on the part of builders towards buyers. It also directed the firm to provide a sufficient driveway so that buyers can bring their cars out of their parking slot smoothly. Buyers Sandip Jambhale and Prashant Shingan had filed a complaint with MahaRera against builders Shri Venkatesh Sharada Infracon, alleging the builders’ project Parijat Building A in Ambegaon, Pune did not provide sufficient car parking space to residents. Jambhale and Shingan also complained that the side margins required around the building had been narrowed down. An architect appointed by MahaRera visited the building in January and submitted a report on their findings to MahaRera. Based on the architect’s report, MahaRera member BD Kapadnis ruled that a builder is contractually obliged to provide proper parking space. Responding to Jambhale’s complaint, Kapadnis said, “It is necessary for the respondent [the builder] to provide Mr Sandip [Jambhale] the parking space, which must have sufficient way to take four-wheelers to the parking space and the parking space should be of standard size as laid down by the bylaws so that a car of standard size should be parked therein easily.” With regards to Shingan’s complaint, Kapadnis said the builder cannot provide parking in the upper level as it was meant for two-wheelers. “The respondents cannot provide a car parking of four-wheeler on the upper level parking. It will be in contravention of section 14 because it violates and contravenes the sanctioned plans or specifications therein,” he said. Kapadnis further observed that during the site visit, the architect had noted the driveways “are not as per the dimensions required by the bylaws and therefore, it is difficult to drive four-wheelers to the parking space allotted to the complainants”. Shri Venkatesh Sharada Infracon has agreed to provide adequate car parking spaces to both complainant buyers. Housing activist Ramesh Prabhu said, “Parking space is an essential amenity and it is obligatory for builders to provide a decent parking space to buyers. This ruling will force builders to improve the overall quality of their buildings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharera-parking-space-builders-contractual-obligation-towards-buyers/story-o335tGT7DppJoXActvtkmM.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||BJP opposes ₹40-lakh repair work at BMC chief’s bungalow||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has opposed the proposed repair works worth ₹40 lakh for municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal’s official bungalow at Carmichael Road near Tardeo in south Mumbai. The BJP has said that in the past, too, a lot of money has been spent on repair works and the same should be avoided in the current scenario in view of the fund crunch faced by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.However, BMC administration has said the repair work was proposed months ago but could not start owing to the pandemic. BMC allots bungalows to the municipal commissioner and the three additional municipal commissioners.The BMC’s chief’s bungalow is a heritage structure which undergoes repair works from time to time. A BMC official said, “Internal and external repair works were proposed last year during the tenure of former BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi. However, the current chief has made few suggestions, and we have incorporated the same. There is nothing new being proposed.”BMC has proposed internal works for the BMC chief’s bungalow including renovation of toilet block, internal plumbing works, false ceiling, painting and furniture work. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “Only a couple of years ago BMC had spent lakhs on repair work during the tenure of former BMC chief Ajoy Mehta, and now repair work is being undertaken again. We understand that there might be some changes that BMC might want, but this is not the correct time. BMC is facing a financial burden and has stopped recruitment. In such a scenario, why is BMC spending on something that can wait for a while?” Meanwhile, Chahal said, “The roof of the bungalow is covered with plastic sheets held by bamboos, but still there are water leakages at many places. Anyone is free to visit the bungalow and decide if the repairs are necessary or not.”BMC in a clarification issued on Friday said, “The bungalow is more than 100-years old and is a heritage structure. The administrative approval from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) has come and the planning for the repair work is ongoing since a year now. During monsoon, the bungalow is prone to water leakage. Due to leakage, there are other problems such as moisture in walls, cracking of walls, frequent deterioration of furniture in the bungalow, dryness in the walls including wooden windows and doors are common. The bungalow has not undergone any major repairs in the past several years, and overall the administrative process for repair and conservation started in the year 2019 itself. Given this, it is clear that there is no fact in the allegation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-opposes-40-lakh-repair-work-at-bmc-chief-s-bungalow/story-wdQBpVu4jd2Wcnfkanh6eK.html

15-08-2020||Mumbai||HC nod for state to appoint administrators for gram panchayats||The Bombay high court (HC) allowed the state to appoint administrators for gram panchayats whose terms have expired after it was assured that only government servants would be appointed for the role. The assurance was made by the state through an affidavit filed in reply to around 40 petitions, challenging the July 13 decision of the government, which empowered chief executive officers (CEOs) of zilla parishads to appoint administrators in consultation with guardian ministers. The appointment was necessitated as elections could not be conducted in view of the Covid-19 situation. The court, however, stressed that private individuals should not be appointed as administrators and also asked the state to consider the suggestions of the petitioners to appoint gram sevaks or officials of other state departments as administrators. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing all the petitions that were filed at the seats of the HC at Mumbai, Nagpur and Aurangabad, was informed that the grievances of the petitioners had been addressed in the affidavit. The state’s affidavit said that the government had a large pool of extension officers from the health, agriculture, education and panchayat departments, who could be appointed as administrators. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni further submitted that the CEOs would only have consulted the guardian ministers with regards to the ground realities and also the reputation, competence and capabilities of every person under consideration for the role. He further submitted that ultimately the CEO of the zilla parishad concerned would be selecting the administrator and not the guardian minister of the district. Kumbhakoni then drew the attention of the bench towards the category of officers who would be considered for being appointed as administrators and said that conditions were imposed for such officers too, and no officer would be given the responsibility of more than three gram panchayats at a time. In all, there are around 14,000 gram panchayats in the state, whose terms expired on May 5, while the term of some expired on Friday. Kumbhakoni added that only if there were no suitable officers to fill the post of an administrator, would private persons be considered for the role. Some of the petitioners submitted that in such a scenario, the CEO should consider officers from departments other than those mentioned in the affidavit. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the submissions made by Kumbhakoni were fair, and the state government could go ahead with the appointments from the four categories: extension officers from health, education, agriculture and panchayat departments. The court also asked the state to consider the suggestions of the petitioners to appoint gram sevaks or officers from other departments as administrators. The bench then posted the matter for hearing at a later date after observing, “We hope that AG (advocate general) abides by [his] statement and would not appoint any private individuals to gram panchayat whose term ends today [Friday] and already expired.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-nod-for-state-to-appoint-administrators-for-gram-panchayats/story-IXtPQeohH0xUokc3weVfhL.html

15-08-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud: CBI court rejects Rana Kapoor’s pre-arrest bail||The special CBI court on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor in connection with the case registered over his alleged deals with Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). The special judge SU Wadgaonkar while rejecting the plea observed that the accused/applicant is a principal accused and played an active role in the crime in question. The special court considered that the investigation is kept open even after filing the charge sheet, as the probe was affected due to spread of pandemic Covid-19. Just before the national lockdown was announced by the government, the CBI had obtained a production warrant for Kapoor to obtain his custody in the bank fraud case. However, the agency decided to wait amidst the lockdown.Pending the execution of the warrant, Kapoor approached the special CBI court for anticipatory bail. Before his plea was heard, CBI filed a charge sheet in the case. Hence, while seeking pre-arrest bail, Kapoor’s lawyers argued that the agency had asked for issuance of summons to Kapoor and his family, and they pleaded that the custodial interrogation was not needed by the agency. The special court refused to accept the contentions and also noted that there is a reasonable ground available to show that custodial interrogation of Kapoor is required by the agency. As per the case registered by CBI, Yes Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) between April and June 2018, in return for which Kapoor was allegedly paid ‘kickbacks’ amounting to ₹600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan in form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd. DHFL sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and a major shareholder, alleged CBI. The loan was sanction on the mortgage of sub-standard property having meagre value. Further, the agency claimed that Yes Bank also sanctioned a loan ₹750 crores to M/s RKW developers which is DHFL group of company. The loan was sanctioned for the purpose of Bandra Reclamation project. The Whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil Wadhawan since the entire amount was transferred by RKW developers to DHFL without making an investment in the Bandra reclamation project. Recently, the special CBI court under Prevention of Corruption Act refused to accept charge sheet as the agency has not obtained sanction to prosecute Kapoor. The case was transferred to special CBI magistrate court. The court while transferring the case held that the agency has not even initiated a process to obtain prosecution sanction against Rana, who is a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act). The prosecution sanction is a must to invoke the provision of PC Act against any public servant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-cbi-court-rejects-rana-kapoor-s-pre-arrest-bail/story-gjbYpGYRvUTePdQmfBOUbJ.html

The local fire brigade team found the body of one deceased, while the search for the second body is still on.According to police, despite waterfalls being banned for revellers during the lockdown, six friends from Mauje Gadage and Ambole village went to Gorakh Gad and later to Chondhi waterfall, in the afternoon for a picnic.Dattatray Borate, senior inspector from Murbad police station said, “The two deceased, Umesh Borkuntle, 22 and Kartik Gadge, 20, entered the waterfall for a swim. The water level was high due to heavy rainfall. Also, there was a 20-feet deep ditch below the waterfall, which the two were unaware of. The water current in the ditch was strong, due to which they were pulled in to them.

It is part of the routine process. The board will announce final dates as and when it is decided,” said an official from the board.According to the timetable, practical and oral exams of students who appear for ATKT have to be conducted in October itself.This year, admissions to first-year junior college have also been delayed due to the late declaration of results. While colleges usually start their new academic year in August, this time, they will do so in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-board-releases-tentative-schedule-for-class-10-12-atkt-exams/story-CA3RMIkRPCabSWrSEFFC1H.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||NGT asks four firms to pay ₹286 crore for polluting Mahul||Four industrial firms in the Mahul-Chembur area have been directed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to pay ₹286.2 crore as compensation for environmental damage caused by air pollution over five years. The bench was hearing a 2014 application that sought the closure of an industrial firm located less than 10 metres from Mahul and Ambapada. In an order published on Thursday, the NGT principal bench headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel directed Aegis Logistics Limited (ALL) to pay ₹142 crore; Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., ₹76.5 crore; Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd., ₹67.5 crore; and Sea Lord Containers Limited (SLCL), ₹ 0.2 crore, as compensation. The 2014 application, filed by Charudatt Koli, Dayaram Mahulkar, Mohan Mhatre and Dattaram Koli, had sought the closure of SLCL, which is an additional unit of ALL. The compensation amount was based on calculations (see box) made under a report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in-house technical committee. The matter was heard by the bench on June 30 and the order was published on Thursday. “While it is true that there may be many reasons for presence of VOCs [volatile organic compounds] in the atmosphere like vehicular emissions, etc., it cannot be denied that the said four companies contribute substantially and predominantly to the VOCs in Mahul and Ambapada villages. The prolonged exposure… may weaken lungs and other organs. Conditions prevailing in the area are sometimes likened to that of a ‘gas chamber’,” read NGT’s order. VOCs – including benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene – are harmful toxic pollutants that cause exposure-related health effects in human beings. Among the major contributors to air pollution in Chembur are logistic services storing oil, gas and chemical items; and oil companies releasing VOCs during loading, storage and unloading or handling of hazardous chemicals at various stages. While directing the firms to submit the funds to different accounts, NGT has directed the constitution of a 10-member joint committee to prepare an action plan for pollution abatement over not more than five years and address health problems of inhabitants due to air pollution in the Mahul-Chembur area. The committee comprises two senior nominees of the CPCB; a Union environment ministry representative; a Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) member; a nominee from the state health secretary; a Mumbai district collector; and representatives of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and King Edward Memorial Hospital. MPCB will be the nodal agency. “The amount to the extent of compensation determined (₹286.2 crore) will be made available for the plan to be executed by the respondents themselves or otherwise as may be decided by the committee from time to time,” the order read. Koli said their demand for SLCL’s closure stands. “₹286 crore is minimal against actual VOC emissions calculated by experts in their report. Industries claim to use the best available technology to control VOC emissions, but if pollution levels have been this high, then one can imagine the extent of exposure to residents and allied health impact,” he said. “Through a series of orders were passed over the years, including similar plans directing MPCB to come up with restoration measures, nothing has happened. Residents continue to breathe polluted air,” said Mahulkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ngt-asks-four-firms-to-pay-286-crore-for-polluting-mahul/story-G2ja88sXYgT0DC2k4ybb7O.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||Is Parth Pawar still unhappy?||Nationalist Congress party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s son Parth is apparently sulking after senior Pawar publicly ticked him off for deviating from party line on the issues such as actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide case probe and Ayodhya temple construction. Pawar had called him “immature” and had said he doesn’t give a damn about what the latter says, over demand for Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Rajput case. A day after Pawar’s public rebuke, Parth went to Silver Oak, Pawar’s residence in south Mumbai, where he had over two-hour discussion with his aunt Supriya Sule, also daughter of the NCP chief, but could not meet the NCP chief, said insiders. He is reportedly upset with public rebuke by his grandfather (Sharad Pawar). There are speculations that he may quit the party. Both Ajit and Parth have maintained complete silence on the issue. This also suggests that Pawar continues to be miffed with his grand-nephew over his out of turn statements on policy matters. On Friday, Parth reached Pune and is likely to meet his paternal uncle Shrinivas Pawar and aunt Vijaya Patil, it is said. Ajit is also in Pune where he held a review meeting on the pandemic on Friday. Ajit is the son of Pawar’s elder brother Anandrao Pawar and was brought into politics by his uncle (Sharad Pawar). “Pawar saheb has the authority as he (Parth) is a party worker. We don’t give political advice, for that we have a national leader (Sharad Pawar) in the family and we are proud of him. We also have Ajit dada (Ajit Pawar) who is his (Parth) father. He (Parth) may have got hurt and may come to discuss, but we will speak only on personal issues,” Vijaya told a Marathi news channel on Friday. There was a rift in the family in the past too over Parth contesting the general elections. Eventually, Parth lost the polls to the sitting Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Barne. Soon after the Lok Sabha elections, Pawar was seen promoting his other grand-nephew, Rohit, who is the son of his other nephew, Rajendra. With Pawar’s encouragement, Rohit successfully contested the Assembly elections from Karjat-Jamkhed constituency in Ahmednagar district. On Friday, Rohit said it was a family matter. “It is a family matter and saheb (Sharad Pawar) has already spoken on this,” he said in Ahmednagar. He added that the BJP is doing politics over giving justice to the late actor. NCP MP and senior leader Sunil Tatkare said: “No one is upset. Ajit dada is in Pune and holding meetings. Everyone is busy working.” He met the NCP chief with social justice minister Dhananjay Munde at YB Chavan Centre on Friday noon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-parth-pawar-still-unhappy/story-c5hVNWrQHYLvR0wIxEQ3tJ.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The balloon hawker’s smiley||You’ll always find him alone. Always silent. And he is seen every evening at Old Delhi’s Chitli Qabar Chowk, which is otherwise so noisy, and so hyperactive, teeming with shoppers, idlers, hawkers, florists, kebab wallas, fish mongers, rickshaw pullers, and labourers from early morning to late into the night.Munaf Alam, with his black mask slumped under his chin, is the only island of stillness in this ocean of chaos and confusion.He’s a balloon seller, and has been hawking balloons in the square for six years. “I come here daily, around six in the evening,” he says in an extremely low voice. Mr Alam is sitting on his haunches by the streetside with six balloons tied to an electric pole beside him. The yellow one has a smiley printed on it, which is looking a tad odd when you contrast it with Mr Alam’s solemn expressions.He says that each time a customer, usually a child, gets one of these balloons, he replaces it by taking out a new one from his bundle of flat balloons.Mr Alam gets his balloons from Sadar Bazaar. He says he lives by himself in this city. “My home is in Bihar.” His family, in a village of Darbhanga district, means his elderly parents, he explains. On being queried about his age, he thinks hard as if it were a long-forgotten information, and after a couple of minutes of intense deliberation, he says, “I may be 39, or 42.” A passerby eavesdropping on the conversation finally speaks up, muttering: “You must be 45.”Mr Alam’s home in Delhi is near Delite Cinema, currently closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s a very small house.” He explains this point in greater detail. “My home is under a staircase... it is very narrow and the roof is very low... you cannot stand up straight... in my home, you can do nothing but lie down on the floor.” He has his meals in nearby eateries.“I manage to earn just enough for myself.” Mr Alam has been in the city for 16 years, and was earlier working in a dhaba.Looking about the mostly mask-less crowd, he says he will leave the place at about 1 am, when the traffic of people starts to thin down. (It never totally disappears.) “At home, I try to sleep... but sleep comes after a long time, and so I keep staring at the roof.” He wakes up everyday about 10 in the morning.During the entire course of this conversation, about 15 minutes, nobody has stopped to get a balloon. The smiley continues to cheerily shine over the traffic square. On request, Mr Alam agrees to pose by his “smile walla gubbara (balloon)” and, just at the decisive moment of the ‘click’, he breaks into a smile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-balloon-hawker-s-smiley/story-DZkmw7f3PB15F0enTd7d8I.html

Police said the girls, all aged 12 or 13, were plucking fruits from trees along the banks of the river when the mishap occurred.The deceased have been identified as Kulwinder Kaur, 12, her cousin, Manjinder Kaur, 13, and their two friends, Gagandeep Kaur, 13, and Suman Kaur, 13. They were all students of Classes 5 and 6 at a local government school. Their parents are daily wagers.Inspector Rajesh Thakur, SHO at Sidhwan Bet police station, said while two girls slipped and fell in the water while plucking fruits, the other two lost their balance and drowned while trying to rescue them.Some children playing near the river raised the alarm, following which villagers alerted the police. The police initiated rescue operation, but the children had died by then. The bodies were later fished out in the evening with the help of villagers and sent to the Ludhiana civil hospital for autopsy. Kulwinder’s father Mukhtiar Singh told the police that the children often used to play near the river. He said his daughter was a Class-6 student and wanted to be a teacher.Police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure following the statements of the deceased’s family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-ludhiana-girls-plucking-fruits-drown-in-sutlej-rive-two-die-while-saving-them/story-ghWLyZLGCL3j6hWLBRJqrN.html

15-08-2020||Gurugram||Spread of Covid-19 in Haryana ‘upward and outward’ from Gurugram and Faridabad||Despite Gurugram and Faridabad both recording a steady decline in the growth in number of new Covid-19 cases, it is Haryana’s northern and western districts that have started giving health officials a new cause for concern.Officials said the outbreak has perceptibly been spreading “upwards and outwards” from southern Haryana, with Yamunanagar, Panchkula, Kurukshetra and Sirsa districts currently seeing the largest surge in reported infections.As per state health department data, Yamunanagar saw the highest Covid-19 growth rate over the past two weeks, with its total case load of infections increasing by 113%. Panchkula’s total burden of Covid-19 cases increased by 106% during the same time, while Kurukshetra and Panipat’s total confirmed positives grew by 98 and 90%, respectively. Between August 1 and August 14, Yamunanagar has seen 300 new cases with the number of total cases standing at 565. Panchkula has recorded 564 new cases , with 1,096 total cases. For Kurukshetra, the numbers of new cases and total cases are 415 and 838 respectively and those for Panipat are 906 and 1,915 respectively. Meanwhile, southern districts like Gurugram, Faridabad and Nuh, once hot spots, witnessed growth rates between 11 and 26%. Gurugram, which has witnessed the most significant slowdown in new cases, has a recovery rate of 92%, which officials said is the highest in the state, and has a daily growth rate of under 1%. In comparison, emerging hots pots in northern districts are seeing daily growth rates between 6 to 8%.As of August 14, Haryana has a total of 45,614 positive Covid-19 cases, of which 6,748 are classified as active cases. Despite having lower absolute numbers, Yamunanagar, Panchkula, Kurukshetra and Panipat together make up close to 20% of the state’s entire active caseload. The recovery rate for Haryana currently stands at 84%, while the fatality rate stands at 1.14%. The doubling rate stands at 30 days, but the four districts with the highest growth of cases (over the past two weeks) are doubling at twice the pace, between 12 to 15 days. “We can confidently say that the outbreak has spread upwards and outwards from Gurugram and Faridabad, which are the most populated districts and also share lots of connections with Delhi. These were the first hot spots to emerge in Haryana, around May-June. In July, when the situation in the south started improving, it was adjacent districts like Rewari, Bhiwani, Jhajjar and Rohtak that witnessed surges. Now, even those districts have begun to see a slowdown in cases, but the outbreak has continued to spread and gained speed in districts that are further away from the south,” said Dr Usha Gupta, director, health services, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP).A senior infectious diseases expert at PGIMER Chandigarh, who is also involved in Haryana’s upcoming seroprevalence study, requesting anonymity, said, “The geographic spread of the outbreak in Haryana is natural. As the state opens up post-lockdown, and people continue to move between districts, whether for work or personal reasons, the infection will move out of areas which were once red zones, and new hot spots will emerge. Luckily, in terms of absolute numbers, these new hot spots will not be overwhelmed because the population is much less.”Commenting on this development, Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said, “The surge was expected owing to regular influx of people from red zones. Being the state headquarters for many department offices, Panchkula sees many regular commuters from outside.”Kaur also pointed out that the Baddi industrial area in Himachal Pradesh, which shares a border with Panchkula, has recently emerged as a new hot spot due to the movement of migrants after state borders were opened.Gupta and other health department officials maintained that while the outbreak has continued to spread in Haryana, there is no cause for alarm yet. “In every single district, we have vacant beds and ventilators available. If need be, we will also leverage available infrastructure in urban centres and shift critical patients from rural areas to places like Gurugram and Faridabad, where tertiary care facilities have become available after a reduction in active patients,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/spread-of-covid-19-in-haryana-upward-and-outward-from-gurugram-and-faridabad/story-dmij9CkifxuyLOiGLpmT7H.html
15-08-2020||Gurugram||Sarpanch’s husband, who was shot by gangster, succumbs to injuries||Over a month after the 37-year-old husband of sarpanch of Alipur village was shot outside a private hospital in Sohna, the victim succumbed to injuries at a private hospital on Wednesday night. The crime branch had earlier arrested one suspect in relation to the case. On July 15 around 4pm, the victim, Manoj Dagar, had gone to a private hospital with his nine-year-old daughter who was suffering from a mild fever. Dagar was about to park his SUV outside the hospital, 100 metres away from City Sohna police station across the road, when he was shot through the car’s window pane by a suspect. He had sustained one gunshot wound in the neck and, since then, had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city. Police probe has revealed that the suspect, Mahesh Rathi, brother of gangster Ashok Rathi, held a grudge against Dagar, who had a role in vacating a house in Alipur. A crime branch official, requesting anonymity, said, “Ashok Rathi had usurped a house belonging to his wife’s relatives in Sohna after relations had soured between them. On the intervention of Dagar, whose wife is the sarpanch, the property was freed from Rathi’s control and the house was locked. This enraged Rathi’s brother, Mahesh, and he planned to take revenge.” The police said they are probing the role of other suspects in the case too and added that Section 302 (punishment for murder) under the Indian Penal Code(IPC) will be added to the FIR registered at City Sohna police station. Ashok Rathi, who had links with gangs and was accused in several cases, was shot dead by three men at his house in Alipur on November 16 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sarpanch-s-husband-who-was-shot-by-gangster-succumbs-to-injuries/story-CAn4oeRkWqTuzx8VIgDOMM.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Returning migrants to be tested for Covid in centres at Delhi’s borders||The Delhi government has set up a rapid antigen test centre at the interstate bus terminal (ISBT) in Anand Vihar in light of migrant workers returning to the capital with the slow revival of the economy and gradual lifting of curbs that were imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The move comes at a time when the daily reported cases have come down in the national capital, while they have gone up in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- the two states from where the maximum number of migrants are trickling into Delhi. Delhi recorded 1,192 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, against 3,947 – the highest single day spike in the capital – on June 23. Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, recorded 4,512 fresh covid cases on Friday against 605 recorded on June 23. Bihar recorded 3,906 fresh Covid cases on Friday against 206 on June 23.   The rapid antigen test centre was set up on Thursday, said a senior official of the Delhi government. He said till Friday evening, around 450 people were tested at the centre and only six were fund to be Covid-19 positive.Although the interstate road transport is yet to be allowed, many are reaching Delhi by walking across the border lines that Delhi shares with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. “In the next two weeks, the government will set up several such test centres at crucial locations in the city’s border areas. Revenue district officials have been entrusted with identifying such locations,” the official said.Millions of migrant workers had left Delhi in the days following the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19. The state government had also set up thousands of centres to provide food and shelter to migrant workers who lost their livelihoods until arrangements were made to send them back to their villages on trains and buses. Thousands of them also set off on arduous journeys back home, covering hundreds of miles, by foot.“Since mid-July, we have seen a large number of workers returning to the city. While it is easier to keep a tab on those arriving by trains, it is difficult to track those coming by foot,” said another senior government official, on condition of anonymity.Currently, interstate road transport is prohibited under the lockdown norms drafted by the central government. But, road transport within states is allowed.The second official said most of the migrants take buses from their respective districts and arrive at Kaushambi – a township in Ghaziabad, on the Uttar Pradesh side of the border. From there, they walk to Anand Vihar, covering a distance of about 4km by foot. From Anand Vihar, which is in Delhi, they take local buses and go to other areas within the national capital, the official quoted above said.He further said most individuals who have so far been tested at the Anand Vihar centre are factory workers, construction workers, and self-employed people such as plumbers, electricians, painters, and carpenters, among others. Several of them have also crossed from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh in a similar fashion, before reaching Delhi eventually, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/returning-migrants-to-be-tested-for-covid-in-centres-at-delhi-s-borders/story-6W4SSF6GHem2uCIehDR5uN.html
15-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s recovery rate improves to 76.73%||Recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the last 16 days has increased by 13.68 per cent and the doubling rate in the same period has gone from 24 days to 38 days, according to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data.Over the past few days, the city’s recovery rate, number of active cases in proportion to progressive positive cases and the doubling rate has shown drastic improvement even though the testing has been ranging between 5,000 to 6,000 in 24 hours, said officials.The city’s recovery rate as of July 29 was 63.05 per cent which jumped up by 13.68 per cent to 76.73 per cent as of August 13. This means more number of people are being discharged after they have been isolated as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.Murlidhar Mohol, Pune Mayor, said, “It is good news that more people are being cured of the virus and are discharged.”“Pune city’s recovery rate is 76.73 per cent while the number of active cases in proportion to progressive positive cases is 20.92 per cent which is a good thing. However, it is also true that our fatality rate is now 2.35 per cent which is at par with the country’s fatality rate,” he said.“All agencies are working together to bring down the fatality rate even more,” he said.The number of active cases, who are in hospitals or at home, undergoing treatment or are under observation is also dropping. The number of active cases has gone down from 17,000 cases or 34.52 per cent cases with 9,693 people in home isolation as of July 29 to 14,000, active cases or 20.92 per cent as of August 13 with 7666 in home isolation.With fewer fresh cases being reported the number of active cases is going down thereby bringing down the pressure on the medical infrastructure.Meanwhile, PMC has projected a doubling rate of 24.57 days on July 29 when the progressive positive count of the city was 51,738 cases which is now estimated to be around 38.69 days as of August 13 with a total of 70,326 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-recovery-rate-improves-to-76-73/story-nnCwf8tr6qVlRvdVFxU13K.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Fewer nursery admissions in MCD schools, SDMC kicks off special drive||The schools run by the three civic bodies in the national capital are seeing fewer admissions in entry-level classes of nursery and pre-primary this year with some schools not getting even a single enrolment in these classes as yet. Principals of many of these schools pointed to the reverse migration caused by the lockdown enforced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic as a reason for the low interest and raised concerns about the “drop” in overall enrolment. For instance, at a South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) school, officials said the school did not get even a single admission to nursery and pre-primary (KG) this year. The school principal, who wished not to be named, said, “We are still waiting for parents to approach us for admissions to nursery and pre-primary. These are the entry-level classes in which we get maximum admissions every year. But this year, we are getting more admissions in other classes. This is a worrisome trend.”The principal of another SDMC school, again on condition of anonymity, said, “We have got seven admissions in nursery so far. Majority of our students are from working-class families and many such families residing in this area have left for their home states in view of the pandemic. Fathers of some of the children have visited the school to enquire about admissions. They said they will get their families back only after the Covid-19 situation eases in the city.”Taking stock of the situation, the SDMC has launched a special drive to boost admissions in its schools. Mukesh Suryan, the chairperson of the south civic body’s education committee, issued an order on August 11, saying, “In the month of August 2020, it’s been decided that each and every teacher will conduct the admission drive in their area and admit at least 20 students to their schools. Accordingly, each and every principal will make sure to admit at least 200 new students with the cooperation of fellow teachers, staff/SMC, parents and local councillors.”Suryan said the SDMC will focus on creating awareness among parents. “Parents are scared for the safety of their kids. Particularly, parents of three- and four-year-olds are thinking that there is no point admitting their children when the schools are shut.”The north, east and south corporations run 765, 365 and 581 schools, respectively, and they cater to children up to class 5. The admission process in civic body schools this year was delayed by over three months due to the pandemic and began only on July 1. A similar situation has been reported in schools of east and north MCDs. In a nursery school of east municipal corporation, only six admissions have taken place so far. “Last year, we had 70 admissions to nursery. This time it’s negligible. We majorly get students from the very low-income group. Now we have started calling parents of our former students and asking them to send children from their neighbourhood,” the principal of the school, who wished not to be named, said. A principal of a north civic body school in Narela said five students have taken admission to the nursery as of now. “Last year, we had 29 students in the nursery. We have started distributing pamphlets to inform parents that admissions are open. We are also sending WhatsApp messages on our student groups as well.”Ira Singhal, the spokesperson of the north civic body, said, “We are also conducting an admission drive engaging our teachers and school management committee (SMC) members to boost the number of admissions.” EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said, “We have started collecting data on admissions. We will also launch a drive if required.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said learning will slow down in early years if the parents do not enrol children in entry-level classes amid the pandemic. “We will have to find other ways to mitigate the loss when the situation comes back to normal. But this should not put pressure on schools to open early since the first job of a school is to provide a safe learning space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fewer-nursery-admissions-in-mcd-schools-sdmc-kicks-off-special-drive/story-Smo9iWK6PUvOupUADDJpRM.html
15-08-2020||Delhi||Private neighbourhood clinics shut, patients struggle to treat minor ailments||Even though Delhi has gradually unlocked over the past three months amid the Covid-19 pandemic, residents from across neighbourhoods complain that general practitioners are yet to open their clinics for consultations. Most hospitals have opened their outpatient departments (OPD) for non-Covid patients but the fear of contracting the infection is keeping people away. Naveen Upadhyay, 67, a resident of Dwarka sector 4, said local clinics have not reopened since the lockdown was enforced on March 25. He is severely diabetic and his wife needs regular consultation for high blood pressure. “My wife fell ill two weeks ago and we wanted to get her BP checked and consult a doctor. But the clinic where we usually go has not opened yet. My son checked for doctors in the area but none have opened up. Finally, we managed to get a phone consultation but my wife could neither get a physical examination nor her BP checked. I have bought a BP monitoring machine now to avoid such instances of emergency in the future,” Upadhyay said. Upadhyay is not alone. Many people from all over Delhi are facing such problems. Private clinics, mostly located in residential areas, are primary health care service providers in several neighbourhoods for mild ailments such as flu, minor aches and pains and regular checkups. People also prefer visiting local general practitioners to avoid the hassle of visiting a hospital. Mrinalini Chatterjee of south Delhi’s CR Park said she experienced a bout of headache and vomiting last week but she was forced to go to a private hospital. “I waited in the car until my turn came because I was scared of contracting an infection. In large hospital set-ups, it is difficult to ascertain how many people gather. There should be some guidelines asking private clinics to resume services. Coronavirus might continue for a few months, does that mean people with other illnesses will be left to fend for themselves?” Chatterjee said. HT tried contacting 30 private clinics across the city to know how many were open for consultation. Nine were providing phone consultations and six were open for a physical check. Dr Amit Pradhan, who runs a private clinic in IP Extension, said he has not opened his clinic since the lockdown to avoid crowding. However, he has been providing consultations through video conferencing. In cases where physical examination is necessary, home visits are also provided. “This is just a precautionary measure. My clinic is a small space, which often gets crowded in the evenings. No one wants to shut their business and sit home, but these are extraordinary times and doctors, like any other professionals, are trying to find a way to get through,” Pradhan said. Patients with Covid-19 symptoms also complained they are facing difficulties in getting prescriptions from doctors to get tests done. Sudhir Pal, a retired army official, who lives in north Delhi’s Pitampura, said his 29-year-old son was experiencing typical Covid-19 symptoms from June 23. However, it took them a week to get a prescription from a local doctor. “The first three days, my son’s condition was very worrying. We kept insisting we should get a Covid-19 test done but the doctor kept postponing it, saying he will monitor the situation for some more days. On the eighth day, we got a go-ahead and on the ninth day he was tested and ended up positive. It will be hard to explain what we went through in those days. When I am willing to pay for the test, why should I have to run from pillar to post to get an approval?” Pal said. A senior official of the union ministry of health and family welfare said the idea behind directing states to allow private practitioners to prescribe coronavirus tests was to increase testing and make tests more accessible to people. “It would depend on the state government on how they are pushing private doctors to engage patients with symptoms and prescribe testing. Many are opting for online prescriptions after observing symptoms for over three days and that is a good way to follow,” the official said. A response from Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain’s office clarified that there was no restriction on the operation of private clinics. “We are encouraging most testing and OPD facilities in all Delhi government hospitals are open,” the response read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-neighbourhood-clinics-shut-patients-struggle-to-treat-minor-ailments/story-JIUzCK17OnTZJwEe8XtycI.html

15-08-2020||Delhi||AIIMS doctor found dead inside south Delhi flat, police say he left behind a note||The decomposed body of a research fellow at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was found on Friday afternoon in his rented flat in south Delhi, police said. The 40-year-old was from a mid-nineties MBBS batch of AIIMS and had been staying alone in his flat for over a decade. He had returned to the hospital for research in the paediatrics department on a project. Senior police officers said that their preliminary inquiry suggests that the doctor allegedly hanged himself inside the flat. “The flat’s main door was bolted from inside. Prime facie, it appears to be a case of suicide. However, the reason is still not known. So far, no foul play is suspected.”Police said they have found a note purportedly written by the doctor. A police officer paraphrasing the contents of the note, said that the doctor wrote that he was choosing to end his life as he did not see any reason to live for 70-80 years and did not want to hide his “mental condition”. The doctor was unmarried. The officer said the doctor’s family members have told the police that he had made a similar attempt on his life in the past as well. A doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity said, “He had been undergoing treatment at AIIMS for a psychiatry disorder till some time back and after he became a little better, he lost touch with his regular therapist.” “He preferred to remain alone and did not interact with others,” the doctor said. AIIMS has seen a spate of suicide among its students as well as patients. In the last four months, there have been eight death by suicides at the hospital. These include the daughter of a deceased cancer patient who jumped off a building on May 9, a 22-year old man who hung himself from a staircase on June 5, a journalist, under treatment for Covid-19, who jumped off the trauma centre building on July 6, a junior doctor who jumped off the hostel building on July 10, and a person who hung himself in the bathroom on July 17. Another MBBS student jumped off the building at the hospital just earlier this week. Doctors from the hospital had said that he had been depressed and under treatment at the hospital. In Friday’s incident, DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that a call was received at the Hauz Khas police station at 3.10 pm, regarding a foul smell emanating from a house in an area close to AIIMS campus. A police team reached there and found that the house was locked from inside. They broke open the door and found a man’s body hanging inside. “The doctor originally belonged to a north Indian state. He had last joined his office in AIIMS on August 11 (Tuesday). Other details about him and the exact reason behind his extreme step are still being ascertained,” the DCP said adding that inquest proceedings have been initiated in the death. “We already have a student wellness wing, where counselling services are provided. There are counsellors available at the hostels as well. We have an emergency number where people can call too. However, we are looking at ways to provide better support to our students. It is unfortunate that meritorious students like the ones studying here are taking such steps,” said another doctor, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiims-doctor-found-dead-inside-south-delhi-flat-police-say-he-left-behind-a-note/story-sJNCAtA0XilepkyriNOuuM.html
15-08-2020||Noida||How Covid control room helps people cope with the pandemic||The 30 telephone lines set up at the Covid-19 integrated control room (ICR) in Noida’s Sector 59 keep buzzing with pandemic-related queries. A man who has just landed from Dubai wants to know the results of his mother’s second Covid-19 test, a mother-daughter duo who tested positive for the infection are enquiring about when an ambulance will come to pick them up, while another resident wants to know how to quarantine himself till his test results arrive. It is a regular Thursday afternoon, but the staff at the control room find themselves inundated with queries.Set up by the Gautam Budh Nagar administration and district police with support from tech giant HCL Technologies on April 4, the ‘all-in-one’ integrated control room has till date received more than 2.53 lakh calls on its toll-free number – 1800-419-2211.According to its staff, the control rooms gets at least 350 calls daily on average which is still far less than the average 1,000 daily call it used to get during the lockdown.District surveillance officer (DSO), Dr Manoj Kumar Kushwaha, said the number of phone calls at the control room have reduced ever since the central government rolled back the restrictions imposed during the lockdown. “Earlier, the control room would receive many calls from people inquiring about food and shelter, about people wanting to go to their hometowns apart from residents calling to complain about people coming from districts but not quarantining themselves. But, now we mostly get Covid-19 test-related queries, people testing positive and requiring ambulances to go to the hospital and people with symptoms who want to know where they get themselves tested,” he said.The telephone lines at the control room are manned by 27 personnel from different departments who then forward the calls depending on the kind of query to one of seven different units established in the control room. The seven units—home isolation, containment zone, sampling and surveillance, facility allocation and self-declaration, contact tracing, rapid response, and ambulance and sanitization-engage a total of 175 officials and workers.District magistrate Suhas LY said in the home isolation unit, which gets the maximum number of calls these days, has a strength of over 40 staffers, including the chief development officer (CDO), sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), district panchayat raj officer (DPRO) —who are administrative in-charges, additional chief medical officer (ACMO) —the medical in-charge, nine doctors, a data manager, and 26 phone operators. “When this team gets information about the patients testing positive for Covid-19, it gets in touch with the asymptomatic patients and asks them to report immediately to L-1 facilities (for mild-care). The patients are then evaluated by a team of doctors if they are fit enough to be isolated at home. We ask the patients to then download the UP Covid-19 surveillance mobile application so that they can be monitored at home,” he said.The DM further said at the time of patients’ transfer from the hospital to their home, an online form is filled which includes all their personal details and health vitals. “Also, an undertaking is signed by the patient, and a home fitness certificate is issued by the doctor. Patients are also given the ‘Covid kavach (shield) kit’ and their details are immediately transferred virtually to the control room for further monitoring and coordination,” he said.Chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said a detailed online and offline database of all the patients is maintained and a team of doctors, paramedics and teachers monitor these patients round the clock. “We track their progress through the UP Covid-19 app and the control room also keeps a close tab on then the patients asking about their oxygen levels, temperature and any other complaints they have,” he said.Patients, who need to be treated at a Covid-19 facility, are looked after by the facility allocation team. “We contact the Covid-19 patients to trace their location. The list of patients who are not present in any facility and need treatment are given to the rapid response team for shifting of those patients to a facility. The database of all traced patients’ locations is updated on our portal,” said Dr Kushwaha.The containment zone cell, run by four people- a nodal officer, a doctor, and two support staff, maintains the database of the addresses of all Covid-19 patients in the district. “After sorting the database, sealing suggestions with every patient’s address long with de-sealing dates are given to all SDMs/magistrates concerned. All SDMs send the conformation lists after sealing the given addresses which are added to the district containment zone list. Daily de-sealing list is prepared and given to all SDMs and the same addresses are removed from the district containment zone list,” the doctor working for the team, who preferred anonymity, said.The staff at the control room which runs its 24 hours (in two shifts) throughout the week diligently maintains two registers as well—one for noting down calls with medical requests, reports of symptoms and requests for ambulances, while the other for complaints including containment zones, people flouting quarantine norms within containment zones, “Every call is noted down with the caller’s complete details so that no patient goes missing from our database in the future,” said one of the staffers.HCL’s technical team, which provides support to the control room personnel, works remotely from home.A team of police officers is also deployed at the control room to keep a close watch on law and order issues. Commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that at the beginning of the lockdown, the control room was instrumental in monitoring those suffering from respiratory issues and fever and then became important for coordinating and monitoring the health of migrants arriving in the district. “The control room was involved in collecting feedback on issues such as rations, food distribution, and quarantine facilities. The police commissionerate itself has provided ration and food packets to more than two lakh families so far. The helpline registers all Covid-related calls separately and operators also call residents back to check if their queries and complaints have been resolved within 24 hours or not,” Singh said.“The technical support unit (TSU) has also created a portal to integrate data from surveillance officers, labs and medical facilities which played a crucial role in analysing data and contact-tracing of Covid-positive patients’ Singh said, adding it was the database prepared by the control room which helped in ensuring the safe return of students and migrant workers to their hometowns a few months ago.It was police commissioner Singh who had first discussed the idea of setting up the control room with the principal secretary for medical education, Rajnish Dubey, just before the chief minister’s visit in March, and after getting the nod from the state government, the district police and administration approached HCL for providing infrastructural support for the control room. “I am thankful to the Nadar family (founders of HCL), especially Roshni Nadar (chairperson of HCL Technologies), who agreed to give all support to us in no time. The ultra-modern control room was finally set up April 4 for the purpose of resolving all problems related to the coronavirus pandemic under the same roof one platform,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/how-covid-control-room-helps-people-cope-with-the-pandemic/story-2cWdvMCv5QJUwmyEtYZUsO.html
15-08-2020||Noida||Land worth ₹30 crore freed up from encroachments in Noida||The Noida authority freed up land worth ₹30 crore near Sector 150 in a demolition drive on Friday, said officials.The authority has intensified its action against land mafia encroaching upon notified land, they added. On Friday, the authority freed up 9,200 square metres of land meant for planned developed on khasra number 464 and 482 in Kondli Bangar village near Sector 150 which is home to dozens of newly-developed housing and commercial projects along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway.“The authority team has taken possession of the land whose cost is ₹30 crore as per the market rate. Our drive against the encroachments will continue followed by action against those who encroach notified land ,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The land grabbers had made tin sheds over this land to claim ownership, said authority officials. The authority’s land department team along with the police removed the tin sheds taking back the possession of the notified land. Notified land refers to identified or demarcated agricultural land, which is part of the planned development as per the Noida master plan-2031. Once the state government notifies a piece of land, nobody can construct any structure or building without requisite permission or approval from the Noida authority.Officials said it has started drive freeing up notified land to ensure that the land mafia does not plan unauthorised projects luring plot buyers. In the past, the authority has been warning the property buyers, through public notices and advertisements in newspapers, to not buy plots in unauthorised housing projects developed on notified land.“The land mafia grabs our land, then plans unauthorised housing projects and sells plots to buyers. Buyers lose their money when the authority demolishes their houses built illegally in such unauthorised projects. Therefore, the authority keeps appealing to property buyers not to fall into such traps,” a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/land-worth-30-crore-freed-up-from-encroachments-in-noida/story-aYtAC367VBlsTULpI1pWtO.html

15-08-2020||Chandigarh||Delay in setting up Covid facility: UT administrator to visit PGIMER||Even though a week has passed since the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) was directed to increase the bed capacity for severely ill Covid-19 patients, the institute has not been able to do so, prompting the Chandigarh administration to plan a visit to the hospital.The directions had been issued during a war room meeting, chaired by the UT administrator, last week. Besides PGIMER, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, had also been asked to earmark 100 beds for city’s patients. Seeing no outcome, the UT administration on Thursday gave a written communication to the institute for the same. When asked on Friday, the institute, in a written reply told Hindustan Times, said that they are finding the modalities to increase the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients.“Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is committed to provide treatment to citizens of the region. In the rough circumstances, we have developed a 200-bed Covid-19 centre, which has the capacity of providing critical care to 40 patients at a time. As directed by the administration, we are finding modalities to increase the bed capacity.” the response stated.When asked about the delay in setting up the facility, adviser to UT administrator, Manoj Parida said that the administrator on Friday communicated with the director of PGIMER, Dr Jagat Ram, on the issue following which he has decided to visit the institute.“UT administrator, along with the officers of Chandigarh administration will visit PGIMER after Independence Day to confirm that 100 new beds have been earmarked for the patients of Chandigarh. The visit will probably be on Wednesday,” Manoj Parida said.Meanwhile, GMCH-32 will convert a part of Block A of the hospital into a facility for Covid-19 patients.“Hundred more beds have been earmarked for Covid-19 patients on the 4th and 5th floor of Block A. All the beds have oxygen support while five more ventilators are being installed in the same areas for severely ill patients,” said Dr BS Chavan, director-cum-principal of GMCH-32||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delay-in-setting-up-covid-facility-ut-administrator-to-visit-pgimer/story-uIMMPwE6yeMAbknYzJPedN.html
15-08-2020||Pune||Pune railway division treats staff down with Covid||Pune railway division may be the only railway division in the state to treat its employees and relatives who are Covid-19 positive by creating infrastructure and setting up a medical team. Till date, 433 railway employees of Pune division underwent Covid test at the divisional railway hospital (DRH) and 232 staff were declared positive. Since the treatment started at DRH Pune, 232 employees were tested positive and 177 of these were discharged after being declared cured. The staff who died of the infection are 18. Currently, 12 positive patients are admitted at DRH and 29 critical cases are sent to other private and government hospitals for treatment. “Since lockdown restrictions were implemented in the city from March-end, we started treating our infected staff at our DRH. Compared to other divisions our DRH is small, but we decided to give treatment to employees as per the guidelines given by the health ministry. We are giving treatment to railway employees under the Pune railway division, their family members and retired staff.Swab testing facility is also available at DRH and treatment is given to patients showing mild and moderate symptoms. Critical patients are shifted to other Covid hospitals in the city. As our DRH was not a Covid designated hospital to treat positive cases, we contacted Pune Municipal Corporation and received their approval,” said Pune divisional railway manager (DRM) Renu Sharma. To treat Covid cases, central oxygen supply system was also set up at DRH. The hospital has 50 beds, including 20 oxygen beds and 10 beds for suspected patients. While the medical staff includes, 11 doctors and 19 nurses, three more doctors were deployed on temporary basis. “We started treating cases from the last week of March. We also added more beds with oxygen facility. Also, on temporary basis, three doctors and 18 nurses were recruited. Pune railway division is the only division in the state to treat staff,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-railway-division-treats-staff-down-with-covid/story-MfMJO8b05D2UUaP24iH5PL.html
15-08-2020||Mumbai||51.5kg sea cucumbers worth ₹1 crore seized in Lakshadweep||A fresh consignment of 54 sea cucumbers weighing around 51.5 kg worth ₹1 crore was seized near Agatti Airport, Lakshadweep on Thursday. This comes amid the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) taking over all major sea cucumber poaching offence cases in Lakshadweep.Acting on a tip-off, the Lakshadweep Sea Cucumber Protection Task Force seized the consignment consisting dead sea cucumbers processed with preservatives and kept ready for further transportation to mainland, said officials. Sea cucumbers are invertebrates, which can grow up to 6 feet, and are high in demand across south-east Asia, mainly China, for food and traditional medicine. In India, the species is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and the Union environment ministry imposed a ban on harvesting sea cucumbers in 2001.In February, the Lakshadweep Islands administration announced the creation of the world’s first conservation area, covering 239 square kilometre, for endangered sea cucumbers. Officials said organised networks in Lakshadweep which export sea cucumbers for short-term monetary gains have been destroying the natural ecosystem. “We have learnt that the latest recovered consignment may have been part of six other similar ones (which are yet to be traced). This highlights that the illegal trade is still at large. Based on the size of the species, we believe they have been hunted from uninhabited islands where such large sea cucumbers are found,” said Damodhar AT, secretary of department of environment and forest and chief wildlife warden of Lakshadweep administration. A case has been registered under WPA, and further investigation is underway to nab the offenders, he said.Meanwhile, the Union environment ministry has agreed to form Lakshadweep Marine Wildlife Protection Force by engaging 350 personnel titled Marine Wildlife Protection Watchers (MWPW), who will be placed across 10 the islands. The ministry has sanctioned ₹2.72 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal which includes expenditure for establishing three anti-poaching camps in Veliyapani, Thinnakkara and Suheli islands, all of which are uninhabited.“MWPW will guard these isolated locations through round-the-clock surveillance for all activities in lagoon areas to protect not only sea cucumbers but all other Schedule I species from poaching and prevent wildlife offences in Lakshadweep,” said Damodhar.Marine biologist and interim director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) Deepak Apte said the issue needs to be investigated at both national and international scale on priority. “This is about the sovereignty of the territorial waters, because we are unaware of the links of these offenders. Unless punishments are strong, such risks will continue,” said Apte. “The fishing community has to be made aware that this is illegal. They should also be made aware that historically they have been a nature conservation-oriented community, and that such acts tarnish the image of islanders.”Earlier on February 12, Lakshadweep witnessed the largest global seizure of the species as a consignment of 1,716 sea cucumbers worth ₹4.26 crore weighing 852 kg was seized from Suheli. On January 21, an international trade kingpin was arrested and a consignment of 52 dead sea cucumbers was seized. On January 15, 172 sea cucumbers weighing 234kg worth ₹1.17 crore were seized and four persons were arrested as part of an international marine animal trafficking syndicate. The fourth case was in November 2018 when the same trade kingpin (arrested on January 21) was caught with a 8.75-kg consignment. The kingpin, who was arrested, had managed to escape from custody back then.In view of these three cases, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau in February requested the Interpol to issue a purple notice (a category that aids efforts to tackle environment crime and issues notices for criminals hunting wild animals to sell their body parts in the international market). Following this, CBI took over all the three cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/51-5kg-sea-cucumbers-worth-1-crore-seized-in-lakshadweep/story-qEfu5VXkPeITEy8FJrzS6N.html
