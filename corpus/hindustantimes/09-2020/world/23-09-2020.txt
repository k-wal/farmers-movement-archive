23-09-2020||World||Covid vaccine to be widely available by April, says CDC chief||Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told senators that he didn’t mean to imply last week that it could take into the second half of next year for enough Covid-19 vaccine to be available to inoculate all Americans.Redfield said at a Senate health committee hearing Wednesday that about 700 million vaccine doses should be available by April, echoing a timeline laid out by Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, last week.The vaccine candidates that are furthest along in development will require a two-dose regimen. Redfield’s comments last week, in an appearance before a different Senate panel, were “alluding to how long I thought it would take to get those doses into the American public,” he said. It could take through July to disburse the vaccine to all Americans that want one, Redfield said.President Donald Trump said last week that he had called Redfield after his earlier testimony to tell him his comments weren’t correct.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed Wednesday with the timeline of 700 million doses by April.Political QuestionsThe heads of U.S. health agencies attempted during the hearing Wednesday to reassure the public that staff are making decisions, particularly surrounding a vaccine, based on science, not politics. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn committed to taking any inoculation his agency authorizes.“FDA will not authorize or approve a vaccine that we would not feel comfortable giving to our families,” Hahn said.The agency plans to “provide additional information so that it is clear what we expect” from vaccine manufacturers that apply for emergency authorization of a shot, Hahn said. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s biologics office that oversees vaccines, said Sept. 10 that the agency would put out guidelines for vaccine makers that will set a higher bar for emergency authorization.Redfield said that CDC data indicates 90% of Americans are still susceptible to the virus.Health officials also said they were dismayed at studies showing that “a disturbing number” of people who recover from Covid-19 experience inflammation in their heart muscles, Fauci said. The inflammation is “really quite puzzling,” Fauci told lawmakers, and it remains to be seen whether it will subside or whether those who have had the virus could suffer from cardiovascular issues later on.“These are the kinds of things that tell us we must be humble,” Fauci said, “that we do not completely understand the nature of the virus.”Childhood CasesIn another area of concern, hospitalization rates among children with Covid-19 increased during the summer, according to CDC’s prepared remarks for the hearing.“Though the mortality rate is low for children aged 18 years and younger, Covid-19–associated hospitalization rates increased among this age group during the summer,” according to the testimony.The CDC has previously reported that from March 1 through July 25, 1 in 3 children admitted to a hospital for Covid-19 ended up in an intensive-care unit. The number of pediatric hospitalizations is still small compared with adults, but the data do highlight that kids aren’t immune to the virus -- as President Donald Trump has claimed -- and can suffer serious illness.The percentage of all hospitalizations for Covid-19 that involve children rose from 0.8% May 21 to 1.7%, totaling 5,016, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on Sept. 17. Children represented 10.3% of the more than 5.7 million Covid-19 cases in the U.S., the academy said. When the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year, the CDC originally said children represented 2% of Covid-19 cases.Redfield didn’t immediately expand on the prepared remarks, but a CDC report shows that weekly hospitalizations for all ages related to Covid-19 hit a second peak the week ending July 18. Weekly adult hospitalizations fell between the weeks ending Aug. 1 and Sept. 12, while the rates among children remained steady during that time period, the CDC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-to-be-widely-available-by-april-says-cdc-chief/story-BbBjplJBJPVS0PswmNXwKN.html

23-09-2020||World||Pak oppn divided over army dictating policy on Gilgit Baltistan||Cracks have emerged in Pakistan’s newly formed opposition alliance over Gilgit Baltistan, with PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif saying the issue of giving provincial status to the disputed region should have been discussed in parliament and not at the GHQ, the military headquarters. “They (leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement) were called (to the GHQ) on the issue of Gilgit Baltistan. This is a political issue that should be settled by the people's representatives.... These issues should be decided in the parliament, not in the GHQ,” she told media on Wednesday.Her comments came a day after Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence director general Lt Gen Faiz Hameed discussed the prospects of giving GB the status of a province in a meeting with the opposition alliance leaders. Leader of the opposition in parliament Shehbaz Sharif, who is Maryam Nawaz’s uncle, along with his party colleagues Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal, attended the meeting on behalf of the PML-N while the PPP was represented by party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and senator Sherry Rehman.She also pointed out that no representative of her father, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, met the army chief. This statement is seen as an attack on Shahbaz Sharif, who is also the president of the PML-N party. Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the meeting with the military leadership ahead of the opposition parties’ all parties conference but made no further comments. Reacting to Maryam Nawaz’s statement, railways minister Sheikh Rasheed said that the PML-N leadership held two, not one, meetings in the last two months with the military leadership, adding a rift had emerged between Maryam Nawaz and Shahbaz Sharif over the leadership of the PML-N party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-divided-over-army-dictating-policy-on-gilgit-baltistan/story-4aHlJAy9CMJUpkmX0OEG5O.html
23-09-2020||World||Pakistan to hold assembly elections in disputed Gilgit Baltistan on Nov 15||After moving ahead with plans to create a province in disputed Gilgit Baltistan (GB) despite India’s strong protests, Pakistan is planning to hold general elections for its legislative assembly on November 15, local media reported on Wednesday.New Delhi considers GB a part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and has consistently opposed changes made in the disputed region by Islamabad.A summary regarding the assembly election has been approved by President Arif Alvi and sent to Prime Minister Imran Khan for the final go-ahead, reports said. Analysts have said that once the elections are held, the government will move towards making GB a full province. The election date was announced after a meeting on Tuesday between opposition parliamentary leaders and the army high command, in which Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence director general Lt Gen Faiz Hameed discussed the prospects of giving GB the status of a province. Leader of the opposition in parliament Shehbaz Sharif, along with his party colleagues Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal, attended the meeting on behalf of the PML-N while the PPP was represented by party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and senator Sherry Rehman. With all stakeholders on board, the process to make GB a full province within the Pakistan federation has been started, said an observer. Earlier this month, the minister for Kashmir and GB affairs, Ali Amin Gandapur had announced that the government had decided in principle to elevate GB to the status of a full-fledged province with all constitutional rights, including representation in parliament. He told a delegation of visiting journalists from GB at a meeting in Islamabad that Khan would visit the region and make a formal announcement in this regard. Gandapur had also clarified that after the grant of constitutional rights, the subsidy and tax exemption on wheat given to the region would not be withdrawn. New Delhi had conveyed to Pakistan several times that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession. In May, the external affairs ministry said Pakistan or its judiciary had no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it and rejected attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. “Instead, Pakistan should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” the ministry had said.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-assembly-elections-in-disputed-gilgit-baltistan-on-nov-15/story-WNJJ3YiClYMNcKxCnjx1eL.html
23-09-2020||World||Russia’s Navalny released from German hospital after 32 days||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been released from a Berlin hospital after more than a month’s treatment for poisoning, with doctors now believing that a “complete recovery” from the Soviet-era nerve agent is possible for him, the hospital said Wednesday.Navalny spent 32 days at Berlin’s Charite hospital, 24 of them in intensive care, before doctors deemed his “condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged from acute inpatient care.”As he was released Tuesday, the 44-year-old displayed his characteristic sarcastic sense of humor. In an Instagram post, he took swipe at Russian President Vladimir Putin, scoffing at reported comments by the Russian leader suggesting that Navalny might have intentionally poisoned himself.Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is Putin’s most visible opponent, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. He spent those two days in a coma in a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk, where Russian doctors said they found no trace of any poisoning.German chemical weapons experts have determined that he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.The hospital said based on Navalny’s progress, physicians believe that a “complete recovery is possible,” but added it ”remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.”In recent days, Navalny has been posting regular photos of his convalescence from the hospital on Instagram, first showing him sitting up in his bed surrounded by his family, then up and about in the building.In his post Tuesday night, he laughed off a report in the French newspaper Le Monde saying that Putin suggested to French President Emmanuel Macron in a call that he “could have taken the poison himself.”“Good theory, I believe it deserves the most careful attention,” Navalny wrote in Russian. “Cooked Novichok in the kitchen. Took a sip from a flask on the plane. Fell into a coma.”He wryly wrote that the “ultimate aim of my cunning plan” must have been to die in Siberia, where the cause of death would be “lived long enough.”“But Putin outmaneuvered me. You can’t fool him,” Navalny wrote. “As a result, I lay in coma for 18 days like a fool, but didn’t get my way. The provocation failed!”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said the report about Putin’s conversation with Macron was “inaccurate in its reported wording,” but refused to elaborate as to which part was inaccurate. Macron’s office refused to comment on the report.The nerve agent used in the attack was the same class of Soviet-era poison that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the poisoning attempted murder and she and other world leaders have demanded that Russia fully investigate the case.Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote. Members of his team accused the Kremlin of involvement in the poisoning, charges that Russian officials have vehemently denied.Russia has bristled at the demands for an investigation, saying that Germany needs to share medical data in the case or compare notes with Russian doctors.Germany has noted that Navalny was in Russian treatment for 48 hours and that Russia has its own samples from Navalny. Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow needs data from Germany “to compare” tests results.Germany has also enlisted the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for technical assistance in the case. The agency has collected independent samples from Navalny for testing but results have not yet been announced.The Charite statement was released in consultation with Navalny and his wife, and the hospital would not comment further on any outpatient care for him.Navalny’s team has said he eventually plans to return to Russia, but had no immediate statement after his release from the hospital.Peskov said Wednesday that Navalny, “as any other Russian citizen,” is free to come back to Russia “at any moment.” He reiterated that what happened to the him remains “a big question” for the Kremlin, as Russian investigators “don’t have any facts pointing to” poisonous substances in Navalny’s body.Peskov once again called for Germany, France and Sweden to share their data with Moscow.“We’re still expecting it and are convinced that it can help us make significant progress in this case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-navalny-released-from-german-hospital-after-32-days/story-eZbsjbKRpNUlJiIdlcyP9N.html

23-09-2020||World||Pakistan’s 39-yr-old NSA a key player in army’s Gilgit move that suits China||Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa has fronted Pakistan’s exercise to create a province in disputed Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the occupied Northern Areas, holding a quiet meeting with the country’s politicians on the topic before a minister went public with Islamabad’s plans last week. But the army, people familiar with the matter said, isn’t driving the creation of the fifth province alone.A 39-year-old has also been hard at work. Moeed W Yusuf.Yusuf, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on National Security Division and Strategic Planning, has been a principal player in Islamabad’s decision to revoke the notional autonomy granted to Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and incorporate the disputed region as one of Pakistan’s five provinces, Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said, describing Pakistan’s young National Security Adviser as one of the project’s key driving forces.Gilgit-Baltistan’s assimilation into the Islamic Republic works well with China that has poured billions of dollars - even if much of it is a loan - into the China Pakistan Economic Corridor to build an alternative supply route to the choked, and vulnerable Malacca Strait, the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The army has scaled up its presence in the GB region over the years to secure the CPEC that has faced some opposition from locals over concerns that it destroys the environment, culture and social fabric without much benefit to the people.The effort to change Gilgit-Baltistan’s disputed status also fits in well with Moeed Yusuf’s long-standing project to turn the Line of Control with India into an International Border. Back in 2009 when he was still an academic and building his ties to the establishment in Pakistan and the United States, Moeed Yusuf had advocated converting the LoC into the IB, with both sides maintaining sovereign control over the respective parts of Jammu and Kashmir.A Pakistan watcher said Moeed Yusuf explored the possibility of formalising the LoC as the border between the two countries nearly a decade later when he visited New Delhi in 2018. “By then, he had entrenched himself in the establishment in Washington via the US Institute of Peace and worked closely with the Pakistan Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence.,” he said.Yusuf had cultivated an image of being an advocate of Indo-Pak peace and resolution of the Kashmir issue at USIP. He did run into a bit of a controversy at USIP months before Imran Khan picked him as his special adviser in December 2019 when objections were raised about the public-funded institution becoming a venue of choice for hosting Pakistani officials at events reserved for select invitees. One South Asia expert Dr Christine Fair also alleged that Yusuf had been sharing sensitive information with Pakistani agencies using his position and access within the USIP.Moeed Yusuf is said to have continued to speak about his ideas on Indo-Pak relations after he joined Imran Khan’s team as well and plugged the agenda with General Bajwa and other top military officers.In his new role in Imran Khan’s team, his understanding and familiarity with the American system helped to position him as the main strategic thinker for the Pakistani leadership, particularly on dealing with the US Administration, Congress, bureaucracy and the think-tanks.Not much is known about his views on Pakistan’s support of terrorism to achieve political and diplomatic ends, particularly in Kashmir. Indian counter-terror officials said they had not heard of any instance where Moeed Yusuf had spoken of ending the establishment’s support to terrorists operating in India.“What we do know is that he did come up with the idea that Pakistan should not seek mediation on Kashmir over concerns that Islamabad could be placed in an awkward position if the US came up with a unilateral proposal, akin to Donald Trump’s Middle East Plan,” a senior Indian official said. This idea, however, did not find any support within the military and the foreign office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-39-yr-old-nsa-a-key-player-in-army-s-gilgit-move-that-suits-china/story-HWCRNNF2r0cYWFlY1T3KoL.html
23-09-2020||World||Trump administration’s ambassadorial nominee calls on Pakistan to act against terror||The Trump administration’s nominee for ambassador to Pakistan has said that Islamabad must take “sustained and irreversible” action against terrorism. In a statement to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Tuesday as part of his confirmation process, William E Todd said he will actively engage Pakistan on terrorism, strategic stability and non-proliferation if he is confirmed. “To truly reduce regional tensions, and rebuild a strong relationship with the United States, Pakistan must take sustained and irreversible action against terrorism. Pakistan has suffered terribly itself at the hands of terrorists and has committed publicly to ensure terrorists cannot use Pakistani territory to operate,” he said in his statement. He added, “Pakistan has taken important steps toward fulfilling that commitment but needs to continue that work. If confirmed, I will work with Pakistan to advance our shared interest in eliminating terrorism from its territory and advancing security in the region.” Also Read: Pakistan Hindu Council chief discusses Jodhpur deaths with foreign minister QureshiTodd referred to what he described as “regional dynamics” and said “although we have a strong relationship with India, that does not need to come at the expense of Pakistan”. He added, “I believe that under the right conditions, we can have a strong relationship with both countries. Our hope is that both countries will take the necessary steps to reduce tensions, and as President [Donald] Trump has offered, we are prepared to facilitate dialogue if both sides request it.”India has accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, especially in Kashmir. It has also repeatedly spurned all efforts by Trump to mediate between the two countries, saying differences with Pakistan are a bilateral matter. In his statement, Todd described the US-Pakistan ties as “a longstanding and important, but always complicated and sometimes contentious relationship”. He said: “We certainly have our differences, but Pakistan is an essential regional partner, and this is an opportune moment in our relationship to work together on shared goals. Peace in Afghanistan is in both our countries’ best interests, and effective US-Pakistani cooperation is essential to achieve that objective.”He recalled secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s remarks during a visit to Islamabad in 2018 about an “opportunity to reset the relationship between our two countries across a broad spectrum - economic, business, commercial - the work that we all know that we need to do to try to develop a peaceful resolution in Afghanistan that benefits certainly Afghanistan, but also the United States and Pakistan”. Also Read: India slams Turkish President Erdogan’s Kashmir remarks at UNGATodd said Pakistan played a “critical role in creating the conditions that brought Afghan leaders and the Taliban to the historic start of Afghan Peace Negotiations” and noted Islamabad has an “even more important role to play in supporting efforts toward a negotiated political settlement”. This represents an opportunity for Pakistan to “continue to forge a new and better role in the region”, he added. He said he would also engage Pakistan on strategic stability and non-proliferation, “carrying a clear message on the threat that nuclear weapons pose to the United States, the region, and our allies and partners”. Pakistan needs to “demonstrate it is prepared to live up to international commitments on weapons of mass destruction”, he added. Todd also listed three other key priorities that he would focus on if confirmed—advancing human rights, particularly freedom of religion and expression, increased bilateral trade and investment, and expanded youth engagement. “I was shocked and heartbroken that US citizen Tahir Naseem was killed in a Pakistani courtroom in which he was facing an accusation of blasphemy. I grieve with the family of Mr Naseem, and if confirmed, will engage Pakistani authorities on full accountability for the perpetrators,” he said.“I am also concerned about increasing restrictions on civil society, including the growing harassment and disappearances of journalists without accountability, which undermines the exercise of the right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of expression and association,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-s-ambassadorial-nominee-calls-on-pakistan-to-act-against-terror/story-yhkdtFGlgNdOtOMhh1IvZM.html
23-09-2020||World||UN unearths record low temperature for Northern Hemisphere||For all the recent talk of global warming, climate historians hunting for past temperature extremes have unearthed what the UN weather agency calls a new record low in the Northern Hemisphere — nearly -70 degrees Celsius (-93 F) was recorded almost three decades ago in Greenland.The World Meteorological Organizations publicly confirmed Wednesday the all-time cold reading for the hemisphere: -69.6 Celsius recorded on Dec. 22, 1991 at an automatic weather station in a remote site called Klinck, not far from the highest point on the Greenland Ice Sheet.“In the era of climate change, much attention focuses on new heat records,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas in a statement. “This newly recognized cold record is an important reminder about the stark contrasts that exist on this planet.”The temperature tally surpasses the -67.8°C recorded twice at Siberian sites of Oimekon in 1933 and Verkhoyanksk in 1892. The latter Russian site made headlines in recent months for recording what may be a new record-high temperature north of the Arctic Circle during a heatwave in the region.The new low was confirmed by so-called “climate detectives” working with the WMO’s Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes in Geneva.The agency, which was created in 2007, has been poring over historic data in search of records like high and low temperatures, greatest rainfall, and even of “heaviest hailstone” and “longest lightning flash.”It said that the record came to light after “a WMO blue-ribbon international panel of polar scientists tracked down the original scientists involved” from the Klinck automatic weather station than ran for two years in the early 1990.The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was the -89.2 Celsius (-128.6 F) recorded in 1983 at the high-altitude Vostok weather station in Antarctica, WMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-unearths-record-low-temperature-for-northern-hemisphere/story-GJrR3Ky4DdXkNPlpyiP0MO.html

He currently remains in federal custody.Federal prosecutors said the two companies owned by Syed provided high-performance computing platforms, servers, and software application solutions. From 2006 to 2015, Syed and BSI conspired with company employees in Pakistan to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by exporting computer equipment from the US to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) without obtaining the required authorisation from the US Department of Commerce, according to an indictment returned in the District Court in Chicago. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is a Pakistani government agency responsible for “the design, fabrication, and testing of high explosives and nuclear weapons parts, uranium mining and enrichment, and the development of solid-fuelled ballistic missiles.The indictment charged Syed and BSI with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and foreign trade regulations, and one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Syed, BSI and the other conspirators falsely represented to the US-based computer manufacturers that the illegal shipments were intended for Pakistan-based universities, Syed’s business, or Syed himself.As a matter of fact, they knew that the true end user and ultimate consignee of each shipment was either the PAEC or a research institute that trained the agency’s engineers and scientists, the indictment stated.In so doing, according to the indictment, Syed and his company caused the US-based computer manufacturers to submit to the US government shipping documents, including Shippers Export Declarations, that listed false end-users for the US-origin goods, thereby undermining the US government’s ability to stop the illegal shipments, the Department of Justice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-american-arrested-for-illegally-exporting-computer-equipment-to-pak-s-atomic-body/story-6ztyTXY0RjHpTckN9rzluO.html

23-09-2020||World||Most people infected with novel coronavirus develop symptoms: study||Most people who are infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that causes Covid-19, are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection, a review of studies carried early in the pandemic suggests. While some people who contract the novel coronavirus never experience any symptoms, there remains disagreement about what proportion of total infections these cases represent. The latest study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, suggests that true asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 comprise a minority of infections. According to the researchers at the University of Bern, Switzerland and colleagues, the full spectrum and distribution of the severity of Covid-19 symptoms are not well understood. Some people with the virus may experience severe infections resulting in viral pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and death, while others remain completely asymptomatic or develop mild, nonspecific symptoms. The researchers wanted to better understand the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and never develop any symptoms, as well as the proportion of people who are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but develop symptoms later. They systematically reviewed literature using a database of SARS-CoV-2 evidence between March and June, 2020. The researchers analysed 79 studies reporting empirical data on 6,616 people, 1,287 of whom were defined as asymptomatic, in order to determine the proportion of infected people who never developed symptoms. While the study was limited by its inability to ascertain the impact of false negatives, the researchers were able to estimate that 20 per cent of Covid-19 infections remained asymptomatic during follow-up. Accurate estimations of true asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and for populations to adopt appropriately tailored public health strategies, the researchers said. Improved accuracy of serological tests is also needed to reduce the number of false negatives, they said. Since each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 is initially asymptomatic, the proportion that will go on to develop symptoms is estimated to be around 80 per cent, suggesting that presymptomatic transmission may significantly contribute to overall SARS CoV-2 epidemics. “The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection,” said Diana Buitrago-Garcia at the University of Bern. “The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing and tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed,” Buitrago-Garcia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-people-infected-with-novel-coronavirus-develop-symptoms-study/story-kKgFwtJFxd6MGGqpG4X4wI.html
23-09-2020||World||Covid-19 cases surge as Israel prepares tighter measures||Israel on Wednesday reported a new record level of daily cases of coronavirus, shortly before government officials were to meet to discuss tightening a new nationwide lockdown.The health ministry reported 6,861 new cases Wednesday as a raging outbreak showed no signs of slowing. Israel, a country of some 9 million people, now has one of the world’s highest rates of coronavirus on a per capita basis, and health officials say hospitals are quickly approaching capacity.The government last week imposed a nationwide lockdown that closed schools, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants. The coronavirus cabinet was meeting later Wednesday to discuss further tightening the restrictions.Israel won international praise for its handling of the outbreak last spring, moving quickly to seal its borders and impose a lockdown that appeared to contain the virus. But the government reopened the economy too quickly, and a new outbreak has quickly spread throughout the summer. The economy, meanwhile, has not recovered from a serious downturn caused by the first lockdown.The health ministry has instructed hospitals to delay non-essential surgeries and to open additional coronavirus wards as the number of serious cases continues to rise.Beyond further limiting economic activity, officials have been discussing shuttering synagogues and clamping down on protests — both of which risk sparking a public backlash. The limits would come at a time when Israeli Jews are celebrating the High Holidays and when weekly demonstrations have been held against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his handling of the coronavirus crisis.Deputy health minister Yoav Kisch said restrictions would have to be tightened in the near future.“Educational institutions will be closed, the economy will be limited to essential work, synagogues will have no indoor prayers, with arrangements for outdoor prayer, and demonstrations will be allowed without protesters traveling between cities,” he told Channel 12 TV. “Everyone will demonstrate where he wants, will pray where he wants and will stay at home.

I sincerely hope that justice for the victims and their families will now be served.”El Sheikh’s mother had sought to block the evidence transfer for more that two years, arguing that turning over the information would violate data protection laws because it could lead to the execution of her son.US Attorney General Robert Barr last month promised that the two suspects wouldn’t face the death penalty if they were tried in American courts.Kotey and El Sheikh are alleged to have beheaded 27 people, including three US and two British hostages, while fighting for the so-called Islamic State group in Syria. They are believed to have been part of a four-man cell that became known as “the Beatles” because all four spoke with British accents.Both men were raised in London before traveling to Syria to join Islamic State. British authorities revoked their citizenship because of their actions in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-turns-over-evidence-to-us-in-islamic-state-beatles-case/story-DC2i4braGgojMYeSImBLPO.html
23-09-2020||World||China trails US in development of sixth-generation aircraft: Report||China, which in recent years tried to catch up with the US in the design and production of new generation warplanes, is trailing the American air force in the development of the sixth-generation fighter jets by several years, according to a media report. America is leading the world in the sixth-generation fighter jets with the US Air Force saying it has flown a prototype – a milestone that is still years away for China, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday. The US has two fifth-generation fighters in service: the Lockheed Martin F-22 and F-35, both with stealth, supersonic cruise, super maneuverability and superior avionics.Though lagging behind in the development of aircraft engines, China has produced a variety of new generation fighter aircraft including the stealth fighter, J-20 which is officially stated to be the fourth-generation fighter jet. The bulk of its advanced jets mostly comprise of Russia’s Sukhoi aircraft, including Su-27, Su-30KK and Su-35S, besides J-15 which has been specifically developed to operate from the decks of the aircraft carriers being developed by it. China currently has one aircraft carrier, Liaoning, a refit of the Soviet-era ship which was commissioned in 2012 and the second indigenously developed carrier, Shandong, is undergoing sea trials while the third one is under construction. The official media report says China plans to have six aircraft carriers. While focussing on the up-gradation of avionics, China’s new generation aircraft mostly rely on Russian engines. Also, China which helps its all-weather ally Pakistan to jointly produce JF-17 fighter jets, recently upgraded it with new Block-3 version. The upgraded JF-17 fighter jet featuring the technologies of China’s stealth fighter J-20 made its maiden flight early this year in the Chinese city of Chengdu. JF-17 Thunder, which was previously referred to as FC-1 Xiaolong, was previously a single-engine multi-role light fighter jointly produced by the two countries for several years with engines supplied by Russia. China’s fifth-generation fighter project began in 1997, but it was not until 2011 that the Chengdu J-20 had its first flight, and 2017 when it entered the service.Wang Haifeng, the chief designer of Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, which makes the J-20, confirmed earlier that China had started working on its next-generation fighter. “We have chosen and supplemented some technological features in line with various war scenarios,” the Post quoted Wang as saying. “I believe in 2035 or earlier you will see these efforts translated into powerful weapons to defend our airspace,” he said. The features of the future jets are still unknown but Wang said the aircraft could involve the application of artificial intelligence, extreme stealth and omnidirectional detection. He also mentioned laser weapons, self-adapting engines and hypersonic weapons as technologies that had the potential to change the future of warfare. Besides the US and China, Russia is at work on a sixth-generation combat plane, testing some of its technologies on the fifth-generation Su-57. A model of the Franco-German Future Combat Air System by Dassault and Airbus was also on display at last year’s Paris Air Show, with its maiden flight set for 2026. The British sixth-generation fighter Tempest by BAE reportedly had a wind tunnel test in August and is expected to be ready by 2035.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trails-us-in-development-of-sixth-generation-aircraft-report/story-4eh3653BUdeFACUixvHU1J.html
23-09-2020||World||Putin critic Alexei Navalny released from German hospital 32 days after ‘poisoning’||The German hospital treating Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny for poisoning said Wednesday that his condition improved enough for him to be released, and suggested a “complete recovery” from the nerve agent was possible.Navalny, 44, spent 32 days in treatment in Berlin’s Charite hospital, 24 of which were in intensive care, before doctors deemed his “condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged from acute inpatient care.”The hospital said that based on Navalny’s progress, treating physicians believe that “complete recovery is possible,” but added that it ”remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.”Navalny, the most visible opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia.German chemical weapons experts have determined he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.It was the same class of Soviet-era agent that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018, and Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders have called for Russia to fully investigate.Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote. Members of his team accused the Kremlin of involvement in the poisoning, charges that Russian officials have vehemently denied.Russia has bristled at the demands for an investigation, saying it needs Germany to share medical data or compare notes with the Russian doctors who said they found no trace of poison in his system while he was at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk.Germany has noted that Navalny was in Russian treatment for 48 hours, and that Russia has its own data.Germany has also enlisted the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for technical assistance in the case.Last week, the international agency said its experts had “ independently collected biomedical samples from Mr Navalny for analysis by OPCW designated laboratories”Results have not yet been announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-critic-alexei-navalny-released-from-german-hospital-32-days-after-poisoning/story-jGQS6W42XdWOwfSELU77TL.html

It was in reference to an incident in the Indian village of Lodta in Rajasthan state’s Jodhpur district on August 9, when 11 Pakistani Hindu migrants were found dead at a farm under mysterious circumstances, according to reports.According to a PTI report, the family had moved to India from Pakistan’s Sindh province in 2015 on long-term visas. They had been living in Lodta for the past six months, where they were hired to work on a farm.Earlier this month, Pakistan had summoned the India’s charge d’affaires in Islamabad to convey the government’s concern over the deaths, as per news reports.The Pakistan foreign ministry’s press statement said Vankwani briefed Qureshi about the anxiety in the Pakistani Hindu community over last month’s incident in Rajasthan. He said that Shrimati Mukhi, the daughter of the deceased head of the family, had filed an FIR in Sanghar over the incident. As per the press statement, Vankwani claimed that according to Mukhi, her father, mother and other family members were murdered after refusing to spy on Pakistan and issue anti-Pakistan statements at the behest of an Indian intelligence agency.The statement also said that the Pakistan foreign minister informed Vankwani that the government had taken up the issue with India through diplomatic channels in Islamabad and New Delhi.Immediately after the incident, the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi had asked the Indian government for access to a surviving member of the family, sharing of copies of the FIR and initial investigation report, and facilitating the presence of the high commission’s representatives during post-mortem of the deceased persons, the statement added.According to the press note, Qureshi assured Vankwani that the safety and security of Pakistani nationals was the responsibility of the Pakistan government. He added that since the victims of “Jodhpur incident” were Pakistani nationals, it was incumbent upon Islamabad to be fully aware of the circumstances under which the Pakistani nationals died in India.Appreciating the efforts made by the Pakistan government over the incident, Vankwani said the Hindu community would take necessary steps to register its protest over the deaths, the press statement concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hindu-council-chief-discusses-jodhpur-deaths-with-foreign-minister-qureshi/story-b0TF3zRi13PxvTgZyAgNYK.html

In Brooklyn, officials are concerned about Williamsburg, with a 2% positive rate, and a southern part of the borough that includes Midwood, Borough Park and Bensonhurst, where the positive rate is 4.71%.“It is now clear that these signals in the south of Brooklyn have coalesced into one cluster we are calling the Ocean Parkway Cluster,” Gallahue wrote in the email. “At this point in time, these increases could potentially evolve into more widespread community transmission and spread to other neighborhoods unless action is taken.”The department said it would continue to urge people to avoid large indoor gatherings, wear masks when socially distancing is not possible and to get tested for the virus frequently.“We will have more to say in the days ahead,” Gallahue wrote.

23-09-2020||World||Protest outside embassy in Nepal after new row over Chinese ‘encroachment’||The construction of 11 buildings by China in a part of the remote border district of Humla that Nepal claims as its own territory has triggered a border row between the two countries, with a spontaneous protest outside the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The buildings were constructed by the Chinese side in an area where a border pillar has been missing since Nepal built a road several years ago. There was only a hut in the area in 2005, according to Nepalese officials who visited the disputed area recently. “The Chinese side claimed that the area where the houses are built falls within the Chinese territory,” Bishnu Bahadur Tamang, chair of Namkha rural municipality, who visited the area on Sunday with a team of officials, told The Kathmandu Post. The construction of the buildings by Chinese security and border forces has been reported to Nepal’s home ministry. There was a spontaneous protest in front of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu on Wednesday afternoon against the “encroachment” of Nepalese territory in Humla district. The protesters chanted slogans and demanded China should vacate Nepalese territory immediately, videos posted on social media showed. Also Read: Fake pages from China tried to disrupt US politics, says FacebookBefore they were dispersed by police, the protesters also demanded the reopening of two border posts at Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi, which have been shut for 10 months and where goods imported from China worth billions of rupee have been stuck. A statement issued by the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu said the buildings in question “have been verified to be on the Chinese side of the China-Nepal border”. The statement added: “The Nepali side may make verification again. China and Nepal have no territorial disputes.” The statement described the two countries as “friendly neighbours” and said China has “always respected Nepal’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Media reports said that during an inspection by a Nepalese team led by chief district officer Chirinjbi Giri on Sunday, Chinese security officials claimed their territory extended one kilometre further south from the area where the buildings are located. Tamang, however, said Nepal’s territory extends two kilometres north from where the buildings are, The Kathmandu Post reported. “Of the 11 houses in the disputed area, security forces live in one and the others are empty,” Tamang said. Also Read: LAC row: Five things you need to know todayAfter Nepalese officials reached the disputed site on Sunday, Chinese security personnel arrived in a truck, a tanker and a jeep. They used a microphone to speak with the Nepalese officials and asked them to go to the border for talks. “We spent around one-and-a-half hours at the disputed area. After we reached, a team of Chinese army and security officials came and said talks cannot be held on their territory. Then we left,” Tamang said. “We claimed that area to be our territory, they showed us the map and said it is theirs.” Nepal’s home ministry dispatched a team comprising government officials, the head of security agencies and local government representatives to Namkha rural municipality to conduct an inspection and submit a report, which is expected at the end of the week. Chakka Bahadur Lama, the MP from Humla, said the dispute emerged after a border pillar in the area went missing. “As long as both sides do not ascertain the location of the missing pillar, the dispute will continue,” Lama said. “The pillar was damaged during a road construction on the Nepali territory some 12 years back. That area where the Chinese have allegedly built the concrete buildings is on the old yak caravan route used for trade between Nepal and Tibet.” During a meeting in 2015, Nepal and China had agreed to ascertain the location of the missing pillar, but no steps were taken subsequently, local officials said. The officials further said that if a straight line of demarcation is drawn from the last existing pillar towards the location of the missing pillar, the disputed land falls inside Nepalese territory. Parliamentarian Lama blamed negligence on the part of the Nepal government for the problem as the country’s security presence in the border area is less than that of the Chinese side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-11-structures-in-disputed-area-triggers-border-row-with-nepal-report/story-MmKmvpAwCbDJDSltHsZj7O.html
23-09-2020||World||Fake pages from China tried to disrupt US politics, says Facebook||Facebook says it has removed a small network of fake accounts and pages that originated in China and focused on disrupting political activity in the US and several other countries.The US-focused activity was just a “sliver” of the accounts’ overall activity and gained almost no following, Facebook said. Their primary focus was Southeast Asia, including the Philippines.In the US, the accounts posted material both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.Facebook did not link the network directly to the Chinese government. It said the people behind the network tried to conceal their identity and location via virtual private networks and other methods.Concerns about foreign efforts to interfere in the election were underscored by a warning Tuesday from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to try to spread disinformation regarding the results of the election, including by creating fake websites or social media content aimed at discrediting the process. The agencies noted that even if a foreign actor managed to tamper with an election-related website, the underlying data would remain uncompromised.US intelligence officials warned last month about ongoing or potential efforts by China, Russia and Iran to interfere in November’s election. In an August public assessment, the country’s chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, said officials had determined that Beijing regards Trump as unpredictable and wants to see him lose to Biden.The statement said that China had been expanding its influence operations ahead of the election to “shape the policy environment in the United States” and had been weighing the pros and cons of taking more aggressive action.Notably, though, the intelligence assessment was more specific in its characterisations of Russian interference, saying that Moscow was using a range of measures to denigrate Biden and that Kremlin-linked actors were propping up Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.The question of which country poses the biggest threat to election security has emerged as a politically fraught issue.Trump and several senior administration officials have repeatedly insisted that China is more aggressive, even though that characterization is not in line with the August intelligence assessment. After FBI Director Chris Wray outlined the threat of Russian interference at a congressional hearing last week and warned of its ongoing danger, Trump harangued him on Twitter by calling China a “FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.” Facebook said the network focused mainly on Southeast Asia, where it posted in Chinese, Filipino and English about global news and current events.These included Beijing’s interests in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, support for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter’s potential run in that nation’s 2022 presidential election, and criticism of Rappler, an independent news organization in the Philippines.Facebook also removed a second network originating in the Philippines. These accounts posted in Filipino and English about local news and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, a pending anti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-pages-from-china-tried-to-disrupt-us-politics-says-facebook/story-Pq9Vme8aJ1FIntJ6qzJdXO.html
23-09-2020||World||No deal with Israel, but Saudi pushes outreach to Jews||From scrubbing hate-filled school textbooks to a taboo-defying religious sermon, Saudi Arabia is pushing for another kind of normalisation after declining to establish formal relations with Israel -- co-existence with Jews.Saudi Arabia has said it will not follow its allies Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in establishing diplomatic relations without a resolution to the Palestinian issue, even as it cultivates clandestine ties with the Jewish state.Having Saudi Arabia, an Arab powerhouse and epicentre of Islam, forge a similar deal would be the ultimate diplomatic prize for Israel, but the kingdom is wary that its citizens -- sympathetic to the Palestinian cause -- may not be ready for a full embrace.Saudi Arabia, however, is pushing to change public perceptions about Jews with a risky outreach to a community that has long been vilified by the kingdom’s clerical establishment and media, laying the groundwork for an eventual recognition.School textbooks, once well-known for denigrating Jews and other non-Muslims as “swines” and “apes”, are undergoing revision as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s campaign to combat extremism in education, officials say.“The Saudi government has also decided to prohibit the disparagement of Jews and Christians in mosques,” said Saudi analyst Najah al-Otaibi.“Anti-Jewish rhetoric was common at Friday prayers of the imams in mosques used to address Muslims around the world.”In a stunning U-turn, a preacher in the holy city of Mecca triggered a social media storm this month when he spoke of Prophet Mohammed’s friendly relations with Jews to advocate religious tolerance.The sermon was by Abdulrahman al-Sudais, the imam of Mecca’s Grand Mosque who courted controversy in the past for strongly anti-Semitic views.‘When, not if’ Mohammed al-Issa, a Saudi cleric who heads the Muslim World League, won praise from Israel in January after he travelled to Poland for events marking 75 years since the Nazi death camp Auschwitz was liberated.Earlier this year, the kingdom announced the screening of a Holocaust-themed film for the first time at a movie festival, before it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.The kingdom has also pursued a bold outreach to Jewish figures, including in February when King Salman hosted a Jerusalem-based rabbi, David Rosen, for the first time in modern history.“When it comes to Saudi Arabia and Israel establishing relations, it is a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’,” said Marc Schneier, an American rabbi with close relations to Gulf rulers.“Part of the process that all Gulf countries have and are going through on the road to normalisation is first pushing warmer ties between Muslims and Jews and then moving more boldly into discussing Israel and the Gulf.”Arab News, the kingdom’s main English-language daily, whipped up a social media storm at the weekend when it briefly changed its social media banner on Twitter and Facebook with a greeting in Hebrew for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.The newspaper recently published a lengthy series on the Jews of Lebanon, and plans a similar instalment on an ancient Jewish community that lived in what is today Saudi Arabia.The newspaper’s editor Faisal Abbas told AFP the coverage “was not tied to Israel” but aimed at connecting with “Arab Jews worldwide”.‘Difficult to happen’ The coverage marks a departure for tightly controlled media in the absolute monarchy.Saudi media outlets have previously branded the Jewish state as the “Zionist” enemy, but largely hailed the recent deals struck with the UAE and Bahrain.Fuelling speculation about quietly warming relations with Israel were two television dramas on the Saudi-controlled MBC network during this year’s fasting month of Ramadan.In a controversial scene in one of the shows, “Exit 7”, one Saudi character brushes aside the taboo of doing business with Israel, saying Palestinians are the real “enemy” for insulting the kingdom “day and night” despite decades of support.The moves indicate that the kingdom is not opposed to normalisation with the Jewish state after having resolutely supported the Palestinians politically and financially for decades, observers say.But Israel formalising relations with unelected Arab governments “is not the same as Israel making ‘peace’ with Arab people”, said Giorgio Cafiero, the chief executive of Gulf State Analytics.Data from a rare Saudi public opinion poll published last month by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy suggests many Saudi citizens are not in favour of a deal.Despite the Saudi media outreach to Israelis and Jews, “a mere nine percent of Saudis” agreed that people in favour of business or sports contacts with Israelis should be allowed to do so, according to the Institute’s David Pollock.“What peace? Peace after all that (Israel) has done, killing and war?” Bader, a young Saudi citizen in Riyadh, told AFP.“It’s difficult for this to happen between (Saudis and Israelis). I won’t support it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-deal-with-israel-but-saudi-pushes-outreach-to-jews/story-gOXFJ8vtWz2JDyPEgW8UBI.html
23-09-2020||World||US passes 200,000 Covid-19 deaths as spread quickens worldwide||The United States has passed 200,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, as a record-breaking wave of new infections forces authorities in Europe to reimpose lockdown restrictions.The world’s most powerful nation hit the figure just 41 days before a presidential election, and as the World Health Organization warned that new cases worldwide have risen to record highs.US President Donald Trump -- who faces a tough re-election fight and is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in the polls -- said the 200,000 milestone was “a shame” and deflected blame onto China.Trump used a video address to the annual United Nations General Assembly to attack Beijing for not stopping the spread of what he called the “China virus.”“We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world -- China,” he told the UN’s diplomatic showcase event, which is being held almost entirely online because of the pandemic.Trump has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis, even as the United States has suffered one of the world’s highest death tolls.According to an AFP tally, worldwide more than 31 million people have been infected and nearly 962,000 have died from Covid-19 since the virus emerged in the eastern Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The World Health Organization reported late Monday that almost two million infections were recorded around the globe in the single week to September 20.The six percent increase versus the previous week is “the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic”, the UN health agency said.Get through’ winterIn Europe, a surge forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce fresh steps to try to allay the rising death toll. “To help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so,” the government said, despite fears of a devastating economic impact.New rules come into force for pubs and other hospitality venues on Thursday and plans to allow fans back into sporting events have been ditched.Several Premier League football players have tested positive, sending them into isolation and forcing games to be postponed. Johnson warned the new restrictions could last up to six months and called for a collective effort to “get through this winter together”. His scientific advisors had said the United Kingdom could see a devastating 50,000 coronavirus cases a day by mid-October if no action is taken.“Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour,” said Johnson, who like Trump has been widely criticised for his handling of the pandemic.Even with citizens weary of months of social distancing and previously unthinkable restrictions on their lives, hundreds of millions face harsher measures to come.After months of brutal lockdown was eased, Spain’s health minister on Tuesday called on Madrid residents to limit their movements and social contact to the “essential”.Some 850,000 people in part of the Madrid region are now again under lockdown.Across Europe, hundreds of major events have been scaled back or cancelled. For the first time since 1944 the most august of all gatherings, the Nobel prize ceremony, will not take place as normal in Stockholm this year, and will instead be televised.The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Norway in December will also be scaled back.Austria Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told AFP that fighting the pandemic remained “a very big challenge”, as his country extended mandatory mask wearing and re-instated some restrictions imposed earlier this year.“I am still relatively young, but I have been part of the Austrian government for many years and I thought I had already been through a lot politically,” the 34-year-old conservative leader said in an interview. “The corona crisis now exceeds all previous experiences of course.” Return to MeccaIn a rare glimmer of hope, Saudi Arabia announced that it will gradually resume the year-round umrah pilgrimage for Muslims from October 4.The kingdom had suspended the umrah in March and later scaled back the annual hajj in a blow to millions of Muslim pilgrims around the world amid fears that the coronavirus could spread to Islam’s holiest sites.In the first stage, “6,000 citizens and residents within the kingdom will be allowed to perform the umrah per day from October 4”, the interior ministry said in a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency.In Australia, authorities eased some restrictions that had seen domestic inter-state travel virtually banned.Like neighbouring New Zealand, restrictions have driven the rate of community transmission close to zero in much of Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-200-000-covid-19-deaths-as-spread-quickens-worldwide/story-6lWYa7cUIWAZ2PookZaY1K.html

Results of the study, conducted by subsidiary Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, were statistically significant, the company said in a release.The announcement sent Fujifilm shares up more than 4% in Tokyo to their highest level in four months.Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had touted Avigan’s potential as Japan’s contribution to a global race for coronavirus treatments, aiming for domestic approval in May.The government called on Fujifilm to triple national stockpiles of Avigan, approved in 2014 as an emergency flu treatment, and pledged to donate it to countries on request.But a lack of patients in Japan hampered clinical testing. In July, researchers at Fujita Health University said their Avigan study failed to reach statistically significant results.In its statement, Fujifilm said it would perform further analysis of the trial data and seek to file for approval of Avigan for use in Covid-19 as early as October.This week, the Nikkei newspaper cited ministry sources as saying approval could be granted within a month of receiving such a request.In July, Fujifilm sold its global rights to Avigan to India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. Already available generically in many countries under the name favipiravir, the drug has been approved to treat Covid-19 in India and Russia.Avigan acts on the RNA of viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate. It is the subject of dozens of trials worldwide, but concerns remain over birth defects it caused in animal studies.Dr Reddy’s shares were 0.7% higher at 0430 GMT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fujifilm-s-avigan-shown-to-be-effective-in-japanese-phase-3-trial-for-covid-19/story-aLdqcrZHSplmSzS4UME1iM.html

Some other antigen tests must be read using a small, portable device.“You know that companies like Abbott or Roche are bringing these tests to the market and we are definitely looking into this,” said Bjoern Becker, senior director, product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group.“You will see us applying them for new products within the next few weeks in October,” he told reporters during a virtual call. “That’s definitely the next thing to come.”Becker said Lufthansa is considering making the new antigen tests initially available to its first-class and business class passengers, given limited supply.Lufthansa is also looking at ways to expand its network of testing centers to airports in the United States and Canada, given that they are important markets, he said.

Turkey should learn to respect sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply.”Erdogan called the Kashmir “conflict” a “burning issue” in his virtual address during the UNGA debate and said, “Steps taken following the abolition of the special status of Jammu-Kashmir further complicated the problem.”He added, “We are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue, within the framework of the United Nations resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.”Watch l ‘Gross interference’: India slams Turkish President Erdogan’s Kashmir remarks India considers the Kashmir dispute as something to be settled bilaterally with Pakistan, and under the Simla Agreement. It is a position that is widely accepted by the international community, including eventually by US President Donald Trump who had tried, and failed, to intervene in the dispute with offers to mediate.Erdogan had raised the issue in 2019 as well, rallying around Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s attempt to garner greater international attention on Kashmir at the UNGA. Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the only other leader to take Pakistan’s side at that time.In his 2019 speech, the Turkish president had accused the international community of having “failed” to devote enough attention to Kashmir, saying, “In order for the Kashmiri people to look at a safe future together with their Pakistani and Indian neighbours, it is imperative to solve the problem through dialogue and on the basis of justice and equity, but not through collision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-slams-turkish-president-erdogan-s-kashmir-remarks-at-unga/story-ann6FVUwGjTW7Ez37afnvI.html
23-09-2020||World||Thousands expected to honour Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Supreme Court||Thousands of people are expected to pay their respects at the Supreme Court to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the women’s rights champion, leader of the court’s liberal bloc and feminist icon who died last week.Even with the court closed to the public because of the coronavirus pandemic and Washington already consumed with talk of Ginsburg’s replacement, the justice’s former colleagues, family, close friends and the public will have the chance Wednesday and Thursday to pass by the casket of the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.The sad occasion is expected to bring together the remaining eight justices for the first time since the building was closed in March and they resorted to meetings by telephone.Ginsburg will lie in repose for two days at the court where she served for 27 years and, before that, argued six cases for gender equality in the 1970s.Following a private ceremony Wednesday in the court’s Great Hall, her casket will be moved outside the building to the top of the court’s front steps so that public mourners can pay their respects in line with public health guidance for the pandemic.Since her death Friday evening, people have been leaving flowers, notes, placards and all manner of Ginsburg paraphernalia outside the court in tribute to the woman who became known in her final years as the “Notorious RBG.” Court workers cleared away the items and cleaned the court plaza and sidewalk in advance of Wednesday’s ceremony.Following past practice at the tradition-laden court, Ginsburg’s casket is expected to arrive just before 9:30 a.m. EDT Wednesday, the court said. Supreme Court police will carry it up the court steps, which will be lined former Ginsburg law clerks serving as honourary pallbearers.Chief Justice John Roberts and the other justices will be in the Great Hall when the casket arrives and is placed on the Lincoln Catafalque, the platform on which President Abraham Lincoln’s coffin rested in the Capitol rotunda in 1865. A 2016 portrait of Ginsburg by artist Constance P. Beaty will be displayed nearby.It’s unclear whether President Donald Trump would visit the court before he leaves town Wednesday afternoon, though he did pay respects when Justice John Paul Stevens died last year and President Barack Obama visited the court after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in 2016.The entrance to the courtroom, along with Ginsburg’s chair and place on the bench next to Roberts, have been draped in black, a longstanding court custom. These visual signs of mourning, which in years past have reinforced the sense of loss, will largely go unseen this year. The court begins its new term Oct. 5, but the justices will not be in the courtroom and instead will hear arguments by phone.After the private ceremony inside the court, Ginsburg’s casket will be on public view from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday and 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday.On Friday, Ginsburg will lie in state at the Capitol, the first woman to do so and only the second Supreme Court justice after William Howard Taft. Taft had also been president. Rosa Parks, a private citizen as opposed to a government official, is the only woman who has lain in honour at the Capitol.Ginsburg will be buried beside her husband, Martin, in a private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery next week. Martin Ginsburg died in 2010. She is survived by a son and a daughter, four grandchildren, two step-grandchildren and a great-grandchild.Ginsburg’s death from cancer at age 87 has added another layer of tumult to an already chaotic election year. Trump and Senate Republicans are plowing ahead with plans to have a new justice on the bench, perhaps before the Nov. 3 election.Only Chief Justice Roger Taney, who died in October 1864, died closer to a presidential election. Lincoln waited until December to nominate his replacement, Salmon Chase, who was confirmed the same day.When Scalia, Ginsburg’s closest friend on the court, died unexpectedly in 2016, Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama’s high-court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-expected-to-honour-ruth-bader-ginsburg-at-supreme-court/story-eLKBy0ami8RfPp3yBc4dzN.html
23-09-2020||World||Indian Americans have powered economic growth of United States, says Biden||Indian Americans, with their hard work and entrepreneurship, have powered the economic growth of the United States and helped forge cultural dynamism in the country, Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden said on Tuesday.Addressing a national virtual fundraiser organised by Indian Americans, Biden assured the community members and the mega donors that as a president, he would address their concerns with regard to H-1B visa and legal immigrants that attract the best and the brightest to the US.Think about what this community has done for the country, he said. Entrepreneurs running businesses around the country and around the world, innovators who make the foundation for Silicon Valley and lead some of the most influential companies in the world come from the community, the former vice president said.“You have helped forge an economic and cultural dynamism in this country. That is a continuation of who we are, we are a nation of immigrants,” Biden said.Hitting out at President Donald Trump, he said all the harmful actions on H-1B, racial injustice or climate crisis are a common threat. “This president makes things worse, not better,” Biden added.It makes parents wonder whether their kids will have the kind of future they dreamed of when they came here, he said.“As president, I promise I am going to draw on the best, not the worst, beat this pandemic and build the economy back, help our kids get a good education and make sure healthcare is a right not a privilege, and build an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values,” Biden said.“We do not talk enough about how the Indian American community has powered our economic growth,” the former vice president said in his address to the virtual fundraiser, which according to his spokesperson Remi Yamamoto was attended by 268 people.Highly appreciative of the cultural, social and family values of Indian Americans, Biden said that is why he values the Indian American Diaspora so much.Seema Sadanandan, a senior policy adviser to the campaign, opened the fundraiser and asked Dr Vivek Murthy, former surgeon general, to start off by talking about his relationship with Biden. Family was the main theme of the conversation with a few references thrown in about Indian food.“Joe Biden is the kind of guy I would love to bring home to have dinner with my mom and dad,” Murthy said in his opening remarks, adding that some homemade masala dosa would be served.“He is authentic. He is real. And he says what he thinks and that is something I really love about him. He says what is on his mind. He is honest and true,” he said.Biden, Murthy said, is a man who generally meets with his values and those values are reliably centred around generosity and community. “It is who he is,” Murthy said.In a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council and National Finance Committee member of the Biden campaign, said the former vice president will bring hope, unity, change and healing to the country.“He will restore the soul of America and its glorious position on the world stage. He will be the best friend of India and Indo-Americans. He will streamline H1Bs, remove green card backlogs, sign new trade deals, implement climate change agreements, protect us against hate crimes, guard our places of worship and ensure that South Asians are well represented in his administration,” Bhutoria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-have-powered-economic-growth-of-united-states-says-biden/story-ZX6lGgWeBKGT3wApGXju5L.html
23-09-2020||World||Follow Covid-19 precautions or face another lockdown, PM Johnson tells Britons||Hours after outlining a new set of restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson implored Britons in a special broadcast on Tuesday evening to follow precautions to curb the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19), or face fines and even another lockdown, if the minority who flout rules continue to do so.As the day-rise of new cases climbed to 4,926 on Tuesday evening, and a cumulative total of 403,551 with 41,825 deaths, Johnson abandoned his earlier optimistic outlook, and said if need be, the army would be deployed to ensure official guidance is followed.He said: “(Unless) we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later…If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs”.“And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend…We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further”.The country, he told Britons, came together when the virus took hold in March, when people scrupulously followed official guidance by staying at home and taking basic precautions such as frequently washing hands and maintaining social distancing.That collective action kept the virus at bay, which was reflected in falling numbers of new cases and admissions in hospitals from June onwards. But September has seen an exponential rise at various levels, after what Johnson called “too many breaches” of guidance.Johnson said: “The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell…That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary”.The new curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres, which has further unnerved the industry struggling to balance the books in recent months. Wearing of masks has been made compulsory, including in taxis.Another key advice was to ‘work from home’, a reversal of the recent ‘back to work’ advice when new cases were in the hundreds. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covod-19-behave-or-face-another-lockdown-johnson-tells-britons/story-xFT9EIHXzlUh2vytQXErBL.html
23-09-2020||World||Hillary Clinton chides senate GOP for Ginsburg replacement rush||Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Republican rush to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court could spell the end of Obamacare, but that she opposes increasing the size of the court in response.In an interview taped for the Bloomberg Equality Summit to take place on Wednesday, Clinton cited Ginsburg’s reported last wish -- that the seat she had held since 1993 remain vacant until the presidential election was decided.“She was offering a measured opinion that’s in the best interest of the country and the court to let the election go forward,” said Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.She acknowledged that Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm an appointment from President Donald Trump before the Nov. 3 election.A decision by Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to go forward with confirming a nominee is a “very unfortunate display of partisan power to push through whoever the president nominates,” Clinton said.She said she wouldn’t, however, favor a strategy being discussed by some Democrats to increase the size of the court in the event they win control of the Senate and White House to dilute the conservative majority. She called that idea “a step too far.”The 2016 Democratic standard bearer said her party should be “absolutely clear what’s really at stake and first and foremost in this case is health care,” noting that the high court is scheduled to hear a case on the Obama administration’s signature health care legislation shortly after the election.“It really speaks to the fervent desire of Republicans under Trump and Mitch McConnell to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,” Clinton said. “What that means is for millions of Americans, their cost will go up, if they can even get insurance.”Clinton framed the high court and health care battles in terms of the coronavirus pandemic.“Having the seat filled right now, rather than waiting until we know who the president is, may well mean the end of the ACA and millions of Americans who have been exposed to Covid-19 will have pre-existing conditions that won’t be covered,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-chides-senate-gop-for-ginsburg-replacement-rush/story-IcmoSOgbIutTARbwY4NR3N.html
23-09-2020||World||Covid fatalities top 200,000 in US as UK tightens curbs||The US death toll from Covid-19 topped 200,000 on Tuesday, a figure unimaginable eight months ago when the scourge first reached the world’s richest nation. The grim milestone in America was reported only hours after the UK announced new restrictions short of a total lockdown, with the country’s authorities reporting a sharp increase in cases in recent weeks.The deadly disease has so far claimed more than 965,000 lives globally and has infected over 31.3 million people. The US remains the worst-hit nation, surpassing 200,000 fatalities and reporting nearly 6.9 million Covid-19 infections. In the UK, the disease has claimed over 41,800 lives and infected at least 400,000 people.Critics in the US said the latest statistics exposed the Trump administration’s failure to meet its sternest test ahead of the November 3 election. President Donald Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden said, “With this crisis that required serious presidential leadership, he just wasn’t up to it. He froze... and America has paid the worst price of any nation in the world.”In the UK, concern over managing the crisis was prompted by modelling that showed new cases doubling every seven days. The new measures would last at least six months, Johnson told the House of Commons. The curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres. Fines of up to £10,000 and compulsory wearing of masks are among the new steps.Another advice from the UK PM was to “work from home”, a reversal of the recent “back to work” advice. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.The advice to last six months means Johnson has dropped his earlier optimism of a return to normal by Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-fatalities-top-200-000-in-us-as-uk-tightens-curbs/story-aNYXwpZkSvSmYjuO7d9zNM.html
23-09-2020||World||US set to make it tough for firms to hire H-1B holders||The Trump administration plans to make it harder for US companies to hire foreign workers on H-1B non-immigrant short-term visas, by narrowing the definition of “speciality” occupation and raising minimum wages for the employees. Both measures are intended to ensure American workers were not displaced or denied jobs because of cheaper foreign workers. Critics of the H-1B programme argue that US companies are hiring foreign workers to displace American ones, and that they are not highly skilled as they ought to be. More than 70% of these H-1B visas go to Indians hired by US companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, and US subsidiaries of Indian IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS.Office of Management and Budget of the White House has posted a notice on its website saying a review was under way of H-1B and other visas, but no details were available.White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Reuters news agency that these measures will be “utterly transformative” and will ensure there is “no market for someone to drive back down wages on H-1Bs to displace American workers”.The administration would expect to have them in place for maximum impact before elections on November 3. Reuters reported that these measures were being fast-tracked and the final bunch of orders could also include restriction on international students.The H-1B visa programme has been on the cross-hairs of the Trump administration from the beginning and it has been changed and altered incrementally since, through executive orders. It was suspended temporarily in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs that were becoming available from the lockdown. The president has also suspended all immigration till December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-make-it-tough-for-firms-to-hire-h-1b-holders/story-S1uDidm9iBPKDdZVdiKuWO.html
23-09-2020||World||Confidence crisis at UN, reforms needed: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the United Nations faces a “crisis of confidence” as it commemorated its 75th anniversary, and reiterated India’s long-standing call for reform at the world body to reflect “today’s realities” and “give voice to all stakeholders”.In a declaration adopted at the end of the day-long commemorative meeting, the General Assembly committed itself to “instil new life in the discussions on the reform” of the UN Security Council (UNSC), one the principal organs of the world body. India is seeking a permanent seat on the reformed and expanded UNSC.The Prime Minister was participating in a virtual high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly to commemorate the historic session. He is scheduled to deliver his speech at the high-level General Debate of the assembly on Saturday, as the first speaker for the day.“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” Modi said in a short address.He added: “Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stake holders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.”The Prime Minister recalled for listeners that India was a founding signatory of the United Nations that was born out of the “horrors” of World War II, and shared India’s own “philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’” (the whole world is one family).“Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations,” Modi said. “We pay tribute to all those who have advanced the cause of peace and development under the UN flag, including in UN peacekeeping missions, where India had been a leading contributor.”But, he added, “while much has been achieved, the original mission remains incomplete” — something acknowledged by the declaration the General Assembly adopted at the end of the one-day meeting to commemorate the anniversary. The declaration said more needs to be done towards preventing conflict, ensuring development, addressing climate change, reducing inequality and leveraging digital technologies.There is a “need for reform of the United Nations itself”, Modi added.The declaration did make a forceful case for it. “We commit to instil new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalize the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council,” it said.India and many countries have called for reforming the UN arguing that it must reflect the changing world order and accommodate the aspirations of emerging powers. India itself has sought a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council.The US, the UK, France and Russia — four of the five permanent members — have endorsed the country’s demand, but there has been no real progress in the process, called the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN), which has been under way for a long time.India has “accorded the highest priority to permanent membership”, the ministry of external affairs said on Monday in a parliamentary reply.It has pursed this on both bilateral and multilateral platforms, especially in concert with countries that are also seeking a permanent membership of the council such as G-4 partners Japan, Germany and Brazil and with IBSA’s other two members Brazil and South Africa.IBSA foreign ministers met last week virtually for their annual meeting around the UN General Assembly sessions, and expressed “frustration with the slow pace of progress” on Security Council reforms in the IGN process which, they complained, “lacked transparency in its working methods”.“Expressed our collective frustration with the slow progress of reforms in the Inter-Governmental Negotiations,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Twitter after the meeting. “Time has come for substantive negotiations in a formal setting on a single comprehensive text.”Serving and former diplomats and experts are clear-eyed, however, about the challenges in the way. UNSC reforms will not be easy, and will require India to be persistent. “Global action to meet global challenges of today demands that the UN reforms to strengthen multilateralism in keeping with contemporary realities,” said Manjeev Puri, a former top Indian diplomat to the UN.“Demanders for change, including India, need to be resolute and determined as reform is unlikely either easily or quickly but is a must for themselves and the world,” he added.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at Wilson Center, said that as long as China was standing in the way, it will be difficult for India. “India’s hopes of a permanent UNSC seat have long been dashed by the veto power of China. And given the trajectory of India-China relations, which are free-falling and are likely to remain in crisis for an extended period of time, it’s highly unlikely that Beijing will change its position anytime soon.”He added: “India’s best hope is that UN rules eventually change so that a majority of votes, as opposed to unanimity, are required to have a new permanent member.”India will begin a two-year term on the Security Council coming January as a non-permanent member, for the eighth time. It hopes to use the opportunity to further burnish its credentials for a seat as a permanent member. Its previous non-permanent terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confidence-crisis-at-un-reforms-needed-pm-modi/story-ebu9Lb9K6R0GDoIeY4cv7J.html
23-09-2020||World||Influenza vaccine does not increase Covid-19 risk: Study||Receiving the influenza vaccine does not increase a person’s risk for contracting Covid-19 or worsen associated conditions or mortality, according to a study. The research, published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, shows the flu vaccine is the single most important intervention to help stay healthy. Seasonal flu activity is unpredictable, and otherwise healthy people are hospitalised due to serious respiratory infection each year, the researchers said. It is even more important to receive the flu vaccination this year to help prevent a ‘twindemic’ of flu and Covid-19, they said. Researchers led by Joe Zein, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic in the US, analysed over 13,000 patients tested for Covid-19 between early March and mid-April. They compared those who had received unadjuvanted influenza vaccines in the fall or winter of 2019 (4,138 patients) with those who did not receive the vaccine (9,082 patients). The study found that influenza vaccination was not associated with increased Covid-19 incidence or disease severity, including risk for hospitalisation, admission to the intensive care unit or mortality. “Our findings suggest that we should proceed as usual with our vaccination strategy for global influenza this flu season,” said Zein. “Getting the annual flu vaccine remains the best safeguard against the influenza virus -- both for yourself and the people around you,” he added. The researchers noted that much is still unknown about the possible outcomes of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes Covid-19 -- and influenza infection, including disease pathology and burden to the healthcare system. They believe that the population’s adherence to widespread and early flu vaccination while researchers continue to collect data will help to mitigate the risk of simultaneous viral infections and pandemics. “We have already seen the stress that Covid-19 can put on our hospitals and resources,” said Zein. “While we’re not yet sure how flu season will affect Covid-19 susceptibility and infections, we strongly advise people to get their influenza vaccines, both for their individual health and the collective health of our care systems,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/influenza-vaccine-does-not-increase-covid-19-risk-study/story-rqs84SBDVF9iYCqHXgtSaM.html

The video, published online last week by a local network in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, showed the young soldiers inside a bus and singing a well-known Chinese military song “Green Flowers in the Army”. Nearly all of them seemed emotional, with some crying.WATCH | Chinese soldiers ‘cry’ on way to India border; Taiwan media mocks Taiwanese media such as Liberty Times and Taiwan News, known for their pro-independence, anti-China stand, seemed to mock the soldiers for crying, interpreting it as a sign of fear against deployment at the border with India amid the ongoing tension in eastern Ladakh. Also read: India-China military commanders to meet at least twice more before disengagement commencesChina considers Taiwan as a breakaway region to be reunified by force if necessary and currently – much like with India – military tension between the two is rapidly escalating. The recruits in the video are from the Yingzhou district of Fuyang city in Anhui. The video was shared across online platforms in China as well as on Twitter and on Facebook, interestingly by a Pakistani comedian Zaid Hamid.“As tensions continue to simmer on the Sino-Indian border, a video surfaced on Sunday (September 20) showing PLA soldiers crying as they are allegedly deployed to the border,” the Taiwan News reported on Tuesday.Also read: Chinese airforce uses Hollywood film clips in propaganda videoThe new troops were “reportedly college students, and five of them had ‘proactively volunteered to serve in Tibet’, which borders the Ladakh region where the bloody Galwan Valley skirmish took place in June of this year,” it said.“In the video, the soldiers can be seen sobbing hysterically as they struggle to sing the words to the PLA song ‘Green Flowers in the Army,’” the report added.It said Hamid, the Pakistani comedian, seemed to be “poking fun” at the recruits despite him saying: “We Pakistani support you China. Stay Brave.”The Chinese state-controlled media reacted strongly against its Taiwanese counterparts, saying they deliberately misinterpreted the emotional video involving the PLA soldiers. Also read: How Chinese propaganda is using the 1962 war to shape public opinion“At that time, they were bidding farewell to their parents and sang the famous military song ‘Green Flowers in the Army’, and they sang ‘Go home when you celebrate your work’, completely contrary to the mood created by Taiwanese media,” the nationalist tabloid Global Times said in a report on Tuesday.The report added that though the Taiwanese media report “tried to use all kinds of explicit hints to shape the image of the PLA fighters being ‘afraid of war’, when describing all the key information, the author used vague terms such as ‘reported’ and ‘probable’, which seemed very guilty.”The Global Times report added that many who re-posted the content mocking the PLA were Twitter users from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crying-pla-troops-on-way-to-india-border-causes-china-taiwan-media-war/story-i7tpbeTb3x1lBNvyk0XV5L.html
