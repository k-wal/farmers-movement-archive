But gamblers see a different reality and are putting their money on Donald Trump.The Republican incumbent, who is seeking a second term, has slowly climbed back since late July to nearly even with the Democratic former vice president.For some Australian and British bookmakers, Trump is the odds-on favorite.Betting on national or local elections is illegal in the United States. All the action is happening on foreign gambling sites -- which Americans can sometimes access.Also read: Trump faces storm over alleged comments on war dead, calls for Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin to be firedA $100 wager on a Trump win today could bring the punter a return of $190 if he notches the victory. “There is no doubt that the momentum appears to have swung back into President Trump’s favor,” said Rupert Adams, a spokesman for British bookmaker William Hill, which has already accepted more than $1.3 million in election bets.Lee Price, a spokesman for Irish gambling brand Paddy Power, explains that after a slowdown in betting activity due to the coronavirus crisis, interest has “started to pick up again in recent weeks.”“We think the Trump factor is sure to keep punters interested,” Price told AFP.Many who have placed their bets on Trump now are hoping for a repeat of 2016, when the Manhattan real estate mogul staged a stunning comeback against Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton to win the White House.‘Just plain scary’British bookmaker Betfair has taken in 10 million pounds ($13.3 million) in bets on the White House race since August 23, on the eve of the Republican nominating convention. That brings their total so far to 72 million pounds, as compared with 33 million pounds at the same point in the campaign in 2016.Betfair is hoping to top the record of 199 million pounds wagered in 2016, half of which came after polling stations closed, explained spokesman Darren Hughes.Beyond the main event, Paddy Power is taking bets on some quirky issues: will Trump paint the White House gold (500-1)? Will he have an airport in Mexico named after him (66-1)? But Price says the interest in those types of bets has waned a bit. “Trump is less wacky, quirky, and funny,” Price says, calling the president’s current behavior “just plain scary.”Matthew Collins, a 29-year-old Australian sales consultant, placed 21 separate bets before the Republican convention -- nearly all of them on Trump.He picked the president to win again in November, but also as the winner of several specific states. In all, he put down about AUS$20,000 (US$14,570) -- a sum he won on a bet that Biden would choose Kamala Harris as his running mate.Collins, who describes himself as politically left-leaning, says he thinks Trump has gained momentum since his party’s convention in late August, which came on the heels of the Democrats’ event.“The Republicans seem to like America. They don’t hate their own country. I didn’t get that from the DNC so I think that their message on its face isn’t persuasive,” Collins said.‘Watch where the money goes’Nick Freiling, the CEO of a market research firm, who bet $300 on a Trump victory in traditionally Democratic Minnesota, says it’s normal for the gap between the candidates to narrow as November approaches.The coronavirus crisis is another major factor, he said -- Trump faced sharp criticism for his handling of the pandemic, but the issue “is steadily falling out of our public consciousness, and people are less angry about things, generally.”Collins said he didn’t believe the polls were “representative of reality” and said the margin of error “must be so high.”For Freiling, “the polls may be of ‘likely voters’ and show Biden winning. But what about voters’ enthusiasm for their candidate (which correlates with turnout)? Trump is winning that battle by huge margins.”“Watch where the money goes,” Collins said, predicting that Trump will dominate his three debates with Biden. “That’s what people really care about.”He noted that voters can lie to pollsters about who they are supporting, which could skew results.Those with skin in the betting game are also keeping an eye on the likely massive proportion of votes cast by mail this year, due to coronavirus concerns -- a potential game changer.“That feels like a situation that could get very messy,” Collins said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-may-be-down-in-the-polls-but-he-s-tops-for-bettors/story-YwOjJqbWRGOZuogtfO5VoI.html
06-09-2020||World||Inside Pak Army’s deradicalisation programme for surrendered militants||A deradicalisation programme launched by the Pakistan Army for surrendered militants in the restive Balochistan province has an Islamist overhang, with leaders of hardline groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami being part of the training courses, according to documents accessed by Hindustan Times.The deradicalisation and rehabilitation programme, started in 2018 by Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa, also appeared to be aimed more at replacing the ethnic Baloch identity of the militants with one that emphasises “religio-patriotism”, the confidential documents show.Bajwa, who was recently at the centre of a controversy after a Pakistani news website reported that his family had created a business empire of 99 companies in four countries - including a pizza franchise worth nearly $40 million - appears to have been the guiding force behind the programme that was launched while he was heading the Pakistan Army’s southern command.Also read: India calls China’s bluff in ChushulAn existing deradicalisation centre in Quetta named Umeed-e-Nau was expanded and renamed ‘Darepsh’, a Balochi word meaning “ujala” (light), to implement the programme. The documents show that the programme has so far handled at least two batches of surrendered militants – 50 fighters who were part of a course from December 2018 to March 2019, and 128 fighters who underwent a course during April-July 2019.While the programme does make an effort to rope in both army and civilian psychologists to deal with the psychological and social training of the surrendered Baloch fighters, almost 20 percent or a fifth of training modules are devoted to a “religio-patriotism programme”, and guest speakers for this included Abdul Haq Hashmi, the provincial president of Jamaat-e-Islami.The Jamaat-e-Islami established deep links with jihadi groups during the war against Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s and was also active in the early years of the militant movement in Jammu and Kashmir, having close ties with the Hizbul Mujahideen. The Jamaat also has close ties with the Pakistani military.Also read: To China, a military and diplomatic messageThe documents show that while the surrendered fighters are taught “rejection of extremism” during the religio-patriotism programme, they are also trained in “jihad, morality, patriotism”.The documents also highlight the mismatch between the overall number of surrendered fighters and the number of those who have completed the deradicalisation programme. According to a brief history of the programme included in the documents, more than 2,500 fighters surrendered in 2018 as a result of “effect-based selected operations in Balochistan along with efforts in non-kinetic domain” that isolated “terrorists/Baloch sub-nationalists”.However, only 178 surrendered fighters were part of the two deradicalisation and rehabilitation courses conducted so far. Most of these fighters were drawn from Dera Bugti, Sibi and Kohlu regions of Balochistan.People familiar with developments also pointed to the similarity between the deradicalisation camps being run in Balochistan and the so-called re-education camps run by Chinese authorities for Uyghurs in Xinjiang. “The objectives, layout and vocational training module closely align with those of the camps in Xinjiang. One of the key aims seems to be to remove all traces of ethnic identity and nationalism,” said one of the people cited above.Significantly, a slide that is part of the documents contains a reference to one of the key issues raised by civil society and human rights groups regarding the activities of Pakistani security and intelligence agencies in Balochistan – the issue of “missing persons” or the victims of enforced disappearances.The slide on some nine points raised by the surrendered Baloch fighters during the deradicalisation programme includes in the first place, “Missing Pers whereabouts be pursued”. The surrendered fighters also called for financial assistance to be paid to some fighters who hadn’t received the aid when they laid down arms.In recent years, the bodies of scores of victims of enforced disappearances have been found dumped on roadsides, many of them with marks of torture.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it was strange that the Jamaat-e-Islami, described by some as the “mother organisation for most jihadis”, was part of such a deradicalisation programme. “This programme also shows the misplaced priorities of the Pakistan Army – such a programme should focus on Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa or Punjab, where deadly groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba are based. But then the groups that don’t indulge in activities against the Pakistani state have always received preferential treatment,” he said. “The Pakistan Army appears to be using its own version of Islam to crush groups with an identity and form of Islam that doesn’t suit them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-pak-army-s-deradicalisation-programme-for-surrendered-militants/story-BoklIk0RosjNmTgZrBJkBN.html
06-09-2020||World||Jill Biden drawing on classroom time for case against Donald Trump||When Jill Biden introduced herself to millions of Americans during last month’s Democratic National Convention, she did so from a high school where she once taught English near her Delaware home.Since then, she’s visited a classroom that would otherwise be filled with elementary school children, participated in a health briefing on how to safely resume in-person learning and met with teachers in a Wisconsin backyard.The emphasis on education is a natural fit for someone who was a public school teacher for more than 20 years, earned two master’s degrees and then a doctorate in education and continued teaching at a community college when her husband, Joe Biden, was vice president.But in an election year where reopening schools shuttered by the coronavirus is emerging as a flashpoint, Jill Biden is increasingly drawing on her classroom experience to empathize with parents struggling to cope with the shift to virtual learning. She’s taking a mostly virtual 10-city tour of schools disrupted by the pandemic and is trying to make the case that President Donald Trump doesn’t deserve re-election because of his handling of the coronavirus.“I feel if Joe had been president at this time we would not be in the midst of this chaos,” Jill Biden told a mother and two teachers during a discussion that lasted more than half an hour on the patio of a private home last week in Wauwatosa, outside Milwaukee.Trump has also tried to seize on schools as an election-year issue, pressuring state and local leaders to resume classroom instruction and threatening to withhold federal dollars for those who don’t. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent mixed signals, saying students should return to the classroom but also noting that virtual classes present the lowest risk of Covid-19 spread.The public appears more skeptical of reopening than the White House.Only about 1 in 10 Americans thinks day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a poll released in late July from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. Roughly 3 in 10 say that teaching kids in classrooms shouldn’t happen at all.If Biden wins the election, his wife has pledged that his administration will make listening to teachers’ concerns a priority. She also could play a role in shaping school reopenings. Both Bidens listened and took notes during a virtual briefing last week with public health and education experts about how to approach a reopening without exacerbating the pandemic.“How many times have we had someone who’s wanted to be the education president and is very good on rhetoric but has very little or no idea how to translate that rhetoric into reality,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has endorsed Biden. “She sends a message throughout America, not only of the importance of education, but also the importance of sweating the small stuff.”Sometimes her message is the contrast between Trump and a Biden administration. On the same day that the president traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, last week to blame protests that sometimes turned violent on “domestic terror,” Jill Biden was touring Evan G. Shortlidge Academy, a kindergarten through second grade school in Wilmington, Delaware, where she and her husband live.When Joe Biden made his own visit to Kenosha two days after Trump, both Bidens also made time for the Wauwatosa meeting a short time later. “Joe can talk about his education plan. I probably know it better than he does,” Jill Biden said with a laugh.As part of her multi-city tour, Jill Biden held a virtual North Carolina back-to-school roundtable and has upcoming online events in Florida and Nevada. She will also travel to Minnesota for an in-person meeting with parents and teachers.At Shortlidge, the school year will begin Tuesday, but in the short term, all instruction will be online, which some parents worry is not as effective as traditional instruction. More than 330 of the school’s 369 students are Black or Latino, and 77% receive federally subsidized lunches.After walking through several empty classrooms and across freshly polished floors stenciled with paw prints in honor of the school’s Wild Cats mascot, Jill Biden spoke to a small, socially distanced and masked group of teachers and administrators outside — near a playground closed during the pandemic and roped off with yellow caution tape.The thrill of back-to-school has “turned from excitement into anxiety and the playgrounds are still. Some classrooms are dark as the bright young faces that used to fill them; now we just see them on screens,” Jill Biden said, noting that parents and teachers are “losing sleep” over what’s in store for youngsters this fall.“Americans of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back, and they’re fighting for each other. We haven’t given up,” she said. “We just need leadership worthy of our nation, and worthy of all of you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-drawing-on-classroom-time-for-case-against-donald-trump/story-ylnbQIutx4UxdnesH6obfN.html

The museum showcases several examples of fabric dyed in ‘Turkey red’ with Indian motifs, with revised description agreed in consultation with experts.Another item with a revised description is the Scottish Glengarry cap with Indian embroidery.Original version‘This cap was probably modelled on a Glengarry bonnet, traditional Scottish headgear that became associated with the dress of Scottish regiments of the British army from the 1850s. Scottish regiments were deployed across India, and in 1848 the Ludhiana Sikh Regiment adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap. It features Kashmir shawl motifs that are now better known as Paisley patterns’.Revised version‘The Indian embroidery and buta patterns on this cap, as well as its form resembling a Scottish Glengarry bonnet, suggest it might have been made by a Punjabi craftsperson to sell to Scottish soldiers. At this time Scottish regiments were deployed across India to maintain British rule. Following British victory in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the newly formed Regiment of Ludhiana, which included colonised Indian soldiers, adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap. Is this a sign of cultural exchange or subjugation?’Kashmiri shawls with the droplet-shaped motif, which became popular in Britain when they were imported from India during the early 19th century, led to a major imitation industry springing up in the Scottish town of Paisley. The museum presents sketches of the ‘Paisely shawl’ with a revised text.Also read: ‘We won’t blink first’ - UK warns EU on BrexitOriginal version‘The 19th-century demand for imported soft woollen Kashmir shawls led Paisley weavers and manufacturers to develop British imitations. These shawls have complex designs that could only be produced on mechanical Jacquard looms controlled by a sequence of punched cards dictating the pattern. Designing and weaving became two separate professions, the design process encompassing several stages from a sketch to a point paper before being woven on the loom’.Revised version‘This sketch and point paper show how a pattern design was developed before being woven on the loom. The design process had several stages, each managed by a different person with different skills. Once the design was complete, preparatory work for weaving was carried out by winders, warpers, dyers and beamers. Draw-boys or draw-girls worked with the weaver to operate the loom. Finishing was done by clippers, sewers, fringers, washers, pickers and dressers, many of whom were women. By the mid-19th century, French Jacquard looms were introduced, and the Paisley shawl industry became so highly organised that it overtook competitors in Edinburgh and Norwich’.“As a new design museum, we have no excuse for omitting and misrepresenting this history in our galleries…The first step we’ve taken in this process is to re-write a number of object labels in our galleries so that they reflect a decolonial and transnational approach to Scotland’s design history,” says Meredith More, curator at V&A Dundee.“Some of these original labels omitted important details about the colonial context for the objects’ creation, while others unwittingly misrepresented the facts. To re-write them we worked with a group of experts from the Transnational Scotland Network”, she adds.The decolonisation project is the latest initiative of the £80 million museum housed in a unique design inspired by the eastern cliff edges of Scotland and created by the prominent Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, drawing a large number of visitors this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-museum-revises-perspectives-on-colonial-india/story-jhw1gJ8XslgLY8Yawo1bmK.html
06-09-2020||World||Beirut search effort sparked by dog stops, no survivor found||A search operation of a building that collapsed during last month’s deadly blast in Beirut stopped on Sunday after rescue workers said they did not find any survivors.The operation in the historic Mar Mikhail district had gripped Lebanon since Thursday, sparking hope that a survivor might be found under the rubble a month after the blast on August 4 that killed 191 people and wounded nearly 6,500. Seven people remain missing.The devastating explosion of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port of Beirut caused widespread damage to several neighborhoods. The Lebanese capital is still reeling from the blast, with a quarter of a million people made homeless by the impact of the explosion on apartment buildings.The latest rescue operation began Thursday when a dog used by a Chilean search-and-rescue team signaled the detection of a possible human pulse under the rubble of a collapsed building during a tour of streets in the area. Rescue workers used cranes, shovels and their bare hands in a meticulous search after a pulsing signal was then detected by a device.The black-and-white 5-year-old dog named Flash inspected the building several times a day as aid workers removed debris. Photos of Flash, in red shoes to protect its paws, circulated on social media and the dog became a hero to many Lebanese.The head of the Chilean team, Francisco Lermanda, told journalists at the scene late Saturday they had not found any bodies amid the rubble. Lermanda said the pulsing signals heard might have come from of a member of the rescue team.In past days, the Chilean team had urged people on the streets, including journalists, to turn off their mobile phones and remain quiet for several minutes at a time to avoid interfering with their instruments.Lermanda said they will search a sidewalk after which they will declare the operation over. It was not clear if a search for bodies would continue.Two days after the explosion, a French rescue team and Lebanese civil defense volunteers had searched the same building, which had a bar on the ground floor. At the time, they had no reason to believe anyone was still at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-search-effort-sparked-by-dog-stops-no-survivor-found/story-cAouOmqaUtFO8vOY80UyqO.html

The local police have launched a murder investigation.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Sunday television that there was no indication that the incidents were related to terrorism. The incidents between 12.30 am and 2.20 am were linked, the police said, with no apparent motive of hate-crime. One suspect is being hunted.The police declared it a ‘major incident’, triggering relevant responses from ambulances and other services. A large number of young people were in the city centre area that has several pubs and restaurants.Witness Cara Curran told the BBC, “I found multiple people having fist fights... people from inside pubs and clubs came out and started to see what was going on. There were females, males, old people, young people, such a mix of people, it didn’t seem real at the time”.“Working on the club scene for over two years, I’ve always seen quite a lot of fights but it was nothing like tonight. The body language and demeanour was quite different. The number of things that I’ve heard happened tonight in the space of three hours, with the stabbings that have happened, the car crashes and multiple other things, it’s such a huge shock to me”.Chief superintendent Steve Graham of the West Midlands police said, “The events during the early hours of this morning are tragic, shocking and understandably frightening. Please be assured that we are doing absolutely everything we can to find whoever was responsible and trying to understand what exactly happened”.“We have well-rehearsed plans for dealing with major incidents. Your safety is always our priority and that’s why you’ll see an increase in officers on the streets,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-killed-several-hurt-in-weekend-birmingham-brawl-foreign-secy-rules-out-terrorism-link/story-tEbTMliOyf5Ec8bW5kjTYI.html
06-09-2020||World||France puts more departments on high alert due to surge in Covid-19 cases||French authorities have placed seven more departments covering major cities such as Lille, Strasbourg and Dijon on high alert as increases in Covid-19 infections accelerate, the government said Sunday.Of France’s 101 mainland and overseas departments, 28 are now considered “red zones” where authorities will be able to impose exceptional measures to slow the number of new coronavirus cases.The move comes as France reported a record of nearly 9,000 daily cases on Friday, and a further 8,550 cases in the past 24 hours on Saturday, when the nationwide test positivity rate increased to 4.7 percent.Paris and the Bouches-du-Rhone department encompassing the southeastern city of Lyon were the first to be placed on high alert by the government on August 14 after infection rates began to climb.That prompted local officials to require face masks in all public spaces to slow the virus’s spread, in hope of avoiding a spike in cases that could again overwhelm hospitals as autumn approaches.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Sante Publique France health agency, which has warned of “exponential” caseload increases, said Saturday that 53 new outbreak clusters had been discovered in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number under investigation to 484.Twelve more Covid-19 deaths were reported, for an overall toll of 30,698 since the pandemic flared last March.Concerns over infection risks have already prompted officials to close 22 schools after cases were detected just days after students returned from the summer break last week, and dozens of individual classes have also been suspended.On Sunday, the government said pre-school teachers as well as those with deaf students would soon be given transparent masks to facilitate comprehension at a crucial education stage for young children.“More than 100,000 of these masks will be produced by the end of this month,” the state secretary in charge of people with disabilities, Sophie Cluzel, told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-puts-more-departments-on-high-alert-due-to-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-lKYRvUjMmJjUsFGSdVWLjK.html
06-09-2020||World||Covid-19: Speaker wants daily testing for UK parliamentarians||The Speaker of the House of Commons on Sunday called for daily Covid-19 tests on lawmakers in order for Parliament to resume its sessions with a full House.Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he and the Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had ruled out the use of face masks during sessions to further cut down on the social distancing requirements within the Commons but he was keen to see daily tests as a means of encouraging greater participation in person by members of Parliament (MPs).Under current social distancing rules in place, the number of people allowed in both the House of Commons and Lords is strictly limited to control the spread of coronavirus, with some members joining in sessions remotely via video conference.“To be quite honest with you, I’d like to do it daily, not weekly. The problem is weekly testing doesn’t tell you anything,” Hoyle told ‘Times Radio’ in an interview.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“I’ll be quite honest with you, I’ve made approaches to the NHS (National Health Service) and government to say, look, why can’t we have a testing system? What we would need is a quick turnaround of tests in order that we can get MPs in. We’re looking at it. I personally would have had the heat screening equipment in to test temperatures,” he said.The Speaker said it had been agreed that asking MPs to wear a mask while on the benches “really wouldn’t work” as it would make recognition more difficult and be an obstacle to making speeches. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to be keen for Parliament to return to its pre-Covid packed Houses by the end of the year. In reference to that timeline, Hoyle said: “We are a Covid-secure workplace – if we were to lose that status, the game is over. It’s about working in an efficient way. If people don’t need to be here, why would we have them here.” The pandemic has prompted some of the biggest changes to British parliamentary procedure in centuries and many feel the subdued atmosphere with so many of them working remotely. At the end of the summer recess, the autumn session of the Parliament resumed this week within a mixed physical and remote setting in place to ensure parliamentarians can keep two metres apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-speaker-wants-daily-testing-for-uk-parliamentarians/story-7n1hamfZ16G3GMWmCvqDsI.html
06-09-2020||World||Has Pakistan flattened Covid-19 curve? Here’s a look at numbers||Pakistan has claimed to have flattened its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) curve despite conducting the lowest number of tests, a point made by several experts within the country and across the world, and opening up sooner than others.As of Sunday, the neighbouring country’s infection tally stood at 298,509 while the death toll from the viral disease has gone up to 6,342, according to worldometer. Pakistan had reported its first case of Covid-19 infection in January.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here According to data, Pakistan reported the highest spike of 6,825 cases on June 14, and since then infections have been on the decline, barring a few days with relatively minor spikes, indicating the flattening of the country’s Covid-19 curve. It recorded its lowest one-day jump of only 300 cases on September 3 and just one death on August 29, according to worldometer. However, Pakistan, with a population of 221,709,593 (according to worldometer), has so far conducted only 2,757,709 tests or less than 1.25% of its total populace has been tested for the coronavirus disease.The maximum number of tests were performed on June 20, around the same time when the infections in the country were at peak, according to the Pakistan government’s website. Post that, the country reported a drop in the number of people being tested for the virus every day, signalling the possibility of a direct relationship between dropping cases and tests.“150 countries have done more Covid tests/million than Pakistan, Mexico, India, Indonesia, or Bangladesh. These 5 nations are now in a DATA FOG. They won’t know the REAL number of cases, hotspots, deaths or time to herd immunity. Drive carefully/humbly through this fog,” Dr Faheem Younus, the chief of infectious diseases at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, had tweeted on 4 August. India currently has 4,113,811 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and of them 3,180,865 people ave recovered from the infection. However, the disease has so far claimed 70,626 lives. As many as 48,831,145 tests have been conducted till September 5. Data for Covid-19 cases available on the Pakistan government’s website varied from those on worldometer, however, the overall trend did not show much variation. It still stands true that the caseload declined as the testing reduced.Critics of the government have said that the death rates have been low because of the demographics as the country has a far younger population.However, the government has pointed out “smart lockdowns” and herd immunity among other factors contributing to the low Covid-19 infections in the country.“Today our ‘smart lockdown’ strategy has proved to be successful and numerous nations are following the vision outlined by Prime Minister Imran Khan,” foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI in late July.Pakistan, which suffered economic losses due to the pandemic, had begun reopening some factories in early April and has since been gradually easing curbs with even educational institutions most likely to open later this month.According to a study “Sero-Epidemiological Survey for COVID-19” conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH), around 300,000 people were infected, showing that the capital city was going towards “herd immunity,” Dawn newspaper reported.

06-09-2020||World||China tries to flip the pandemic script, starring a ‘reborn’ Wuhan||China is recasting Wuhan as a heroic coronavirus victim and trying to throw doubt on the pandemic’s origin story as it aims to seize the narrative at a time of growing global distrust of Beijing.The PR blitz plays out daily in comments by Chinese officials and lavish state media coverage of a “reborn” Wuhan that trumpets China’s epidemic-control efforts and economic recovery while the United States struggles.The drive peaked in the past week as Chinese primary schools welcomed back students with considerable fanfare and Wuhan hosted executives from dozens of multinationals, from Panasonic to Dow and Nokia, on a highly choreographed tour of the central Chinese city.Also read: 50,000 people taking part in phase 3 trial of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine“There are few places in the world today where you don’t need a mask and can gather,” a Chinese official, Lin Songtian, told the executives, implying that Wuhan was one of those places.“This testifies to Wuhan’s triumph over the virus and that (the city) is back in business.”Lost in this retelling, however, is that a wet market in Wuhan is widely believed to be ground zero for the pandemic.China’s foreign minister suggested on August 28 during a European outreach trip that the virus might not have emerged in China.The drive indicates China recognises Covid-19’s damage to its brand and wants to leverage its relatively successful recovery to counter growing international challenges, analysts said.China faces foreign bitterness over the virus and an initial cover-up attempt by Wuhan officials, plus criticism of Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong and generally more aggressive international posture.“Beijing wants the narrative to be: we handled it, we can help you handle it and (hopefully) we’re the first to have a vaccine that works,” said Kelsey Broderick, Asia analyst with Eurasia Group.“That’s really the only way China can come out ahead of the idea that a wet market in Wuhan started this crisis.”‘Absolutely safe’ The fumbling US pandemic response provides a clear opening, said Yun Jiang, director of Australian National University’s China Policy Centre.“The fact that the US is not only not doing enough, but actually doing things that go against American interests, is a big help to China,” she said.The three-day Wuhan tour also included foreign media outlets and ended Saturday.It featured primary-school students performing traditional Chinese opera and ballet, a renovated food market presented as a model of sanitation, and a Yangtze riverfront cruise underneath a skyline ablaze with towering light displays referencing the virus recovery.Also read: CNBG, Sinovac find takers in Pakistan and Bangladesh: The latest on coronavirus vaccineThe city of 11 million -- which suffered more than 80 percent of China’s 4,634 Covid-19 deaths -- has come a long way since the pandemic’s grim early days, when a suffocating weeks-long lockdown rendered it a ghost town.No new local transmissions have been reported in months, traffic jams are back, shoppers cram malls, and al fresco diners gobble up the city’s signature spicy crayfish dish.Face masks sag from the neck or are abandoned altogether.The growing confidence was displayed at a Wuhan pool party attended by thousands of mask-less people last month that prompted overseas accusations of recklessness after images of the event went viral.China countered that the party indicated the nation’s success in taming the coronavirus.“What risks can there be?” asked Wuhan factory worker Xie Ailiang while speaking to AFP.“I think now Wuhan should be absolutely safe.”‘Winter is coming’ But not everyone is taking a victory lap.Many Wuhan citizens express persistent concern over an uneven recovery and fear of new outbreaks.“The economy has really declined. The benefit of even coming to work is questionable,” said Yi Xinhua, 51, who sells tofu from her stall at a Wuhan wet market.Blocks of tofu were neatly arranged by shape and size, but there few buyers -- Yi says her sales are only half of the pre-pandemic level.It’s a common complaint in Wuhan, blamed by many business owners on lingering fear of going out in public and the widely expressed belief that millions who fled the city early in the pandemic have still not returned.Wuhan employers complain online that the exodus has also reduced the local labour pool.And memories of a subsequent virus cluster in May, which triggered a citywide effort to test millions, remain fresh.“Everyone is afraid the epidemic will return, you know? The summer is over, and winter is coming,” said Yi.“We’ve recovered a bit. But if the virus comes back, we’ll be hit again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tries-to-flip-the-pandemic-script-starring-a-reborn-wuhan/story-SxMBDzEowU19ioKLvtAdzK.html

That was soon followed by reports of other stabbings across the city center over a period of about two hours.Police said they believed the stabbings were linked and had launched a murder investigation.Graham said two of the seven injured people, a man and a woman, were in critical condition in hospitals. Five others received “relatively minor” injuries.The site of one attack is in the city’s Gay Village, but Graham said there was no suggestion the crime was “motivated by hate.”Police cordoned off an area in the center of the city full of bars and nightclubs. Witnesses said they were busy on Saturday night, with many people eating and drinking at outdoor tables. More cordons and blue forensic tents were set up about half a mile away, near the city’s Snow Hill train station.Cara Curran, a club promoter, said she saw multiple people fighting in the street.“It was one group of boys against another group of boys,” she told the BBC, adding that “racial slurs” were being thrown.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was “a very serious incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.”West Midlands Mayor Andy Street urged people “to not speculate about the incident” and to “remain calm but vigilant.”Official statistics show knife crime is on the rise in the U.K., where most guns are outlawed, though the number of homicides with blades fell in 2019 from the year before.Britain has seen several recent knife attacks, including a stabbing rampage in a city park in Reading, near London, in June that killed three people. A Libyan man has been charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-killed-7-injured-in-stabbings-in-uk-s-birmingham/story-AAaapc7TUtQxhGTKzdMNjO.html

Also read: Britain will not be EU ‘client state’: UK Brexit envoyBritain says the EU is dragging its feet in talks and has failed to fully accept that it is now an independent country.“We are not going to be a client state. We are not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws,” Frost told the Mail. “We are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things.” “That’s what being an independent country is about, that’s what the British people voted for and that’s what will happen at the end of the year, come what may,” Frost said.At heart, Britain is pressing one of the EU’s most sensitive buttons – the fear that a post-Brexit Britain could become a much more agile, deregulated free-market competitor on its border by using selective state aid.“More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,” said one EU diplomat.“If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff edge for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this,” the diplomat said. “If, on the other hand, the UK’s approach became more pragmatic and realistic, there would probably be a good chance to save the negotiations and agree on a deal.”Frost said a lot of preparation had been done for a possible exit without a trade deal.“I don’t think that we are scared of this at all,” Frost said. “If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-won-t-blink-first-uk-warns-eu-on-brexit/story-IUGKg6w1NGiJsdfHqFAaMP.html

Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union are amongst the frontrunners who are trying to release a shot against the viral disease.Clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer, Oxford University and AstraZeneca, Russian Direct Investment Fund-sponsored Sputnik V and Cansino Biologics have all conducted the phase 1 and phase 2 trials.The coronavirus disease has killed 878,237 people and more than 26 million cases have been recorded across the globe with the United States, Brazil and India contributing the most.Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccines:• Several countries are participating in the late-stage trials of China National Biotec Group and Sinovac Biotech Ltd’s Covid-19 vaccine. Serbia and Pakistan have come to an agreement to participate in the phase 3 trials of CNBG’s vaccine candidate. Turkey and Bangladesh will be Sinovac’s testing grounds for its vaccine candidate.• Olivier Bogillot, Sanofi’s chief in France, has said the vaccine being developed by Sanofi and the United Kingdom’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc is likely to be priced below 10 euros. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline are developing a protein-based vaccine and will start their final stage trials in December.• Vaccine makers will only send their vaccines for Covid-19 to the US’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only after extensively reviewing safety and accuracy data in a bid to thwart the political pressure exerted on the FDA to roll out a vaccine as soon as possible. Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi and other vaccine manufacturers are likely to take the pledge.• Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed - Trump administration’s vaccine programme - told NPR that it is highly unlikely that data on a vaccine’s safety and efficacy will be available before October. He was speaking in reference to US health officials telling states to be ready to ‘distribute vaccine shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cnbg-sinovac-find-takers-in-pakistan-and-bangladesh-the-latest-on-coronavirus-vaccine/story-yxy0D0KDaaPPonfc0h2yvJ.html

Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.Also read| Typhoon Haishen: Japan deploys 22,000 soldiers on full alertThe Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-haishen-unleashes-fierce-winds-rain-in-southern-japan/story-7jxyJfIyKkUkXRIrrSezQJ.html
06-09-2020||World||Australia Covid-19 epicenter to start easing lockdown measures||Australia’s second most populous state will soon begin easing a strict lockdown put in place to contain the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreak, although most measures will remain in place for at least two more weeks.The lockdown is hurting the Australian economy, which is gripped by its first recession in almost 30 years. Victoria contributes about one-quarter of Australia’s gross domestic product, but is isolated from the rest of the country after other states closed their borders against a spike in community transmission.Also read: Kamala Harris says she would not trust Trump alone on coronavirus vaccine“If we open up too fast then we have a very high likelihood that we’re not really opening up at all, we’re just beginning a third wave,” Victoria’s Premier Daniel Andrews said at a media briefing. “We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown.” The first changes, which take effect from Sept. 14, include a lengthening of permitted outdoor exercise time to two hours, and an allowance for two people or a household to meet outside.Across the state, people have been ordered to stay at home except for essential work, medical care, provisions, or exercise. The state capital Melbourne, home to five million residents, has been under even tighter restrictions since early August, with a nighttime curfew and large parts of its retail and manufacturing sectors shuttered.A further easing of restrictions, including a phased re-opening of schools and childcare centers, is planned for Sept. 27. Opening up beyond that will depend on the state meeting targets for reducing the rate of new infections. The Melbourne curfew will be fully lifted on Oct. 26, as long as the daily average is lower than five new cases and fewer than five infections have been reported from unknown sources in the previous 14 days.Victoria reported 63 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from a daily peak of 687 on Aug. 4, the state’s health department reported Sunday via Twitter.Also read: Israelis protest against PM Benjamin Netanyahu as coronavirus infections spikePrime Minister Scott Morrison, who is pushing for states to lift border restrictions to help kick-start an economic revival, said the move to extend lockdown measures was “hard and crushing news,” for the people of Victoria.“The proposed roadmap will come at a further economic cost,” Morrison said in a media statement. “While this needs to be weighed up against mitigating the risk of further community outbreak, it is also true that the continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting on mental health.”Australia’s business lobby has also called on Andrews to move quicker to re-open businesses and get the state economy moving again. “Where businesses can operate safely with strict protocols in place, they should be allowed to open, and people should be allowed to work,” Jennifer Westacott, chief executive officer at the Business Council of Australia, said in a statement.Morrison said Friday that most state and territory leaders have recommitted to opening up the economy by December, although he failed to secure an immediate agreement to lift border restrictions that are hampering the recovery.Australia’s first lockdown, which lasted roughly from March to May, was one of the most successful in the world, bringing down the number of cases to just a handful a day nationwide. But security failures at quarantine hotels for returning travelers and poor communication of critical information to migrant communities allowed the virus to roar back in Victoria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-covid-19-epicenter-to-start-easing-lockdown-measures/story-A6zApmt4LtoJwg8MF3Mb6K.html
06-09-2020||World||Germany to discuss possible sanctions against Russia over Navalny’s poisoning||Germany, the current head of the European Union, will discuss possible sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, its foreign minister said Sunday.Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin.Germany said last week there was “unequivocal evidence” that President Vladimir Putin’s top foe had been poisoned using Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.“We have high expectations of the Russian government to solve this serious crime,” Heiko Maas told German daily Bild. “If the government has nothing to do with the attack, then it is in its own interest to back this up with facts.”If Russia does not help clarify what happened “in the coming days”, Germany will be compelled to “discuss a response with our allies,” Maas said.The crime against Navalny was a violation of the international Chemical Weapons Convention and there must be an appropriate response, he said. “When we think about sanctions, they should be as targeted as possible.”Western leaders and many Russians have expressed horror at what Navalny’s allies say is the first known use of chemical weapons against a high-profile opposition leader on Russian soil.The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Germany is yet to share any findings with Moscow’s prosecutors.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe the Navalny case.“Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it’s calling. On purpose?” she said on Facebook.‘Several indications’Maas said there were “several indications” that Russia was behind the poisoning, in the strongest accusations yet from Germany.“The deadly substance with which Navalny was poisoned has in the past been found in the hands of Russian authorities.“Only a small number of people have access to Novichok and this poison was used by Russian secret services in the attack against former agent Sergei Skripal,” he said, referring to a 2018 attack on the former double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury.The Skripals spent days in a coma before recovering but local resident Dawn Sturgess died after picking up a discarded perfume bottle allegedly used to carry the poison.The Navalny case is only the latest in what Berlin has seen as a series of provocations by Putin that have damaged ties and called future cooperation into question.The poisoning comes a year after the murder in broad daylight of a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park, which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia.Nord Stream 2 German Chancellor Angela Merkel also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the “outrageous” spying attempts.On the subject of which sanctions could be discussed by the EU, Maas did not rule out action relating to Nord Stream 2, a multi-billion-euro Russian-German gas pipeline nearing completion that has drawn the ire of US and European partners alike.“I hope... that the Russians do not force us to change our position on Nord Stream,” Maas said, adding that the consequences of any potential cancellation of the project would also need to be weighed, and that the debate on sanctions should not be “reduced” to one point.The controversial pipeline is meant to deliver Russian gas to Europe, but the German government has faced growing calls to abandon it as tensions with Russia escalate.Bild slammed Merkel last week for comments that Nord Stream 2 should be judged independently from Moscow’s actions.“Vladimir Putin views the gas pipeline as an important strategic weapon against Europe and as a vital source of funding for his war against his own people,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-discuss-possible-sanctions-against-russia-over-navalny-s-poisoning/story-7paJBCyKOISCSlbUaSep0K.html

Trump is facing storm for his alleged disparaging remarks against the American war dead.The allegations, sourced anonymously, describe multiple offensive comments by the president toward fallen and captured US service members, including calling World War I dead at an American military cemetery in France “losers” and “suckers” in 2018.The Atlantic carried a report on the alleged comments of the president, which was dismissed by the White House.But a new twist came in the story when a correspondent at pro-Trump Fox News confirmed that Trump indeed made those remarks. Jennifer Griffins, Fox News’ national security correspondent, posted a long thread on Twitter in which she said that the president had not wanted to honour the American war dead at the Aisne-Marne cemetery in France.“This former official heard the President say about American veterans: “What’s in it for them? They don’t make any money.” Source: “It was a character flaw of the President. He could not understand why someone would die for their country, not worth it”,” Griffins said in one of her tweets. This former official heard the President say about American veterans: "What's in it for them?

It is a disgrace,” he added in his remarks on Friday.Biden said that “the president should humbly apologise to every Gold Star mother and father, to every Blue Star family that he’s denigrated. ...Who the heck does he think he is?”Trump, meanwhile, said no apology was necessary, because it was a “fake story”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-faces-storm-over-alleged-comments-on-war-dead-calls-for-fox-news-reported-to-be-fired/story-GFv6YYZQcp9XodX9pkeN1H.html

US regulators are considering adding Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to a list of foreign buyers that need government permission to acquire technology or components, according to The Wall Street Journal and other outlets. They said officials are looking at whether SMIC plays a role in Chinese military development. “We have no relationship with the Chinese military,” the company said in a statement. It said SMIC products are “solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses.” The company said it is “open to sincere and transparent communication” with Washington to resolve “potential misunderstandings.” SMIC is a leader in a semiconductor industry built up by the ruling Communist Party in an effort to reduce China’s reliance on foreign technology. The Trump administration is trying block Chinese access to US technology it worries might be used to make weapons or develop competitors to American industry. The US-Chinese tariff war that erupted in 2018 was sparked in part by Washington’s complaints about Beijing’s technology ambitions. The United States and other governments complain Chinese development plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Washington also worries about China’s development of long-range missiles, supercomputers that can be used in nuclear warhead development and other high-tech weapons. That comes amid tension over control of the South China Sea and other territorial disputes. Washington has imposed similar curbs on access to US process chips and other components for China’s first global tech competitor, Huawei Technologies Ltd., one of the biggest makers of smartphones and network equipment. That threatens to cripple Huawei’s business. Chinese companies including Huawei are developing their own processor chips and other technology. But factories that produce them require American manufacturing technology for which there are few alternatives. SMIC said it previously was granted “validated end-user status” by the agency that would impose the export controls. Such status allows a Chinese company to export US technology without applying for a license for each shipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-chipmaker-denies-military-ties-as-us-steps-up-feud/story-qPEKEHIUKh2eBfVkdorhFK.html

In a book due to be published next week, Cohen alleges that Trump described Mandela as a poor leader, according to the Washington Post which reported it obtained a copy of the book.According to the newspaper, Cohen wrote that following Mandela’s death in 2013, Trump said: “Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it’s a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader.”Cohen also alleged that Trump said: “Tell me one country run by a black person that isn’t a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.”White House Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany responded by attacking Cohen’s credibility.“Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies,” McEnany said in a statement.Trump has called Cohen “a rat,” and a liar, and Cohen has said he faced repeated death threats from Trump supporters.Trump, a Republican, is seeking re-election and will face Democrat Joe Biden at the polls on November 3. At the Republican convention in August where Trump was formally nominated to appear on the ballot, speakers defended Trump against past accusations of racism.Cohen alleged that Trump was dismissive of minorities, and that Trump said during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would not win the Hispanic vote, the Washington Post reported. According to Cohen, Trump said: “Like the blacks, they’re too stupid to vote for Trump.”Cohen is serving time for tax evasion, false statements and campaign finance violations, the last related to payments to silence women who alleged affairs with Trump before the 2016 presidential election.He was released to home confinement in May given the risks of catching Covid-19 in prison, but then was briefly imprisoned again in July. A federal judge then ruled Cohen had been subjected to retaliation for planning to publish his book, and ordered him released again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-says-president-disparaged-black-leaders-and-voters-report/story-YWE0VspUluCkSN3JwiCxFK.html

North Korea has suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests since 2017, but efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade it to give up its nuclear and missile programs have achieved little.Trump is seeking reelection in November and a North Korean missile test before that would highlight the lack of progress despite Trump’s unprecedented meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.There was no immediate comment from the State Department or the Pentagon on the CSIS report.At news conference earlier on Friday, Trump hailed his relationship with North Korea, saying that when he was elected people had predicted he would be at war with the country within a week.“In the meantime, we’ve gotten along with them. We didn’t get to war,” he said.Trump has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea since 2017 as a success from his diplomacy and has sought to play down numerous shorter-range tests in the period.“North Korea already tested a PKS-3 SLBM last October. And it didn’t cross Trump’s redline then, and is unlikely to this time. Trump won’t care,” Vipin Narang, a non-proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter.South Korea’s military said the Pukguksong-3 tested last year flew 450 km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 910 km (565 miles) and would have had a range of about 1,300 km (800 miles) on a standard trajectory.News of the activity at Sinpo comes amid signs that North Korea may be preparing for a major military parade in October, which some analysts believe could be used to show off new missiles as the country has done at such events in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/images-suggest-north-korea-may-be-preparing-launch-of-submarine-missile-report/story-KFq8IvFCLnrZ8bZLcboShP.html

She was also a student of fine arts at the University Of Balochistan. It is believed her husband killed Shaheen because she was becoming famous in her area, a conservative part of Balochistan.In a report compiled in 2018, it was estimated that 50 people, including 30 women, had been killed in the name of honour in Balochistan.The report was compiled by The Aurat Foundation — a non-governmental organisation — working for protection of the rights of women and shared with the public at a press conference in Quetta, the provincial capital.According to programme officer Muhammad Ashfaq Mengal, the victims were mostly killed by close relatives, including husbands, brothers and other relatives in the name of so-called honour and small family feuds.This seems to be the case behind the death of Shaheen as well. “The killing was the result of domestic violence,” Kech superintendent of police Najeebullah Pandrani said, adding that police were investigating the murder.He said no arrests had been made so far. However, Shaheen’s family lodged a first information report (FIR) against her husband, whom she married five months ago. Her body was shifted to her residence for burial, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-woman-journalist-in-balochistan-allegedly-shot-dead-by-husband/story-QgUF1ddyrdRs9CSfDJRGgN.html

Dozens of injured worshipers are still receiving medical treatment, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.The explosion occurred on the evening of Friday as people gathered in the mosque for the evening prayer.According to preliminary data from Narayanganj Fire Service’s deputy assistant director Abdullah Al Arefin, as quoted in the report, gas leaked out from underground pipes and accumulated inside the mosque and then detonated “due to sparks when someone tried to switch [one of the six] air conditioners or fans on or off.”There was a 7-year-old child among the deceased, according to the report.More than 15 people are reportedly still being treated from burns and other injuries at the Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. All of them are in critical condition, Partha Shangkar Paul, a resident doctor at the institute, was cited in the report as saying.The local fire department and police have launched an investigation into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-gas-explosion-in-bangladesh-mosque-rises-to-21/story-AMX1fzjqMeTja5vlKWSajP.html
06-09-2020||World||‘Hands off the children’: masked men arrest protesting Belarusian students||Masked security agents dragged students off the streets and bundled them into vans as new protests broke out against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday on the fourth weekend since his disputed re-election. Up to 30 people were detained for taking part in unsanctioned protests, Russian news agency TASS quoted the Minsk police as saying. Draped in red-and-white opposition flags, students staged protests in several places in the capital, including outside the Minsk State Linguistic Institute where police had arrested five people on Friday, local media footage showed. Elsewhere masked men dragged away students who had gathered at an eatery in Karl Marx Street in the centre of Minsk, while some of the protesters shouted “tribunal!”, according to footage shown by news outlet TUT.BY.Thousands of women later held a separate march through Minsk in the afternoon, shouting “hands off the children” as one of their slogans. One woman went up to masked security forces standing in a line, showing them pictures of protesters with bruises on their bodies. The government has previously denied abusing detainees after many come out of prison following the election complaining of punishment beatings.Protesters later converged on a Catholic church in Independence Square, with hundreds crammed inside for a service, in solidarity with Minsk’s archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz who was barred from re-entering Belarus on Monday.After the service finished, priests and protesters marched in a procession around the building known as the Red Church and said prayers on the square, with hundreds of people shining their phones as flashlights.A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko has struggled to contain a wave of mass protests and strikes since he won a sixth term at an election last month that opponents say was rigged. He denies electoral fraud. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, his main challenger who fled into exile two days after the election, will travel to Warsaw to meet the Polish prime minister next week. A member of her campaign team and a senior member of the opposition Coordination Council, Olga Kovalkova, on Saturday also arrived in the Polish capital fearing she would be arrested again if she remained in Belarus.Lukashenko has previously dismissed the coronavirus pandemic as a “psychosis” that could be tackled by drinking vodka and taking saunas. But on Saturday he appeared to chide the protesters for spreading the disease. “We stagger through the streets, rubbing against each other,” he said at a televised government meeting.“Where’s the social distancing and so on in that? We’re doing everything we can to delay the moment when we say goodbye to this disease. That’s unacceptable.” Thousands took part in protests that coincided with the start of the school year on Tuesday. At the Minsk State Linguistic Institute, students sang “Do you hear the people sing”, a protest anthem from the musical “Les Miserables”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hands-off-the-children-masked-men-arrest-protesting-belarusian-students/story-6LGItvzjqbjyqD1d3jfKrM.html
06-09-2020||World||Britain will not be EU ‘client state’: UK Brexit envoy||Britain will not become “a client state” under the terms of any post-Brexit trade deal struck with the European Union, the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost insisted late on Saturday.Ahead of an eighth and final round of scheduled talks with the EU next week, Frost said Britain was “not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws”.“We are not going to be a client state,” he told the Mail on Sunday in a rare newspaper interview, as the stalled negotiations with the bloc near their conclusion.“We are not going to accept provisions that give them control over our money or the way we can organise things here in the UK and that should not be controversial,” Frost added. “That’s what being an independent country is about, that’s what the British people voted for and that’s what will happen at the end of the year, come what may.”Britain formally left the EU in January, nearly four years after a landmark referendum to end almost 50 years of European integration.But it remains bound by EU rules until the end of this year as both sides try to thrash out the terms of their future relationship.The talks have become gridlocked over several issues, including so-called level playing field provisions and state aid as well as fisheries. Time is running out for both sides to reach agreement, given the need for the deal and legal texts to be scrutinised by member states and ratified by the European parliament.The deadlock has heightened fears of a no-deal Brexit after December 31, when much of the trade between Britain and the bloc could revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and tariffs.However, Frost insisted Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his senior ministers are not “scared” of such a scenario.“If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that,” he said.Referring to several years of prior negotiations, Frost said the previous UK government led by ex-premier Theresa May “had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments” during Brexit talks -- a mistake they would not be making.“A lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-will-not-be-eu-client-state-uk-brexit-envoy/story-WDK4n0ny8OWVKqldmlt6TP.html

The signs of life detected in the past two days, Lermanta said, were breaths of fellow rescuers already inside the building picked up by their sensitive equipment. He said efforts would now focus on clearing the rubble and finding remains.“We never stop with even one percent of hope,” Lermanta said, of finding a body. “We never stop until the job is done.”The Aug. 4 blast killed about 190 people, injured 6,000 more, and devastated whole neighbourhoods. The authorities held ceremonies on Friday to mark a month since the explosion tore into a city already reeling from a crippling economic crisis.Rescue efforts dominated local and social media, as the Lebanese were transfixed, desperate for a miracle. None came. The ruined building where the search was continuing lies between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, among the hardest hit areas by the blast and home to many old buildings that crumbled as the shockwave ripped through. Work was slow, rescue workers said earlier in the day, as the badly damaged building was at risk of complete collapse. “The building is really crumbling, it’s scary and there’s a lot of danger to the team,” Abou Moussa said. Workers used shovels and their hands to dig, while mechanical diggers and a crane lifted heavy debris. Scanning equipment was also used to create 3D images of the wrecked building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-signs-of-life-in-beirut-rubble-after-three-day-search-for-blast-survivors/story-ezpGWZxdnykDcNTuLLtGPP.html
06-09-2020||World||NY attorney general to form grand jury after Prude death||New York’s attorney general on Saturday moved to form a grand jury to investigate the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after being hooded and held down by Rochester police earlier this year.“The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish,” Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement about Prude’s death, which has sparked nightly protests and calls for reform. She said the grand jury would be part of an “exhaustive investigation.”Prude’s death after his brother called for help for his erratic behavior in March has roiled New York’s third-largest city since video of the encounter was made public earlier this week, with protesters demanding more accountability for how it happened and legislation to change how authorities respond to mental health emergencies.“This is just the beginning,” Ashley Gantt, a protest organizer, said by email after James’ announcement. “We will not be stopped in our quest for truth and justice.”Protesters gathered Saturday for a fourth night on the street where Prude, naked and handcuffed, was held face-down as snow fell. Policy body camera video shows officers covering Prude’s head with a “spit hood,” designed to protect police from bodily fluids, then pressing his face into the pavement for two minutes.Prude died March 30 after he was taken off life support.The Monroe County medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” Excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, were contributing factors, the report said.A police internal affairs investigation cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing, concluding in April that their “actions and conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and consistent with their training.”James’ office opened its investigation the same month. Under New York law, deaths of unarmed people in police custody are often turned over to the attorney general’s office, rather than handled by local officials.Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier this week called on James to expedite the probe.“Today, I applaud Attorney General Tish James for taking swift, decisive action in empaneling a grand jury,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Justice delayed is justice denied and the people of New York deserve the truth.”Advocates say Prude’s death and the actions of the seven now-suspended Rochester police officers demonstrate how police are ill-equipped to deal with people suffering mental problems.Having police respond can be a “recipe for disaster,” The National Alliance on Mental Illness said in a statement Friday.Prude’s death “is yet another harrowing tragedy, but a story not unfamiliar to us,” the advocacy group said. “People in crisis deserve help, not handcuffs.”Stanley Martin, an organizer of Free the People Rochester, told reporters: “We do not need violent workers with guns to respond to mental health crises.”Activists have marched nightly in the city of 210,000 on Lake Ontario since the police body camera footage of the encounter with Prude were released by his family Wednesday.Friday night’s protest resulted in 11 arrests, police said. As they had the night before, officers doused activists at police headquarters with a chemical spray to drive them from barricades around the building.As the night wore on, demonstrators were pushed further back, as police fired what appeared to be pepper balls. Fireworks were shot off and a bus stop was set on fire.Prude’s family has said he appeared to be spiraling into crisis in the hours before his encounter with police.“You’re trying to kill me!” the 41-year-old man is heard saying.A police union has defended the officers involved in the encounter, saying they were strictly following department training and protocols, including using the mesh hood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-attorney-general-to-form-grand-jury-after-prude-death/story-Ywly9fLhpjXGxj9BDB6gSJ.html

One month on, seven people are still listed as missingOn Wednesday night, a sniffer dog deployed by Chilean rescuers detected a scent beneath a collapsed building in the heavily damaged Gemmayzeh neighbourhood adjacent to the port.High-tech sensors confirmed an apparent heartbeat and rescue teams took up the search.But after three days’ work removing piles of masonry, Chilean rescue specialist Francesco Lermanda late Saturday said there was no longer any sign of life under the rubble.“Sadly today we can say that technically we have no sign of life inside the building,” he told the media.Two female rescue workers on Saturday slipped through a final tunnel to check for any victim in the last air pocket where there could possibly be but found nobody there, he said.Work would however continue to make the zone secure and ensure there was no possiblity of any victim being left inside, Lermanda said.In the afternoon, engineer Riyadh al-Assad had said the workers had cleared two layers of rubble and reached a stairway, where they found no-one.The civil defence agency’s operations director, George Abou Moussa, in the morning said the chances of finding someone alive were “very low”. But civil defence officer Qassem Khater said his team was determined not to give up.“We are not leaving the site until we’ve finished going through the rubble, even if a new building collapse threatens,” he said.Chilean specialist Walter Munoz in the morning had put the chances of finding a survivor at “two percent”.Lebanese officials had played down the chances of anyone surviving so long beneath the rubble.But even the faint hope of a miracle caught the imagination of a country already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.“I was not aware I needed a miracle that much. Please God, give Beirut this miracle it deserves,” said Selim Mourad, a 32-year-old film-maker.Lebanon lacks the tools and expertise to handle advanced search and rescue operations, so they have been supported by experts from Chile, France and the Unites States.The Chileans, in particular, have been praised as heroes by many Lebanese on social media, who have compared their expertise with the lacklustre performance of what they see as their own absent state.The country observed a minute’s silence for the dead on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-sign-of-life-in-search-for-beirut-blast-survivor/story-mxCYCYyICujZHzh86YUZwI.html

More than 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of ice cubes were needed to fill up the box, after Koeberl stepped inside wearing nothing but swim trunks.In order to fight the “wave of pain” caused by the freezing temperatures, Koeberl says he was trying to focus on positive emotions.“I’m fighting the pain by visualizing and drawing on positive emotions so I can dampen this wave of pain,” Koeberl told reporters. “That way I can endure.”A small crowd of people watched on as Koeberl beat his own record from 2019 by 30 minutes on the town square of Melk in Lower Austria.After being taken out of the ice box by helpers he said that the sun felt “really great” on his back.Koeberl is planning to beat his own record one more time — next year in Los Angeles. His team said that Koeberl’s personal record is also the current world record when it comes to exposing the body to ice for as long as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austrian-man-spends-2-5-hours-in-box-filled-with-ice-cubes-breaks-his-own-record/story-ufZhKuOrFZBhjMmtCCNwCJ.html
06-09-2020||World||Facebook blocks ailing man’s planned end-of-life broadcasts||Facebook on Saturday blocked live broadcasts from a chronically ill bed-ridden man who appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron for a medically-assisted death and who wanted to show what he expects will be a painful end to his life after he announced that he was stopping all food and drink.Prostrate on his bed, Alain Cocq posted video of himself Friday after taking what he said would be his last liquid meal.“I know the days ahead are going to be very difficult,” he said. “But I have taken my decision and I am serene.” In a letter this week, which Cocq also posted, Macron said that French law forbade him from granting his request for the “right to leave with dignity,” with a medically-assisted death.“With emotion, I respect your approach because it speaks to the very intimate relationship that each of us builds with the end of our life and our death,” Macron said in the letter dated Thursday, sent after one of his aides spoke at length with Cocq by telephone in August.But Macron added that “because I am not above the law, I am not in a position to grant your request.” In a handwritten addition at the end, Macron signed off the letter with the words, “With all of my personal support and my profound respect.” French media have reported that Cocq, a 57-year-old former plumber, suffers from a long-term and incurable degenerative illness. He says that he has lived in great pain for 34 years and that after multiple operations, he prefers to die. In his Facebook post on Friday evening, he said the alternative would be “the degradation of my body.” “I am going to stop hydrating myself when I turn off the lights,” he said. “Given my general condition, it’s likely to be quick, which is what I hope for, because I’m not a masochist.” He said he would keep taking painkillers.“The path to my deliverance is starting and, believe me, I am happy about it,” he said. “To those I won’t see again, I say goodbye. Such is life.” Cocq had planned to subsequently live-broadcast the end of his life that he expects will follow within days of his decision to stop all food, liquids and medicines. But a message Saturday on Cocq’s account said that Facebook has blocked him from posting videos until Tuesday.Facebook confirmed that it had blocked Cocq’s live broadcasts.“Our hearts go out to Alain Cocq and those who are affected by this sad situation,” it said in a statement. “While we respect his decision to draw attention to this complex and difficult issue, based on the guidance of experts, we have taken steps to keep Alain from broadcasting live, as we do not allow the depiction of suicide attempts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-blocks-ailing-man-s-planned-end-of-life-broadcasts/story-oYloGac78nhzhwmt9RGHPO.html
06-09-2020||World||Israelis protest against PM Benjamin Netanyahu as coronavirus infections spike||Thousands of Israelis gathered outside the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem on Saturday despite record levels of coronavirus infections, calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to resign because he is on trial for corruption charges.The protesters held banners reading “Revolution” and “Citizens Write the Constitution” as they marched toward Netanyahu’s residence. A sign aimed at the prime minister was projected on a building reading in Hebrew: “Enough with you.”The government’s missteps in handling the coronavirus crisis after relative success in its early stages have mostly fueled the summer-long weekend demonstrations. The death toll has surpassed 1,000 and the country is mulling a new lockdown to stop the rapid spike in daily infections. Israel currently has over 26,000 active Covid-19 patients.Police have clashed with protesters on several occasions and used water cannons to clear them off main streets and squares, though in recent weeks the gatherings have been calmer but larger.On Friday, a police spokesman said they had arrested a man who was “dressed up as a woman in a provocative way.” An Associated Press photographer saw police arresting at least five people.Netanyahu’s achievements on the external foreign policy do not seem to stand by his side at home.On Friday, Serbia and Kosovo gave Israel a diplomatic boost as Serbia announced it will move its embassy to Jerusalem and Kosovo said it will establish ties with Israel with an embassy in Jerusalem. On Saturday, Netanyahu praised the U.S.-brokered deal, noting that Serbia is the first European country and Kosovo is the first Muslim majority country to have embassies in contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians want the city’s eastern part for a future capital.The announcements by Serbia and Kosovo came about three weeks after the U.S. brokered a deal to establish and normalize ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office despite being charged last year with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. He has denied the allegations, calling them a “witch hunt” and lashing out at the judiciary, law enforcement and media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-protest-against-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-as-coronavirus-infections-spike/story-MsSoh59UdwWkmaRlqhkKFP.html
06-09-2020||World||WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange to fight US extradition bid in UK court||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is set to fight for his freedom in a British court after a decade of legal drama, as he challenges American authorities’ attempt to extradite him on spying charges over the site’s publication of secret US military documents.Lawyers for Assange and the US government are scheduled to face off in London Monday at an extradition hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges adding up to a maximum sentence of 175 years. His lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists at risk.Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said the case “is fundamentally about basic human rights and freedom of speech.”“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes – such as the publications Julian has been charged for – should be protected from prosecution,” she said.American prosecutors say Assange is a criminal, not a free-speech hero.They allege that Assange conspired with US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They also say he conspired with members of hacking organizations and sought to recruit hackers to provide WikiLeaks with classified information.“By disseminating the materials in an unredacted form, he likely put people -- human rights activists, journalists, advocates, religious leaders, dissidents and their families -- at risk of serious harm, torture or even death,” James Lewis, a British lawyer acting for the US government, told a hearing in February.Assange argues he is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and says the leaked documents exposed U.S. military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.His lawyers argue the prosecution is an abuse of process by a Trump administration that wants to make an example of Assange. They say he would be held in inhuman conditions and would not get a fair trial in the United States.Journalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request. Amnesty International said Assange was “the target of a negative public campaign by U.S. officials at the highest levels.”“If Julian Assange is prosecuted it could have a chilling effect on media freedom, leading publishers and journalists to self-censor in fear of retaliation,” said Amnesty’s Europe Director, Nils Muižnieks.The four-week extradition hearing is part of a twisting saga rife with competing claims of hacking, spying and subterfuge. Assange’s lawyers claim the US intelligence services directed a private security firm to spy on him while he was living in Ecuador’s London embassy -- a case currently being heard in a Spanish court.Assange also alleges he was offered a pardon by the Trump administration if he agreed to say Russia wasn’t involved in leaking Democratic National Committee emails that were published by WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. The White House denies that claim.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of UK and Swedish authorities -- but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison as he awaits the extradition decision. Supporters say the ordeal has harmed Assange’s physical and mental health, leaving him with depression, dental problems and a serious shoulder ailment.Assange’s partner Stella Moris, who had two sons with him while he lived in the embassy, said he looked thinner and was in “a lot of pain” when she visited him in prison in late August for the first time since March.The extradition hearing opened in February but was put on hold when the UK went into lockdown in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is resuming with social distancing measures in court and video feeds so that journalists and observers can watch remotely.Assange is expected to be brought by prison van from Belmarsh to the Old Bailey criminal court for the hearing, which is due to run until early October. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is likely to take weeks or even months to consider her verdict, with the losing side likely to appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-to-fight-us-extradition-bid-in-uk-court/story-KbOY8HYw2XLYfIVaAnaAtL.html
