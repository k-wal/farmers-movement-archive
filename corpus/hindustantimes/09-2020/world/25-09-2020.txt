This applies also to the dependents of principal visa holders.The proposed rule, published by the department of homeland security, will be open for comments for 30 days. But it was not clear when it will go into effect. President Donald Trump has only a few months to finalise the rule by January 2021, and longer if he is re-elected. If he loses the November 3 election to Joe Biden, the Democrat will be under no obligation to implement it.The duration of stay can be extended either by filing for extension with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or by going back to their countries of origin for fresh visas.The two-year rule will apply to people from countries that are either on state department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism or who have an overstay rate of over 10%.“The significant increase in the volume of F academic students, J exchange visitors, and I foreign information media representatives poses a challenge to the Department’s ability to monitor and oversee these categories of non-immigrants while they are in the United States,” the notice said.The department added it is “concerned about the integrity of the programmes and a potential for increased risk to national security” from people on these visas.There are an estimated 200,000 Indian students in the US, which has admitted an estimated 1 million international students every year. Together, they have generated around $41 billion’s worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-proposes-rule-to-cut-stay-for-foreign-students-journalists/story-9KuaVBWLbV4xofdjagbVHP.html

25-09-2020||World||Covid-19 can’t crush human rights, declares UN gathering||In a diminished spotlight because of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading human rights defenders on Friday urged people in these fractured times to connect through politics — and vote, too.“In many places around the world, participation is being denied and civic space is being crushed,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on the sidelines of the annual UN gathering of world leaders, this year held online.People must take part in the decisions that affect their lives, he said, noting “new heights” of inequalities and and warning: “The window to address climate change is almost shut.”In the cautious language of diplomacy, no names were named, no governments called out. But around the world, the crack of batons and the tang of pepper spray have been common as some authorities are accused of using the cover of Covid-19 restrictions to commit abuses and limit free speech.In Venezuela, advocates said quarantine was used to erode civil liberties. In Kenya, watchdogs said police enforcing curfew beat or shot dead civilians including a 13-year-old boy.People must push back even in this socially distanced world, speakers said.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned of a “crisis of governance” and a marginalization of voices that she said will only deepen grievances and harm all of society.“We are witnessing an erosion of public trust in institutions and traditional politics,” said Eamon Gilmore, the European Union’s special representative for human rights.Young people in particular are feeling increasingly insecure, he said. Economies are crumbling in the pandemic, erasing job opportunities, and millions of students are unable to return to school.Speaking up for youth, the founder of Action for Justice and Human Rights in Liberia, Satta Sheriff, told the gathering that people like her should not be seen as simply waiting for an empty seat at the table.Youth in the West African nation successfully pressed the government to declare rape a national emergency after days of peaceful protests, she said. Despite that win, access to decision-making spaces remains limited for youth, who face the “stereotype of constantly being labeled troublemakers,” she said.Such frustration is especially potent in Africa, with the world’s youngest population and a median age of 19. The continent’s population is expected to double by 2050, and already a small corps of young opposition leaders in places like Uganda is challenging heads of state who have spent years, even decades, in power.The Covid-19 pandemic is a crucial chance for governments to fight the urge to impose repressive measures and instead win the trust of citizens that’s key to combating the spread of the virus, speakers said.“It’s the good governance” that has kept Latvia’s confirmed virus case rate relatively low compared to the rest of Europe, said the country’s ambassador to the UN, Andrejs Pildegovics. South Korea’s ambassador, Cho Hyun, agreed, citing people’s voluntary wearing of face masks in his country’s relative success in containing the virus.As scores of heads of state this week are making urgent calls to band together to fight the crises of Covid-19, Friday’s speakers on human rights stressed that governments must open the political space for everyone.As the global toll closed in on 1 million deaths, the UK’s minister for human rights, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, reminded listeners: “It’s only over when it’s over for all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-can-t-crush-human-rights-declares-un-gathering/story-PzYVK69OIQVw3J4yFHcSUK.html
25-09-2020||World||2 charged in deadly Covid-19 outbreak at Massachusetts veterans’ home||Two people were indicted for their alleged role in a COVID-19 outbreak at a Massachusetts veterans’ home that contributed to the deaths of at least 76 residents, the state’s attorney general announced on Friday. A grand jury on Thursday indicted superintendent Bennett Walsh and David Clinton, the former medical director of the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, on charges of criminal neglect related to their work at the facility. “We allege that the actions of these defendants during the COVID-19 outbreak at the facility put veterans at higher risk of infection and death and warrant criminal charges,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. Healey said the charges stem from the two individuals’ roles in decision-making at the home that led to the consolidation of two dementia units into one. The move placed symptomatic residents, including some who had tested positive for the coronavirus, and asymptomatic residents in close proximity, “increasing the exposure of asymptomatic veterans to the virus,” officials said. “We believe this is the first criminal case in the country brought against those involved in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Healey told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-charged-in-deadly-covid-19-outbreak-at-massachusetts-veterans-home/story-AaGVlbidBC03IFx2zsTZDI.html
25-09-2020||World||UK asks China to allow UN unfettered access to Xinjiang||The Boris Johnson government on Friday called on China to allow the United Nations unfettered access to Xinjiang following what it called “grave concerns about China’s policies against the Uighur Muslims” in the region. Tariq Ahmad, foreign office minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth, said in a statement on China at the UN Human Rights Council that there is “compelling evidence of systemic human rights violations in Xinjiang”. On Hong Kong, Ahmad described the UK’s deep concerns about the “direct threat” that Beijing’s new National Security Law allegedly represents to rights and freedoms in the Special Administrative Region, the foreign office said.Ahmad said: “(Of) grave concern, in Xinjiang, there is compelling evidence – including from the Chinese authorities’ own documents – of systematic human rights violations. Culture and religion are severely restricted, and we have seen credible reports of forced labour and forced birth control. Staggeringly, up to 1.8 million people have been detained without trial”.He added: “Across the country, we also remain seriously concerned about the pressure on media freedom…(We) call on China to uphold the rights and freedoms in the Joint Declaration, to respect the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary, allow unfettered access to Xinjiang and to release all those who are arbitrarily detained”.Ahmad said Beijing’s imposition of the National Security Law amounts to a serious breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration, allegedly violating Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and directly threatens rights and freedoms.“The National Security Law is being implemented with the apparent intention to eliminate dissent. It allows prosecution of certain cases in mainland China, a jurisdiction where defendants are often held for long periods without charge or access to legal counsel, and where we have concerns about judicial independence, due process, and reports of torture”, he told the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-asks-china-to-allow-un-unfettered-access-to-xinjiang/story-gQdBUUq0D68hiG9HSlgRII.html
25-09-2020||World||Covid-19: London is at very worrying tipping point, says mayor||London mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday said the British capital is at a “very worrying tipping point’ as officials revealed that it is being placed on the countrywide Covid-19 ‘watchlist’ following a rise in infections.New local lockdowns were announced in Cardiff and Swansea, amid growing concerns over an exponential rise in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week announced more curbs short of a full national lockdown, urging people to take basic precautions.Khan said: “London is at a very worrying tipping point right now. We’re seeing a sharp rise in 111 calls (for medical care), hospital admissions and patients in ICU. The near-collapse of test and trace and the resurgence of the virus means new measures to slow its spread were absolutely necessary”.“Testing capacity was diverted away from London in the last two weeks to other national hotspots…The lack of testing capacity is totally unacceptable and it is why London has been added to the government’s coronavirus watchlist as an area of concern”, he added.New daily cases in London are below 500, but it has been added to the list of places of concern. The daily new cases in the UK rose to 6,634 on Thursday evening, nearing the daily rise recorded in April and May. There were 40 deaths in the last 24 hours.London Councils, representing all 32 boroughs, said London is being placed on the national Covid-19 watchlist. No new measures were being taken, but London’s entry on the list was a “stark reminder that now is time for all Londoners to pull together and take action to keep themselves, their families and their communities safe, and to ensure that London’s economy is protected”, it said in a statement.“There are no additional measures at this stage but it is welcome that the city’s testing capacity is boosted so that Londoners have timely access to Covid-19 tests and the government must ensure that this is sustained from now on. We ask all Londoners to work together and abide by the national restrictions announced on Tuesday”, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-is-at-very-worrying-tipping-point-says-mayor/story-mBiUOEarRInFkQ6D8aTjcI.html
25-09-2020||World||Highly effective coronavirus antibodies identified, may lead to passive Covid-19 vaccine||Scientists have identified highly effective antibodies against the novel coronavirus, which they say can lead to the development of a passive vaccination for COVID-19.Unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time. However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, the researchers said.The research, published in the journal Cell, also shows that some SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bind to tissue samples from various organs, which could potentially trigger undesired side effects.The scientists at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin isolated almost 600 different antibodies from the blood of individuals who had overcome COVID-19, the disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2.By means of laboratory tests, they were able to narrow this number down to a few antibodies that were particularly effective at binding to the virus. The researchers then produced these antibodies artificially using cell cultures.The so-called neutralising antibodies bind to the virus, as crystallographic analysis reveals, and thus prevent the pathogen from entering cells and reproducing, they said.In addition, virus recognition by antibodies helps immune cells to eliminate the pathogen. Studies in hamsters -- which, like humans, are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 -- confirmed the high efficacy of the selected antibodies.“If the antibodies were given after an infection, the hamsters developed mild disease symptoms at most. If the antibodies were applied preventively -- before infection -- the animals did not get sick,” said Jakob Kreye, coordinator of the research project.The researchers noted that treating infectious diseases with antibodies has a long history.For COVID-19, this approach is also being investigated through the administration of plasma derived from the blood of recovered patients. With the plasma, antibodies of donors are transferred, they said.“Ideally, the most effective antibody is produced in a controlled manner on an industrial scale and in constant quality. This is the goal we are pursuing,” said Momsen Reincke, first author of the research.“Three of our antibodies are particularly promising for clinical development,” explained Harald Pruss, a research group leader at the DZNE and also a senior physician at Charite – Universitatsmedizin Berlin.“Using these antibodies, we have started to develop a passive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2,” Pruss said.In addition to the treatment of patients, preventive protection of healthy individuals who have had contact with infected persons is also a potential application, the researchers said. How long the protection lasts will have to be investigated in clinical studies, they said.“This is because, unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time,” Pruss said. In general, the protection provided by a passive vaccination is less persistent than that provided by an active vaccination, the researchers said.However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, they said.“It would be best if both options were available so that a flexible response could be made depending on the situation,” Pruss added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-effective-coronavirus-antibodies-identified-may-lead-to-passive-covid-19-vaccine/story-cEENdXizjGZQJJMta69VEO.html

The world doesn’t need lessons on human rights from a country which has been known as nursery and epicentre of terrorism,” he said, according to ANI.‘Pakistan exploited our youth, ordered killing of fellow Kashmiris’: EFSAS directorKumar also highlighted the atrocities Balochs have to suffer in Pakistan. “Enforced disappearances, state violence and forced mass displacements, harassment, extrajudicial killings, army operations, torture, kill-and-dumps, torture camps, detention centres, military camps are regular features in Balochistan,” he said, according to ANI.The Free Balochistan Movement (FBM) issued a statement on September 20, saying Pakistan continues to promote unhindered religious extremism in occupied areas of Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to ANI. India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism recordThe organisation’s spokesperson Gamshaad Baloch said that on September 13, the armed wing of Jamaat-e-Islami attacked Baloch and Sindhi human rights activists who were peacefully protesting against the disappearances of their loved ones. FBM believes that Pakistan has adopted the policy of religious extremism, ANI reported citing its statement said.Kumar also pointed out that in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the neighbouring country has driven the original Kashmiris out. He said Pakistan is attempting to change the demography of the region by driving its real inhabitants out.He also pointed out that since 1947 the percentage of minorities has decreased in Pakistan. He said, “It’s a matter of great concern that the population of religious minorities in Pak which was 23% in 1947 has reduced to an insignificant number. In PoK, Pakistan has affected demographic change by reducing & driving real Kashmiris out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-need-lessons-on-human-rights-from-nation-which-nurtures-terror-india/story-9EHgzai8DfWRPc8psQWKvL.html

Those who subscribed to the Indian Constitution, were specifically targeted”, said Junaid.He added, “Today, led by its Foreign Minister, Pakistan is demanding a return of the autonomy that Jammu & Kashmir had earlier enjoyed under the Indian Constitution. The same Constitution against which, it started this proxy war in which Kashmiris were massacred”.India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism record“Will Pakistan be allowed to get away just like that?”, he questioned.Junaid told the United Nations, “Even after it ruptured our social fabric, ordered the killing of thousands of my fellow Kashmiris, exploited our youth as pawns in its proxy war, and was majorly responsible for getting our autonomy diluted through unleashing its terror-policy?”“I humbly urge this Council to summon the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for an audit.

25-09-2020||World||UN: At least 16 drown in migrant shipwreck off Libya coast||At least 16 migrants trying to reach Europe drowned in the Mediterranean Sea when their small dinghy capsized off the coast of Libya, the UN migration agency reported Friday, the latest shipwreck to underscore the deadly risks facing those who flee the war-afflicted North African country.Libyan fishermen spotted the sinking boat late Thursday, said the International Organisation for Migration, and managed to pull 22 people from the water, including those from Egypt, Bangladesh, Syria, Somalia and Ghana.Three dead bodies were found floating in the water, including one Syrian man and woman, and at least 13 other migrants were missing and presumed drowned, the IOM said.The boat had set off from the town of Zliten, east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, late on Wednesday.The Libyan Coast Guard said that it had ordered the rescue, and warned the death toll could rise further as search teams scoured the area for more victims.“So many boats are leaving these days, but autumn is a very difficult season,” said Commodore Masoud Abdal Samad. “When it gets windy, it’s deadly. It changes in an instant.” In the years since the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, war-torn Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants hoping to get to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route. At least 20,000 people have died in those waters since 2014, according to the IOM.Those who survived Friday’s disaster were taken to the Tripoli port, where they received medical care for their burns, a common consequence of leaked engine fuel mixing with saltwater, said Safa Msehli, an IOM spokeswoman.Libyan authorities took the survivors to the Zliten detention center, run by the Tripoli-based government’s Interior Ministry. Migrants rescued at sea and returned to Libya routinely land in detention centers notorious for torture, extortion and abuse. Amnesty International revealed in a report Thursday that thousands of migrants have been forcibly disappeared from unofficial militia-run detention centers.The shipwreck, the second to be recorded by the UN in as many weeks, “signals the need now more than ever for state-led search and rescue capacity to be redeployed and the need to support NGO vessels operating in a vacuum,” said Msehli.Since 2017, European countries, particularly Italy, have delegated most search-and-rescue responsibility to the Libyan Coast Guard, which intercepts migrant boats before they can reach European waters. Activists have lamented that European authorities are increasingly blocking the work of nongovernmental rescue organisations that patrol the Mediterranean and seek to disembark at European ports.(AP) RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-at-least-16-drown-in-migrant-shipwreck-off-libya-coast/story-cYeDMFpoxozHCDSQ8NqOEO.html
25-09-2020||World||‘You are good people:’ Alexei Navalny thanks Russian pilots, medics||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in Germany recovering from what authorities there determined to be nerve agent poisoning, thanked Russian pilots and paramedics for acting quickly after he fell into a coma on a flight from Siberia.Navalny, who collapsed on a plane to Moscow on August 20 and spent nearly three weeks in a coma, said in an Instagram post on Friday that pilots “quickly landed the plane in Omsk” and medical workers at the airport “jammed a dose of atropine” into him, immediately recognizing “a toxic poisoning.”“Thank you, unknown good-hearted friends. You are good people,” the 44-year-old politician wrote under a photo of him hugging his wife Yulia.After 48 hours in a hospital in Omsk, where Russian doctors said they found no trace of any poisoning, Navalny was transferred to the Charite hospital in Berlin. German chemical weapons experts determined that he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.Navalny, a longtime foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was discharged from the hospital earlier this week. Charite hospital said that based on Navalny’s progress, physicians believe a “complete recovery is possible.”Russian authorities have been resisting the international pressure to launch a criminal investigation, saying no trace of poisonous substances has been found in Navalny’s system and demanding Germany, France and Sweden to share their findings.The Russian delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons sent a note to Germany on Wednesday, requesting “comprehensive information on the so-called Navalny case,” including “test results, biological materials and other clinical samples” to be provided within 10 days.German government spokeswoman Martina Fietz confirmed Friday that the Germany mission to the OPCW received the note. The mission will respond in keeping with rules that provide for a 10-day deadline, Fietz said.“But let me repeat again what we have said here repeatedly in the past: Russia already has everything necessary to be able to conduct investigations itself,” Fietz added. She once again pointed out that German, Swedish and French labs have confirmed that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, and that the OPCW has taken samples.Navalny has remained in Germany to undergo rehabilitation after being released from the hospital, which may take weeks, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said Thursday. Nevertheless, he planned to return to Russia at some point, according to his allies.Navalny’s team blamed the Kremlin for the poisoning, claims which officials brushed off.In Friday’s Instagram post, the politician said that “a series of happy coincidences and sharp actions” by pilots and medical workers sabotaged what Navalny said he thought may have been “the plan of the killers.”“I was supposed to fall sick 20 minutes after takeoff, and in another 15 minutes lose consciousness. There was guaranteed to be no access to medical help and in another hour I would continue travelling in a black plastic bag on the last row of seats, scaring all passengers going to the bathroom,” the politician wrote.“Everything that happened next was very dramatic and deserves a separate story, but there would have been nothing to tell if not for these guys.”___Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-are-good-people-alexei-navalny-thanks-russian-pilots-medics/story-UEWdVd41iocaaxlr49gl7K.html
25-09-2020||World||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is first woman to lie in state at US Capitol||Commemorations are set to begin Friday honoring the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the US Capitol, the first woman in American history to lie in state at the domed building, capping days of commemoration of her extraordinary life.Mourners are paying tribute to Ginsburg, who died last week at age 87, as her casket was on public view at the court’s iconic steps. It made the short procession across the street Friday morning for the private Capitol ceremony with elected officials, family and other invited guests amid coronavirus social distancing restrictions.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, arrived, walked quietly through the Capitol hallway, and running mate vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris is also attending. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is planning to welcome Ginsburg’s casket as the Capitol under turmoil as President Donald Trump’s prepares to announce a conservative nominee to replace the liberal icon weeks before the election.Speaking ahead of the event, Pelosi told CBS that Americans need to know what’s at stake for the “rush” to confirm Ginsburg’s replacement.The politics of the moment, in a tense election year, rippled throughout the celebrations this week of Ginsburg’s life and career. But the ceremony is expected to be a celebration and honoring of her life and work, with musical selections from one of Ginsburg’s favorite opera singers, mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves.Several member of Congress, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a former presidential contender are attending. Members of the House and Senate who are not invited to the ceremony because of space limitations imposed by the coronavirus pandemic will be able to pay their respects before a motorcade carrying Ginsburg’s casket departs the Capitol early afternoon.The honor of lying in state has been accorded fewer than three dozen times, mostly to presidents, vice presidents, and members of Congress. Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon, was the most recent person to lie in state following his death in July. Henry Clay, the Kentucky lawmaker who served as Speaker of the House and also was a senator, was the first in 1852. Rosa Parks — a private citizen, not a government official — is the only woman who has lain in honor at the Capitol.Ginsburg has lain in repose for two days at the Supreme Court, where thousands of people paid their respects, including President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Thursday. Spectators booed and chanted “vote him out” as the president, who wore a mask, stood silently near Ginsburg’s casket at the top of the court’s front steps.Trump plans to announce his nomination Saturday of a woman to take Ginsburg’s place on the high court, where she served for 27 years and was the leader of the liberal justices.Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, will be buried next week in Arlington National Cemetery beside her husband, Martin, who died in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-is-first-woman-to-lie-in-state-at-us-capitol/story-MuHUUQj4zZ9IFS8v3CR4sM.html
25-09-2020||World||First man cured of HIV infection now has terminal cancer||Timothy Ray Brown, the first person known to have been cured of HIV infection, says he is now terminally ill from a recurrence of the cancer that prompted his historic treatment 12 years ago.Brown, dubbed “the Berlin patient” because of where he lived at the time, had a transplant from a donor with a rare, natural resistance to the AIDS virus. For years, that was thought to have cured his leukemia and his HIV infection, and he still shows no signs of HIV.But in an interview with The Associated Press, Brown said his cancer returned last year and has spread widely. He’s receiving hospice care where he now lives in Palm Springs, California.“I’m still glad that I had it,” Brown said of his transplant.“It opened up doors that weren’t there before” and inspired scientists to work harder to find a cure, which many had begun to think was not possible, the 54-year-old said Thursday.“Timothy proved that HIV can be cured, but that’s not what inspires me about him,” said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has worked with Brown to further research toward a cure.“We took pieces of his gut, we took pieces of his lymph nodes. Every time he was asked to do something, he showed up with amazing grace,” Deeks said.Brown was an American working as a translator in Berlin in the 1990s when he learned he had HIV. In 2006, he was diagnosed with leukemia.Dr. Gero Huetter, a blood cancer expert at the University of Berlin, believed that a marrow transplant was Brown’s best chance of beating the leukemia. He wondered, could he also cure Brown’s other life-threatening disease by using a donor with a gene mutation that provides natural resistance to the AIDS virus?Donors like these are very rare and transplants are risky. Doctors have to destroy the patient’s diseased immune system with chemotherapy and radiation, then transplant the donor’s cells and hope they develop into a new immune system for the recipient.Brown’s first transplant in 2007 was only partly successful: His HIV seemed to be gone but his leukemia was not. He had a second transplant from the same donor in March 2008 and that one seemed to work.Since then, Brown has repeatedly tested negative for HIV and has frequently appeared at AIDS conferences where cure research is discussed.“He’s been like an ambassador of hope,” said Brown’s partner, Tim Hoeffgen.A second man, Adam Castillejo -- called “the London patient” until he revealed his identity earlier this year -- also is believed to have been cured by a transplant similar to Brown’s in 2016.But donors like these are scarce and the procedure is too risky to be widely used.Scientists have been testing gene therapy and other ways to try to get the effect of the favorable gene mutation without having to do a transplant. At an AIDS conference in July, researchers said they may have achieved a long-term remission in a Brazil man by using a powerful combination of drugs meant to flush dormant HIV from his body.Mark King, a Baltimore man who writes a blog for people with HIV, said he spoke with Brown earlier this week and is grateful for what Brown has contributed to AIDS research.“It is unfathomable what value he has been to the world as a subject of science. And yet this is also a human being who is a kind, humble guy who certainly never asked for the spotlight,” King said. “I think the world of him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-man-cured-of-hiv-infection-now-has-terminal-cancer/story-Mu5P7NilrdfSB7wiHJNpYN.html

The rare conciliatory message from the North Korean leader came as Moon faced intense political fallout over the incident, which coincided with a renewed push by him for engagement with North Korea.“Chairman Kim Jong Un asked to convey his feeling that he is greatly sorry that an unexpected unsavoury incident occurred in our waters which hugely disappointed President Moon Jae-in and compatriots in the South,” the adviser, Suh Hoon, told reporters. Suh said the letter was a response to requests for an explanation for the incident and included a promise to prevent any recurrence. North Korea expressed hope the incident would not undermine recent efforts to foster trust, Suh said, adding Moon and Kim had exchanged letters this month. Moon praised Kim’s “strong resolve to save lives” and steer anti-virus and flood recovery work in his Sept. 8 letter, his office said. In a Sept. 12 reply, Kim said Moon would win the battle against the coronavirus and “good things” would happen later.The leaders have held three summits and signed pacts to ease tension since 2018, but relations have soured since the collapse last year of a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, at which Moon had offered to mediate. Defection or accident?The shooting of the man, a fisheries official who had gone missing this week, shocked South Koreans and sparked a barrage of criticism from the opposition and the public, prompting an unusually tough response from Moon, who called it “unpardonable”.Critics accused Moon of failing to save a citizen’s life while being soft on North Korea, saying the military did not attempt to save him despite spotting him six hours before he was shot dead.South Korean officials said the man has run up debt and likely sought to defect to the North. But his brother refuted that, saying he had just got a new boat and must have had some sort of accident.“Not everyone who has debts wants to go to the North,” the brother, Lee Rae-jin, said on social media. “What the military was doing when he was floating around our waters for almost a day?” The North’s soldiers fired more than 10 shots at the man after he tried to flee without revealing his identity, Suh said, citing the letter. But the North Korean side denied burning his body, saying the soldiers had burned a floatation device he was using in line with their anti-virus procedures, Suh said.Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the apology showed Kim did not want the incident to escalate but it remained highly contentious in the South.“The letter showed Kim’s willingness to quickly resolve the situation but publicly it’s a very sensitive matter,” Yang said.The shooting came a day after Moon proposed a new initiative including North Korea to the U.N. General Assembly and called for a formal termination of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an armistice, a long-standing North Korean demand.But opposition politicians derided Moon’s olive branch.“Now is not the time to speak of ending the war,” said Thae Young-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who is now an opposition lawmaker. He called for a formal investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-apologizes-to-seoul-after-killing-south-korean-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-RIMQNwH5JbkPa8Jdi46jeL.html

It uses adjuvants, ingredients that could boost immune responses from Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline and US’ Dynavax Technologies.- Researchers have said that two doses of S-Trimmer with the GSK’s adjuvant which induced antibody levels in monkeys were higher than those seen in blood samples of patients who have recovered from the viral infection.- In a promising development, the vaccine candidate did not trigger a disease enhancement effect when it was tested in monkeys. Stirring a reverse effect, experts around the world have feared that the Covid-19 vaccines guaranteeing immunity can worsen the disease instead of preventing the patients’ sickness.- The study states that the vaccinated monkeys appeared to be protected from weight loss, fever and organ damage when challenged with the virus after inoculation.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-in-animal-test-all-you-need-to-know/story-sybSrcxpDL7Qmy7lFuA6VL.html
25-09-2020||World||China aims to make 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses a year||China claimed on Friday that the World Health Organization (WHO) had conveyed its support for using experimental Covid-19 vaccines on high-risk groups during clinical trials in June.The National Health commission (NHC) also said that China’s annual production capacity of vaccines is expected to reach 610 million doses by end of this year and is forecast to reach 1 billion doses per year by 2021.China had informed the WHO about inoculating high-risk groups on June 29, Zheng Zhongwei, director-general of NHC’s Development Centre for Medical Science and Technology said at a press conference.State media reported that China had approved the plan on June 24 and authorised emergency use of the vaccines on July 22.The NHC had argued that under the Chinese vaccine management law, emergency vaccines were allowed to be used on certain people at high risk of contracting the disease, such as medical workers, frontline pandemic control workers and customs workers.“After the approval, on June 29, we made a communication with the relevant representatives of the WHO Office in China, and obtained support and understanding from WHO,” Zheng said.High-risk groups also include workers at border ports, agricultural and sideline products, and frozen food markets besides the elderly, pregnant women, children, and patients with underlying diseases.Speaking at the same press conference, Wu Yuanbin, director of the Department of Science and Technology for Social Development of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said four new coronavirus vaccines had entered phase 3 clinical trials.Wu said that currently 11 new coronavirus vaccines in China had entered clinical trials. Four vaccines entered Phase 3 clinical trials, of which three are inactivated vaccines and one an adenovirus vector vaccine. The phase-3 clinical trials are being conducted in several countries in the Middle East, South America, and Southeast Asia.Meanwhile, two stevedores in east China’s port city of Qingdao were reported as asymptomatic Covid-19 cases on Thursday.The workers aged 40 and 45 had both handled imported frozen seafood on September 19. Nucleic acid tests revealed they were positive for novel coronavirus on Thursday. So far, 132 close contacts have been tracked and put under quarantine, official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-aims-to-make-1-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-a-year/story-Qq0oo18WRJ6NMzXFPfvvWI.html
25-09-2020||World||In despair, protesters take to streets for Breonna Taylor||Some of them raised their fists and called out “Black lives matter!” Others tended to the letters, flowers and signs grouped together in a square in downtown Louisville. All of them said her name: Breonna Taylor.People dismayed that the officers who shot the Black woman in her apartment during a drug raid last March wouldn’t be charged with her death vowed to persist in their fight for justice. The big question for a town torn apart by Taylor’s death and the larger issue of racism in America was how to move forward.Many turned to the streets — as they did in several US cities — to call for reforms to combat racist policing.“We’ve got to take it lying down that the law won’t protect us, that they can get away with killing us,” said Lavel White, a regular protester in downtown Louisville who is Black. He was drawn to a march Thursday night because he was devastated by a grand jury’s decision a day earlier not to charge the officers. “If we can’t get justice for Breonna Taylor, can we get justice for anybody?”He was angry that police in riot gear were out in force when protesters had been peaceful as they streamed through the streets of downtown Louisville past a nighttime curfew. Demonstrators also gathered in places like Los Angeles where a vehicle ran through a crowd of protesters, injuring one person. In Portland, Oregon — a city that has seen many protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis — a fire was set at a police union building.Taylor, a Black woman who was an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them, authorities said. He said he didn’t know who was coming in and opened fire in self-defense, wounding one officer. Police entered on a warrant connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.State Attorney General Daniel Cameron said Wednesday that the investigation showed officers acted in self-defense. One officer who has already been fired was charged with firing into a neighboring apartment.The FBI is still investigating whether Taylor’s civil rights were violated. But the burden of proof for such cases is very high, with prosecutors having to prove officers knew they were acting illegally and made a willful decision to cause someone’s death.While there was despair after the decision in Taylor’s case, others saw reasons to hope.Reginique Jones said she’ll keep pressing for increased police accountability and for a statewide ban on “no knock” warrants — the kind issued in the Taylor case, though the state attorney general said the investigation showed police announced themselves before busting into her apartment.“I believe that we are going to get past this,” Jones said as she returned Thursday to the park in downtown Louisville that has been at the center of the protests. “We can still get some justice.”Taylor’s family planned to speak Friday in the park that’s become known as Injustice Square.The case has exposed the divide in the US over bringing justice for Black Americans killed by authorities and the laws that allow officers to be charged, which regularly favor police.Since Taylor’s killing, Louisville has taken some steps to address protesters’ concerns. In addition to the officer who was fired and later charged, three others were put on desk duty. Officials have banned no-knock warrants and hired a Black woman as the permanent police chief — a first for the city.Louisville also agreed to more police reforms as it settled a lawsuit that included $12 million for Taylor’s family. But many have expressed frustration that more has not been done.And so they took to the streets.Louisville police in riot gear barricaded roads and cars honked as the crowd marched past a nighttime curfew. Officers blocked the exits of a church where protesters gathered to avoid arrest for violating the curfew.Several people were detained, including state Rep. Attica Scott, a Louisville Democrat. Scott unveiled legislation recently that would ban the use of no-knock search warrants in Kentucky. The measure, called Breonna’s Law in honor of Taylor, also would require drug and alcohol testing of officers involving in shootings and deadly incidents and require that body cameras be worn during the execution of all search warrants.Police eventually pulled back late Thursday after negotiating with demonstrators to end the protest.At least 24 people were arrested as of 1 a.m. Friday, police said. Authorities alleged the protesters broke windows at a restaurant, damaged city buses, tried to set a fire and threw a flare into the street.Earlier, it got heated between some protesters and a group of 12 to 15 armed white people wearing military-style uniforms, but it didn’t turn physical.The curfew will last through the weekend, and Gov. Andy Beshear called up the National Guard for “limited missions.”Peaceful protests a night earlier gave way to some destruction and violence. Two officers were shot and were expected to recover.Larynzo D. Johnson, 26, was charged and he’s scheduled to be in court Friday. Court records did not list a lawyer for him.In the Louisville square where protesters often gather, Rose Henderson has been looking after the flowers, signs and letters placed at a memorial for Taylor and hopes officials won’t try to remove them.“We’re going to stay out here and hold this place,” Henderson said.___Associated Press writers Rebecca Reynolds Yonker, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Bruce Schreiner and John Minchillo in Louisville, Kentucky; Kevin Freking and Michael Balsamo in Washington; Aaron Morrison in New York; and Haleluya Hadero in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-despair-protesters-take-to-streets-for-breonna-taylor/story-xCnfzWyD3CLRPPx5ZBEFRI.html
25-09-2020||World||US records over 7 million Covid-19 cases, 20% of the world’s total||The number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States topped 7 million - more than 20% of the world’s total - as Midwest states reported spikes in Covid-19 infections in September, according to a Reuters tally.The latest milestone on Thursday comes just days after the nation surpassed over 200,000 Covid-19 deaths, the world’s highest death toll from the virus. Each day, over 700 people die in the United States from Covid-19.California leads the country with over 800,000 total cases, followed by Texas, Florida and New York. All Midwest states except Ohio reported more cases in the past four weeks as compared with the prior four weeks, led by South Dakota and North Dakota. South Dakota had the biggest percentage increase at 166% with 8,129 new cases, while North Dakota’s new cases doubled to 8,752 as compared to 4,243 during the same time in August.Many cases in those two states have been linked to the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that annually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.According to a Reuters analysis, positive cases rose in half of the 50 US states this month. Ten states have reported a record one-day increase in Covid-19 cases in September, including Montana, South Dakota and Utah on Thursday.New cases rose last week after falling for eight consecutive weeks. Health experts believe this spike was due to reopening schools and universities as well as parties over the recent Labor Day holiday.A study by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Indiana University, the University of Washington and Davidson College said recent reopening of college and university campuses for in-person instruction during late summer this year could be associated with more than 3,000 additional cases of Covid-19 per day in the United States in recent weeks.US confirmed cases are the highest in the world followed by India with 5.7 million cases and Brazil with 4.6 million.The United states is currently averaging 40,000 new infections per day. Top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he would like to see the number to fall below 10,000 per day before flu season starts in October.Health officials and President Donald Trump have presented different views about the nation’s health crisis. Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term on Nov. 3, early this month had claimed that the United States was “rounding the corner” on the crisis. Fauci contradicted the claim the next day, saying the statistics were disturbing.(Reporting by Anurag Maan and Roshan Abraham in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-over-7-million-covid-19-cases-20-of-the-world-s-total/story-Aqw4eLaNd331JcBo0mxZ3I.html
25-09-2020||World||Manhattan DA Vance, Trump lawyers go head-to-head over Prez’s tax returns||With the US presidential election looming, lawyers for Donald Trump will ask a federal appeals court on Friday to block Manhattan’s top prosecutor from obtaining the president’s tax returns in connection with a criminal probe into Trump and his businesses.The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments from lawyers for Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, whose investigation began more than two years ago.The probe has been stalled as Trump fights an Aug. 2019 grand jury subpoena to his accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of his corporate and personal tax returns.Vance began his probe after Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen paid hush money to silence two women before the 2016 election about claimed sexual encounters with Trump.The probe now appears to go beyond the payments, with Vance saying in court filings he might have grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax and insurance fraud, and that possible bank fraud might also be examined.Trump’s lawyers have said the subpoena was “wildly overbroad,” issued in bad faith, and part of a “fishing expedition” designed to harass him.Vance is a Democrat, and Trump is a Republican.Friday’s arguments follow the US Supreme Court’s July 9 rejection of Trump’s claim he was absolutely immune from criminal probes while in the White House.The Supreme Court said Trump could raise other challenges to the subpoena. Trump has said he expects a return to that court if the appeals court rules against him, as it did last November.In an Aug. 20 ruling, US District Judge Victor Marrero said Vance should obtain the returns, saying Trump’s effort to prolong the dispute could cause statutes of limitations to run out and give him the immunity the Supreme Court rejected.“Justice requires an end to this controversy,” Marrero wrote.Trump’s lawyers want the case returned to Marrero so he can review the substance of the president’s arguments, rather than treat them as a repackaging of his immunity claim.Though the appeal was fast-tracked, the public will likely not know what’s in Trump’s tax returns before the Nov. 3 election.Grand jury proceedings are secret, and if Vance gets the returns it could be months before their contents become public.All three judges on the appeals court panel were appointed by Democratic presidents, as was Marrero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manhattan-da-vance-trump-lawyers-go-head-to-head-over-prez-s-tax-returns/story-tKmUXS2rnDa8vzkw2cxi2H.html

25-09-2020||World||Rio scraps famed carnival as virus surges across globe||Brazil has postponed Rio de Janeiro’s famed carnival for next year, the latest spectacle hit by the pandemic as governments across the globe struggle to contain a surge in coronavirus infections.Rio’s carnival, famous for its gyrating Samba dancers, drummers and dancing crowds, draws millions for all night parties in packed streets, making social distancing all but impossible.Brazil now has the world’s second highest death toll after the United States -- nearly 140,000 fatalities -- and is still battling to bring the virus under control.Rio’s samba schools had already warned in July that without certainty of a vaccine this year it would be difficult to organise the February 2021 festival. “It’s not a cancellation, it’s a postponement,” said Jorge Castanheira, president of the group that organises the parades. “We are looking for an alternative solution, something we can do when it’s safe to contribute to the city.”It was the first time the carnival had been postponed since 1912, joining a growing list of major entertainment and sporting events disrupted by the pandemic with the virus showing no signs of slowing its track across the globe.Australia also postponed plans to host a Test cricket match against Afghanistan and a one-day series against New Zealand Friday, saying the pandemic had made arranging the matches too difficult.French Open tennis tournament will now allow only 1,000 spectators each day in line with tougher restrictions introduced this week by the French government.Worldwide deaths are nearing one million and more than 31 million cases have been detected since the coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.With scientists still racing to develop a vaccine, governments are being forced to reimpose crippling lockdown measures that slowed the virus spread earlier this year but sent much of the world economy into a tailspin.The European Union raised the alarm on Thursday, saying the pandemic is worse now than at the March peak in several member countries, as governments in Europe and beyond order new anti-virus measures.Europe’s death rate has not returned to the levels seen earlier this year but new infections are soaring once again, prompting the bloc’s disease control agency to flag seven countries of “high concern”.France reported an all-time high in new daily cases of over 16,000, one day after announcing tougher infection control measures especially for hard-hit Mediterranean port Marseille.Bars in Paris and 10 other cities will be forced to close early but Marseille will see restaurants and bars close completely. Fierce reactions from local officials underscored the struggle governments face balance health risks against the need to revive businesses battered by lockdowns.“I am angry because there was no consultation,” Marseille Mayor Michele Rubirola told Franceinfo radio. “Why turn the screws when our numbers have been improving for a few days now?”Stay at homeMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Friday also ordered the elderly to stay at home and recommended employers allow home working after the Russian capital saw a sharp rise in virus cases.Sobyanin’s message came after figures that were steady for several months climbed steeply in recent days in Russia, the world’s fourth most affected country, and particularly in Moscow.“We all really don’t want to go back to he harsh restrictions of spring,” Sobyanin said. “I hope we can avoid this.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has warned that a new lockdown could be needed in Athens unless the public can help bring down new cases by respecting distancing and mask-wearing measures.Israel, which closed schools and imposed restrictions on workplaces and leisure activities last week in a second nationwide lockdown, toughened its rules still further on Thursday.Most workplaces and markets are to be closed and prayer meetings and demonstrations will be severely restricted, as the country battles the world’s worst per-capita infection rate.British pubs and bars were also closing earlier than usual from Thursday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson required all premises serving drink and food to shut by 10 pm in a bid to curb growing virus cases.“I don’t think it’s gonna help, it’s too little too late, as usual,” Joyce, a drinker in her fifties at the Prince George in the East London neighbourhood of Dalston, told AFP.“You’re just displacing the problem.”As lockdowns edge back, the rollout of a vaccine is seen as crucial for a return to normal life, with several leading vaccine candidates currently in late-stage trials.That is particularly key for international sports, where many events are taking place are generally behind closed doors and without audiences.However, Olympic boss Thomas Bach said the postponed Tokyo Games could take place next year even without a vaccine.“A number of big sport events have been successfully organised recently,” he said, pointing for instance to the success of the Tour de France.Elsewhere in the world of sport, Swedish striker and AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 38, has tested positive for coronavirus, his club announced on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rio-scraps-famed-carnival-as-virus-surges-across-globe/story-XLGNr7atGS3d3dGUs4ckZO.html
25-09-2020||World||How Harley-Davidson lost its rumble in India||Harley-Davidson Inc. is riding out of India. That’s as much of a problem for the American motorcycle icon as for one of the largest two-wheeler markets looking to make its mark globally.Harley said in a regulatory filing Thursday that it was discontinuing sales and manufacturing operations in the world’s second most populous country as part of its company-wide restructuring, or the “Rewire” plan, a five-year strategy to reset its business, focus on high-priority markets and tighten up by streamlining models. That the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company is pulling out of a thriving market for motorbikes speaks to a troubled international strategy in need of overhaul. It comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing his “Make in India” program, with the autos sector (including two-wheelers) as a key part and potentially $23 billion in production incentives on the way. Nonetheless, Toyota Motor Corp. said last week it won’t expand further there.India hasn’t been an easy market for Harley, where it’s had an assembly plant for a decade and sells a few thousand bikes. The company operates a “complete knock-down” assembly plant, where components and parts are imported from the US and assembled into motorcycles for the local market. It also produces the Harley-Davidson Street series for sale outside North America. Finding the price sweet spot and gaining traction in India, even with models made for the market with smaller engines, has been difficult. Discounts sometimes help; at other times, they turn off buyers. Bike manufacturers have struggled with the existential approach — more for less, or vice versa? Indian consumers are aspirational and not that easy to please: A cheaper model of a high-end brand won’t cut it. Taxes on larger powertrains are punitive. Harley’s bikes can cost as much as 1.1 million rupees (about $15,000). That’s steep for a market where the average bike with decent mileage starts at 50,000 rupees, and its nearest competitor prices closer to 150,000 rupees.  Harley was never going for the mass market, of course. It’s long since moved beyond the Wild One to the Weekend One, selling the emblazoned-leather-jacket lifestyle of the American biker on the open road to those who can pay a top price for it. Still, in India, there has been opportunity. Volumes of premium-segment motorcycles have been growing for the last six years. Top-end models have drawn first-time buyers from higher-income levels, and are potentially an upgrade choice for the 70-some million riders of smaller bikes, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Its main rival in the segment is Eicher Motors Ltd.-owned Royal Enfield — priced well below a Harley, with a similar brand appeal. The Harley cult hasn’t grown big enough to convert into substantial sales. The top 10 brands in India have 70% of the market, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. Most of the best-selling models have been around for at least 17 years, on average. The majority of new launches fail when it comes to gaining share. As the analysts put it, the best way to get a toehold has been when new segments emerge. Harley hasn’t rolled into one. It priced itself too high, then tried to make cheaper versions that didn’t appeal to fans. The company is hamstrung to some extent by the parts it imports and then assembles at its Bawal plant. Tariffs have been a point of contention with US presidents from George W. Bush to Donald Trump. But Harley struggled even after they were cut. The company has also suffered in the wider global trade frictions, with net revenues affected by tariffs imposed by China and the European Union, and by the US on items imported from China. Part of the problem for motorcycles has been the transition to the latest emission norms (a good thing). Keeping up, though, has meant an increase in imported content for parts, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Duties and taxes haven’t been lowered to keep pace, while ownership costs and road taxes have increased. All together, state levies make up to approximately 50% of a vehicle’s on-road price, the highest among comparable countries, the analysts say.Modi’s ambitious plans could have been helped by a symbolic gesture to hold on to Harley. India’s inability to keep a premium manufacturer with an outsize brand points to misaligned incentives and dim prospects for becoming a top-end hub. Middle-weight players are doing fine, and large domestic manufacturers like Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co. export 47% and 26% of their production. But that may be the ceiling.In contrast, Thailand has several production-linked incentives, along with significant research and development expenditure benefits and relatively low corporate tax rates. Premium, larger-engine motorcycle makers have flocked there, including Harley, which has a manufacturing facility.Both India and Harley are walking away from what could have been a big opportunity.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Anjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

25-09-2020||World||Terror probe launched after 2 wounded in Paris knife attack||French terrorism authorities are investigating a knife attack that wounded at least two people Friday near the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, authorities said. A suspect has been arrested.The area in eastern Paris remained cordoned off by police two hours after the attack. Children were being sequestered in nine schools while police worked to determine no other suspects were on the run, according to education and police officials.It is unclear what motivated the attack or whether it was linked to Charlie Hebdo, which moved after its offices were targeted in a 2015 Islamic extremist attack that left 12 people dead.Police cordoned off the area, including the former Charlie Hebdo offices, after a suspect package was noticed nearby, but the package was found to be harmless and no explosives were found, according a police official.An investigation was opened into “attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise,” according to an official at the prosecutor’s office. Authorities did not release the identity of the suspect arrested in the area of the Bastille Plaza.“I saw a guy that was in his 30s or 40s with an axe in his hand who was walking behind a victim covered in blood...I cant tell you how many victims there was, I just saw one,” witness Kader Alfa told The Associated Press at the scene.AP reporters saw officers flooding into the neighborhood, near the Richard Lenoir subway station.The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company’s staff members were evacuated.Moreira said a man in the street “attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn’t enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left.” He said the company had not received any threats.A Paris police official said that while authorities initially thought two attackers were involved, they now believe it was only one person, who was detained. The official said police were still searching the area while they questioned the arrested suspect.Police initially announced that four people were wounded in the attack, but the official told The Associated Press that there are in fact only two confirmed wounded. Police could not explain the discrepancies.Police did not release the identities of the attacker or the wounded, who are in “absolutely urgent” condition, the official said. The official was not authorized to be publicly named.French Prime Minister Jean Castex cut short a visit to a suburb north of Paris to head to the Interior Ministry to follow developments.The trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently underway across town.

25-09-2020||World||China demolished around 16,000 mosques in recent years: Report||Chinese authorities have demolished thousands of mosques in Xinjiang, an Australian think tank said Friday, in the latest report of widespread human rights abuses in the restive region.Rights groups say more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking people have been incarcerated in camps across the northwestern territory, with residents pressured to give up traditional and religious activities.Around 16,000 mosques had been destroyed or damaged, according to an Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report based on satellite imagery documenting hundreds of sacred sites and statistical modelling.Most of the destruction had taken place in the last three years and an estimated 8,500 mosques had been completely destroyed, the report said, with more damage outside the urban centres of Urumqi and Kashgar. Many mosques that escaped demolition had their domes and minarets removed, according to the research, which estimated fewer than 15,500 intact and damaged mosques were left standing around Xinjiang.If correct, it would be the lowest number of Muslim houses of worship in the region since the decade of national upheaval sparked by the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.By contrast, none of the Christian churches and Buddhist temples in Xinjiang that were studied by the think tank had been damaged or destroyed.ASPI also said nearly a third of major Islamic sacred sites in Xinjiang -- including shrines, cemeteries and pilgrimage routes -- had been razed.An AFP investigation last year found dozens of cemeteries had been destroyed in the region, leaving human remains and bricks from broken tombs scattered across the land.China has insisted that residents of Xinjiang enjoy full religious freedom.Asked about the research on Friday, China’s foreign ministry said the research institute had “no academic credibility” and was producing “anti-China reports and anti-China lies”.Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said there were about 24,000 mosques in the region.“Xinjiang’s total number of mosques is more than ten times the number in the US, and the average number of mosques per Muslim person is higher than in some Muslim countries,” Wang told a regular press briefing.Friday’s report comes a day after ASPI said it had identified a network of detention centres in the region much larger than previous estimates.Beijing has said its network of camps are vocational training centres, which are necessary for countering poverty and anti-extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demolished-around-16-000-mosques-in-recent-years-report/story-uvtYtO81RzSCZfrL96bIlJ.html

In Moscow, the number of new daily infections started to grow last week and was up to over 1,500 on Friday from under 700 two weeks ago.“None of us want to return to severe restrictions (that were in place) this spring. I hope we can avoid that,” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in his blog.Sobyanin urged people over 65 years old and those suffering from chronic illnesses to stay at home starting from Monday, limit their contacts with others and leave their residence only when necessary. Employers are recommended to allow as many people as possible to work from home, disinfect the workplace regularly, observe social distancing guidelines and use personal protective equipment in offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-asks-elderly-to-stay-home-amid-new-covid-19-surge/story-an4AYsVcxDceCvLNrNEaSN.html
25-09-2020||World||Some Covid-19 cases turn severe due to faulty genes, misguided antibodies||More than 10 per cent of young and healthy people who develop severe Covid-19 have misguided antibodies that attack not the virus, but the immune system itself, and another 3.5 per cent may carry a specific kind of genetic mutation, according to a new study. The research, published in the journal Science, noted that both groups of patients lack type I interferon -- a set of 17 proteins crucial for protecting cells and the body from viruses. These proteins, according to the researchers from the Rockefeller University in the US, are part of the intrinsic and innate immunity, kicking in before the body produces an antibody response, and are known to play an important role in immediately heightening the cells’ defences in response to several viruses. In the case of some patients with severe Covid-19, they said the interferons could either be neutralised by the patients’ own antibodies, or may not be produced in insufficient amounts due to a faulty gene. They said the findings help explain why some people develop a disease much more severe than others in their age group including in individuals who required admission to the hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) despite being in their 20s and free of underlying conditions. The study results, according to the researchers, may also provide the first molecular explanation for why more men than women die from Covid-19. “These findings provide compelling evidence that the disruption of type I interferon is often the cause of life-threatening Covid-19,” says Jean-Laurent Casanova, a co-author of the study from the Rockefeller University. “And at least in theory, such interferon problems could be treated with existing medications and interventions,” Casanova said. The novel coronavirus can cause symptom-free infection in most people, or can kill some others in a few days. According to the researchers, the unusual susceptibility to certain infectious diseases can be traced to single-gene mutations that affect an individual’s immune response.In the current research, they genetically analysed blood samples from more than 650 Covid-19 patients who had been hospitalised for life-threatening pneumonia due to the coronavirus, of whom 14 per cent had died. The scientists also included samples from another group of over 530 people with asymptomatic or benign infection. They initially searched for differences between the two groups across 13 genes known to govern the production of the type I interferons in the body, which are critical for defense against the influenza virus. According to the study, a significant number of people with severe disease carried rare variants in these 13 genes, and more than three per cent of them were missing a functioning gene. From further experiments, they showed that immune cells from these patients did not produce any detectable type I interferons in response to the coronavirus. The scientists demonstrated that human fibroblast cells with mutations affecting the interferon type I pathway were more vulnerable to the virus, and died in higher numbers, and did so at a faster rate than cells without those mutations. They said three other infectious diseases caused by mutations affecting an immune signalling protein can also be caused by auto-antibodies against that protein. Examining 987 patients with life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia, they found that more than 10 per cent had auto-antibodies against interferons at the onset of their infection, with a majority of them (95 per cent) being men. The researchers confirmed these findings using biochemical experiments which showed that these auto-antibodies can effectively curb the activity of interferon type I. In some cases the auto-antibodies could be detected in blood samples taken before patients became infected and in others, they said, these were found in the early stages of the infection, before the immune system had the time to mount a response.However, the auto-antibodies seem to be rare in the general population, the scientists said, adding that only four out of 1,227 randomly selected healthy people were found to have them. “All of these findings strongly indicate that these auto-antibodies are actually the underlying reason some people get very sick, and not the consequence of the infection,” Casanova said. The scientists believe the findings could point to medical interventions that may help control the disease severity. Citing an example, they said two types of interferons available as drugs and approved for use to treat certain conditions, such as chronic viral hepatitis, could be further investigated for their effectiveness against severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-covid-19-cases-turn-severe-due-to-faulty-genes-misguided-antibodies/story-lMN4aTaFt0WSf56tuNnRIM.html

He is in a critical condition in hospital.Officers did not open fire and the BBC said it was believed the man turned the gun on himself. A murder investigation is underway, police added.“This is a truly shocking incident in which one of our colleagues has lost his life in the most tragic circumstances,” London police chief Cressida Dick said. “We are in the early stages of the investigation and are still working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and we will provide further updates when we have them.”Britain’s interior minister, Priti Patel, said she was shocked and saddened by the killing.“This is a sad day for our country and another terrible reminder of how our police officers put themselves in danger each and every day to keep the rest of us safe,” Patel said. British police officers remain routinely unarmed, and a survey in 2017 suggested most did not want to carry weapons regularly.“This is utterly devastating and heartbreaking news,” said John Apter, chairman of the National Police Federation which represents rank and file officers in England and Wales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-detained-in-custody-centre-kills-cop-in-south-london/story-9gfJHjIr0iWmukq9dlU7YM.html
25-09-2020||World||This is why Covid-19 may be life-threatening for some patients||When two brothers fell critically ill with Covid-19 around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases, genetic variations, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of coronavirus patients.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing evidence suggests that a significant minority of Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an impaired interferon response. Twin landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that insufficient interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”The work highlights the potential for interferon-based therapies to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The possibility that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now recruiting Covid-19 patients.“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said Alexander Hoischen, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’ genetic makeup.New NexusInterferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”Whether sufficient interferon is available early or late in Covid-19 cases has a major bearing on disease severity, according to Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. Ideally, production of the antiviral substance would be triggered when immune cells encounter SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, stopping rapid viral reproduction inside the body and averting complications, he said.“But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has anti-interferon genes which can stop or antagonize the production or effect of interferon,” said Yuen, who measured the effects in human lung tissue. If the interferon response is delayed and the amount of virus in the body peaks at a high level, other parts of the immune system will be “awakened.”‘Really disastrous’That may trigger lung-injuring inflammation -- collateral damage from an excessive immune reaction to the virus. “This is really disastrous,” he said.Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to the study in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.‘First explanation’“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”Genetic analysis of Covid-19 patients published in the same journal revealed two dozen gene mutations that had been “silent” until patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers -- many of them also involved in the antibody study -- sequenced the genomes of 659 patients with life-threatening cases of the disease; 3.5% carried genetic variations that inhibit interferon production.Those genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers described in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.Raging feverHis 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this chromosome are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as 14% of critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients. On the other hand, patients who produce antibodies against interferon shouldn’t donate blood products for treating other patients.“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-why-covid-19-may-be-life-threatening-for-some-patients/story-Tfjk8G3iN2UUDNDHgYaEaK.html
25-09-2020||World||Donald Trump infuses politics into his choice for Supreme Court justice||President Donald Trump is infusing deliberations over his coming nomination of a new Supreme Court justice with political meaning as he aims to maximize the benefit before Nov. 3 and even secure an electoral backstop should the result be contested.Even before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death last week, the president had tried to use likelihood of more Supreme Court vacancies to his political advantage. Now, as he closes in on a decision on her likely replacement, Trump has used the vacancy to appeal to battleground-state voters and as a rallying cry for his conservative base.He also is increasingly embracing the high court — which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping -– as an insurance policy in a close election.Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the pandemic have already brought about a flurry of election litigation, and both Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,” Trump said Wednesday of the election, adding, “And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices.”It’s a line echoed by Trump allies, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who said Thursday, “I think that threat to challenge the election is one of the real reasons why it is so important that we confirm the Supreme Court nominees, so that there’s a full Supreme Court on the bench to resolve any election challenge.”Barely six weeks from Election Day, and as millions of Americans are already voting, Trump and his advisers have tried to use the court vacancy to help deliver Trump another term in office.Supreme Court nominations are never entirely devoid of political considerations, but Trump’s decision has been particularly wrapped up in a charged political moment.Within hours of Ginsburg’s death, Trump made clear his intention to nominate a woman in her stead, after previously putting two men on the court and as he struggles to mitigate an erosion in support among suburban women.In discussing his five-person short list, he’s been sure to highlight some from election battlegrounds that he’s aiming to win this fall as much as their jurisprudence.“I’ve heard incredible things about her,” he said of Florida’s Barbara Lagoa, a day after Ginsburg’s death. “I don’t know her. She’s Hispanic and highly respected. Miami. Highly respected.”In an interview with a Detroit television station, he volunteered that hometown Justice Joan Larsen is “very talented.”Trump was even considering a meeting with Lagoa this week in Florida, where he plans campaign events. The appellate court judge was confirmed last year by the Senate in a bipartisan vote and has been promoted for the court by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and others as a nominee with more across-the-board appeal.Trump and his aides, though, appear to have set their sights on nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, who was at the White House twice this week, including for a Monday meeting with Trump.The staunch conservative’s 2017 confirmation on a party-line vote included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. Trump allies see that as a political windfall for them should Democrats attempt to do so once again. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is trying to recapture.On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence defended Barrett when asked whether her affiliation with People of Praise, a charismatic Christian community, would complicate her ability to serve on the high court.“I must tell you the intolerance expressed during her last confirmation about her Catholic faith I really think was a disservice to the process and a disappointment to millions of Americans,” he told ABC News.Trump played up the power to make judicial nominations with conservative voters in 2016, when Republicans senators kept open the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia rather than let President Barack Obama fill the opening. Trump’s decision to release lists of accomplished conservative jurists for potential elevation to the high court was rewarded by increased enthusiasm among white evangelical voters, many of whom had been resistant to supporting the candidacy of the one-time New York Democrat.Even before Ginsburg’s death, Trump had done the same in 2020, releasing an additional 20 names he would consider for the court, and encouraging Democrat Joe Biden to do the same.Biden has resisted that pressure so far, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from trying to sow fear among conservatives about whom the Democrat might nominate.“So they don’t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far-left radicals,” Trump said this week.“If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far-left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition,” Trump said at a rally outside Toledo on Monday. “They will mutilate the law, disfigure the Constitution and impose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-infuses-politics-into-his-choice-for-supreme-court-justice/story-tWepfTSCW1bXKpjbBgtLpL.html
25-09-2020||World||Pence, Ivanka visit salon damaged by Minneapolis unrest||Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump made an unannounced stop Thursday at a hair salon left in rubble by the violence that followed George Floyd’s death, part of a campaign visit aimed at driving home President Donald Trump’s law-and-order message in a key swing state.Pence, Ivanka Trump and Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia stood by on the city’s north side as owner Flora Westbrooks, near tears, pointed at what remained of Flora’s Hair Design.“I never thought this would happen,” Westbrooks said. “Not to me.” “We’re with you,” Pence told her.Pence and President Donald Trump’s eldest daughter later went to a listening session with a “Cops for Trump” group and business owners. Trump has been campaigning on a law-and-order message for weeks and is eager to put Minnesota in play four years after he narrowly lost the state to Hillary Clinton.“I want to be clear: There’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, and justice will be served,” Pence told the crowd at an airport hotel. “But there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that ensued. And those who engaged in acts like these will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed Black man’s neck during an arrest captured on bystander video. His death set off protests around the world, including some that became violent. Property damage in Minneapolis alone is estimated at roughly $100 million.After Floyd’s death, a majority of Minneapolis City Council members pledged to abolish the police department and replace it with a new agency that would take a more socially minded approach. Their hopes of taking the idea to voters in November was blocked by a city commission and won’t happen before 2021, if ever.The talk of abolishing police came as Minneapolis saw spiking violent crime, as many other big cities did, and also as some residents complained that police response times had slowed. Morale in the department has been down, and dozens of officers have retired or are seeking disability leave.“We are expected to be the handyman that fixes everything, and it’s not possible,” Matthew Hagan, a Hennepin County sheriff’s deputy and president of the Minnesota chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, told Pence.Pence said men and women in law enforcement deserve respect every day, and if people want better-trained officers, they need more funding.“We’re not going to defund the police — not now, not ever,” Pence said. “The American people want us to stand by law enforcement and stand by our African American neighbors and all of our neighbors who’ve been impacted by the violence in our cities.” Matt Seyko Thao, a 30-year-old from West St. Paul, said he thinks the Trump campaign is using law-and-order messaging to court those who were unsure about calls to defund the police earlier this summer.“He’s here to give relief to the people who go support the police, people who say ‘what happens if the police are gotten rid of,’” he said. “It’s all a political ploy ... and he’s here for the wrong reasons.” Pence’s visit to the city where Floyd died prompted Minneapolis leaders to ask Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard as a precaution. The governor’s office said 100 guard members were made ready out of what Walz called “an abundance of caution.” The Trump campaign’s visit came a day after several hundred demonstrators rallied at the state Capitol in St. Paul before marching onto an interstate to protest a Kentucky grand jury’s decision not to bring homicide charges against Louisville police officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor, who was Black and unarmed.Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for Joe Biden, said in a statement: “Nothing Vice President Pence says today will distract voters from the truth: four years of the Trump-Pence Administration’s chaos and division has made Minnesotans’ lives worse.” Pence told business owners that he sensed their feeling of helplessness as they watched the unrest unfold in May. He said that shouldn’t happen.“It was hard to stand there and see your business burn. Everything you worked for,” Westbrooks said. “I just want my business back. I just want another start.” Ivanka Trump said the Trump administration will do what America does best “and help you and others like you rebuild, because that’s what we need to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-ivanka-visit-salon-damaged-by-minneapolis-unrest/story-EMaiDX6yQTOBlpBAyDj2AO.html
25-09-2020||World||US Presidential Elections: Joe Biden’s low-key campaign style worries some Democrats||The final stretch of a presidential campaign is typically a nonstop mix of travel, caffeine and adrenaline. But as the worst pandemic in a century bears down on the United States, Joe Biden is taking a lower key approach.Since his Aug 11 selection of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, Biden has had 22 days where he either didn’t make public appearances, held only virtual fundraisers or ventured from his Delaware home solely for church, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules. He made 12 visits outside of Delaware during that period, including a trip to Washington scheduled for Friday to pay respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.During the same time, President Donald Trump had 24 trips that took him to 17 different states, not counting a personal visit to New York to see his ailing brother in the hospital or weekend golf outings.Biden’s aides insist his approach is intentional, showcasing his respect for public health guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus and presenting a responsible contrast with Trump, who has resumed large-scale campaign rallies — sometimes over the objections of local officials. Still, some Democrats say it’s critical that Biden infuse his campaign with more energy.Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said not traveling because of the pandemic was a “pretty lame excuse.”“I thought he had his own plane,” Hinojosa said. “He doesn’t have to sit with one space between another person on a commercial airline like I would.”Hinojosa argued that Biden prioritizing visits to Texas and Arizona could boost Latino turnout and potentially reduce the pressure on him to sweep Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — where he has focused much of his travel so far.“We are campaigning safely and effectively, and our message is reaching voters in battleground states and generating the enthusiasm and energy we need to beat Donald Trump,” said Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo.The race between Biden and Trump has been generally consistent for months. Biden has maintained a comfortable lead in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many of the battleground states that will decide the election.But polls that showed competitive races or even Democratic advantages in traditionally Republican states proved to be false indicators for Democrats in 2016.Four years later, Biden faces persistent questions about whether his campaign is organizing and connecting with voters. When he visited Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday for a Black economic summit, Collette Alston, chairwoman of the local African American Caucus, said she only found out with one day’s notice — when she saw it on TV.Just 16 people attended the event and Alston warned that Biden wasn’t reaching locals she thinks he needs to — “the people that are like, I don’t care, I really don’t want to vote.”“I do believe that he can win North Carolina,” Alton said. “Can he win it based on what he’s doing right now? No. That’s not the way to win it.”Biden’s swing state visits often seem tailor-made for a television package: A small, socially distanced roundtable or town hall, always with fewer than 25 people; occasionally a stop at a local business or a visit with first responders; and then hours of back-to-back local media interviews.Beyond traveling more, Biden is being urged by some Democrats to expand his message. While he has given standalone speeches on issues like criminal justice reform, climate change and, last weekend, the Supreme Court vacancy, Biden largely ignores those issues during his campaign stops. When he appears before voters, he’s generally laser-focused on the virus and the Trump administration’s mismanaging of it.When a grand jury decided Wednesday not to bring charges against police officers directly involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor, he offered condolences to her mother but declined to comment about the specifics of the case on camera. He later issued a more detailed written statement.David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s former strategist and adviser, said the Biden campaign is “wise” to concentrate on the pandemic because it’s an “anchor around the President’s neck.” But he said it would be a “missed opportunity” for Biden if he didn’t speak up more about the Supreme Court going forward, especially the impact it could have on healthcare.“The future of the Affordable Care Act and particularly the future of protections for people with preexisting conditions is a very close issue, and it’s what drove Democrats to victory in 2018,” Axelrod said.Biden’s aides say the relatively light schedule, small events and message discipline reflect the biggest issue still confronting most Americans today: the coronavirus pandemic. Biden also has sought to offer a responsible contrast to Trump and his rallies, where thousands forgo masks.“Every time Trump shows up and has a mask-less rally and says this thing is overblown, Democrats are winning the Covid battle,” said Jim Kessler, an executive vice president of the moderate Democratic group Third Way.Biden maintains a vigorous schedule even when he’s not traveling. His campaign has become a fundraising powerhouse through largely virtual events. He raised a record $364 million in August that has allowed him to blanket the airwaves across the country and outspend Trump.Still, Trump sees the contrast in travel as an opportunity to argue that his packed schedule shows he’s outworking Biden. The president seized on the Biden campaign’s announcement shortly before 9:30 a.m. Thursday that he wouldn’t have any public events for the day.Biden spent the day preparing for his first debate against Trump next week.“Did you see he did a lid this morning again?” Trump said of Biden during a rally Thursday night at an airport hangar in Jacksonville, Florida. “A lid is when you put out word you’re not going to be campaigning today. So he does a lid all the time. ... I’m in Texas. I’m in Ohio. I’m in North Carolina, South Carolina. I’m in Michigan. I’m all over the place.”Biden’s aides counter that they see evidence in public and private polling that the virus remains top of mind for most voters, and that they have a compelling case to make that much of the crisis is Trump’s fault. They also say their focus on small, high-impact events gets results.Still, the cautious approach isn’t shared by Biden’s wife, Jill, who has already ventured as far away as Maine and spent Thursday making four stops in Virginia. She’s going to Iowa, another state her husband has yet to visit in recent months, on Saturday.Hillary Scholten, a Democrat seeking an open House seat in Michigan, spent a morning last week touring a food bank in Grand Rapids, the state’s second-largest city, with Jill Biden. She’s aware that Joe Biden may not follow suit.“People would want to see him here,” Scholten said. “That being said, there is a global pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-joe-biden-s-low-key-campaign-style-worries-some-democrats/story-JOrTIcDPpYWMTT2UZGcWPK.html
25-09-2020||World||Fake license scandal: ICAO advises Pakistan to suspend issuance of new pilot licenses||The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has advised Pakistan to undertake “immediate corrective actions” and suspend the issuance of any new pilot licenses in the wake of a scandal over falsified licenses, according to an official and a document seen by Reuters. The recommendations from ICAO, a specialized agency of the United Nations that works to ensure safety in international air transport, come days after Pakistan opened a criminal probe into 50 pilots and five civil aviation officials who allegedly helped them falsify credentials to secure pilot licences. “Pakistan should improve and strengthen its licensing system to ensure that it takes into account all necessary processes and procedures and prevents inconsistencies and malpractices before new licenses are issued and privileges of suspended licenses are re-established,” said ICAO, in a previously unreported letter to the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) last week.A Pakistani aviation ministry official told Reuters that the country has not issued any new licenses since July, in the wake of the scandal.The Montreal-based agency’s recommendations come ahead of an ICAO audit to assess the country’s aviation safety management systems.The ICAO audit, originally scheduled for November this year, has been moved to June, effectively giving the PCAA more time to work on reforms, the official said.A PCAA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.An ICAO representative declined to comment on specific details, but said in an email that ICAO is “helping Pakistan to recognise concerns, and if they do not take swift action on them we will actively notify other countries about them.” The pilot scandal has tainted Pakistan’s aviation industry and hurt flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which has been barred from flying into Europe and the United States.In addition to revoking the licenses of 50 pilots, Pakistan has also suspended another 32 pilots for a year.

It was disastrous.”Decades of war and poor investment have left hospitals across Iraq in bad shape, but the infrastructure in Mosul -- recaptured from the Islamic State jihadist group in 2017 -- is especially lacking.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEven now, there is only one operational general hospital in a city once seen as a destination for the best medical care in the country.The Fakhri Dabbagh Centre in Mosul’s east is treating 170 children with symptoms of ASD and other special needs, offering help free of charge.Parents wait outside in the public facility’s packed hallways as kids take rehabilitation courses in two small rooms.Private clinics priceyWhile nurses are happy to see their patients again, long-standing challenges remain.Nisrin Hamdi, a 63-year-old social worker, told AFP the centre lacked equipment to provide speech and motor skills sessions, while staff need advanced training.“Our capabilities are limited and we cannot absorb more patients. There’s not even a transportation system to bring in patients” who have trouble accessing the centre, she said.Private clinics offer help too, but their fees are hefty for many Mosul families with no income.One such private facility, the Special Giving Institute, charges 120,000 dinars ($100) for a month of rehabilitation programmes.Its head, 35-year-old Dr Ahmad Sufi, said he had noticed a rise in cases of ASD across Nineveh province since IS overran its capital Mosul in 2014.He said staying at home -- whether to hide from IS rule or during a coronavirus lockdown -- can exacerbate the disorder.“We had about 4,000 cases (requiring treatment) in Nineveh before IS. It reached around 6,000 under IS and now we are at 10,000 cases,” Sufi told AFP.In a small room, about a dozen children practise a short eight-note tune on keyboards to improve their motor skills.“If these children are not treated, their personal and psychological development will deteriorate,” the clinic’s head, Dr Mohammad al-Qaisi, told AFP.Some studies show increased screen time for young toddlers is linked to a higher likelihood of ASD symptoms.Umm Laith, whose four children are all being treated at the Fakhri Dabbagh Centre, told AFP that staying at home seemed to have set them back.“Because I was afraid for my children, I kept them watching television or playing with their mobile phones. This isolation led to them getting worse,” she said.Struggling with stigma Doctors complain of broader issues too, including stigma.“One of the biggest challenges we have is that even after diagnosing a child with autism, their parents won’t accept it,” said Rahmat al-Zuhair, a health worker in Mosul.“That affects how quickly we can begin treating them.” Several international organisations in the city are trying to plug the gap in aid and raise awareness. They include Save the Children, which has offered psychosocial support to 15,000 kids there since last year.“The needs went up a lot with Covid-19 -- when the lockdown happened, many families in Mosul called us asking when centres would reopen,” said spokeswoman Amal Taif.She said the lack of doctors for children with special needs meant that symptoms of developmental disabilities could go unnoticed or be misdiagnosed.“There are mental health workers, but they don’t necessarily have expertise in children, or (there are) paediatricians, but without a mental health focus.”And in Mosul, Taif pointed out, even basic provisions that can help children with special needs improve are often a long way away.Access to education is limited, parents often struggle to provide nutritious food for their children, and families often still live in homes still severely damaged by war, without electricity and running water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-iraqi-youth-with-development-disorders-suffer-after-mosul-lockdown/story-hsOcCMGxdGaJfxCYAgveDM.html
25-09-2020||World||Pakistan cracks down on 49 scribes, journalists’ body vows protests||A leading Pakistani journalist has revealed that the country’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has registered cases against 49 mediapersons and social media activists under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA).“Biggest crackdown against journalists & social media activists to date in Pakistan. FIA register cases against 49 journalists & social media activists under PECA. Names include @UmarCheema1 @AzazSyed @murtazasolang @ammarmasood3 @AsadAToor @bilalfqi etc,” Mubashir Zaidi tweeted on Thursday night.Zaidi, who hosts the popular talk show, Zara Hat Kay, didn’t give more details. Journalist bodies have condemned the move and have demanded that the cases be withdrawn. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists in a tweet vowed to hold countrywide protests if the government didn’t withdraw the cases.In a statement, the FIA said the agency has received complaints against 49 social media activists from a few complainants with evidence. “Cases have been registered against these activists and the FIA is issuing notices to these activists shortly,” the agency said. The FIA said strict action was likely to be taken against the individuals based on evidence that would be found to be detrimental to state institutions, especially the country’s security forces.In a tweet after the FIA’s announcement, Murtaza Solangi, one of the journalists charged, said he would continue to fight for constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. “We shall not bow before fascist thuggery,” he tweeted, adding, “We shall not surrender our fundamental rights.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the FIA’s move, tweeting, “The HRCP is alarmed by the news in circulation that the FIA is registering cases against 49 journalists and social media activists under PECA regulations. We demand that the state refrain from such action and stop using the FIA to curb political dissent.”A fortnight ago, global monitor Human Rights Watch (HRW) had stated in a report critical of the government that a week prior to that, Prime Minister Imran Khan had “asserted there is no media crackdown in Pakistan, and that he and his government are far more unprotected than the media”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-cracks-down-on-49-scribes-journalists-body-vows-protests/story-WLHXziuxLvwquGnFRmitFK.html
25-09-2020||World||China finds first asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in 35 days at Qingdao Port||China detected its first local asymptomatic infections in more than a month as two port workers responsible for unloading frozen seafood tested positive, adding to alarm that contaminated imports could be transmitting the coronavirus.The two cases, found in Shandong province’s Qingdao city during routine testing of port workers, were the first symptom-free infections that China has reported since Aug 20. China hasn’t reported any local symptomatic infections since Aug 15 either.Unlike other nations, China separates asymptomatic and symptomatic cases in its daily tally, and the former are moved into the latter category if and when they start showing signs of illness.The new cases will intensify concern in China over whether imported products are infectious. Traces of the virus have been repeatedly found on frozen, imported seafood and meat and their packaging, as well as in the containers in which they were shipped.China has banned imports from plants in Ecuador, Brazil and Indonesia in recent weeks after finding the virus on their products, disrupting trading channels.Mystery Grows Over Virus Spread Via Food PackagingWhile the US Food and Drug Administration has said that there’s no evidence Covid-19 is transmitted on food or food packaging, Chinese researchers have found coronavirus on chilled salmon may be infectious for more than a week.The growing number of cases linked to cold storage and port workers is in ongoing mystery. There were resurgences in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Dalian earlier this year connected to people working with imported food products, but experts have been unable to say conclusively where the infections came from.In New Zealand, a run of 102 days without a local virus case came to an end when a worker at a cold-storage plant in Auckland fell sick last month. But officials said that preliminary findings from environmental testing at the plant debunked the theory that the route of transmission was through chilled surfaces on materials arriving from overseas.In Qingdao, the local health commission said that 132 close contacts of the two patients have been quarantined, and 129 among them have tested negative so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finds-first-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-in-35-days-at-qingdao-port/story-cmbELdA8ba7ryRSaNFDIXJ.html
25-09-2020||World||DNA link behind severe Covid-19 may lead to a new treatment||When two brothers fell critically ill with Covid-19 around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases, genetic variations, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of coronavirus patients.The common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing evidence suggests that some Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an impaired interferon response. Landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that insufficient interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”The work highlights the potential for interferon-based therapies to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The possibility that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now recruiting Covid-19 patients.“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said Alexander Hoischen, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’ genetic makeup.Interferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to the study in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”Genetic analysis of Covid-19 patients published in the same journal revealed two dozen gene mutations that had been “silent” until patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers -- many of them also involved in the antibody study -- sequenced the genomes of 659 patients with life-threatening cases of the disease; 3.5% carried genetic variations that inhibit interferon production.Read More: Understanding the Virus and Its Unanswered Questions: QuickTakeThose genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers described in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.His 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this chromosome are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as one in eight critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients.“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dna-link-behind-severe-covid-19-may-lead-to-a-new-treatment/story-II9wcoyYLAlU1Tn2hbRGhP.html
25-09-2020||World||Australian think tank finds 380 detention camps in China’s Xinjiang||China appeared to be expanding its network of secret detention centres in Xinjiang, where Muslim minorities are targeted in a forced assimilation campaign, and more of the facilities resemble prisons, an Australian think tank has found.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute used satellite images and official construction tender documents to map more than 380 suspected detention facilities in the remote Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, highlighting re-education camps, detention centres and prisons that have been newly build or expanded since 2017.The report builds on evidence that China has made a policy shift from detaining Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in makeshift public buildings to constructing permanent mass detention facilities.This is despite Chinese state news agency Xinhua reporting late last year that “trainees” attending “vocational education and training centres” meant to deradicalise them had “all graduated”. Regional government chairman Shohrat Zakir was quoted as saying that foreign media reports of one million or two million people attending these centres were fabricated.Predominantly Muslim minorities in the remote Xinjiang region have been locked in camps as part of a government assimilation campaign launched in response to decades of sometimes violent struggle against the Chinese rule. Some have been subjected to forced sterilisation and abortion and in recent months, ordered to drink traditional Chinese medicines to combat the coronavirus.Australian Strategic Policy Institute researcher Nathan Ruser wrote in a report released late on Thursday: “Available evidence suggests that many extrajudicial detainees in Xinjiang’s vast ‘re-education’ network are now being formally charged and locked up in higher security facilities, including newly-built or expanded prisons, or sent to walled factory compounds for coerced labour assignments.” At least 61 detention sites had undergone new construction and expansion work in a year to July 2020, the report said. These included at least 14 facilities still under construction this year.“Of these, about 50 per cent are higher security facilities, which may suggest a shift in usage from the lower-security, ‘re-education centres’ toward higher-security prison-style facilities,” Ruser wrote.At least 70 facilities appeared to have lesser security by the removal of internal fencing or perimeter walls, the report said.These included eight camps that showed signs of decommissioning and were possibly closed. Of the camps stripped of security infrastructure, 90 per cent were lower security facilities, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-think-tank-finds-380-detention-camps-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-1YbIxyP8DuxPB7N5eV4oPL.html

People familiar with the developments told HT that ULFA-I and NSCN-K were keeping a close watch on both Indian security forces and the Myanmar Army to save its cadres from action. ULFA-I was relocating its cadres with the help of NSCN-K to safer hideouts. Also Read: BSF and BGB to work together to reduce number of border killingsNSCN-IM, too, was also planning relocation of its bases because of the presence and movement of the Myanmar Army in areas controlled by them across the border. A counter-insurgency official, requesting anonymity, argued that the cadres of north-east-based outfits have always moved to different locations whenever there has been action by the Myanmar Army. “Over the last few years, there has been more coordinated action against these outfits by both Indian and Myanmar armies and rebels have faced huge setbacks but they always manage to move to a different location,” he said. The intelligence inputs also suggest that north-east-based insurgent groups are trying to take advantage of unemployment caused by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic to recruit more jobless youths in their separatist outfits. The reports have come at a time when the government’s peace talks with NSCN-IM have failed because of differences between the insurgent group and the Centre’s interlocutor R N Ravi. Earlier in September, the NSCN-IM had reiterated its demand for a separate flag and a constitution for the Nagas. To be sure, the intelligence inputs largely talk about the movement of insurgent groups near the border during July and August. Another counter-insurgency official, however, said that there is a heightened threat of attack on security forces. “We are alert to the situation,” said a security official, who didn’t wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northeast-based-insurgent-groups-forced-to-relocate-by-myanmar-army-action-intel-agencies/story-kMYXwfFmKqwIpET1s2fSXI.html

Eight years later, she was appointed assistant DA in San Francisco, California. In 2000, she quit and took a job in city hall and just three years later she beat her former boss to become the first person of colour to become DA, San Francisco.Also read: Barack Obama to join Kamala Harris for two Democratic fundraisersAccording to her tax returns, her adjusted gross income ranged from $ 144,754 to $ 262,877, the television news channel reported, attributing the rise in income to the release of her first book -- Smart on crime -- during these years.As California attorney general, her salary ranged from $ 151,000 to $ 159,000, according to the council on state governments. In 2014, after marrying attorney Douglas Emhoff, her income grew tenfold to $ 1.2 million. In 2018, her income grew to almost $ 1.9 million. In 2019, the couple had between $ 2.8-6.3 million worth of assets, the report said.In 2015, Harris announced her senate bid after Barbara Boxer announced her retirement plans and won the seat in 2016. Also read: Indians in US raise $3.3mn for Biden in one night, seek moderate positions on Kashmir, CAAIn 2018, she signed royalty agreements for two of her books that she released ahead of her presidential candidacy. She made $ 320, 125 that year and $ 277,763 in 2019 through her books Superheroes are everywhere and The truths we hold: An American journey.In January 2019 she announced her presidential candidacy but dropped out of the race in December, 2019. She wrote in an email to her supporters that it was getting difficult for her to raise money for her campaign, “ I am not a billionaire, I cannot fund my own campaign.”In April 2020, Harris entered a join fund raising effort with the DNC that allowed her to raise six-figure donations for the party, fuelling speculation that she was running for the vice president.

25-09-2020||World||Barack Obama to join Kamala Harris for two Democratic fundraisers||Former President Barack Obama will join Kamala Harris for a pair of fundraisers next week in support of the Democratic ticket, the pair’s first events together since Harris became Joe Biden’s running mate.The two will team up for a grassroots fundraiser focused on low-dollar donations and a high-dollar event on Oct. 2, according to a campaign aide with knowledge of the events who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Both will be virtual. The campaign released a video of the two chatting over video about campaigning and Biden earlier this month.Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, was Obama’s vice president from 2009-2017. Obama joined Biden for a similar virtual small-dollar fundraiser over the summer. In the contest against Republican President Donald Trump, Biden’s campaign hopes to win back some voters who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 then voted for Trump in 2016 and to motivate Obama voters who stayed home in 2016.Obama and Harris are longtime political allies. Harris campaigned for Obama in Iowa during the 2008 presidential primary, when she was San Francisco’s district attorney.In 2010, when Harris was running for state attorney general, Obama endorsed her and attended a fundraising event, giving her a boost in the tightly contested election that she eventually won. Harris was the first woman and Black person elected to that job, just two years after Obama became the nation’s first Black president.The low-dollar fundraiser will be similar to an event Harris recently held with Hillary Clinton and comedians Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, which attracted more than 100,000 people and raised $6 million. People will be able to join even if they contribute just $1, the campaign aide said. The second event will be aimed at donors who can spend far greater sums of money, though the aide didn’t know the minimum amount.Biden and Harris raised a record $364 million in August. Harris has headlined more than a dozen fundraisers for the campaign since joining the ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-to-join-kamala-harris-for-two-democratic-fundraisers/story-xAYQ7KxUQoprKM4uIzstNI.html
25-09-2020||World||Massachusetts man dies from eating bags of black licorice||A Massachusetts construction worker’s love of black licorice wound up costing him his life. Eating a bag and a half every day for a few weeks threw his nutrients out of whack and caused the 54-year-old man’s heart to stop, doctors reported Wednesday.“Even a small amount of licorice you eat can increase your blood pressure a little bit,” said Dr. Neel Butala, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who described the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.The problem is glycyrrhizic acid, found in black licorice and in many other foods and dietary supplements containing licorice root extract. It can cause dangerously low potassium and imbalances in other minerals called electrolytes.Eating as little as 2 ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks could cause a heart rhythm problem, especially for folks over 40, the US Food and Drug Administration warns.“It’s more than licorice sticks. It could be jelly beans, licorice teas, a lot of things over the counter. Even some beers, like Belgian beers, have this compound in it,” as do some chewing tobaccos, said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist and former American Heart Association president. He had no role in the Massachusetts man’s care.The death was clearly an extreme case. The man had switched from red, fruit-flavored twists to the black licorice version of the candy a few weeks before his death last year. He collapsed while having lunch at a fast-food restaurant. Doctors found he had dangerously low potassium, which led to heart rhythm and other problems. Emergency responders did CPR and he revived but died the next day.The FDA permits up to 3.1% of a food’s content to have glycyrrhizic acid, but many candies and other licorice products don’t reveal how much of it is contained per ounce, Butala said. Doctors have reported the case to the FDA in hope of raising attention to the risk.Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, which makes the popular Twizzlers licorice twists, said in an email that “all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations,” and that all foods, including candy, “should be enjoyed in moderation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massachusetts-man-dies-from-eating-bags-of-black-licorice/story-T3ZHD86UYBnHQ1Xgk6GfwJ.html

And hopefully, they will be able to work that out,” Trump told reporters at the White House.“If we can help, we would love to help,” he said.Also read: India underlines stability on ground ahead of fresh round of talks with ChinaThe president’s remarks in this regard come days after senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held talks aimed at resolving the months-long standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The two countries agreed to stop sending more troops to their disputed border in the Himalayas.Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that the border conflict is pushing India to look for an asymmetric response: flexing its naval might.“India is intensifying joint naval maneuvers with the US and its allies while building new ships and setting up a network of coastal surveillance outposts that would allow New Delhi to keep an eye on the Indian Ocean’s maritime traffic,” the newspaper said.A “Grand Tamasha” podcast with senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, eminent American expert on India and South Asia Ashley Tellis said the Trump administration has taken a very transparent position of support for India in this crisis.“And, of course, it is motivated in part by the opportunities to confront China on a grander scale, which sort of makes it part and parcel of the US’s own bilateral problems with China. But I think there is something more going on here. And the more is that I do not think the United States had the alternative of doing otherwise.Also read: Donald Trump promotes health care ‘vision’ but gaps remain“That is, Chinese aggression in this instance has been so blatant that the United States could not stand by and either ignore it or not come to India’s defence,” said Tellis, the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs.“What are the issues here? We all agree that those borderlands along the Himalayan territories are undefined. We all agree that they should be negotiated, delimited, demarcated through a peaceful process. We all agree that the agreements that China and India have repeatedly reached among themselves since the 1990s actually offer a good enough framework for how to resolve this dispute over the long term,” he added.What China has done is that it has thrown all those understandings overboard, Tellis said.“And it is very important to recognise this that whatever the provocations may have been, the provocations created by Article 370 or whatever, I do not think they justified a reaction of this kind. Because a diplomatic provocation should have, you know, elicited a diplomatic response, rather than a quick jump to military action, which has enormous risks.“By China taking the step to move quickly to military action, which has now resulted in loss of lives, I think it has put itself on the opposite side of the United States, which is arguing more loudly than ever for a rules-based community,” he added.“And so, even beyond the Trump administration’s own bilateral problems with China, I think they were left in absolutely no position but to support India on this count and I think even a Democratic administration would have done the same in these circumstances,” Tellis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-hopes-for-india-china-border-differences-to-end-reiterates-his-offer-to-help/story-BMIda4KHGe5qCvEORsM9bO.html
25-09-2020||World||Donald Trump promotes health care ‘vision’ but gaps remain||More than three-and-a-half years into his presidency and 40 days from an election, President Donald Trump on Thursday launched what aides termed a “vision” for health care heavy on unfulfilled aspirations.“This is affirmed, signed, and done, so we can put that to rest,” Trump said. He signed an executive order on a range of issues, including protecting people with preexisting medical conditions from insurance discrimination.But that right is already guaranteed in the Obama-era health law his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissively said Trump’s “bogus executive order on pre-existing conditions isn’t worth the paper it’s signed on.” Democrats are betting heavily that they have the edge on health care this election season.Also read: Trump non-commital on peaceful transfer of power after electionTrump spoke at an airport hangar in swing-state North Carolina to a crowd that included white-coated, mask-wearing health care workers. He stood on a podium in front of a blue background emblazoned with “America First Healthcare Plan.” His latest health care pitch won accolades from administration officials and political supporters but failed to impress others.“Executive orders issued close to elections are not the same thing as actual policies,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser with the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works on a range of health care issues, from coverage to quality.Trump’s speech served up a clear political attack, as he accused Democrats of wanting to unleash a “socialist nightmare” on the US health care system, complete with rationing. But Democratic nominee Joe Biden has rejected calls from his party’s left for a government-run plan for all. Instead, the former vice president wants to expand the Affordable Care Act, and add a new public program as an option.Trump returned to health care amid disapproval of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and growing uncertainty about the future of the Obama-era law.In a rambling speech, he promised quality health care at affordable prices, lower prescription drug costs, more consumer choice and greater transparency. His executive order would also to try to end surprise medical bills.“’If we win we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions,” Trump declared.But while his administration has made some progress on its health care goals, the sweeping changes Trump promised as a candidate in 2016 have eluded him.The clock has all but run out in Congress for major legislation on lowering drug costs or ending surprise bills, much less replacing the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare.”Pre-election bill signing ceremonies on prescription drugs and surprise medical charges were once seen as achievable — if challenging — goals for the president. No longer.Trump’s speech Thursday conflated some of his administration’s achievements with policies that are in stages of implementation and ones that remain aspirational.Also read: Trump says he’s ‘not a fan’ of Meghan’s, wishes Harry luck as ‘he is going to need it’Democrats are warning Trump would turn back the clock if given another four years in the White House, and they’re promising coverage for all and lower drug prices.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Trump’s executive order would declare it the policy of the US government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if the ACA is declared unconstitutional. However, such protections are already the law, and Trump would have to go to Congress to cement a new policy.On surprise billing, Azar said the president’s order will direct him to work with Congress on legislation, and if there’s no progress, move ahead with regulatory action. However, despite widespread support among lawmakers for ending surprise bills, the White House has been unable to forge a compromise that steers around determined lobbying by interest groups affected.Health care consultant and commentator Robert Laszewski said he’s particularly puzzled by Trump’s order on preexisting conditions.“So, after 20 years of national public policy debate and hard-fought congressional and presidential approval, how does Trump conclude he can restore these protections, should the Republican Supreme Court suit overturn them, with a simple executive order?” asked Laszewski.The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the president’s order is not the equivalent of Obama’s law. “Should the administration succeed in its case to throw out the law, the executive order will offer no guaranteed patient protections in its place,” said Lisa Lacasse, the group’s president.For Trump, health care represents a major piece of unfinished business.Prescription drug inflation has stabilized when generics are factored in, but the dramatic price rollbacks he once teased have not materialized. In his speech the president highlighted another executive order directing Medicare to pay no more than what other nations pay for medications, but it remains yet to be seen how that policy will work in practice, if it can overcome fierce opposition from the drug industry.Trump said Medicare recipients will soon receive a card that they can use to save $200 on medications. “I will always take care of our wonderful senior citizens,” he promised.More broadly, the number of uninsured Americans started edging up under Trump even before job losses in the economic shutdown to try to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Various studies have tried to estimate the additional coverage losses this year, but the most authoritative government statistics have a long time lag. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says his best guess is “several million.”Meanwhile, Trump is pressing the Supreme Court to invalidate the entire Obama health law, which provides coverage to more than 20 million people and protects Americans with medical problems from insurance discrimination. That case will be argued a week after Election Day.The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has added another layer of uncertainty. Without Ginsburg, there’s no longer a majority of five justices who previously had voted to uphold the ACA.Democrats, unable to slow the Republican march to Senate confirmation of a replacement for Ginsburg, are ramping up their election-year health care messaging. It’s a strategy that helped them win the House in 2018.A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found Biden had an edge over Trump among registered voters as the candidate with the better approach on making sure everyone has access to health care and insurance, 52% to 40%. The gap narrowed for lowering costs of health care: 48% named Biden, while 42% picked Trump.Trump was unveiled his agenda ahead of a two-day swing to several battleground states, including the all-important Florida. There, he held a rally in Jacksonville and was scheduled to court Latino voters at a roundtable in Doral on Friday. Then he’ll fly to Atlanta, Georgia, to deliver a speech on black economic empowerment. He’ll end the day with another rally in Newport News, Virginia.The scramble to show concrete accomplishments on health care comes as Trump is chafing under criticism that he never delivered a Republican alternative to Obamacare.“We’ve really become the healthcare party — the Republican Party — and nobody knows that,” he said Thursday. “The news doesn’t talk about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-promotes-health-care-vision-but-gaps-remain/story-d6Sms0144dWtuA7X6ZoyVL.html
25-09-2020||World||Anger on US streets as cops let off over Black woman’s death||Anger, frustration and sadness over the decision not to charge Kentucky police officers for Breonna Taylor’s death poured into America’s streets as protesters lashed out at a criminal justice system they say is stacked against Black people. Violence seized the demonstrations in her hometown of Louisville as gunfire rang out and wounded two cops. Police said they would enforce a strict curfew for the next two nights in Louisville.Activists, celebrities and everyday Americans have been calling for charges since Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white policemen after one of them was shot while bursting into her home during a narcotics investigation on March 13. The cops had a no-knock warrant but the investigation showed they announced themselves before entering, said state attorney general Daniel Cameron, a Republican and the state’s first Black top prosecutor.A grand jury returned three charges of wanton endangerment on Wednesday against fired officer Brett Hankison over shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.Demonstrators chanted Taylor’s name and marched in cities including New York, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Portland. People gathered in Chicago’s Millennium Park, chanting demands for justice as drivers on Michigan Avenue honked their horns. Police in Atlanta unleashed chemical agents and made arrests after protesters tried to climb on a SWAT vehicle. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, marchers peacefully blocked highway traffic.In Louisville, one of the wounded cops was treated and released with a leg wound, while the other was shot in the abdomen and doing well after surgery. Larynzo Johnson, 26, was charged with two counts of assault on a policeman and multiple charges of wanton endangerment of police officers.White House hopeful Joe Biden called for police reforms in response to the grand jury’s decision. He said that while a probe continues, “we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna”.US President Donald Trump tweeted that he is “praying for the two police officers that were shot” in Louisville.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anger-on-us-streets-as-cops-let-off-over-black-woman-s-death/story-qHQ2AIBCaDfIq5uXVudagK.html
25-09-2020||World||More contagious virus strain dominating in US, says study||A study to analyse the structure of the coronavirus from two waves of infections in a major city found that a more contagious strain dominates recent samples, researchers from Houston Methodist Hospital said on Wednesday.They studied over 5,000 genomes from viruses found in the earliest phase of the pandemic in Houston and from an ongoing, more recent wave of infections. The study, which has not yet been reviewed by outside experts, found that nearly all strains in the second wave had a mutation, known as D614G, which has been shown to increase the number of “spikes” on the crown-shaped virus.The researchers said patients infected with the variant strain had higher amounts of the virus on initial diagnosis. But there was little evidence mutations in the virus have made it deadlier.Meanwhile in the UK, chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday announced another multi-billion-pound package that includes the exchequer picking up parts of the wage bill of all employees until April 2021. The package includes extension of VAT relief, loans to struggling companies and extension of grants to the self-employed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-contagious-virus-strain-dominating-in-us-says-study/story-ej5Q175Xot0m8PrXbO0YhN.html

25-09-2020||World||Cracks in oppn alliance, with help from army||Within days of former premier Nawaz Sharif’s hard-hitting speech challenging the army’s interference in Pakistan’s politics, a grand opposition alliance created to unseat the Imran Khan government appears to be crumbling. Not surprisingly, this comes with a little nudge from the military. While the government was unable to counter most allegations levelled by Sharif, it was the army that sprang into action with leaks and statements that created rifts in not only the opposition alliance but in Sharif’s own PML-N party, pitting his brother Shahbaz Sharif on a collision course with his daughter and political heir Maryam Nawaz. The first statement after the speech came the next day from army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa, who told a select group of parliamentarians the military didn’t have a role in politics. He said the military didn’t play any part in recently passed Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-related legislation, working of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and political proposals for Gilgit Baltistan (GB). Insisting that the political leadership was responsible for these matters, Bajwa conceded broad-based consultation was necessary on GB because of its strategic importance. While this debate was gathering momentum, it was leaked that key opposition leaders had met Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed days ahead of the all-party conference. Railways minister Sheikh Rasheed, seen to be close to the military, disclosed this and taunted the opposition for criticising the army and meeting with it at the same time. This leak embarrassed most of those who attended. Shahbaz Sharif confirmed the meeting while Bilawal clarified they attended a briefing on national security, a matter that is usually kept secret. In a hurriedly called press meet, Bilawal justified the meeting because PM Imran Khan had failed to engage with the opposition on national security issues during his tenure, such as worsening ties with India following the Pulwama attack. He said GB was discussed at the meeting. Soon after, Maryam Nawaz criticised her allies and took a potshot at her uncle and party president Shahbaz Sharif for meeting the military. She told the media on Wednesday, “They (opposition leaders) were called [to the GHQ] on the issue of Gilgit-Baltistan. This is a political issue that should be settled by the people’s representatives... These issues should be decided in Parliament, not in the GHQ.” Railways minister Rasheed then disclosed that the PML-N leadership had held not one but two meetings with the military leadership in the past two months. But Maryam’s statement appeared to have upset the military, with the head of its media wing, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, disclosing that senior PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair held two meetings with Gen Bajwa in recent weeks to discuss the issue of Nawaz Sharif and his daughter. Iftikhar said both meetings were “requested” by Zubair, who “talked about Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz”. He added, “The army chief made it clear to [Zubair] that whatever their legal issues are, they will be solved in Pakistan’s courts, while political issues will be solved in parliament.” While the army seems to have won the latest round, it is clear the issue of military interference in politics will continue to be debated. It has also shaken the Khan government, which is being accused of coming to power through a rigged election. Analyst Kamran Yousaf said the days of the government may soon be over and another set-up cobbled with consensus could take charge. But others disagree. Most analysts say Nawaz Sharif’s speech stirred a hornet’s nest, and his contention that the army is a “state above a state” will echo in the corridors of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cracks-in-oppn-alliance-with-help-from-army/story-w47OLQrAgtLcjtyEvShJNN.html
