The accounts were fake, created by an organization in Africa with links to Russia’s Internet Research Agency.Similarly, this past week Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts linked to that “troll factory” that had pushed out stories about race and other issues. The network had tricked unwitting American writers to post content to the pages.It’s a troubling but familiar pattern from Russia, as the Internet Research Agency overwhelmingly focused on race and the Black Lives Matter Movement when targeting the US in 2016. The goal, part of the Russian playbook for decades, was to sow chaos by posting content on both sides of the racial divide. Indeed, “no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans,” concluded a report from the Senate Intelligence Committee.With the election just two months away, some lawmakers are worried that the Russian efforts, now evolved and more sophisticated than four years ago, could again take hold. They fear the Trump administration’s decision to limit what it tells Congress — and by extension the American people — about election threats will allow the propaganda to spread.“Race was a big piece of what they did in 2016, and given heightened racial tensions this year, there’s no reason they wouldn’t be doing the same thing again,” says Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He says the information that is now being limited “belongs to the American people.”Democrats were furious last weekend after Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, a close Trump ally, informed Congress that the office would supply written information to the intelligence committees about election threats but would no longer be doing in-person briefings, denying lawmakers the chance to ask questions.The cancellation came a few weeks after US intelligence officials publicly stated that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Trump’s opponent, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, ahead of the election. Trump responded to that assessment by saying that “nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have.”Election interference has always been a sensitive subject for Trump. The president has often dismissed the idea that Russia interfered at all in 2016, and has replaced many long-serving intelligence officials with his own appointees.The intelligence statement did not offer specifics about what tactics Russia is using, but the past provides important clues.In 2016 the Internet Research Agency had an “overwhelming operational emphasis on race” that was apparent in the online ads it purchased — more than two-thirds contained a term related to race. The company targeted that content to “African-Americans in key metropolitan areas with well-established black communities and flashpoints in the Black Lives Matter movement,” according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report. One of its top performing pages, “Blactivist,” generated 11.2 million engagements with Facebook users.Bret Schafer, an expert on foreign disinformation with the bipartisan group Alliance for Securing Democracy, said stoking racial animosity is a Kremlin strategy that goes back decades. His group tracked a major uptick in social media activity on racial issues from Russian state-sponsored media and political figures this summer, especially after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.“We have seen a constant messaging theme being race and racism in the US,” Schafer said. “They’re very good at it.”There is evidence that the recent police shooting of a Black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the resulting protests — the focus of political sparring between Trump and Biden this week — have fueled a new round of social media activity from foreign governments.English-language media outlets linked to the Russian government have published stories supporting the protests, and “Cop Injustice in Kenosha” is the headline on a video posted by an online news organization with ties to Russia. Another video from the Kremlin-backed outlet Redfish shows Trump supporters driving aggressively through protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been protests for weeks.The stories are precisely the kind of content lawmakers are trying to keep tabs on.The acting chairman of the Senate committee, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told a local news outlet this past week that has spoken to Ratcliffe and expects the in-person briefings to continue. But it is unclear whether they will. A spokeswoman for Ratcliffe would not confirm Rubio’s remarks.The committee’s top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, says he has been working with Rubio to urge Ratcliffe to reverse the decision.“Ninety percent of the information I’ve ever gained from any briefing is not from the briefing, it’s from the questions,” Warner said.The briefings are less likely to be reinstated in the House intelligence committee, which is led by Democrats. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said cancelling the briefings is a “shocking abdication of its lawful responsibility.” He has urged vigilance on the Russian meddling, noting that the tactics have evolved but “the underlying malign goals remain the same.”The intelligence committees are receiving some information from the social media companies themselves, notably Facebook and Twitter. The companies were slow to respond in 2016, but are now waging sophisticated efforts to root out foreign interference. Twitter stopped accepting political ads, while Facebook began verifying the identity of ad buyers in 2018 and this week said it will restrict new political ads in the 7 days before the election.Nina Jankowicz, disinformation fellow at the nonpartisan Wilson Center, says there has been an improvement in tracking, but because the issue of interference has been so politicized, Congress and the public aren’t getting enough information.“What people need to be looking for is stuff that is seemingly trying to get a rise out of them,” Jankowicz said. “Don’t think you are going to find a troll. It’s about guarding yourself from emotional manipulation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/racial-tensions-across-united-states-pose-target-for-2020-election-meddling/story-QI1ZCwXUfWwCCcRfTgY56I.html

The OMB will issue more detailed guidance shortly.Also read: Jacob Blake pleads not guilty to charges prior to Kenosha shootingThe memo comes amidst a national discussion about racism triggered by the killing of George Floyd, an African American man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis in May.While President Donald Trump has condemned the incident, he has denied there is systemic racism in the country and has opposed ‘Black Lives Matter’ and defended the police. He has used anti-racism protests and unrest to the protests to stoke fears of lawlessness, seeking it to tie it to Democrats and Joe Biden, their presidential nominee, more specifically.Jacob Blake, the black man whose shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, added another flashpoint to the unrest, pleaded non-guilty on Friday in a virtual appearance in a court hearing charges of sexual assault and disorderly conduct stemming from a complaint filed by an ex-girlfriend prior to the shooting. Blake survived the shooting but is paralyzed waist down.Amid the national debate on racism, a professor at the prestigious George Washington University in Washington has admitted to pretending to be black for years. “To an escalating degree over my adult life, I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim,” Jessica A Krug, who is white, wrote in an online post. “First North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness.”Krug teaches African and Latin American studies. The university has said she will not be teaching while her case is being reviewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-orders-end-to-un-american-diversity-training-for-federal-workers/story-7TPTg7m8Me4puwSPNzaqoJ.html
05-09-2020||World||Covid-19: France expects more severe infections in next two weeks||France must stay vigilant as more people will be hospitalised in intensive care units in the next two weeks, reflecting a flare-up in Covid-19 infections in recent days, health minister Olivier Veran said on Saturday.Veran however ruled out the need for a new nationwide lockdown, telling BFM television that France had other means to fight the virus, including testing.“I cannot envision a general lockdown. The lockdown was a lid on an overflowing cooking pot,” he said.Health authorities on Friday reported 8,975 new confirmed cases, almost 1,500 higher than the previous daily peak of 7,578 on March 31, when France was in one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns.The death toll in France stood at 30,686 people as of Friday.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAs the rise in infections has mainly affected young people, who are less likely to develop complications, there has so far been less strain on French hospitals, which were almost overwhelmed at the end of March.But after falling steadily for months after an April 14 peak of 32,292, the number of people hospitalised was up by 28 on Friday to 4,671, rising for a sixth day in a row.“We are not all on the same epidemic wave as last spring. We are on a slower trend but one that must alert us,” Veran said.“This week, 55 patients on average were hospitalised in intensive care units (ICU) each day, this means we are on an average of 1,500-2,000 people hospitalised in ICU units per month in our country. This is not neutral and we must be extremely vigilant,” he added.Current hospitalisation numbers reflected infections contracted two weeks ago, Veran said. “So it is obvious that in the next 15 days there will be an increase, it will not be massive but there will nevertheless be an increase in the number of severe cases and in the number of people hospitalised and in ICU units”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-expects-more-severe-infections-in-next-two-weeks/story-MOT2834cZbLXygBnOobY8O.html

The self-defence forces must gather all their strength and be ready for anything,” Kono said, as quoted by the NHK broadcaster.Earlier in the day, Japan’s Meteorological Agency said that the typhoon may cause high waves that can be comparable to tsunamis.Atmospheric pressure in Haishen’s centre is 920 hectopascals, while its wind power is 180 kilometres per hour and gusts are up to 252 kilometres per hour. Haishen is expected to hit Japan’s Kyushu island on September 6 and 7.Nearly 100 flights in southern and southwestern Japan were cancelled on Saturday due to the approaching typhoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-haishen-japan-deploys-22-000-soldiers-on-full-alert/story-ON8xdq5pDPLCxmh5e09T6K.html

American officials have also pressed neighboring Pakistan to get the Taliban to the table.Relentless delays over the exchange of prisoners —5,000 held by the Afghan government and 1,000 by the Taliban — have hindered efforts to get intra-Afghan talks started.In late August, a delegation led by the Taliban’s political office head and the chief negotiator of the February deal with the United States, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar came to Pakistan. While little was revealed about the details of his meetings with Pakistani officials, it is believed he was pressed to get started with intra-Afghan talks.With many of the Taliban leadership council living in Pakistan, Islamabad has been pressed by Washington to use its influence to push negotiations forward. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has repeatedly said he wants peace talks started and that a military solution for Afghanistan is an impossibility.Pakistani officials reportedly met a second time with Baradar on Friday before his return to Doha again pressing for a swift start to Afghan peace talks, it is believed.US and Afghan officials have both said they want to see a reduction in violence in the conflict going into talks with the Taliban, but the militant group maintains that a cease-fire would only be on the agenda once talks begin.Washington’s February agreement with the Taliban was reached to allow the exit of American troops after nearly 20 years at war in keeping with a promise President Donald Trump made during the 2016 US election campaign. The withdrawal, which has already begun, is not dependent on the success of the Afghan negotiations but rather on commitments made by the Taliban to fight terrorist groups and ensure Afghanistan cannot be used to attack America or its allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-delegation-returns-to-doha-setting-stage-for-peace-talks-with-afghanistan/story-IMrg3zzf7gQCZyWUaQxkHN.html

05-09-2020||World||United Nations chief warns of famine, food insecurity in 4 conflict-hit nations||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that there is a risk of famine and widespread food insecurity in four countries affected by conflict — Congo, Yemen, northeast Nigeria and South Sudan — and the lives of millions of people are in danger.In a note to Security Council members obtained by The Associated Press on Friday, the UN chief said the four countries rank “among the largest food crises in the world”, according to the 2020 Global Report on Food Crises and recent food security analyses. But funding to help is very low, he said.“Action is needed now,” Guterres said. “Having endured years of armed conflict and related violence, the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, northeast Nigeria and South Sudan are again facing the specter of heightened food insecurity and potentially famine.” The UN chief said key indicators “are similarly deteriorating” in a number of other conflict-hit countries including Somalia, Burkina Faso and Afghanistan.“The situation varies from country to country, but civilians are being killed, injured and displaced; livelihoods are destroyed; and availability of and access to food disrupted, amid growing fragility,” Guterres said. “At the same time, humanitarian operations are attacked, delayed or obstructed from delivering life-saving assistance.” He said food insecurity in conflict-affected countries “is now further exacerbated by natural disasters, economic shocks and public health crises, all compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic.” UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said in an interview with AP that the economic fallout from the pandemic including lock downs, border closures and restrictions on movement have all had “a big effect on food security and agricultural productivity.” And extremists have taken the opportunity “to make hay out of all this,” he said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“Everybody is very preoccupied by Covid and the virus,” Lowcock said. But “it is not the virus that’s creating most of the carnage. It is other things, and we need to focus on the things that will really cause the biggest loss of life.” Lowcock said many of those things are consequences of Covid-19 -- the economic contraction, the declining availability of basic public services, “the insecurity into which extremist groups are occupying themselves.” He said a lot of effort has gone into things like providing personal protective equipment, public information campaigns on the virus, water and sanitation campaigns, “all of which are good things.” “But if you do those at the expense of basic humanitarian needs in these badly affected places, what you end up with is not a reduction in loss of life but an increase in loss of life,” Lowcock said. He said having four countries meet the requirement in a 2018 Security Council resolution to report to the council when the risk of conflict-induced famine and widespread food insecurity occurs is highly significant. According to the secretary-general’s note, escalating violence in volatile eastern Congo “is again driving disastrous levels of food insecurity and hunger,” and the latest analysis “indicates that over 21 million people are in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity.” With only 22% of the UN humanitarian appeal currently funded, Guterres said, “core programmes will need to be reduced or suspended.” In Yemen, where the international community mobilised to prevent famine two years ago, he said, “the risk is slowly returning”. Escalating conflict and economic decline brought the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine two years ago, and similar conditions and worsening key indicators are emerging today, he said. A recent survey indicated that 3.2 million people in government-controlled areas are now “highly food insecure,” and food prices are 140% higher than averages before the conflict began in 2015, Guterres said. “But with only 24% of humanitarian requirements funded in 2020, agencies are now forced to reduce or close core programs.” In northeast Nigeria’s Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, he said, “alarming levels of food insecurity and hunger have arisen largely as a result of the actions” of extremists affiliated with armed groups. Guterres said estimates suggest more than 10 million people in the three states — about 80% of the population — need humanitarian assistance and protection, an almost 50% increase since last year and the highest recorded since humanitarian operations began. Yet, the UN appeal is only 33% funded, its lowest level, he said. In South Sudan’s Jonglei and Greater Pibor administrative area, Guterres said the situation deteriorated rapidly in the first half of 2020, “fuelled by escalating violence and insecurity,” Guterres said. Fighting has been accompanied by widespread attacks on agricultural and pastoral land and the looting of livestock and food, leaving more that 1.4 million people in the area “facing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity, he said. In addition, at least 350,000 children suffer from severe or moderate acute malnutrition.” Guterres said the latest outlook from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network “is flagging worsening catastrophe conditions...in areas affected by the violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-chief-warns-of-famine-food-insecurity-in-4-conflict-hit-nations/story-ujReF5H6UZtg9F9938ZwgP.html
05-09-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 crisis, religious figures worry about losing followers, funding||The Covid-19 pandemic is testing the patience of some religious leaders across Africa who worry they will lose followers, and funding, as restrictions on gatherings continue. Some evangelical Christian leaders in Uganda have launched a campaign with the now-universal phrase of protest: “I can’t breathe.”Their members vow to occasionally put on the burlap costumes they say resemble the sackcloth worn by biblical prophets.“Uganda is a God-fearing nation but, unfortunately, due to the lockdown, the citizens of our great country cannot gather to seek God’s intervention,” Betty Ochan, leader of the opposition in Uganda’s national assembly, recently wrote in the local Daily Monitor newspaper. “The devil is taking dominance. If people do not worship God together, they are spiritually derailed.”From Nigeria to Zimbabwe, people are speaking out — or sneaking out to worship — as they argue that limits on religion could lead to a crisis of faith.“I am appalled that some people have the audacity to tell us how many hours we can spend in church,” said Chris Oyakhilome, president of the Lagos-based megachurch known as Christ Embassy. “How dare you. What in the world do you think you are?”Church services in Nigeria resumed last month but are limited to an hour, a severe test for some in a country where worship can spill from a Sunday morning into the afternoon.Some ministers in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, have sparked a separate controversy for saying followers should continue paying their tithes into designated bank accounts. Some ministers have long been accused of maintaining lavish lifestyles at the expense of their followers.But the larger concerns are rooted in the very nature of belief.“Coming together is very important from an African point of view,” said Christopher Byaruhanga, a professor of systematic and historical theology at Uganda Christian University. “We Africans want to live in a community. So the coronavirus is now redefining that community.”Coming together to worship is part of the “accountability” that builds trust as people share their testimonies, he said.The “overall levels of religious commitment” in sub-Saharan Africa are among the highest in the world, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center. The region’s number of Christians grew from about 7 million in 1900 to 470 million by 2010, when it was home to 21% of the world’s Christians and 15% of all Muslims.Christians strongly associate their faith with the brick-and-mortar buildings of their parishes, said the Rev. Charles Odurkami, an emeritus bishop in Uganda.“Africans are notoriously religious,” he said. “Of course, in Africa some people worship with two feet. One foot in traditional culture and another foot in Christianity.”Another religious leader in Uganda, a self-described prophet who leads a congregation of thousands in Kampala, has criticized attempts to negotiate with the government to reopen houses of worship.“It’s disrespectful ... if a so-called pastor goes on his knees and begs a politician to open up,” Elvis Mbonye recently told a local broadcaster. “I will not ask any man to give me the permission, the right, the directives.”Hajji Ramadhan Mugalu, secretary-general of the Uganda Muslim Supreme Council, said Muslims “are losing out on the ... social aspect” while mosques remain closed.“If arcades and malls have been opened, our prayer is that these places of worship should also be opened,” he said. “Yes, they can pray at home, but congregational prayer is very powerful.”Authorities in Uganda and other countries say they will follow the advice of health experts on allowing places of worship to resume normal operations. In Tanzania, however, President John Magufuli has alarmed health experts by asserting that divine power would offer protection from the virus. The country hasn’t updated its number of infections — just over 500 — since April.In South Africa, which makes up roughly half of the African continent’s 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus infections, the pandemic has challenged people’s relationship with their faith, said Mosa Sona, bishop at Grace Bible Church in the Johannesburg township of Soweto.“Am I a believer that practices his faith in the midst of a crowd, at a building called a church, or does it matter when I am all alone at home?” asked Sona, whose church was among the first to stream sermons online.Others insist on staying physically in touch with their coreligionists, no matter what pandemic restrictions say.In Zimbabwe, the government has encouraged people to pray at home. But that wasn’t an option for Amos Mazikande, who recently went to a “prophet” with his apostolic group to seek a cure for his daughter’s persistent headaches.The family used back roads to avoid police on their way to an open ground where services are held in the capital, Harare.“Coronavirus will be defeated by the Holy Spirit, so we don’t have to fear it,” Mazikande said.Across the country, apostolic believers line up to collect “holy” water, oil, pieces of cloth and clay pots that they believe offer protection from “evil spirits” that bring poverty and disease.At a recent service, about a dozen worshippers huddled to sing and dance, some with face masks dangling from their chins. Under a nearby tree, a woman knelt while the leader sprinkled water and vigorously shook her head in an apparent healing session.Some say such scenes show the pandemic is strengthening people’s faith no matter how they worship.Etienne Bonkoungou, a chaplain in Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, said he has noticed that since normal church services recently resumed, people who didn’t attend regularly before the pandemic now show up every week.“People found it necessary to get closer to God because they said it’s only God that can deliver them,” Bonkoungou said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-religious-figures-worry-about-losing-followers-funding/story-Kl7iZo4PWIPUVhptL1iW0H.html

Cafferty noted that Blake had been working as a painter and that he had no prior criminal record or convictions in any state. Blake raised his hand to greet Loren Keating, a Kenosha County judicial court commissioner, when addressed, saying “Yes sir,” when asked if he could hear clearly and whether he understood the terms of his $10,000 signature bond.“The state recognizes that these are serious charges but also that the defendant has serious injuries and he’s recovering at the hospital,” said Zeke Wiedenfeld, a prosecutor.The court set trial to begin on Nov. 9 with jury selection. The complaint does not identify the ex-girlfriend by name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacob-blake-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-prior-to-kenosha-shooting/story-LN6SLTTWlmnhDWWKERZ3JO.html
05-09-2020||World||Rochester, New York police union says officers acted by book in using hood in man’s arrest||The head of Rochester, New York’s police union on Friday defended the actions of officers involved in the March arrest of Daniel Prude, a Black man whose death triggered protests, saying they followed protocols in using a hood to restrain him.“They had to do exactly what they did,” Rochester Police Locust Club President Michael Mazzeo told a news conference on Friday, adding that there was a “substantial amount of evidence to show why the protocols” used by the officers were employed.Prude, a 41-year-old Black man, died after an encounter with police in Rochester, New York, in March. His family this week released body camera footage from his arrest, showing a group of officers putting a mesh hood over Prude’s head - apparently to prevent his spit from possibly transmitting the novel coronavirus - as he kneels naked and restrained on the street.Release of the video was followed by protests in Rochester, turning the city of 200,000 people in the northwest corner of the state into the latest flash point in a summer of civil unrest over racism and police brutality.Seven police officers were suspended Thursday over the arrest. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint”, with intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, among additional contributing factors.Rochester police chief La’Ron Singletary and mayor Lovely Warren, both Black, have faced questions over why the officers were not disciplined until the videotape became public five months later. Singletary has said internal and criminal investigations were underway. Mazzeo, in his first comments since the body camera footage was made public, said he had been told by Singletary’s office after the arrest that there were “no concerns” with the officers and that they had followed training. Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that based on the known facts and the video evidence available online she believes the officers acted properly, including in their use of a so-called “spit hood”.“This device is intended to protect officers and others from somebody who threatens to bite or spit, or uses their mouth to infect them,” Haberfeld said, describing their response to the situation as “absolutely by the book”. The video footage also shows officers forcing Prude’s face down on the ground. Prude can be heard shouting, “Take this ... off my face!” and “You’re trying to kill me!” in response to the hood. Officers are heard saying “Calm down” and “stop spitting.”Prude’s head was then pressed onto the pavement for two minutes, according to video footage and records released by Prude’s family. He died a week later at the hospital.Pressing a person’s face down is also a common procedure among police departments as a way to gain control over someone who is resisting arrest or who appears to be under the influence of drugs, Haberfeld said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rochester-ny-police-union-says-officers-acted-by-book-in-using-hood-in-man-s-arrest/story-7npJhQa611gsthHxOkcFaL.html

The Chinese defence minister suggested that both sides should maintain communication at all levels including between the two ministers, it added.• Singh said that both sides should take guidance from the consensus of the leaders that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas was essential for the further development of our bilateral relations and that two sides should not allow differences to become disputes. Accordingly, the two sides should resolve the ongoing situation and outstanding issues in the border areas peacefully through dialogue.• The Chinese defence minister, the statement said, conveyed that Chinese side too desired to resolve the issues peacefully. Singh advised that it was important therefore that Chinese side should work with the Indian side for complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas including Pangong Lake as well as de-escalation in border areas in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas, strictly respect and observe the line of actual control and should not make attempts to unilaterally change status quo.• Singh further said that the current situation should be handled responsibly and that neither side should take any further action that could either complicate the situation or escalate matters in the border areas. Singh conveyed that the two sides should continue their discussions, including through diplomatic and military channels, to ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/must-continue-talks-to-ensure-full-restoration-of-peace-rajnath-singh-to-chinese-defence-minister/story-y19cbxp07Z7uxD3f1uL7II.html

More than 2,200 people were evacuated to temporary shelters in the southern city of Busan.Natural disasters tend to have a greater impact in the North due to its creaking infrastructure, and the country is vulnerable to flooding as many mountains and hills have long been deforested.Punishing the local officials is a “way for the North Korean leadership to avoid blame” for the casualties, Ahn Chan-il, a defector turned researcher based in Seoul, told AFP.“They are sending out a message that Kim Jong Un never does anything wrong, but damages occur only because those who work for him fail to follow his order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-punishment-for-north-korea-officials-after-typhoon-casualties/story-CJS2YZ1XTDMcAFteATbUHM.html

Now... we will start asking questions of some of the Western vaccines,” he told Reuters.Dmitriev complained that certain politicians and media were not concentrating on the research that led to the development of the vaccine but are busy in negative publicity against Russia.The vaccine, named Sputnik-V in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, is a human adenoviral vector vaccine which fights against Covid-19.Dmitriev also lauded India for expressing interest in locally producing the vaccine.“India has historically been a very important partner of Russia. India is one of the leading countries in production. Around 60% of all the vaccines in the world are produced in India. We are in close dialogue with the corresponding ministries and the India government and the leading manufacturer of the country regarding localisation of production of Sputnik V vaccine in India,” he said, according to ANI.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine developers plan pledge, Russian shot ‘passes early trial test’: All you need to knowResults of the clinical trials of Sputnik V were released on Friday and the clinical trials showed that 76 participants who participated in the trial developed strong immune responses. The research team said that the heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine “ induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants”, according to results published on Friday by The Lancet medical journal.The participants in the study were followed for 42 days and the scientists said the sample of study participants was small and there were no placebo or control vaccines used. The Lancet study stated that two Russian hospitals involving healthy individuals, both men and women, aged between 18-36 years were enrolled between June 18 and August 3.The study headed by Dr Denis Logunov of the NF Gamaleya National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Moscow said that participants were administered with “heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S).”The study authored by Logunov and his team of researchers pointed out that there were no adverse effects barring some “common systemic and local reactions.”The study said, “The most common systemic and local reactions were pain at the injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most systemic and local reactions were mild. Changes in laboratory variables were mild and transient. In volunteers who received both vaccine components (rAd26-S and rAd5-S), most adverse events occurred after the second vaccination (appendix pp 5–7). No adverse events, either during phase 1 or phase 2, led to the withdrawal of a participant from the study or withdrawal of study drug.”Criticism regarding Russia’s Sputnik V continues as experts say that the approval has been immature. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s daughter was also among the participants and in a cabinet meeting, he said that his daughter feels fine.“I know [the vaccine] works quite effectively, helps to develop strong immunity, and has gone through all the necessary tests,” Putin said.According to another Lancet report, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, raised concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccine based on the immune response. “Immune response might not be directly proportional to the degree of protection—you can only find this out in large-scale trials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-quashes-criticism-of-covid-19-vaccine-says-all-boxes-checked/story-wkDH19Gy8BpLpNKBE6MVgI.html
05-09-2020||World||Would love to help India, China resolve border dispute, says Trump||US President Donald Trump on Friday expressed his readiness once again to “help” India and China resolve their border situation, which he described as “very nasty”.Answering questions at a White House briefing, the president also expressed confidence that Indian Americans will vote for him in the November 3 elections citing the “incredible” turnout at the Howdy Modi event in Houston last September.India and China are “going at it pretty good on the border, as you know, it’s been very nasty, it’s been a very nasty situation,” the president said at the briefing, segueing into the conflict in response to a question about his campaign’s outreach to Indian American voters spearheaded by his son Donald Trump Jr and his partner Kimberley Guilfoyle.He added, “We stand ready to help with respect to China and India if we can do anything we would love to get involved and help. And we are talking to both countries about that.”The American President had extended an offer to mediate the standoff way back in May. “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute,” he had written in a tweet. Both sides turned him down. Trump had offered earlier to mediate between India and Pakistan following the spike in tensions after the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019 by Pakistan-based terrorists. India had rejected that offer also, and swiftly. Responding to a question about his expectations from Indian American voters, the president said, “We have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi and I would think that Indian people would be voting for Trump.”Trump referred to the Howdy Modi event in Houston to back his optimism. “We had an event in Houston, as you know, and it was a fantastic event. I was invited by Prime Minister Modi … it was it was it was incredible. It was actually incredible and the Prime Minister could not have been more generous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/would-love-to-help-india-china-resolve-border-dispute-says-trump/story-jZWe6f7HQiHsZS8o4Fj00O.html
05-09-2020||World||China’s Xi promises more market opening at trade fair||President Xi Jinping pledged to open China’s service industries wider to foreign competitors as its first in-person trade fair since the coronavirus outbreak opened under intensive anti-disease controls.Xi gave no details in his speech Friday night, but Chinese leaders are emphasizing development of tourism, retailing and other services. They are part of a campaign to nurture economic growth driven by consumer spending instead of exports and investment.China will “relax market access for service industries” and “actively expand imports of high-quality services,” Xi said at the China International Fair for Trade in Services.Xi appeared on a video screen before Chinese businesspeople and a handful of foreign VIPs who wore masks and sat in widely spaced chairs at a convention center adjacent to the site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Most exhibitors from abroad are participating via the internet because Beijing has yet to relax curbs that bar most foreign visitors from the country.The annual export-oriented Canton Trade Fair in southern China, the world’s biggest sales event, was held online in June.China’s manufacturers are flexible, efficient global competitors, but its fledgling tourism, finance, health care and other service industries lag their Western counterparts. Regulatory barriers limit the ability of foreign banks and other providers to compete in China two decades after Beijing joined the free-trading World Trade Organization.U.S. officials who are waging a tariff war with Beijing over its trade record point to services, in which the United States runs a surplus with China, as a promising area.Organizers say 18,000 companies and 100,000 people from 148 countries and regions signed up to take part in the trade fair, which runs through Wednesday.China, where the pandemic began in December, was the first economy to shut down and the first to begin the struggle to revive business after the ruling party declared victory over the disease in March. Factories, office towers and shopping malls have reopened but visitors to public buildings in Beijing still are checked for fever by masked guards.China became the first economy to return to growth with a 3.2% expansion over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, rebounding from the previous quarter’s 6.8% contraction.The trade fair has three-dimensional technology for foreign vendors to show goods and secure online communications to talk to customers, the director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Yan Ligang, told reporters on Thursday.Guests and staff must wear masks and will be checked throughout the day for fever, according to Yan. He said organizers will “restrict the flow” of people and the building will be tested for the virus and disinfected every day.Some 200 medical, disease control and first aid staff will be on duty, Yan said.Chinese companies plan to showcase possible coronavirus vaccines that are under development, according to the Beijing Health Commission. It said some will display tools that can detect the virus in 30 minutes.Other planned exhibitions include cultural, financial and public health services, next-generation telecoms and service robots.The coronavirus “cannot stop the development of service trade, nor can it stop our confidence and action to work together,” Xi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-promises-more-market-opening-at-trade-fair/story-SR7SwFIyuC2YQQrWXDtyzM.html

They’re very good young people. And I know their relationship to India is very good and so is mine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. The president, who describes himself as the best friend ever of India and Indian Americans in the White House, was responding to a question about the role the three important members of his family are going to play this election cycle along with respect to the Indian American community. “Would Kimberly, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump, who are very popular among Indian Americans, would be campaigning on your behalf among the Indian Americans with your views on India-US relationship?” the president was asked. “I appreciate the nice sentiments. They think (Kimberley, Don Jr and Ivanka) a lot of India and so do I. And think a lot of your prime minister (Narendra Modi),” Trump said in response to the question. In the 2016 elections, the Trump family had reached out to the Indian American community, particularly in the battleground states of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida where both Ivanka, and Donald Trump Jr along with his other son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara Trump held meetings with the community members and visited Hindu temples. Ivanka, was the first member of the Trump family to make a trip to India after Trump came to power. She led a high-powered US delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India in 2017. Ivanka, frequently tweets about issues related to India. Having a star appeal in India, Ivanka is also special advisor to the president. Donald Trump Jr, who is heading the re-election campaign, has also made trips to India. Last December he held a special book-launch event for Indian American community in Long Island.  “A Key Advantage in Battleground States Could Secure 2020 for Trump,” Don Jr said in a tweet last month. He along with his girlfriend Kimberley, who is national chair of Trump Victory Finance Committee, have been instrumental in the campaign maintaining a close relationship with Indian American community. The two quite often tweet about the key role that the Indian American community can play in the battle ground states. On India’s independence day on August 15, Donald Trump Jr had tweeted: “Sending Best Wishes to India on its Independence Day.” “Grateful for all my friends there and my Indian-American friends here.” “Congratulations to India who is celebrating their 74th Independence Day and to all those Indian-Americans who now call the USA home. The bond between our countries is stronger than it has ever been as we share a deep appreciation for family, peace, and prosperity,” Kimberly said in tweet greeting India on its Independence Day. “America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian Americans!,” she said about a fortnight ago releasing the first video commercial of the Trump Campaign targeting Indian Americans.  Titled “Four More Years”, the 107 second video starts with the iconic footage of Modi and Trump walking hand in hand at the NRG Stadium in Houston during his visit to the US last year wherein the leaders of the two largest democracies of the world made their joint address before a strong crowd of Indian Americans numbering more than 50,000. Amidst cheering of thousands of his supporters in the US, Modi is seen as saying that Trump “needs no introduction” and that “his name comes up in almost every conversation.” He is the president of the United States of America “Mr Donald Trump,” the prime minister says at the start of the video, that has been conceptualised by Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee.  It is well known that Modi is highly popular among Indian Americans. His star appeal has attracted record crowd, hitherto unknown for a foreign leader, on the American soil. Starting with his address at the Madison Square Garden in 2015 and then in the Silicon Valley two years later, both attracting more than 20,000 people, Modi is perhaps the only foreign leader in recent memory to have addressed such huge rallies in the US. His “Howdy Modi” address in Houston last September was attended by a record 50,000 people. Trump made a solo trip to Houston to join him in the addressing the historic rally. While Modi introduces Trump to the crowd whom he addressed as “my family”, the second part of the commercial has clips form Trump’s historic address in Ahmedabad this February. “America loves India. America respects India. And America will always be faithful and loyal friend to the Indian people,” Trump is seen as saying in the commercial in which he praises the contribution of four million Indian Americans. “They are truly spectacular people,” the president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/me-and-my-family-s-relationship-to-india-is-very-good-says-donald-trump/story-DnTDldBqNXb5g9u9DdDUlL.html
05-09-2020||World||Rajnath Singh meets Chinese counterpart, calls for getting ties ‘back on right track’||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday pushed for the restoration of status quo ante at all friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and called for disengagement of troops in an expeditious way during the much-expected meeting with his Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe in Moscow.The meeting between Singh and Wei, on the sidelines of the defence ministers’ meet at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), was the first high-level political face-to-face meeting between India and China since the border row erupted along the LAC in eastern Ladakh in early May.A Press Trust of India report from Moscow said at the meeting on Friday, which lasted for more than two hours, the Indian delegation strongly objected to Chinese army’s fresh attempts to change the status quo in the southern bank of Pangong lake and insisted on the resolution of the standoff through talks.According to China’s official news agency, Xinhua, Wei told Singh that the responsibility of the ongoing tension lies entirely with India – an allegation that New Delhi has brushed off repeatedly, saying that the border aggression has actually been shown by the troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The same Xinhua report in Mandarin from Moscow quoted Singh as saying that India hoped that two sides will “…adopt a responsible attitude, fully disengage front-line forces as soon as possible, avoid taking measures that may escalate or complicate the situation, and avoid turning differences into disputes so as to bring bilateral military relations back to the right track as soon as possible.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval have previously held separate telephonic talks with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi to resolve the standoff.On Thursday, New Delhi squarely blamed Beijing for the tensions along the LAC over the past four months and said the only way forward was through negotiations – reflecting the impasse created by fresh attempts by Beijing to alter the status quo along the disputed border over the weekend.At the meeting, Wei said that recently the relations between the two countries and the two militaries have been seriously affected by the border issue and that it was very important for the two defence ministers to have a face-to-face and candid exchange of views on relevant issues, according to Xinhua.Wei added that the “cause and truth” of the current tension on the China-India border are very clear, and the responsibility lies entirely with the Indian side.“Not an inch of China’s territory should be lost. The Chinese military has the resolve, capability and confidence to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the Chinese defence minister said.The two sides should earnestly implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and stay committed to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation, Wei said.The Chinese defence minister said that Beijing hoped that the Indian side would strictly abide by the series of agreements reached by the two sides, effectively strengthen the control over front-line troops, and refrain from provocations across the current LAC.India should not take any actions that may cause the situation to escalate, and not deliberately hype up or spread negative information, the Chinese said.The two sides should bear in mind the overall interests of China-India relations and regional peace and stability, make joint efforts to meet each other halfway, cool down the current situation as soon as possible and safeguard peace and tranquillity in the China-India border areas, Wei said at the meeting.“The focus of the talks between the two defence ministers was on ways to resolve the prolonged border standoff,” an unnamed source told PTI. Defence secretary Ajay Kumar and Indian ambassador to Russia DB Venkatesh Varma were part of the Indian delegation at the talks that began at around 9:30pm IST at a prominent hotel in Moscow.Several rounds of talks have been conducted through diplomatic and military channels to end the standoff that began in May.The progress suffered a blow when Chinese troops resorted to what were described as “provocative military movements” on the south bank of Pangong Lake during August 29-30. They were thwarted by counter-measures by the Indian side, which quickly occupied several strategic heights and hilltops, and talks between local brigade commanders since Monday to ease the fresh tensions have been inconclusive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-remains-in-denial-blames-india-for-border-impasse-at-sco-meet/story-qjcbHktfmHXWrDNFBcMnxI.html

It had 17,000 participants as of last week, with 24% from communities of color.The drug developer aims to recruit 30,000 healthy volunteers and said it expected enrollment in the late-stage study, which began in late-July, to be completed in September.A growing body of evidence has shown that long-standing health and social inequities have resulted in increased risk of infection and death from Covid-19 among communities of color.Nearly a fifth of 11,000 people enrolled so far in a 30,000-volunteer U.S. trial testing a Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech are Black or Latino, groups among the hardest hit by the coronavirus, a top Pfizer executive told Reuters last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-developer-moderna-could-slow-covid-19-trials-to-add-at-risk-minorities/story-h6tJeb8pZjnLBS6YjQkNUM.html

In fact, the world is going to need billions of doses, and that is going to take time to manufacture.

05-09-2020||World||Donald Trump says US doesn’t know if Russia’s Navalny was poisoned||President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. doesn’t know directly whether Alexey Navalny was poisoned, failing to accept the German government’s assessment that the Russian opposition leader was attacked with a nerve agent.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that medical tests showed “unequivocally” that Navalny had been poisoned by a military-grade novichok nerve agent. Asked about the German conclusion at a news conference Friday, Trump said, “I hear Germany has made it definitive, or almost definitive, but we have not seen it ourselves.”Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a domestic flight to Moscow from Tomsk in August. He was evacuated to a German hospital under international pressure.Kremlin officials have challenged Germany’s conclusion, saying that Merkel’s government hasn’t provided proof.A novichok agent was used in the March 2018 attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil, prompting a concerted expulsion of 150 Russian diplomats from NATO nations.Later in his news conference, though, Trump agreed that it was likely Navalny had been poisoned. “Based on what Germany’s saying, that seems to be the case,” he said.But he didn’t say whether the U.S. would take any specific action in response. “We have to look at it very seriously if that’s the case,” he said.Trump has tried to nurture a closer relationship with Moscow despite the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 election. Earlier Friday, the president’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said that China should be considered a greater threat to U.S. election integrity than Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-doesn-t-know-if-russia-s-navalny-was-poisoned/story-FcPG8236pGTS4yr23bQjMO.html

A White House official later said it was part of a more than $450 billion fund Congress established at the Treasury Department to support emergency lending programs created by the Federal Reserve to combat economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.There hasn’t been as much demand for the Fed’s emergency pandemic programs, particularly its Main Street program for small- and medium-sized businesses. The Congressional Oversight Commission, a panel that oversees Treasury and Federal Reserve responses to the pandemic, reported last month that lenders had issued loans using only about $472 million of more than $600 billion available under the Main Street program.About half of the Treasury fund has been committed to support the Fed’s programs.“We have $300 billion, it’s there, we don’t need the money, we don’t need anything,” Trump said. “I could give it to the people as a very powerful stimulus.”He added that “there’s a theory” he could issue the money without congressional approval, but that he would like lawmakers to approve it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-wants-to-give-leftover-300-billion-to-taxpayers/story-EowjB8mhr3aeCggevoCj8I.html
05-09-2020||World||Biden says he will meet Dalai Lama, sanction China over Tibet||Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has said that as president he will meet the Dalai Lama, continuing a decades-old practice followed by American presidents with the exception of President Donald Trump, and press China to resume talks with Tibetans for “meaningful autonomy”.The nominee also vowed to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet and “step up” support for Tibetans.Biden accused Trump of maintaining a “deafening silence” on Chinese actions in Tibet and focussing instead on an “empty trade deal” and nurturing his “very good friendship” with China’s President Xi Jinping.“As President, I’ll put values back at the center of American foreign policy,” Biden said in a statement Thursday. “I’ll meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama; appoint a new Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues.”The nominee called out Trump for not meeting the Tibetan leader yet, saying “It’s disgraceful, though not surprising, that Trump is the first American president in three decades who has not met or spoken with His Holiness the Dalai Lama”.The appointment of a special coordinator is mandated by the US Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 — “to promote substantive dialogue between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representative”. The position has been vacant since January 2017, when President Trump took office.Biden went on to say: “I’ll work with our allies in pressing Beijing to return to direct dialogue with the representatives of the Tibetan people to achieve meaningful autonomy, respect for human rights, and the preservation of Tibet’s environment as well as its unique cultural, linguistic and religious traditions.”He will also “step up” support for the Tibetan people, he said, by, among things, expanding Tibetan language services at Radio Free Asia and Voice of America to get information from the outside world into Tibet.But the Trump administration has not been soft exactly on China over Tibet, as charged by Biden. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions in July on some Chinese officials because of Beijing’s restrictions on US diplomats, journalists and tourists from travelling to Tibet and for “human rights abuses” there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-he-will-meet-dalai-lama-sanction-china-over-tibet/story-Iya0MSwzhXnDg0mqcJ03dL.html
