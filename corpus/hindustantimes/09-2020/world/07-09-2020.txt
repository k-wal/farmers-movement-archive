Among the seven detained is the wife of one of the dead attackers and the two brothers of another. Jbabli said that a preliminary investigation showed that the attackers had developed online links with foreign networks to find out how to make explosives.Sousse was the site of Tunisia’s deadliest extremist attack in 2015, when a massacre killed 38 people, most of them British tourists. That attack dealt a heavy blow to Tunisia’s tourism sector, a pillar of the North African nation’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tunisia-arrests-7-suspects-after-deadly-weekend-attack/story-V2WOCRngbfrYO3KJzaV5BO.html
07-09-2020||World||Putin critic Navalny has come out of coma: Berlin hospital||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been removed from a medically induced coma and is responding to speech, Berlin’s Charite hospital said on Monday.The hospital, which has been treating Navalny since he was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month, said his condition has improved and he is being weaned off mechanical ventilation.“It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,” Charite said in a statement.Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. It made an emergency landing in Omsk so that Navalny could be stretchered off.Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her government has concluded Navalny, 44, was poisoned with Novichok, the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018.Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.The incident has put the future of Germany’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Russia in doubt as a growing number of polticians call for support for the project to be withdrawn unless Russia helps to clear up the circumstances around Navalny’s poisioning.Merkel’s spokesman said on Monday she does not rule out imposing sanctions on the pipeline in response to the suspected poisoning.Novichok is a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.Britain says Russia used Novichok to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the city of Salisbury two years ago. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack, which the Skripals survived. A member of the public was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-critic-navalny-has-come-out-of-coma-berlin-hospital/story-VUpWJ7pRRy93ZmIH0jggDI.html
07-09-2020||World||Greece to boost military amid tension with neighbour Turkey||Greece will be bolstering its military with new armament programmes, a boost to military personnel and the development of the country’s defence industry, the government spokesman said Monday, as a tense stand-off with neighbouring Turkey has led to concerns of open conflict between the two NATO allies.Ankara is currently facing off against Greece and Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Greece and Turkey have deployed naval and air forces to assert their competing claims in the region.“The Turkish leadership is unleashing, on a near daily basis, threats of war and makes provocative statements against Greece,” Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said. “We respond with political, diplomatic and operational readiness, determined to do whatever is necessary to protect our sovereign rights.” Petsas said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis would be announcing details of plans to upgrade the country’s military, during his annual state of the economy speech on Saturday.“We are in contact with friendly countries in order to reinforce the equipment of our armed forces,” Petsas said. Last week, Greece raised 2.5 billion euros (USD 2.96 billion) in a bond auction as the country seeks to increase military spending and raise funds for businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Greek media have reported the purchases may include French-made Rafale fighter jets and at least one French frigate. Petsas said Mitsotakis would be meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday on the sidelines of a meeting in Corsica of European Union Mediterranean countries.Last Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Greece to enter talks over disputed eastern Mediterranean territorial claims or face the consequences.“They’re either going to understand the language of politics and diplomacy, or in the field with painful experiences,” he said.Greece and Turkey have come to the brink of war three times since the mid-1970s, including once over exploration rights in the Aegean Sea.The current dispute escalated when Turkey sent seismic research vessel Oruc Reis, accompanied by warships, to prospect for oil and gas reserves in an area between Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete that Athens claims as its own continental shelf.Greece sent its own warships to the area and put its armed forces on alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-to-boost-military-amid-tension-with-neighbour-turkey/story-3ZLeJcX5fK8PypgI6qPyrN.html
07-09-2020||World||Afghan negotiators wait in Kabul as start of peace talks faces delays: Reports||Afghan negotiators have pushed back a planned trip to Doha for long-awaited peace talks with the Taliban as logistical issues are still being worked on in the Qatari capital, delaying the start of the talks, a government and a diplomatic source said on Monday.After months of delays largely due to a disagreement over prisoner demands by the insurgent Taliban, a government decision to set most prisoners free last week led the major players involved to expect talks would finally begin.Negotiators had initially expected to fly to Doha late last week in anticipation of talks starting as soon as Monday.However the team would not leave on Monday, one government and one diplomatic source told Reuters.One of the sources, a senior government official, said the negotiating team may fly on Tuesday.He added that the cause of the delay was partly due to the Taliban and officials in Doha sorting out final logistical questions over the opening ceremony, including who should be given time to speak and how flags should be arranged.These matters carry symbolic weight for the two sides, each of whom have questioned each other’s legitimacy to present themselves as governing powers.The second issue was finalising plans for around six prisoners to leave Afghan prisons and be transferred to Qatar, in a compromise struck with the Taliban last week, the two sources said. Western governments have objected to their release. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that there were no “major issues” causing the delay, adding that they were waiting for the six prisoners to be released, but technical teams from both sides were working on the issue.Major players including United States Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has helped usher the talks since Washington signed a troop withdrawal pact with the Taliban in February, are also in Doha in advance of the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-negotiators-wait-in-kabul-as-start-of-peace-talks-faces-delays-reports/story-jxEm99TSP1DRpXYh2h8DhM.html
07-09-2020||World||Belarus activist goes missing, colleagues fear detention||A leading opposition activist and several other members of an opposition council in Belarus went missing Monday and their colleagues feared they were detained as part of the authorities’ efforts to squelch nearly a month of protests against the re-election of the country’s authoritarian leader.Maria Kolesnikova, a member of the Coordination Council created by the opposition to facilitate talks with President Alexander Lukashenko on a transition of power, was reportedly put on a minibus in the capital, Minsk, and driven away by unidentified people.Her disappearance follows a massive rally Sunday that drew an estimated 100,000 protesters pushing for the resignation of Lukashenko, who extended his 26-year rule in the Aug. 9 election that the opposition sees as rigged.A council member, Maxim Znak, said Kolesnikova’s colleagues fear she was detained. Two other members of the council also couldn’t be reached on Monday, according to Znak.Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted that Kolesnikova’s disappearance is part of the Belarusian authorities’ effort to “cynically eliminate one by one” and called for her immediate release.The Belarusian Interior Ministry said it hasn’t detained Kolesnikova, while other law enforcement agencies have kept mum.After a brutal crackdown in the first few days after the vote that stoked international outrage and swelled the ranks of protesters, the authorities have switched to threats and selective arrests of opposition activists and demonstrators.Sunday’s demonstrations in Minsk and other cities went on despite the authorities’ warning that participants could face reprisals. The Interior Ministry said 633 people were detained Sunday for taking part in unsanctioned protests.Targeting the protest leaders, Belarusian prosecutors have opened a criminal probe of the Coordination Council that opposition activists set up after the election to try to negotiate a transition of power. Two of its members were given 10-day jail sentences on charges of staging unsanctioned protests last week. One of them, Olga Kovalkova, said she was pressured to leave for Poland over the weekend after being threatened with a longer jail term.Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger in the election, who moved to Lithuania a day after the vote under pressure from authorities, said Monday that Kolesnikova’s disappearance marked another attempt by the government to intimidate the opposition.“It’s an attempt to derail the work of the Coordination Council, but we will not be stopped,” she said. “The more they try to scare us, the more people will take to the streets. We will continue our struggle and push for the release of all political prisoners and a new, fair election.” Last week, Kolesnikova announced the creation of a new party, Together.She said the move will help overcome the current crisis, but the party founders’ call for constitutional changes has stunned some other opposition council members, who argued that it could divert attention from the main goal of pushing for Lukashenko to step down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-activist-goes-missing-colleagues-fear-detention/story-v5ximYjAVvTZYgS0v2bPeO.html
07-09-2020||World||Journalists for US media face possible expulsion from China||China is delaying the renewal of press cards for at least five journalists working at four US media outlets, an organisation of foreign correspondents said on Monday, making them vulnerable to expulsion in apparent retribution for Washington’s targeting of Chinese reporters working in the United States.China’s foreign ministry responded by saying applications for renewal were being processed and those reporters involved would not have their lives in China “affected in any way”. However, ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian also accused the US of being “arrogant and unreasonable” in talks about the matter and “not addressing China’s normal and reasonable concerns and demands at all”.“If the U.S. government truly cares about American journalists, it should extend visas for all Chinese journalists as soon as possible, instead of taking journalists from the two countries as hostages for the certain politicians’ political interests,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.Atlanta-based CNN said its China correspondent was among those given a letter authorizing him to continue reporting for the next two months instead of the usual one-year press card.He was told the move was unrelated to his reporting but was merely a reciprocal measure in response to the actions of the Trump administration toward Chinese media, making it the latest manifestation of the deteriorating state of US-China relations that have fallen to their lowest level in decades.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China, or FCCC, said The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have also been targeted. It did not name the fourth outlet, but said more foreign journalists are expected to receive similar treatment. While the targeted outlets are all American, the journalists involved are of various nationalities.Zhao did not say what future actions China might take, but said “all the options are on the table, and the US side knows that very well”.“If the US insists on going down the wrong path and continuously making mistakes, China will have to make the necessary and legitimate responses to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights,” he said.China’s move comes after the US capped the number of Chinese citizens who could be employed by Chinese media outlets and placed them on 90-day visas. China first responded in March by expelling reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Those affected have been both US and non-US citizens.Official press cards are used to obtain residency permits usually good for one year, while the letters issued by the Chinese foreign ministry “could be revoked at any time, thus putting (the journalists) at constant threat of expulsion,” the FCCC said in a statement.The US moves were fed by complaints that Chinese journalists working for state media acted more as propagandists and agents for the Communist Party than as genuine reporters. The US had already required those outlets to register as foreign entities with the US, similar to consulates and embassies.They also come against the backdrop of worsening US-China relations on a range of issues, including human rights, trade, technology, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Chinese treatment of its Muslim minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.Relations hit a new low in July when the US ordered China to close its consulate in Houston and China demanded the shuttering of the US mission in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Beijing’s latest actions have “turned accredited foreign journalists in China into pawns in a wider diplomatic conflict,” the FCCC statement said, calling on Beijing to “halt this cycle of tit-for-tat reprisals in what is quickly becoming the darkest year yet for media freedoms”.A record 17 foreign journalists were expelled from China in the first half of this year alone by having their press credentials withdrawn, while others have had their residency permits shortened to as little as one month, the club said.The FCCC has also documented increasing harassment and surveillance of foreign journalists in China, including physical assault and cyberattacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-for-us-media-face-possible-expulsion-from-china/story-XVDF48zU6WcLpWlzOZ9rXJ.html
07-09-2020||World||China dismisses New Delhi’s concerns over 5 missing Indians in Arunachal Pradesh||China on Monday shrugged off the Indian army’s concern over five missing civilians in Arunachal Pradesh, saying Beijing has never recognised the state which it claims is part of south Tibet.The Indian army had asked China over the weekend whether the missing Indians were in the custody of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“China’s position on the eastern section of the China and India boundary and China’s southern Tibet is consistent and clear. We have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established on the Chinese territory,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said Monday at the regular ministry briefing.“Regarding the specifics, you mentioned I am not aware of it now,” Zhao said responding to a query about the missing Indians. The Indian Army had contacted its Chinese counterpart about the five missing civilians, who were engaged as guides and porters by the Indian army in the Upper Subansiri district on the Sino-India border, on Saturday.Those allegedly kidnapped have been identified as Toch Singkam, Prasat Ringling, Dongtu Ebiya, Tanu Baker and Ngaru Diri. They had gone hunting in a jungle when they were allegedly kidnapped by the PLA.In February, China had strongly objected to home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, saying the visit had violated its territorial sovereignty and “sabotaged” mutual trust with India.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet and routinely, and sharply, criticises the visit of any Indian official visiting the region.In November, the Chinese foreign ministry had similarly slammed Indian defence minister, Rajnath Singh’s visit to the state to review the security situation in the frontier border region.Relations between India and China have hit a multi-decade low since clashes in Ladakh in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers. Both sides have since stepped up monitoring of their largely unsettled 3,488 km border.“We spoke with them (the PLA) on the hotline and told them that it’s suspected that some people have crossed across to your side and we will be grateful if you could hand them over back, as per what we do normally,” Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, an Indian Army spokesperson, told news agency Reuters.“There is no earmarked line going through the forest or the mountains, so they keep moving here and there. So they might have gone there. It’s a very normal thing,” he said, adding they were yet to hear back from the Chinese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-new-delhi-s-concerns-over-5-missing-indians-in-arunachal-pradesh/story-Ranf7BjrHWVHcahD8lY89L.html
07-09-2020||World||WikiLeaks’ Assange in UK court to fight US extradition bid||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a London court on Monday to fight a US extradition request, at a high-stakes hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.Assange, who has spent almost a year and a half in a British prison, sat in the dock at the Old Bailey criminal court and formally refused the US demand he be extradited to face trial on espionage charges. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and maroon tie, with glasses perched atop his neatly trimmed white hair.Several dozen supporters, including fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, gathered outside the courthouse, chanting, banging drums and calling his prosecution a threat to press freedom.“Julian Assange is the trigger, he is shining the light on all the corruption in the world,” Westwood said.American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges over Wikileaks’ publication of secret US military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.American authorities allege that Assange conspired with US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.In a new indictment filed in June, US prosecutors also say he conspired with members of hacking organizations and sought to recruit hackers to provide WikiLeaks with classified information. That indictment expanded the US case against Assange but did not add any new charges.Assange’s lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists around the world at risk.They argue that Assange is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and say the leaked documents exposed US military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes — such as the publications Julian has been charged for — should be protected from prosecution,” Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said before the hearing.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of U.K. and Swedish authorities — but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison as he awaits the extradition decision.Supporters say the ordeal has harmed Assange’s physical and mental health, leaving him with depression, dental problems and a serious shoulder ailment. The hearing is expected to include expert psychiatric evidence about his mental state.Journalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request. Amnesty International said Assange was “the target of a negative public campaign by US officials at the highest levels.”The extradition hearing opened in February but was put on hold when the U.K. went into lockdown in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is resuming with social distancing measures in court and video feeds so that journalists and observers can watch remotely.The case is due to run until early October. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is expected to take weeks or even months to consider her verdict, with the losing side likely to appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-assange-in-uk-court-to-fight-us-extradition-bid/story-c86XokyezzkQgkyYvms4fI.html
07-09-2020||World||Berlin chair protest to back calls for Greek camp evacuation||Activists are setting up thousands of chairs outside the German parliament in Berlin to underline their calls to take in migrants from an overcrowded camp on a Greek island.The 13,000 chairs being set up in front of the Reichstag building on Monday are meant to symbolize the inhabitants of the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, as well the readiness of some German cities and states to take migrants in.Sea-rescue activist groups that back Monday’s action say the first confirmed coronavirus case at Moria adds urgency to long-standing calls for the camp’s evacuation.Greek authorities last week imposed a 14-day quarantine on Moria after one man who had been living in a tent outside the camp fence tested positive for the virus. As of Aug. 31, the Moria camp housed 12,714 people, several times its capacity of 2,757.Germany’s federal government has agreed to take in a total of 243 children from camps in Greece who need medical treatment, as well their closest relatives. So far, 99 of the children have arrived. It also has taken in 53 unaccompanied children evacuated from the camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berlin-chair-protest-to-back-calls-for-greek-camp-evacuation/story-X5NFkT4EAVMPAuivXbkIFP.html
07-09-2020||World||China shows off Covid-19 vaccines for first time||China has put its homegrown coronavirus vaccines on display for the first time, as the country where the contagion was discovered looks to shape the narrative surrounding the pandemic.High hopes hang on the small vials of liquid on show at a Beijing trade fair this week -- vaccine candidates produced by Chinese companies Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.Neither has hit the market yet but the makers hope they will be approved after all-important phase 3 trials as early as year-end.A Sinovac representative told AFP his firm has already “completed the construction of a vaccine factory” able to produce 300 million doses a year.On Monday, people at the trade fair crowded around booths showing the potential game-changing vaccines.China, which is facing a storm of foreign criticism over its early handling of the pandemic, has been trying to repurpose the story of Covid-19.State media and officials are now emphasising the revival of Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the deadly pathogen surfaced, as a success story in the fight against the virus.They are also touting progress on domestic vaccines as a sign of Chinese leadership and resilience in the face of an unprecedented health threat that has pummelled the global economy.In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to make any potential vaccine developed by China a “global public good”.The potential vaccines on display are among nearly 10 worldwide to enter phase 3 trials, typically the last step ahead of regulatory approval, as countries race to stub out the virus and reboot battered economies.Sinopharm said it anticipates the antibodies from its jab to last between one and three years -- although the final result will only be known after the trials.China’s nationalistic tabloid Global Times reported last month that “the price of the vaccines will not be high”.Every two doses should cost below 1,000 yuan ($146), the report said, citing Sinopharm’s chairman, who told media he has already been injected with one of the candidate vaccines.China’s official Xinhua news agency reported Monday that another vaccine candidate, developed by Chinese military scientists, can deal with mutations in the coronavirus.As of last month, at least 5.7 billion doses of the vaccines under development around the world had been pre-ordered.But the World Health Organization has warned that widespread immunisation against Covid-19 may not be on the cards until the middle of next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shows-off-covid-19-vaccines-for-first-time/story-dGgWVXYEmDfGQUrh6DlvGI.html
07-09-2020||World||UK police arrest man over string of stabbings in Birmingham||British police arrested a 27-year-old man early Monday on suspicion of murder and seven counts of attempted murder following a string of stabbings in a busy nightlife district in the central England city of Birmingham over the weekend.West Midlands Police said the suspect remains in custody after being arrested at around 4 a.m.The arrest follows a large-scale police manhunt in the wake of the stabbings in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police released CCTV footage of the man they said was wanted on suspicion of murder.A 23-year-old man was killed in the attacks and a man and a woman, ages 19 and 32, remain critically ill in hospital after suffering serious stab wounds.Following the arrest, Birmingham Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Steve Graham, said one line of enquiry “ultimately led us to an address in the Selly Oak area this morning where a man was arrested.”“Clearly this is a crucial development but our investigation continues,” he added.Local police have faced criticism of their response to the attacks, notably how the attacker was able to wander the city during his 90-minute rampage. The victims appeared to have been chosen at random.West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has urged people to avoid speculating over any motives behind the attacks and to “remain calm but vigilant.”The stabbings took place at a time when nightlife is gradually resuming across city centers in the U.K. following the national coronavirus lockdown.Official statistics show knife crime is on the rise in the U.K., where most guns are outlawed, although the number of homicides with blades fell in 2019 from the year before.Britain also has seen several recent extremist knife attacks, including a stabbing rampage in a city park in Reading, near London, in June that killed three people. A Libyan man has been charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-arrest-man-over-string-of-stabbings-in-birmingham/story-yfmbuIwAMZOyT14kKQxOCP.html
07-09-2020||World||Australia reports nine coronavirus-related deaths, daily infection count drops||Australia on Monday recorded nine new coronavirus deaths and 47 fresh cases, the lowest single-day spike in new infections in the last two months, health officials said. All the fatalities and 41 of the new cases were reported from Victoria, which is in a stage four lockdown since August 2. Monday’s tally of new cases is the lowest since June 26 in Australia. On Sunday, Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews announced a five-step strategy to lift the current restrictions. This plan will be in effect from September 13 to November 23, after which the state will need to maintain a “Covid-free” status for 14 days to finally be declared as “Covid-normal”. The present stage four lockdown will go on till September 28. Andrews’ roadmap aims to keep daily new cases between 30 and 50 till September 28 and fewer than five by late October. Andrews defended the gradual lifting of restrictions, saying “you cannot run out of (this) lockdown because you will be running into a third wave, resulting in another lockdown.” So far, Victoria has recorded 19,550 Covid-19 cases, while the death toll stands at 675. Andrews said, “These are difficult times, but to go from 725 cases to 41 cases in a month -- that demonstrates this strategy is working, the sacrifices that we are making are worth something.” He added, “I want that (sacrifices) to count and that’s why we simply can’t open up as quickly as everyone would like us to.” “I would like to open up much more quickly than we can, but none of us have the luxury. None of us — not me, not any Victorian — has the luxury of letting our frustration get the better of us. That’s not a recipe for anything other than a third wave,” he added. On Victoria’s virus roadmap, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the state’s decision to extend the lockdown was “hard and crushing news” for Victorians. “It is vital to the national interest to restore Victoria to a Covid-safe environment, where we can reopen our economy and reasonably restore the liberties of all Australians, whether in Victoria or anywhere else,” he said. “The proposed roadmap will come at a further economic cost. While this needs to be weighed up against mitigating the risk of further community outbreak, it is also true that the continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting on mental health,” Morrison said on Sunday. Meanwhile, New South Wales recorded four new coronavirus cases, including three healthcare workers at Liverpool and Concord Hospitals. Queensland reported two new cases in the last 24 hours. The coronavirus has so far claimed 762 lives with 26,319 confirmed infections in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-reports-nine-coronavirus-related-deaths-daily-infection-count-drops/story-7TrC8ld4N1ZGt2B5HxUncK.html
07-09-2020||World||India now second behind US in coronavirus cases amid economic pain||India’s increasing coronavirus caseload made the Asian giant the world’s second-worst-hit country behind the United States on Monday, as its efforts to head off economic disaster from the pandemic gain urgency.The 90,802 cases added in the past 24 hours pushed India’s total past Brazil with more than 4.2 million cases. India is now behind only the United States, where more than 6.2 million people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University.India’s Health Ministry on Monday also reported 1,016 new deaths for a total of 71,642, the third-highest national toll.The world’s second-most populous country with 1.4 billion people, India has been recording the world’s largest daily increases in coronavirus cases for almost a month. Despite over 2 million new cases in the past month and the virus spreading through the country’s smaller towns and villages, the Indian government has continued relaxing restrictions to try and resuscitate the economy.On Monday, the Delhi Metro, which serves India’s sprawling capital, New Delhi, and adjoining areas, resumed operations after remaining shuttered for more than five months. The commuters were scarce and stations deserted. Only asymptomatic people were allowed to board the trains, with masks, social distancing and temperature checks mandatory.Security personnel used metal detectors attached to rods to ensure social distancing during frisking at the stations, and commuters were allowed to enter only after sanitizing their hands.New Delhi’s streets have already returned to their normal bustle, and people are again flocking to markets. The city’s bars will reopen on Wednesday.The reopenings come after India’s economy shrank faster than any other major nation’s, nearly 24% in the last quarter.India’s economic pain dates to the demonetization of the nation’s currency in 2016 and a hasty rollout of a goods and services tax the next year. But the strict virus lockdown that started on March 24 further exacerbated the economic woes.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered everyone in the country to stay indoors, the whole economy shut down within four hours. Millions lost their jobs instantly and tens of thousands of migrant workers, out of money and fearing starvation, poured out of cities and headed back to villages. The unprecedented migration not only hollowed out India’s economy but also spread the virus to the far reaches of the country.Now, as cases surge, most of the country, except in high-risk areas, has already opened up, with authorities saying they have little choice.“While lives are important, livelihoods are equally important,” Rajesh Bhushan, the top official of India’s federal health ministry, said at a news briefing last week.Almost 60% of India’s virus cases are now coming from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, the nation’s most populous state. But infections are also returning to areas that had managed to slow the spread of the virus, offsetting marginal gains.Initially hit hard by the virus, New Delhi had seemed to turn the tide through its aggressive screening for patients. But after reopening steadily, the state has reported a recent surge in cases and fatalities. The reopening of the metro is expected to further worsen the situation, experts fear.The recent surge in cases also highlights the risks of India’s strategy on relying too heavily on rapid tests that screen for antigens or viral proteins. These tests are cheap, yield results in minutes and have allowed India to test over a million people a day.But they are also less precise and likely to miss infected people, said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert of Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India.India also says its recovery rate is 77.3% and that the fatality rate has declined to around 1.72%.But the economic crisis means that people in India, especially the poor who were inordinately impacted by the harsh lockdown, have to go out and work. They are also less likely to have access to good healthcare.The virus has already deepened misery in the country’s vast hinterlands and poorer states, where surges have crippled the underfunded healthcare system and stretched resources.S.P.

07-09-2020||World||India re-opens metro trains, overtakes Brazil with second-highest virus cases||India restarted city metro services Monday after a nearly six-month hiatus as the vast nation overtook Brazil to become the second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases, behind only the United States.Despite warnings that it could eventually overtake the US, India has been steadily re-opening its pandemic-battered economy.Masked commuters sat in mostly empty coaches and flashed victory signs to journalists early Monday at metro stations in the capital New Delhi -- one of the most badly hit cities along with financial hub Mumbai.Passengers can only sit on alternate seats, and after undergoing thermal screening.“There was no problems commuting in the metro. Social distancing is being followed and... people are using facemasks and sanitising,” passenger Deepak Kumar, who took the subway to work in Delhi, told AFP.“For our lives to move on, we have to get out of our homes... so this is a good move by the government to start the metro trains.”The resumption of metro services came as the South Asian nation recorded 4.2 million infections since the pandemic began, health ministry data showed.It surpassed Brazil’s total, making it the second-highest tally behind the United States’ 6.25 million.India has also recorded 71,642 deaths, fewer than the 126,203 in Brazil and 188,540 in the US.Many experts, however, say it is not testing enough people and not properly recording many deaths, meaning the real numbers may be much higher.- ‘Alarming’ -Since August the country of 1.3 billion people, home to some of the world’s most densely populated cities, has been reporting the highest single-day rises in the world.On Monday it reported an increase of more than 90,000 cases.Its caseload had moved past four million on Saturday, only 13 days after hitting three million.Delhi, a city teeming with 20 million people, recorded 3,256 new infections on Sunday -- its highest single-day spike in 73 days. It was also the first time cases crossed the 3,000 mark during this period.Virologist Shahid Jameel, who heads the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, said the key factor to watch is the growth rate in infections, which he called “quite alarming”.“Over the past two weeks, the... average has moved from about 65,000 cases per day to about 83,000 cases per day, that is about a 27 percent increase over two weeks or about two percent per day,” Jameel told AFP.India has been testing more than 10 million people per day on average, with plans to ramp it up further.The Indian Council of Medical Research, the scientific agency leading the government’s response, on Friday revised the testing criteria, allowing anyone to get a test without a doctor’s letter.Jameel said the move was overdue.“This will uncover more asymptomatic people, who are the real source of this expansion in India. There should also be more testing in rural districts and villages, since over two-thirds of the cases are coming from there,” he said.The re-opening of subway services was part of an effort by the government to gradually restart economic activity after the strict lockdown imposed from late March saw growth contract by a record 23.9 percent in April to June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-re-opens-metro-trains-overtakes-brazil-with-second-highest-virus-cases/story-WH3cPzefVe50jW4GutmvvM.html
07-09-2020||World||EU seeks details after report UK may renege on Brexit terms||The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator said Monday that he will seek clarification from London about a report that Britain might be planning to renege on commitments it has made during negotiations on its departure from the bloc, as concern mounts that trust between the sides is evaporating.The Financial Times newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is planning domestic legislation that would water down commitments to maintaining an open border between the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland that it has already signed up to.The border guarantee was a key part of the legally binding divorce agreement sealed last year. It’s seen as vital to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Britain left the bloc on Jan. 31 and a transition period meant to sort out a trade agreement to soften the economic blow of Brexit expires on Dec. 31.“This protocol is a condition for preserving peace and for protecting the integrity of the single market. It’s also a pre-condition for confidence between us because everything that has been signed in the past must be respected,” EU negotiator Michel Barnier told French radio France Inter.Barnier said he would ask for details from his British counterpart, David Frost, “to better understand the government’s intentions.” The two sides are meeting in London from Tuesday for their eighth round of negotiations. Barnier said last week he was “worried and disappointed” by the lack of progress.Johnson is talking tough ahead of the negotiations. In remarks released in advance by his office, he is expected to say later on Monday that Britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insist that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the U.K.”He is also set to say that an agreement must be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for Oct. 15. Barnier and the trade committee at the European Parliament, which must also endorse any agreement, insist that the negotiations must conclude before the end of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-details-after-report-uk-may-renege-on-brexit-terms/story-Gpen4Dou2bU0mOx2c0fQkO.html

Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the US Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. That was after an extensive search of the Nimitz, America’s oldest carrier in active service that carries some 5,000 sailors and Marines.The Nimitz, the guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton and other 5th Fleet personnel continued their search on Monday, Rebarich said. She declined to identify the missing sailor, citing Navy policy.The Nimitz, whose homeport is Bremerton, Washington, has been in the Arabian Sea since late July. It replaced the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which had spent months in the Arabian Sea on its deployment that saw the carrier break the Navy’s previous at-sea record. Navy officials have limited port calls due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The Nimitz’s arrival in the Mideast saw Iran conduct a live-fire drill targeting a mockup aircraft carrier resembling it.The drill underlined the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the US after a series of escalating incidents last year led to an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Tehran responded to that strike by firing ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American forces in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-searches-for-missing-nimitz-sailor-in-arabian-sea/story-Qugmh0Tvhs5ddrxgaGWzbJ.html
07-09-2020||World||China targets press cards for some US media: Reports||China has reportedly suspended full renewal of press accreditation for some journalists at US media outlets in apparent retribution for Washington’s targeting of Chinese reporters working in the United States.The moves are the latest manifestation of the deteriorating state of US-China relations that have fallen to their lowest level in decades.Atlanta-based CNN said in a story on its website that China correspondent David Culver was among those told of the new arrangement while applying to renew his foreign ministry-issued press credentials.CNN said he was given a letter authorizing him to continue reporting for the next two months instead of the usual one-year press card. He was told the move was unrelated to his reporting but was merely a reciprocal measure in response to the actions of the Trump administration toward Chinese media.There was no immediate response from China’s foreign ministry.CNN and The New York Times reported that other US media have also been targeted. China’s move comes after the US capped the number of Chinese citizens who could be employed by some Chinese media outlets at 100 and placed all on 90-day visas.China first responded in March by expelling reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Those affected have been both US and non-US citizens.The US moves were fed by complaints that Chinese journalists working for state media acted more as propagandists and agents for the Communist Party than as genuine reporters. The US had already required those outlets to register as foreign entities with the US, similar to consulates and embassies.They also come against the backdrop of worsening US-China relations on a range of issues, including human rights, trade, technology, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and Chinese treatment of its Muslim minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targets-press-cards-for-some-us-media-reports/story-8AGYcECGCQEs4lZSBwAkHK.html

We will hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for that,” Pompeo was quoted as saying in a State Department tweet on Sunday (local time).Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times with the two countries sparring over a range of issues including Beijing’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea and the Chinese government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis.Pompeo has said recently that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a clear and intensifying pattern of bullying its neighbours from the Taiwan Strait to the Himalayas and beyond and hoped for a peaceful resolution of the situation on the India-China border.Last Wednesday, the top US diplomat said the Department of State will now require senior Chinese diplomats in the US to receive approval to visit American university campuses and to meet with local government officials.

07-09-2020||World||Californians dodged blackouts but wildfires may cut power anyway||California once again evaded rolling blackouts Sunday after residents dramatically curbed electricity use during a record-breaking heat wave -- but the state’s energy crisis is far from over.The sweltering temperatures are fueling wildfires that have, just this weekend, taken down power plants, forced evacuations and cut power to about 70,000 homes and businesses. Even when the heat begins to dissipate on Monday, offshore winds forecast to hit Northern California will stoke the risk of more fires, likely forcing even more outages.Such is life in a changing climate: More extreme weather inciting more frequent blazes, and an electric grid struggling to cope with unprecedented heat. San Francisco on Sunday hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), smashing a prior record of 92 set in 1904, according to the National Weather Service. Los Angeles reached 111 and San Diego topped 100, also records.The California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid, credited consumers with averting what would have been the largest blackout in state history and the third round of rolling outages in less than a month. But for some Californians, dialing back their air conditioners won’t be enough to keep the lights on as wildfires rage across the state.Utility giant PG&E Corp. warned that more than 100,000 customers may go dark late Monday in parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Sierra Nevada foothills in a bid to keep its power lines from igniting fires. It’s the first time this fire season that PG&E has warned of shutoffs.Last year, when California’s utilities first began carrying out widespread blackouts like this, some homes and businesses were left in the dark for days. That drew outrage from state and local officials, triggered investigations and prompted PG&E to reassess the scope of future shutoffs.Years of deadly fires started by PG&E’s wires in wind storms forced California’s largest utility to declare bankruptcy last year. The company emerged in July after agreeing to pay $25.5 billion to settle wildfire lawsuits. The state has since set up a wildfire liabilities fund, essentially an insurance pool for the region’s utilities, but just one catastrophic blaze could wipe it out.Wreaking HavocThe latest blazes are already wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which has scorched 45,500 acres and is not contained, knocked out transmission from a hydro plant on Saturday. Another fire in Southern California cut off a solar farm, the California ISO said. Together, the blazes sucked 1.6 gigawatts from the power system, enough to power 1.2 million homes. While half of that had been re-connected by midday Sunday, another fire took out 500-600 megawatts.By Sunday evening, the heat had also taken down a 900-megawatt transmission line from Oregon, prompting the grid operator to call a Stage 2 emergency -- the last step before rolling blackouts. Southern California electricity prices briefly jumped to $1,164 a megawatt-hour while prices in Northern California surged to the highest level since January.Over the next two hours, officials called on consumers to turn off lights and appliances, to keep the grid from collapsing. It worked, but the ISO warned that it isn’t over yet.“Temperatures tomorrow will continue to be hot throughout the western U.S.,” the grid operator said in a statement. “The ISO is also monitoring numerous wildfires that may impact electrical lines.”Unprecedented HeatThe Department of Energy earlier Sunday issued an emergency order allowing several more power plants to produce as much electricity as possible over the next seven days, even if doing so would otherwise violate anti-pollution rules. At the ISO’s request, the agency said it was authorizing power plants in the City of Industry, El Segundo and Long Beach to run at their maximum output levels -- even though it may unleash additional air pollution. In a statement, agency spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said California policymakers should “evaluate why the grid is not able to handle extreme stress, which could be alleviated with the support of greater baseload power generation and natural gas supply.”One thing that has made California’s grid so vulnerable to soaring demand is the state’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes. The state’s utilities have commissioned large battery packs to pick up the slack, but most of the batteries haven’t been installed yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/californians-dodged-blackouts-but-wildfires-may-cut-power-anyway/story-Aue5YQosUo1kezz2CLPxvM.html
07-09-2020||World||Typhoon lashes South Korea after battering Japanese islands||A powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in South Korea on Monday after battering islands in southern Japan. More than 20 people were injured.The Korea Meteorological Administration warned of “very heavy rain and very strong winds” as Typhoon Haishen, packing maximum winds of 126 kilometers (78) miles per hour, made landfall in the southeastern port city of Ulsan. The weather agency said the typhoon, the third to hit the peninsula in as many weeks, was weakening and would likely be downgraded to a tropical storm within 24 hours.Cars struggled to navigate flooded roads in Ulsan and other coastal cities such as Busan, Sokcho and Gangneung. Emergency workers scrambled to clean up toppled trees and damaged traffic signs, buildings, and other structures. The Ministry of the Interior and Safety said a person in Busan was injured after a car flipped in strong winds, but it didn’t immediately provide further reports of casualties.At least 318 flights in and out of the southern island province of Jeju and across the mainland were canceled, according to the Korea Airports Corporation. Some bridges and railroad sections were shut down, thousands of fishing boats and other vessels were moved to safety, and more than 1,600 residents in the southern mainland regions were evacuated due to the possibility of landslides and other concerns.Workers as of Monday morning had restored power to 11,523 of the 17,620 households that had lost electricity in the southern mainland areas and Jeju.Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, plowed through Okinawa and other southern Japanese islands over the weekend. Traffic was still paralyzed in places, bullet trains were suspended and most domestic flights in and out of airports in southwestern Japan were canceled Monday.Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said at least 20 people, including two seriously, were injured. As of Monday morning, about half a million homes were still out of power.Regional officials in Miyazaki said rescue workers were looking for four people missing after a mudslide hit the mountainous village of Shiiba earlier Monday. A fifth person who was rescued at the site was seriously injured. NHK public television, citing its own tally, reported 37 injuries in the Kyushu region.The storm by late Monday was expected to reach North Korea’s northeastern region, which was battered by Typhoon Maysak last week, inflicting further pain on an economy ravaged by U.S.-led sanctions, border closures from the coronavirus pandemic and chronic food shortages.The North’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un visited typhoon-stricken areas, fired a top regional official for poor readiness, and promised to send 12,000 workers from Pyongyang to help with recovery efforts. The North said Maysak destroyed more than 1,000 houses and inundated public buildings and farmland. It didn’t immediately report any casualties caused by Haishen.Maysak damaged roads and buildings and left at least one person dead in South Korea. In addition, a livestock cargo ship sank off Japan’s coast as Maysak passed. Two of its 43 crew members were rescued and one body was recovered before the search was halted because of Haishen. The ship was transporting 5,800 cows from New Zealand to China.___Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-lashes-south-korea-after-battering-japanese-islands/story-sU6vI56sbHoxWdmY5WS4FP.html

07-09-2020||World||Germany raises pressure on Russia in Navalny poisoning probe||Germany on Sunday increased the pressure on Russia over the poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, warning that a lack of support by Moscow in the investigation could “force” Germany to rethink the fate of a German-Russian gas pipeline project.“I hope the Russians won’t force us to change our position regarding the Nord Stream 2” pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.Maas also said “if there won’t be any contributions from the Russian side regarding the investigation in the coming days, we will have to consult with our partners.” He did not exclude possible sanctions against Russia, telling the newspaper that such measures should be “pinpointed effectively.” However, Maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm German and European companies as well as Russia.“Whoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences,” he said. “More than 100 companies from 12 European countries are involved (in the construction), about half of them from Germany.” The German government has come under growing pressure to use the joint German-Russian pipeline project as leverage in getting Russia to provide answers on Navalny. The Nord Stream 2 project would deliver Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea when completed, bypassing Ukraine.Navalny, a Kremlin critic and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to Moscow on August 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk. He has been in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany for treatment on August 22.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Navalny’s poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics and called for a full investigation.German authorities say tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities previously identified the nerve agent, developed during the Soviet era, as the poison used to target former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018.“We have high expectations from the Russians to bring light into this severe crime,” Maas said. “If they have nothing to do with this attack, then it’s in their own interest to put the facts on the table.” France also added pressure on Sunday, suggesting the possibility of sanctions if Moscow fails to quickly respond to European demands for answers about Navalny’s poisoning.“It’s a serious situation. It’s serious firstly because it’s the poisoning of another opposition figure. And it’s serious because the substance that was used, Novichok, is banned,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking on France Inter radio.“(The Russians) must now tell us the truth so that we can act accordingly ... When we say quickly, it’s quickly, that’s to say a week, now. It’s a traumatizing event for everyone,” he said.Putin’s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and said last week that Germany hadn’t provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician’s condition.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova reiterated Moscow’s claim Sunday that Germany hadn’t provided any evidence since Russia requested it in late August.“Dear Mr. Maas, if the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is sincere in its statements, then it should itself be interested in preparing a response to the request of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia as soon as possible,” Zakharova wrote in a Facebook posting.Maas rejected that accusation later Sunday, saying Germany had long agreed to Russia’s request and had told the country’s ambassador to Berlin so last week.“There is no reason why we shouldn’t agree to this request and therefore this is another one of their smoke grenades — we have seen several of those during the last days and I’m afraid there will be more in coming days,” Maas told ARD public Television.Merkel personally offered the country’s assistance in treating Navalny. He’s now in stable condition at Berlin’s Charite hospital, but doctors expect a long recovery and haven’t ruled out that the 44-year-old could face long-term effects to his health from the poisoning.Merkel has previously rejected the idea that the Navalny case be linked to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.The US has long opposed the project, which has been increasingly a source of friction between Berlin and Washington. In August, three Republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a Baltic Sea port located in Merkel’s parliamentary constituency over its part in Nord Stream 2. The Mukran port is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction.The US argues the project will endanger European security by making Germany overly dependent on Russian gas. It’s also opposed by Ukraine and Poland, which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the Baltic, as well as some other European nations.In addition to the security concerns, the US also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-raises-pressure-on-russia-in-navalny-poisoning-probe/story-WJy8ReNuUPUhCkz4GzBdBL.html
07-09-2020||World||Johnson says UK will quit Brexit talks if no deal by Oct 15||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked tough on Sunday ahead of a crucial round of post-Brexit trade talks with the European Union, saying Britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insisting that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the UK”. With talks deadlocked, Johnson said an agreement would only be possible if EU negotiators are prepared to “rethink their current positions”. The EU, in turn, accuses Britain of failing to negotiate seriously. Britain left the now 27-nation EU on January 31, three-and-a-half years after the country narrowly voted to end more than four decades of membership. That political departure will be followed by an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on December 31 and the UK leaves the EU’s single market and customs union. Without a deal, the New Year will bring tariffs and other economic barriers between the UK and the bloc, its biggest trading partner. Johnson said the country would “prosper mightily” even if Britain had “a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s” -- the UK government’s preferred description of a no-deal Brexit. British chief negotiator David Frost and his counterpart Michel Barnier are due to meet in London starting Tuesday for the eighth round of negotiations. The key sticking points are European boats’ access to UK fishing waters and state aid to industries. The EU is determined to ensure a “level playing field” for competition so British firms can’t undercut the bloc’s environmental or workplace standards or pump public money into UK industries. Britain accuses the bloc of making demands that it has not imposed on other countries it has free trade deals with, such as Canada. Frost told the Mail on Sunday newspaper that Britain was “not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws.”. “We are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things,” he said. The EU says a deal has to be struck before November to allow time for parliamentary approval and legal vetting before the transition period expires. Johnson gave an even shorter deadline, saying an agreement needed to be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for October 15. “If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,” he said. Barnier said last week he was “worried and disappointed” by the lack of progress and said the UK had not “engaged constructively”. Without a deal, British freight firms have warned there could be logjams at ports and supplies of key goods in Britain could be “severely disrupted” starting January 1. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Sunday that talks were “not going well” and dismissed British attempts to drive a wedge between EU nations on issues such as fishing. Le Drian said the 27 nations remained united. “We would prefer a deal, but a deal on the basis of our mandate,” he told France Inter radio. “There is room for action, but the whole package, including the fishing package, needs to be taken up in order to avoid a ‘no deal.’“ (AP) HMB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-says-uk-will-quit-brexit-talks-if-no-deal-by-oct-15/story-m7Pk5fYrgGIXdTfySz8cGK.html
07-09-2020||World||Record-breaking heat may cut power to 9 million Californians||As many as 9 million Californians could lose power Sunday evening as record-breaking heat taxes the electric grid and rampant wildfires knock out power plants and transmission lines.The blazes have already cut electricity to more than 60,000 customers, most of them in Los Angeles, San Diego and Fresno counties -- in some cases for as long as 36 hours. The real test will come after 5 p.m. when electricity demand is forecast to peak and the state’s solar production begins to wane. Without significant conservation, rolling blackouts will begin, plunging scores of people into darkness for the third time in less than a month.“Today is sizing up to be the most challenging day of the year,” said Eric Schmitt, vice president of operations at the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid.The crisis comes just three weeks after an August heat wave triggered California’s first rotating blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis and fueled hundreds of wildfires across the state. As climate change contributes to more extreme weather, the region’s heat, wildfire and blackout woes are only getting worse.Unprecedented heatThe heat gripping the state is unprecedented. San Francisco hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) Sunday, smashing a prior record of 92 set in 1904, according to the National Weather Service. Los Angeles reached 111 and San Diego topped 100, also records.“Temperatures during this current heat storm are expected to peak today, pushing demand for energy beyond levels of available supply,” the California ISO said in a statement Sunday. “There is currently not a sufficient supply of energy to meet the high amounts of demand during the heatwave.”With the state predicting a massive, 4-gigawatt electricity shortfall starting Sunday evening, the Department of Energy on Sunday issued an emergency order allowing several more power plants to produce as much electricity as possible over the next seven days, even if doing so would otherwise violate anti-pollution rules.In the meantime, wildfires are wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire yesterday knocked out transmission from a hydro plant, while a fire in Southern California cut off a solar farm, the California ISO said. Together, the blazes sucked 1.6 gigawatts from the power system, enough to power 1.2 million homes.About half of that had been re-connected by midday Sunday -- and then another fire in Southern California cut out 500-600 megawatts.Wholesale electricity prices in the southern part of the state spiked to the highest level in nearly a year, diverging sharply from prices in Northern California.At the state grid operator’s request, the Energy Department said it was authorizing power plants in the City of Industry, El Segundo and Long Beach to run at their maximum output levels -- even though it may unleash additional air pollution. In a statement, agency spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said California policymakers should “evaluate why the grid is not able to handle extreme stress, which could be alleviated with the support of greater baseload power generation and natural gas supply.”One thing that has made California’s grid so vulnerable to soaring demand is the state’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes. The state’s utilities have commissioned large battery packs to pick up the slack, but most of the batteries haven’t been installed yet.Shut-offsThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported Sunday that some of those who lost power could be without it for 36 hours. Some of LADWP’s equipment was running at 200% of capacity due to the extreme demand for power, and the high night-time temperatures weren’t letting the gear cool off.Utility giant PG&E Corp. which powers much of Northern and Central California, warned on Saturday that it may decide to cut power to about 103,000 customers in parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Sierra Nevada foothills starting late Monday to keep its power lines from igniting fires. Hot, dry winds are forecast to blow across the region, threatening to knock tree limbs into power lines.This is the first time PG&E has warned of shutoffs during this year’s fire season. Last year, when California’s utilities first began carrying out widespread blackouts like this, some homes and businesses were left in the dark for days. That drew outrage from state and local officials, triggered investigations and prompted PG&E to reassess the scope of future shutoffs.The utility’s weather models show that warm, offshore winds will develop Monday evening on the heels of the heat wave. The soaring temperatures will further dry out grass, bushes and other vegetation, PG&E said.Years of deadly fires started by PG&E’s wires in wind storms forced California’s largest utility to declare bankruptcy last year.

The state has since set up a wildfire liabilities fund, essentially an insurance pool for the region’s utilities, but just one catastrophic blaze could wipe it out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-breaking-heat-may-cut-power-to-9-million-californians/story-oYZi76ShetjXEceY3jJuXP.html

At least 100 people were detained, the Russian news agency Interfax quoted the government as saying, while the human rights group Spring-96 put the figure at more than 200. Local media also showed protests and detentions in other cities.A witness said the harsh treatment of the protesters appeared to mark an escalation by the authorities after weeks of comparative restraint, although the violence was not as widespread and indiscriminate as in the protests’ first days.Footage from local media outlet TUT.BY showed a masked man beating a protester as he lay on the ground. Plain clothes officers could be seen smashing the glass door of a cafe to get at protesters sheltering inside. “We ran into a cafe to hide from the riot police, they broke the glass, burst inside, pulled out three people, beat at least one,” Evgeny, a 28-year-old protester, said while waiters cleaned up the smashed glass.Jumping into the riverA witness described helmeted security forces and men in plain clothes detaining at least two dozen protesters near President Alexander Lukashenko’s residence, and beating and kicking another man as he lay on the ground.Some protesters left chanting “we’ll be back”.An ambulance arrived at another cafe, where another witness said a man had been beaten by men with truncheons and could only walk with difficulty.TUT.BY described people jumping into the Svislach River to escape the police in Minsk. Protests also took place outside the capital. In the city of Brest near the Polish border, video footage from TUT.BY showed women shouting “shame” at masked members of the security forces who dragged people away. Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces.“They talk about the brutality of the Belarusian police, and I want to say this: there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world,” he said, according to the official Belta news agency.Lukashenko, in power since 1994, denies electoral fraud. Buoyed by a show of support from traditional ally Russia, he has rejected calls for new elections.Demonstrations have carried on throughout the four weeks since the election, gaining in size on the weekends and drawing tens of thousands of people each Sunday. Western countries have had to balance sympathy with the Belarusian pro-democracy movement against a desire not to provoke Moscow. The crisis has tested European resolve at a moment when countries are also weighing how to respond to the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.In an interview published in the Financial Times on Sunday, Lithuania’s foreign minister urged the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus and counter Russia’s influence or risk undermining the credibility of its foreign policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-detained-as-security-forces-crack-down-on-mass-protest-in-belarus/story-wsFaqGre2sJQ3bZ3IkDEoK.html
07-09-2020||World||Trump on defensive as critics seize on reports he insulted US veterans||President Donald Trump was on the defensive on Sunday over his attitude toward the US military following media reports that he had disparaged fallen veterans, which could harm his campaign for re-election on Nov. 3. Democratic and Republican opponents alike over the weekend seized on the reports - which said that Trump had called US soldiers buried in Europe “losers” - to attack his record on the military on news shows and in political ads.“It breaks your heart,” US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the reported comments in an interview on MSNBC on Sunday.Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, a Republican, told ABC’s “This Week” that the remarks, if true, were “despicable.” Hagel said the reports were “credible” because they were consistent with previous public remarks Trump had made denigrating military personnel, including former US Defense Secretary James Mattis.“It will resonate” with the military, he added.Retired US Army Colonel Jeff McCausland, a former National Security Council official, wrote in an op-ed for NBC News on Sunday that Trump over the years had demonstrated “a clear pattern of disrespect toward the military.”The furor over the Sept. 3 report in The Atlantic could dent support for Trump among service members, a key constituency for the Republican which largely backed him in 2016.The Atlantic reported that Trump made the disparaging remarks after canceling a visit to an American cemetery during a November 2018 trip to France, an account the president denied on Thursday and on Sunday said was “disinformation.”“They will say anything, like their recent lies about me and the Military, and hope that it sticks,” he tweeted, referring to the media and the Democratic Party, whose nominee Joe Biden is vying for the presidency in November.The Atlantic has stood by its report, which cited four unnamed people with firsthand knowledge of the matter and which was later confirmed by several other media outlets. Bloomberg on Sunday reported that Trump spent the extra free time in Paris selecting artwork to ship from the US ambassador’s residence to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Bloomberg report.Former Vice President Biden, whose late son Beau served in Iraq, on Sunday capitalized upon the uproar to highlight his own record of military support with a advertisement aimed at areas with large numbers of military personnel in battleground states. The ad will air nationwide on Sunday night during cable television news programs and on Facebook and Instagram throughout the week as part of a broader $47 million campaign, a spokesman told Reuters on Sunday.The Lincoln Project, a prominent Republican-backed group opposing Trump’s re-election, on Saturday released a new video attacking the president’s comments and broader record on the military. Trump has never served and avoided the draft for the Vietnam war citing bone spurs in his feet. “He’s a draft-dodger in chief who despises the men and women he supposedly leads. He insults their deaths and injuries with his contempt,” it said.Military spendingTrump has repeatedly touted his administration’s spending on the military while also moving to pull American troops out of conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, as well as out of allied countries such as Germany. More recently, he has said he would block the Pentagon’s plan to cut military healthcare by $2.2 billion and reverse its plan to close the Stars and Stripes military newspaper.Nevertheless, a Military Times poll of roughly 1,000 active-duty service members taken late July to early August and published last week, before the latest reports, showed waning military support for Trump and a slight preference for Biden. Several top administration officials, including US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, have rallied to Trump’s defense as the controversy has grown in recent days.On Sunday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he had never heard the president disparage the military or veterans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House that Trump supported the military “100%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-on-defensive-as-critics-seize-on-reports-he-insulted-us-veterans/story-oeUmhph85JtBHPXOTOD2IP.html

At 12:45 a.m. (1545 GMT on Sunday) on Monday its centre was in the East China Sea, about 110 km (68 miles) southeast of the Goto Islands, west of Nagasaki, according to Japan’s meteorological agency.“This typhoon is headed toward and may potentially make landfall in Kyushu, bringing record rains, winds, waves and high tides,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a meeting with cabinet ministers earlier. “I am asking that people exercise the utmost caution.” The storm was forecast to carry top sustained winds of up to 216 km per hour (134 mph) by Monday, the meteorological agency said. Authorities urged evacuations for people in areas across seven prefectures in southern Japan, public broadcaster NHK said, an effort that was complicated by social distancing that meant evacuation centres could take fewer people than normal.Trees on Yakushima, an island 100 km (60 miles) south of Kagoshima city, could be seen shaking violently in strong winds and driving rain, in a post on Twitter.Elderly citizens wearing face masks due to the coronavirus outbreak were gathering at evacuation centres in Kagoshima and other parts of southern Japan, footage on NHK showed.The typhoon has cut power to some 180,000 homes, NHK said adding that public transport services were all stopped in the affected prefectures.Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said two injuries had been reported.Heading for Korean PeninsulaThe typhoon was headed north by northwest at 30 kph, the meteorological agency said, forecast to approach the Goto Islands west of Nagasaki around 3 a.m. on Monday (1800 GMT on Sunday) and then move to the Korean peninsula. One evacuation centre in Miyazaki reached capacity and stopped accepting evacuees as a precaution against the coronavirus, according to NHK.Airlines have cancelled more than 500 flights departing from Okinawa and southern Japan, NHK said. Bullet train service in southern and western Japan was suspended, it said.Japan’s coastguard on Saturday suspended for a second day its search for crew missing from a ship that capsized in the East China Sea last week with a cargo of cattle. Typhoon Haishen follows Typhoon Maysak, which smashed into the Korean peninsula on Thursday, leaving at least two dead and thousands temporarily without power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-without-power-as-typhoon-haishen-batters-japan/story-Ai8EJVJvHpszygyIz0idlK.html
07-09-2020||World||UK urges probe into ‘pure gangsterism’ Navalny poisoning||UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Russia has a “case to answer” over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny given its “track record,” and called for the Kremlin’s cooperation with an international investigation.Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Raab said that while it’s too early to attribute blame, “it’s very difficult to come up with a plausible alternative explanation” other than Russia’s involvement.“The use of chemical weapons in this kind of context is pure gangsterism and Russia does have responsibility never to use it as a government, and second of all to make sure no-one else can use it within its territory,” Raab said, calling for a probe via the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. “Russia needs to cooperate fully.”Raab pledged to work with allies including Germany on a response to the poisoning, which has special resonance in the U.K. because military-grade novichok -- which Germany has said “unequivocally” was used on Navalny -- is the same nerve agent that was deployed in the attempted murder in 2018 of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil.That was the first use of chemical weapons in Europe since World War II and triggered a diplomatic showdown when the U.K. pointed the finger directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering the attack, which inadvertently killed a British woman.WarningRaab’s comments come after his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, warned Russia that Germany’s support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was at risk if the Kremlin doesn’t assist in clarifying Navalny’s poisoning. Sanctions could be imposed on Russia unless it provides clarification in the “next few days,” he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.But the British foreign secretary said for now, the U.K.’s focus is on an investigation because the use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law. Russia “can’t just say ‘this is a domestic issue, it is just our internal affairs,’” Raab said.Speaking earlier to the BBC, Navalny’s chief of staff urged Western countries to respond by targeting Russian financial assets.“The only way to make it painful for them is of course to start taking measures against their assets,” Leonid Volkov said. “They have enormous assets in the west.”(Updates with Volkov comment in penultimate paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-probe-into-pure-gangsterism-navalny-poisoning/story-m3FmwThNvOQ4ViFoslZEmN.html
