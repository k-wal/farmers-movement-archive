Those numbers represent declines from last year’s highs, when more than a quarter of high-school students and about 1 out of 10 middle-school students reported using e-cigarettes.“Although the decline in e-cigarette use among our nation’s youth is a notable public health achievement, our work is far from over,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement. About 3.6 million youths reported using e-cigarettes within the prior 30 days, down from 5.4 million in the 2019 survey.The influential survey has shaped the debate around e-cigarettes in recent years. While billed as a possibly less harmful alternative for the millions of adults who smoke cigarettes, the high rate of teen vaping has cast doubt on whether the products should be available at all.The FDA will soon determine which e-cigarettes can stay on the US market and which must come off. Wednesday is the deadline for applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenagers-e-cigarette-use-declined-in-2020-us-survey-shows/story-rByAqKX5cYghuqXQFXnoxM.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump told Bob Woodward he intentionally downplayed coronavirus risks||President Donald Trump told journalist Bob Woodward that he intentionally downplayed the severity of the coronavirus in public comments to avoid triggering a panic.“I wanted to always play it down, I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,” Trump told Woodward, the author and associate editor for the Washington Post, on March 19 in one of a series of interviews for his book, “Rage,” due for publication this month. CNN published audio recordings of excerpts of the conversations on Wednesday.Trump told Woodward on February 7 that the virus was transmitted through the air -- even as Trump said publicly it was no worse than the seasonal flu and would quickly go away.“It goes through air, Bob, that’s always tougher than the touch,” he said. “The air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”He also told Woodward it was more deadly “than even your strenuous flus.”That same day, Trump had tweeted praise for Chinese president Xi Jinping for his handling of the pandemic.Woodward’s book says Trump was warned by National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien in an Jan. 28 meeting that the virus “will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” according to a Washington Post report on the book.“This is going to be the roughest thing you face,” O’Brien said, according to Woodward, who wrote that Trump’s head popped up at the dire warning. Trump told Woodward in May that he didn’t remember being told that.Trump restricted travel from China shortly after. “The risk of infection for Americans remains low,” his health secretary, Alex Azar, said on Jan. 31.The book is based on 18 interviews that Trump gave Woodward between December and July, the Post reported. It also is based on background conversations with officials and other sources.The book comes as Trump trails Democrat Joe Biden in polls, with surveys showing Americans are displeased with Trump’s handling with the virus. Trump has sought to shift blame over the pandemic, which has killed more than 189,000 Americans, regularly calling it the “China Virus.”On Wednesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump never lied or mislead the public. “We want to keep the country calm, that’s what leaders do,” McEnany told reporters at the White House. “The president never downplayed the virus.”Woodward reports that top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said the White House has “rudderless” leadership, and criticized Trump.“His attention span is like a minus number,” Fauci said, according to the Post’s account of Woodward’s book. “His sole purpose is to get re-elected.”On Wednesday, McEnany quoted Fauci praising Trump over the virus. “There’s a litany of praise,” McEnany said.The book said Trump’s former Defense Secretary James Mattis referred to the president as having “no moral compass” and that he is “unfit” for office.According to the Post account of the book, former intelligence director Dan Coats told Mattis that, to Trump, “a lie is not a lie. It’s just what he thinks.”Trump also criticized top military leaders, according to the Post account of the book.“Not to mention my f-----g generals are a bunch of p-----s. They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals,” Trump told one adviser, according to the Post account.Trump has been under fire for a week after a report by the The Atlantic that he made disparaging comments about American Marines killed in World War I and questioned the value of military service. The White House has disputed parts of that report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-told-bob-woodward-he-intentionally-downplayed-coronavirus-risks/story-TpG7JyjhsAxuvPXd6zxPxM.html
09-09-2020||World||In pictures: Explosive wildfires across California stoked by fierce winds||Wildfires raged unchecked across parts of the western U.S. on Wednesday amid gusty and dry conditions, but forecasters said some weather relief was in sight that could help firefighters overwhelmed by the blazes.In California, winds stoked unprecedented numbers of fires that have forced rescues and evacuations. In Washington, more acres burned in a single day than firefighters usually see all year. Fires also forced people to flee in Oregon and Idaho.A temperature plunge of as much as 60 degrees (15 Celsius), caused by a dramatic intrusion of polar air, helped slow wildfires that spread in Colorado and Montana.“The significantly colder airmass is helping reduce critical fire conditions across the West, however most of West coastline and adjacent counties have Red Flag warnings in effect for part of today,” the National Weather Service said. A warning is issued when conditions combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger.Diminishing winds were possible by Thursday, “bringing some relief to the ongoing fires and fire weather threat,” forecasters said.A massive cloud of smoke covered much of California on Wednesday, dimming the sun to an eerie orange glow over San Francisco.About 125 miles (200 kilometers) to the northeast, winds fanned a huge fire in the Sierra Nevada foothills and forced authorities to order early morning evacuations and warn other residents to be ready to leave.The area is not far from the town of Paradise, where 85 people were killed by a fire two years ago, and Oroville Dam, where failing spillways forced a massive evacuation in 2017.On Tuesday, flames overtook 14 firefighters who had to delploy last-resort emergency shelters and destroyed a fire station in Los Padres National Forest on California’s central coast. They suffered burns and smoke inhalation, and three were flown to a hospital in Fresno, where one was in critical condition, the U.S. Forest Service said.Helicopters have been used in recent days to rescue hundreds of people stranded in the burning Sierra National Forest, where a fire has destroyed 365 buildings, including at least 45 homes. About 5,000 buildings were threatened, fire officials said.Flames threatened the foothill community of Auberry between Shaver Lake and Fresno.In Southern California, fires burned in the mountains of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties, with the potential for the region’s notorious Santa Ana winds to push flames out of wilderness and into communities.People in a half-dozen foothill communities east of Los Angeles were being told to stay alert because of a fire in the Angeles National Forest.“The combination of gusty winds, very dry air, and dry vegetation will create critical fire danger,” the National Weather Service warned.The U.S. Forest Service on Monday closed all eight national forests in the southern half of the state and shutter campgrounds statewide.More than 14,000 firefighters are battling fires in California Two of the three largest blazes in state history are burning in the San Francisco Bay Area, though they are largely contained after burning for three weeks.The state has set a record with nearly 2.3 million acres (930,800 hectares) burned this year and the worst part of the wildfire season is only beginning.“It’s extraordinary, the challenge that we’ve faced so far this season,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said.The threat of winds tearing down power lines or hurling debris into them and sparking a wildfire prompted Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest utility, to shut off power to 172,000 customers in Northern California. More outages were expected Wednesday, with power not expected to be completely restored until Wednesday night.The Southern California Edison utility warned that about 55,000 customer accounts may lose power while San Diego Gas & Electric said 16,700 customers were at risk of a preemptive outage.In the Sierra National Forest east of Fresno, dozens of campers and hikers were stranded at the Vermilion Valley Resort after the only road in — a narrow route snaking along a steep cliff — was closed Sunday because of the so-called Creek Fire.“This is emblematic of how fast that fire was moving, plus the physical geography of that environment with one road in and one road out,” said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College, said of the helicopter rescues. “Unless you wanted an absolute human disaster, you had to move fast.”Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires to global warming. “The frequency of extreme wild fire weather has doubled in California over the past four decades, with the main driver being the effect of rising temperature on dry fuels, meaning that the fuel loads are now frequently at record or near-record levels when ignition occurs and when strong winds blow,” Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pictures-explosive-wildfires-across-california-stoked-by-fierce-winds/story-kY4TcWslm7N0OPlwEejGbI.html

09-09-2020||World||Missing Pak official who ‘helped’ in report on PM’s aide reappears||A Pakistani government official, who is suspected to have helped journalists in writing a story about the rise to riches of a top general and key aide to Prime Minister Imran Khan, has returned home after unknown abductors freed him on the outskirts of Islamabad, officials and the man said.Sajid Gondal, a joint director at Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, returned home on Tuesday evening, five days after he went missing.According to his colleagues, Gondal, a former reporter with Dawn newspaper, was investigating Lt Gen (retd) Saleem Bajwa, the chairman of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority and information aide to Prime Minister Khan.Bajwa resigned last week as special assistant to the prime minister on information and broadcasting, but Khan rejected the resignation. Bajwa’s move came after a report alleged that he had used his offices to help his family set up several offshore businesses. Bajwa, who also served as Commander of the Southern Command, rejected the allegations, and said he would continue to head CPEC Authority. It was unclear who held Gondal for five days, though his family and friends speculated he was in the custody of one of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies, which work largely outside the control of the government.“I am back and safe, and I am thankful to all friends who were worried for me,” tweeted Gondal, who had gone missing while visiting a family-owned farm. His car was found abandoned on a road on the outskirts of Islamabad.Gondal was freed after his relatives rallied in Islamabad amid growing pressure on social media for his release.On Saturday, the Islamabad High Court had ordered authorities to trace Gondal by Monday, while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by his mother Asmat Bibi.The court also forwarded a copy of the order to the cabinet division secretary. “The abduction of a citizen from the federal capital is extremely alarming,” Chief Justice Athar Minallah remarked.Federal information and broadcasting minister Shibli Faraz said Prime Minister Imran Khan was concerned about Gondal’s abduction in Islamabad.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-pak-official-who-helped-in-report-on-pm-s-aide-reappears/story-SLEqiTeEmUUKYdWlesQ1xH.html
09-09-2020||World||Chinese state media admits military deployment along India border||China has deployed bombers, armoured vehicles and heavy artillery besides special forces as well as infantry units along the border with India, state media reports said on Wednesday, in a rare acknowledgment of what seems like a massive mobilisation of troops and equipment along the disputed boundary.Usually, official media highlights exercises in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) to demonstrate its military might along the border with India like it did last August, and repeatedly during the Doklam (Donglang) standoff in 2017.The more blatant show of military power – including sorties by Chinese fighter jets close to the border – is reserved for Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing considers to be a renegade region which it wants to unify with the mainland, by force if necessary.The words ‘deployment’ or ‘mobilisation’ are seldom used in the context of the border with India.State-run nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a report on Wednesday that “bombers, air defence troops, artillery, armoured vehicles, paratroopers, special forces and infantry units” have been mobilised from across the country at the border. “H-6 bombers and Y-20 large transport aircraft attached to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Central Theatre Command Air Force have been deployed to the Tibetan plateau region for training missions, the command revealed on Tuesday, the Global Times report said.A report in national broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) said HJ-10 anti-tank missile systems attached to the PLA 71st Group Army were recently transported from east China’s Jiangsu province to northwest China’s Gobi desert, which is more than 1,600 km away.For the PLA, it would be easier to dispatch troops and equipment to the northwest from the Gobi desert region. “An air defence brigade under the PLA 72nd Group Army also mobilised to the Northwest region in autumn and held live-fire confrontational drills with anti-aircraft guns and missiles,” CCTV reported on Friday.A separate CCTV report said paratroopers and heavy equipment on board the PLA Air Force’s transport aircraft recently conducted a multidimensional area capture and control exercise, also in the deserts of northwest China.The news reports did not specify since when the troops were being mobilised from different parts of China to the border. But they attributed the movement of troops and equipment to the ongoing boundary tension in eastern Ladakh. The reports added that soldiers, guns and aircraft were moved near the border areas not only from different parts of China but also different theatre commands.The Sino-India border area falls under the Western Theatre Command (WAC) of the PLA – the largest among its five theatres of command that covers the mainland’s geography.Several troop divisions deployed in northwest China’s desert areas in Xinjiang and southwest China’s TAR have been ordered to carry out live-fire drills and complex military maneuvres.Chinese military experts whom HT reached out to did not comment on the deployment.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-state-media-admits-military-deployment-along-india-border/story-3Vtg5Er2dLtZx7TUEDMbVL.html

The country also recorded 6 new coronavirus-linked deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the toll to 312, said Dr Jageshwar Gautam, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Population. Gautam said 1,081 new cases of Covid-19 were detected while carrying out 11,167 tests at various labs across the country. He said a total of 918 persons, who earlier tested positive for the virus, were discharged after they fully recovered from the disease. Kathmandu Valley has recorded 464 new cases of Covid-19, taking its tally to 9,440 as of Wednesday, the official said. “With this, the number of Covid-19 infected people discharged after full recovery has reached 33,882,” he said. There are currently 15,025 active cases of coronavirus at various isolation centres. With six new Covid-19 deaths reported on Wednesday, the country’s coronavirus death toll has reached 312, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-coronavirus-cases-near-50-000/story-wa2J5bWeIkNuBvsKrTbhcP.html
09-09-2020||World||Scientists, drugmakers and traders react to AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trial pause||AstraZeneca has paused global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after an unexplained illness in a participant, denting the British drugmaker’s shares as the move was seen as dimming prospects for an early roll out.“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials,” AstraZeneca said in an emailed statement.Below are reactions from scientists, drugmakers and stock market traders and analysts to the news:SCIENTISTS: Ian Jones, Professor of Virology at the University of Reading:“An inevitable consequence of testing a vaccine on large numbers of people is that some will naturally fall ill of other causes during the trial.We must wait and see what the investigation in this case shows but at the moment, I think unfortunate more than sinister would be the best description of the halt.”Charlie Weller, Head of Vaccines Programme at Wellcome:“Safety is the most important consideration when developing any vaccine, and it is right for the trial to be paused while an investigation takes place. This is often a normal part of the process in vaccine trials, which involve tens of thousands of people. It’s critical to quickly understand whether the illness has any relationship to the vaccine or the placebo and to share data openly, as Oxford University and AstraZeneca have done. “Vaccines are among the most rigorously tested and monitored products we have in society, and the COVID-19 vaccines should be no different.”James Gill, Honorary Clinical Lecturer, Warwick Medical School, and Locum GP, said:“During the development of any drug, people will develop side effects – hence we know ibuprofen can cause heart burn. People will also fall ill during the natural course of their lives whilst they have taken the vaccine. We know that the flu vaccine doesn’t cause flu, but some people can be unlucky and catch a bug around the time they are inoculated.Personally, I would be suspicious of a vaccine for a novel virus which was developed without any hiccoughs or pauses.Science on TV is great, and usually gets completed in the course of an episode. In a real lab, chemistry, patients and biology don’t often follow a nice simple course, which is why from the start scientists have said that this COVID vaccine development will take considerable time to get right and safe.”Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine:“We do not know what event has occurred, but given that in the UK those aged over 70 have been included in the trials, coincidental events are to be expected.Very occasionally, what might be expected in an older person, such as a stroke (and this is certainly not a suggestion that it is such an event that has happened here), can occur in a young person.“This very incident shows that the Oxford trial, and any other trials conducted in the UK, are monitored very carefully and precautions are taken to protect both the trial participants and those who might get the vaccine in the future.It is premature to speculate on whether the vaccine caused the adverse event, and even if it eventually is concluded that it is possible the vaccine was the cause, there may be other factors involved and it would not necessarily mean the vaccine could not be used at all.”COMPANIES:Germany’s Leukocare is working with Italy’s ReiThera and Belgium’s Univercells on a monkey adenovirus-based vaccine that is in early testing on humans.CEO Michael Scholl said a clinical trial halt was not unusual:“When you are inoculating 20,000 people, it is a foregone conclusion that at some point you will have severe adverse events. As soon as a link to the vaccine can clearly be ruled out, the trial continues.”He added that something as common as a heart attack could halt a vaccine trial, though he cautioned that any immune-related condition such as an inflammation would be subject to particular scrutiny.Moderna said it was “not aware of any impact” to its ongoing Covid-19 vaccine study at this time.Serum Institute of India (SII):“We can’t comment much on the UK trials, but they have been paused for further review and they hope to restart soon. As far as Indian trials are concerned, it is continuing and we have faced no issues at all.”TRADERS AND ANALYSTS:AstraZeneca’s shares in London fell more than 3% at the open on the news. The FTSE-100 listed stock was down 1.5% at 0943 GMT.Mirabaud trader Mark Taylor:“These headlines will be set back, but it is not an unusual step in the process. The only unusual bit is the amount of attention being drawn to it.“This dents the vaccine hope trade, which had become elevated and has been a major driver in some of the factor style rotation seen lately.”Neil Wilson at Markets.com:“Such are the problems with pinning hopes on a vaccine for a return to normal to be possible. The worry is that while we have all kind of assumed that one company will come up with a vaccine later this year, it’s not going to be plain sailing.”Citi analysts:“The risk of material potentially vaccine-related serious adverse event in one of the multiple large Covid-19 trials was always a high probability event.”“(The) development may negatively impact timelines for other Covid-19 vaccine sponsors. While AstraZeneca’s current share price is discounting little economic value from Covid-19, we expect an initial negative stock and broader market reaction today in response to the news.” UBS:“Even if the vaccine was to work, tolerability may be its Achilles heel and bigger picture, longer term safety of all vaccine candidates will remain an open question even if we get efficacy data later this year/early next.For those that think the Oxford/AZN collaboration is a stepping stone into becoming a vaccine player, we remind investors AZN has repeatedly said that its involvement in the development of a SARS-Cov2 vaccine is not a commercial venture.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-drugmakers-and-traders-react-to-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-pause/story-JOpEIzJdJyCXgFjNnuuHOP.html
09-09-2020||World||China’s biggest airshow cancelled for first time over pandemic||China has called off its biennial airshow due to the coronavirus, a further blow to a global aviation industry heavily disrupted by the pandemic.The show, scheduled to take place in the southern coastal city of Zhuhai from November 10, was set to feature major companies such as Boeing.But China remains closed off to most international travellers due to tight restrictions to stop a resurgence of the coronavirus, which first surfaced in the central city of Wuhan before spreading across the globe.The event takes place every two years and is China’s main aerospace industry exhibition, with products, trade talks and a flying display.It has been a platform for Beijing to show off military equipment and technology such as stealth drones, as well as to unveil a replica of China’s first permanently crewed space station.While Asia’s biggest air show in Singapore went ahead in February -- with measures in place to guard against the deadly pathogen -- over 70 exhibitors including industry giant Lockheed Martin chose to skip the show.This year global air travel has been decimated as countries close borders and tourists stay home.Qatar Airways said in June it will not take any new aircraft in 2020 or 2021, deferring orders with Boeing and Airbus as demand diminishes amid the coronavirus crisis.The virus has also led to the cancellation or postponement of major events including the Olympic Games in Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-biggest-airshow-cancelled-for-first-time-over-pandemic/story-Ue7RmTibKX8zfs8AVIMOZM.html

Officials in the U.S.-led coalition say Iraqi forces are now mostly able to handle the remnants of Islamic State on their own.“We are continuing to expand on our partner capacity programs that enable Iraqi forces and allow us to reduce our footprint in Iraq,” Marine General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Iraq.A senior administration official had said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump would be announcing a reduction of U.S. troops from Iraq.The United States and Iraq in June affirmed their commitment to the reduction of U.S. troops in the country in coming months, with no plans by Washington to maintain permanent bases or a permanent military presence.In 2016 Trump campaigned on ending America’s “endless wars,” but U.S. troops remain in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, albeit in smaller numbers.Last month during a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, Trump redoubled his promise to withdraw the U.S. troops still in Iraq.Trump’s meeting with the Iraqi leader came amid a new spike in tensions between Washington and Tehran after Washington said it would seek to reinstate all previously suspended U.S. sanctions on Iran at the United Nations.Iraq’s parliament had voted earlier this year for the departure of foreign troops from Iraq, and United States and other coalition troops have been leaving as part of a drawdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-announce-us-troop-withdrawals-from-iraq-afghanistan/story-MYyDbosxEb2EKEVqQYk37H.html
09-09-2020||World||Pope uses mask, sanitiser as he appeals for public health||Pope Francis wore a face mask and used hand sanitiser Wednesday as he appealed for the faithful to look out for the health of others as well as themselves during the coronavirus pandemic.Francis took off the mask as his car pulled into the San Damaso courtyard inside the Apostolic Palace, where last week he resumed his weekly public audiences after a nearly six-month Covid-19 shutdown.While chairs were spaced out in the courtyard, the limited crowd massed along the barriers as Francis passed by and some lowered their masks to call out to him. The 83-year-old pope, who lost part of one lung to illness when he was young, loves plunging into crowds but tried to keep his distance and urged the crowd to stick to their seats to avoid contagion.An aide squirted some hand sanitizer in Francis’ hands after he greeted the well-wishers and before he approached his cleric translators on the podium. It was the first time the pope has been seen in public wearing a mask and using hand sanitiser.During his remarks, Francis lamented that “partisan interests” were emerging in which some nations and groups are seeking to keep vaccines for themselves, or to further their own political or economic interests.“The coronavirus is showing us that each person’s true good is a common good and, vice versa, the common good is a true good for the person,” he said. “Health, in addition to being an individual good, is also a public good. A healthy society is one that takes care of everyone’s health.” Francis is expected to elaborate on the need for the world to seek out the common good after the pandemic in an upcoming encyclical that he will sign next month during a private visit to Assisi, birthplace of his namesake, St. Francis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-uses-mask-sanitiser-as-he-appeals-for-public-health/story-tGc27YNnNp15fBltbIKE7J.html
09-09-2020||World||Build-up of greenhouse gases hits new record despite lockdowns: UN report||Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere hit a record high this year, a United Nations report showed on Wednesday, as an economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic had little long-term effect. The sharp, but short, dip in emissions earlier this year represented only a blip in the build-up of climate-warming carbon dioxide. “Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise,” said Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, a UN agency based in Geneva.While daily emissions fell in April to just 17% relative to the previous year, those levels were still on a par with 2006 emissions – underlining how much global emissions have grown over the last 15 years.And by early June, as factories and offices reopened, emissions were back up to within 5% of 2019 levels, according to the report by several UN agencies.Even if 2020 emissions are lower than last year’s output by up to 7%, as expected, what is released will still contribute to the long-term concentration built up since the beginning of the industrial era.Presenting the latest data on emissions, global temperatures and climate impacts on Earth’s oceans and frozen regions, the report showed that atmospheric concentration of CO2 hit 414.38 parts per million in July, compared with 411.74 ppm a year earlier. Scientists say they consider 350 ppm, breached in 1988, a safe limit.As CO2 levels have increased, global temperatures have also risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Scientists say a temperature rise beyond 1.5 or 2 degrees will lead to far worse impacts from climate change across the world, including droughts, stronger storms and extreme sea level rise.“We are really only adapted and able to deal with a very small range of possible weather,” Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, told Reuters. “Even if this is just perturbed a little bit, we come very quickly to the edges of what we as societies can deal with.”The report detailed how climate change is expected to put hundreds of millions more people at risk of flooding. Access to fresh water is also projected to worsen.The number of people living in water-scarce areas by mid-century is now estimated to reach up to 3.2 billion, up from the previous estimate of about 1.9 billion.“It is those who are the most vulnerable in society who are hit fit first,” Otto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/build-up-of-greenhouse-gases-hits-new-record-despite-lockdowns-un-report/story-9cH6ax65g0soXwvk8XQmyN.html
09-09-2020||World||Amid border clashes, Jaishankar to meet foreign ministers of China, Russia||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will have a luncheon meeting with his Chinese and Russian counterparts on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) council of foreign ministers’ summit in Moscow, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday.The ministry said Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi will also have bilateral meetings with counterparts from other SCO member states, but did not say anything specific about a one-on-one with Jaishankar.The Russia-India-China (RIC) meeting between Jaishankar, Wang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov is likely to be held on Thursday. The meeting is significant as it comes in the wake of escalating tensions at multiples points along the disputed boundary between India and China in eastern Ladakh.Jaishankar is already in Moscow for the two-day meeting of foreign ministers, which began on Wednesday.“During this (SCO) meeting, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi will discuss with foreign ministers of other member states of the SCO, cooperation amid Covid-19 and exchange views on major international and regional issues,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular briefing.Wang “will also hold bilateral meetings with relevant member states and attend a luncheon for Chinese, Russian and Indian foreign ministers,” Zhao added.When specifically asked about a bilateral meeting between Jaishankar and Wang, Zhao said: “Like I said, I talked about state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit, and regarding the bilateral meeting you mentioned, if there is information, we will release it in due course”.India’s external affairs ministry said on Tuesday that Jaishankar’s Moscow visit will “include the participation in the Council of SCO Foreign Ministers and other bilateral meetings.”The RIC foreign ministers had last met by video conferencing on June 23 in the backdrop of the spreading Covid-19 pandemic.A meeting between the three ministers in Moscow indicates that Russia, an ally of both India and China, is keen to mediate between the two countries to defuse the tension at the border.A one-on-one meeting – and in-depth exchange - between Jaishankar and Wang is also widely expected as a possible way forward from the months-long standoff between the border troops in eastern Ladakh.Wang Dehua, South Asia expert at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the RIC meeting may also pave the way for a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping.“After Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe and Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh’s meeting in Moscow on September 4, the meeting of foreign ministers is of great significance as it’ is conducive to ease the tension along the border while helping to reset relations of our two countries. Perhaps, it will prompt early meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping,” Wang said.“I think it is also beneficial to the RIC mechanism. The border dispute can only be solved through talk or dialogues. Military confrontation is not an option,” he added.Incidentally, Jaishankar is the longest serving Indian ambassador to China, with his Beijing tenure lasting four-and-half years between 2009 and 2013.Speaking at the launch of his book, The India Way: Strategies For An Uncertain World last week, Jaishankar had said he knew Wang for a long time. “As to what I will be talking to my Chinese colleague when I meet him, we have known each other a long time so you can have a reasonable guess,” he had said.The two had last spoken over phone on June 17, two days after the Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Jaishankar had conveyed to Wang that the need of the hour was for the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps. “The two sides should scrupulously and sincerely implement the understanding that was reached by the senior commanders on 6th June. Troops of both sides should also abide by the bilateral agreements and protocols. They should strictly respect and observe the Line of Actual Control and should not take any unilateral action to alter it,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-border-clashes-jaishankar-to-meet-foreign-ministers-of-china-russia/story-utqYkaXC0tHUfvUrWYMvCL.html

The nomination was submitted by a four-term member of the Norwegian Parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, who is also the chairman of the Norwegian delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Fox News reported.The news comes just weeks after Trump helped broker peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Also Watch | Donald Trump nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for helping broker Israel-UAE deal “I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees,” Christian Tybring-Gjedde was quoted as saying by Fox News.“As it is expected other Middle Eastern countries will follow in the footsteps of the UAE, this agreement could be a game changer that will turn the Middle East into a region of cooperation and prosperity,” Tybring-Gjedde wrote in his nomination letter to the Nobel Committee.On August 13, Trump had announced the United Arab Emirates and Israel’s agreement to establish full diplomatic ties as part of a deal to halt the annexation of occupied land sought by the Palestinians for their future state.The announcement makes the UAE first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.Among Arab nations, Egypt and Jordan have active diplomatic ties with Israel. In 1979, Egypt made a peace deal with Israel, followed by Jordan in 1994.Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize nomination comes just weeks before the crucial US presidential elections, where the Republican’s presidential candidate is running a politically charged campaign against his rival Joe Biden. On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and vote to elect a new government for the next four years or re-elect the Trump for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-nominated-for-2021-nobel-peace-prize-report/story-AcJu6VRUlqzzHWKbE2wkYK.html
09-09-2020||World||Pope warns against seeking political, economic gain from coronavirus||Pope Francis said on Wednesday no one should seek economic or political gain from the coronavirus pandemic and vaccine developers should not see it merely as a profit-making endeavour.Francis told visitors at his weekly general audience - the second with public participation after six months of virtual audiences - that the pandemic should spur everyone to work for the common good.“Unfortunately, we are witnessing the emergence of partisan interests. For example, there are those who want to appropriate possible solutions for themselves, such as (developing) vaccines and then selling them to others,” he said. “Some are taking advantage of the situation to foment divisions, to create economic or political advantages, to start or intensify conflict,” he said, without specifying.The pandemic and the quest for a vaccine have become hot-button issues in the US presidential campaign between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.Trump wants to fast-track a vaccine, which he has said is coming “very, very soon”. The virus has killed more than 186,000 Americans and cost millions of jobs.Biden has charged that Trump is politicizing the issue to help his re-election and has called for any vaccine to be produced and distributed following established scientific standards without outside political interference.The pope called people who turn their backs on the suffering coronavirus had caused “devotees of Pontius Pilate who simply wash their hands of it,” referring to the ancient Roman governor of Judea who ordered Jesus’ crucifixion but refused to take responsibility for it.Francis said while “politics often does not have a good reputation,” there had been many politicians in the course of history “who were saints”. He did not name any.The audience was held in the Vatican’s San Damaso courtyard before about 500 people. Tens of thousands pack the usual venue, St. Peter’s Square.The pope asked people to remain in their seats and keep social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-warns-against-seeking-political-economic-gain-from-coronavirus/story-9Og2gB0HEdGStPyA0ErgUJ.html

The deal would include an option for another 100 million doses.The EU didn’t disclose financial terms. Pfizer and BioNTech previously agreed to supply 120 million doses to Japan. The US in July reached a deal to pay $2 billion for an initial 100 million doses, with an option for 500 million more.The companies have said they’re on track for regulatory review as soon as October. They’ve enrolled more than 25,000 of the 30,000 participants needed for a massive clinical trial to show the vaccine works and secured sign-off this week from regulators to expand the study to Germany.Including study sites in Europe, “and now especially in Germany, is aimed at supporting an approval in Europe,” BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said in a previous statement.The companies’ vaccine relies on a new technology that prompts the body’s own cells to produce the virus proteins needed to trigger the immune system.The EU previously announced preliminary plans for vaccine supply arrangements with developers including Moderna Inc., Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford, Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as CureVac NV..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-lock-biggest-eu-vaccine-deal-of-200-million-doses/story-jPBbKUXmi8uKcTMJhxWxvK.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump and Joe Biden run vastly different pandemic campaigns||North Carolina caps outdoor gatherings at 50 people to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but don’t tell that to President Donald Trump. He basked in a largely maskless crowd of several thousand supporters during a rally in this critical battleground state.“As far as the eye can see,” Trump said, reveling at the sight of people flouting public health guidelines at Tuesday’s rally. “I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago.”A day earlier in Pennsylvania, Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, held a socially distanced meeting in a backyard. His team has been so attentive to local regulations that some staffers have left the room if they risked breaking the rules on crowd limits.“I really miss being able to, you know, grab hands and shake hands,” Biden recently told supporters. “You can’t do that now.”With less than eight weeks until Election Day, Trump and Biden are taking diametrically opposite approaches to campaigning during a pandemic — and the differences amount to more than political theater. The candidates are effectively staking out different visions for the country with Biden emphasizing guidelines supported by local health officials while Trump rails against restrictions that he argues — without evidence — are politically motivated.“By the way, your state should be open,” Trump said in North Carolina — a state where he has feuded with Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, over his abandoned plans to hold the Republican National Convention in Charlotte. “It’s you, it’s Michigan, it’s a couple others,” Trump added, as he sees a potent line of attack in battleground states run by Democrats.Trump aides and allies suggest the president sees his rallies as a manifestation of the reopening he’s preaching — and that he believes is vital to the nation’s economic recovery and what voters want. In a dig at those who warn against reopening too quickly, Trump suggested that these states would suddenly reopen the day after the election — when opponents advocating caution can no longer hurt his reelection.Outdoor events used to be few and far between for Trump, who prefers the deafening echo and air conditioning of indoor arenas. But in the wake of a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the president addressed a half-empty arena and a promised five-figure overflow crowd never materialized, his campaign decided to move to lower-stakes airport hangars and tarmacs.The one thing that has stayed the same: crowing about his crowd sizes in comparison with Biden’s.“If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot,” Trump said Tuesday of his opponent. “Have you ever seen the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people.”Biden’s crowds, in fact, have been far smaller. The former vice president has appeared in public only sparingly since the pandemic hit — and with the strictest adherence to state guidelines: 25 people in Pennsylvania, 50 in Michigan and mandatory face-coverings all around. Biden’s approach reflects the reluctance of many of his supporters to attend large gatherings.For someone who has never been a natural in an arena, the smaller events allow Biden to have more personal interactions with representatives from key voting blocs, like labor and community leaders.But they also allow him to largely avoid any controversy created by a critical questioner or a protester, both of whom he was forced to grapple with multiple times on the campaign trail before the pandemic struck.Even when Biden is confronted with organic crowds of supporters, he’s rarely given the opportunity for an unscripted interaction with them.As Biden gave a speech last week focused on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus at a university building in Pittsburgh, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and continued to arrive even as his event wrapped up.They chanted “We want Joe!” and waved Biden signs, some of them homemade. But, after his speech, Biden remained inside the building to attend a virtual fundraiser, then abruptly left to pass out pizzas at a nearby firehouse without approaching the supporters.Three days later, after Biden visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, he and his wife, Jill, stopped at the home of a supporter in Wauwatosa, a leafy Milwaukee suburb.With so many people confined to their homes, the presence of Biden’s motorcade on a small street drew more than 200 people out onto their porches or the street. The Bidens spent more than half an hour meeting in a quiet back patio with two teachers and a parent concerned about how to resume in-person learning during the pandemic.The crowd cheered and chanted “Go Joe!,” but the private meeting ran so long that Biden only interacted with them for less than a minute. As he was leaving, he walked to the middle of the street and then, surrounded by Secret Service agents, bellowed, “Don’t forget to vote!”Earlier this week, however, Biden took a moment after an event focused on labor leaders at a supporter’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to greet a crowd of about two dozen supporters that had assembled across the street. Flanked by Secret Service agents, Biden said a few words to the crowd about his belief that Americans can do anything when they’re unified and about the need to vote, then spoke briefly to reporters and departed.Later that day, Biden waved at a crowd of about 100 from the window of the AFL-CIO Pennsylvania headquarters, but declined to come any nearer after leaving the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-with-two-months-to-go-pitches-amped-up-for-us-presidential-election-2020/story-nfwl1Afbu2aETqc8Xk9WaP.html
09-09-2020||World||Brexit endgame spurs investors to buckle up for a wild ride||In a year that’s featured a global pandemic and a tidal wave of liquidity from central banks, investors are bracing themselves for a risk they’ve ignored for most of 2020: Brexit.The prospect of the UK and European Union reaching a trade agreement by an October deadline is looking less likely, with Britain saying this week it’s willing to walk away and break international law in the process. That risks the pound falling to a 35-year low, stocks that lag international peers, and bond yields turning negative for the first time amid bets on Bank of England interest-rate cuts, fund managers say.“If we have a big selloff in risk assets, and a bad Brexit outcome, then there’s no reason the pound couldn’t fall back through the March lows,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. That would mean a 12% slump to around $1.14, the lowest since 1985.The stalemate in discussions has already seen the pound suffer its longest losing streak since March when Covid-19 started to rip through the country, and has sent the yield on haven short-term bonds to record lows. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now facing a backlash over a government minister’s admission that the UK plans to break international law by re-writing parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Until recently, the risks associated with failed trade talks had been in the background, overshadowed by the economic fallout of the coronavirus. The pound, which has acted as a market barometer to Brexit since the 2016 referendum, had been rallying along with other currencies in Group-of-10 nations against the US dollar.Complacency around Brexit prompted Riddell to add to a short pound position in recent months and use sterling as a risk-off hedge, mainly against the US dollar and the yen.By contrast analysts in a Bloomberg survey expect only a mild drop to $1.30 by end-2020 and then gains next year. Economists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley all still anticipate a deal on commerce will be in place for the end of December.But with formal talks between the UK and EU resuming this week, those risks are back on investors’ radar. Johnson signaled he would let the talks collapse if a deal isn’t made before mid-October rather than compromise. Officials have also drafted a law that risks undermining the negotiations, a move that Northern Ireland Minister Brandon Lewis conceded would break international law.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is “worried and disappointed.”The flare-up in trade tensions has sent the pound tumbling by more than 2% this week, to below $1.30. It’s increased the cost of hedging swings in sterling over three months to the highest level since May, while Johnson’s comments spurred the biggest jump for six months in options betting on a fall in the currency by December.Value TrapBrexit continues to be a drag on the nation’s equities, with the FTSE 100 falling to a record low against the MSCI World Index. While a slide in the pound may provide a boost for exporters, investors are more underweight on the UK than on any other country examined in a Bank of America fund survey for August.“We see the UK as a value trap,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “Valuations might be attractive but fundamentals are not.”In addition to Brexit, the UK is suffering one of the biggest hits to growth in Europe from the pandemic, and must decide next month whether to keep supporting millions of furloughed workers or face a surge in unemployment.That could mean more pain for UK Plc, which combined with concern over a painful transition from the EU, may further fuel demand for the safety of gilts. Benchmark yields have fallen near a record set during the pandemic shock in March, and the rate on two-year bonds dropped to an all-time low of minus 0.156%.John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management, expects government bonds to rally if fears that trade talks will collapse drive up the possibility of UK interest rates going negative.Money markets have brought forward pricing on a BOE cut below zero to May, compared to September earlier this week. The potential for turmoil also raises the chances for more central bank bond buying.“It’s worth remembering that the Bank of England’s forecasts are based on the UK reaching a full trade agreement with the EU,” said Daniela Russell, head of UK rates strategy for HSBC Holdings Plc, who sees 10-year yields falling to zero by the end of the year.There’s a 40% chance yields could go below that to turn negative in the next year, said Jan von Gerich, a chief strategist at Nordea Bank Abp.Bare BonesA ‘bare-bones’ free trade deal would be enough to avoid such a scenario and lead Aberdeen Standard Investments to be underweight gilts, said Aaron Rock, an investment director.And Citigroup Inc. foreign-exchange strategist Adam Pickett said the market hasn’t priced in the likelihood of the UK and the EU moving toward a last-minute agreement, and is targeting a climb back to $1.35.Brexit fatigue could be one reason why markets are so far mostly positioned for a deal. Either way, fund managers will be glad to see the back of an issue that has forced them to work nights after late votes that flipped markets, defeated two prime ministers and divided the country.“It has dragged on long enough,” said Rock at Aberdeen Standard. “It will be better for all concerned if we can move on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-endgame-spurs-investors-to-buckle-up-for-a-wild-ride/story-3BpDp4fRUxUuKCOZdwXxxI.html

The 45th edition of North America’s largest movie event will still span 10 days from Thursday.“We began this year planning for a festival much like our previous editions, but along the way we had to rethink just about everything. This year’s line-up reflects that tumult,” said Cameron Bailey, TIFF’s artistic director and co-head.TIFF has usually featured close to 400 films. But 2020 will witness a pared-down slate, with 61 features, 36 shorts and another 30 films that will be restricted to the industry to keep its marketplace buzzing.Among the novelties for regular festival-goers will be the “outdoor experience”, with screenings at two drive-in venues and an open-air cinema in Toronto. Physical screenings will be limited to a maximum of 50 persons in the theatre.The online platform will also debut this year and feature all the films available to the public, though they will be geographically limited to Canada.Also Read: While media attention was focused on the insider-outsider debate, Chaitanya Tamhane made historyUnlike previous years, stars will be unable to visit Toronto in person due to mandatory quarantine requirements. But they will make online appearances to interact with audiences. Given the backdrop, TIFF is also partnering with a healthcare company for the festival.The festival will open with African-American director Spike Lee’s filmed version of David Byrne’s American Utopia, a Broadway musical from the founder and frontman of the classic band Talking Heads.India will be represented at TIFF this year by The Disciple, a film from Mumbai-based director Chaitanya Tamhane. In addition, the closing night presentation will feature episodes of Indian-American director Mira Nair’s TV adaptation of Vikram Seth’s novel Suitable Boy.“We could never have anticipated the global seismic changes we would be facing in 2020,” TIFF’s executive director and Co-Head Joana Vicente said. And while TIFF 2020 will miss the adulatory crowds swarming around stars for selfies, organisers hope it will be a memorable experience in a year of duress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toronto-film-fest-is-going-hybrid-as-show-must-go-on-during-pandemic/story-92SzfJOdpA8jEP458O29WO.html

09-09-2020||World||India honours armed forces superveterans settled in Canada||India has launched an initiative to honour armed forces veterans in their 90s and 100s now settled in Canada.The programme called Varisth Yoddha was launched in the Canadian province of Ontario , with a visit by Consul General Apoorva Srivastava to the homes of veterans.Seven veterans were presented with mementos in recognition of their service to India.The oldest of them was Captain Mohinder Singh, born on October 2, 1917, who fought in the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars against China and Pakistan. While the majority of the selected veterans in the first batch defended India in each major war fought since Independence, others had also been part of the British Army and fought in World War II. Among them was Commander Joginder Gei, 98, who joined the Royal Indian Navy and served aboard ships in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Another 98-year-old veteran was Bakshish Singh Randhawa who fought in WWII and also against Pakistan in 1965. Others on the first list included Major Darshan Singh Sanghera, 91, Subedar Major Pritam Singh Dhaliwal, 92, Subedar Gajjan Singh Mavi, 90 and Naib Subedar Gurdial Singh Grewal, 97.Also Read: Pro-Khalistan group alleges India disrupted secessionist referendum, Canada rejects theoryThe initiative was to have started on August 15, India’s Independence Day, but due to Covid-19 restrictions, the consul general visited the veterans at their residences with small ceremonies held for each of them. These centenarians and nonagenarians live in the Greater Toronto Area and have roots in Punjab.The ceremonies were held with the cooperation of the Veterans Association of Ontario. Brigadier Nawab Heer of the association said, “It was quite an emotional occasion for us and pleasant for them.”“If the government is remembering superveterans, it’s a positive step,” Heer said.“We wanted to hold an event on August 15 but because of the circumstances we couldn’t, so I decided to go to their homes in appreciation of their service,” Srivastava said.Srivastava said the plan is to institutionalise appreciation of these ex-servicemen with official ceremonies at the Consulate on Republic Day and Independence Day. For those unable to travel from their homes to the consulate, she said she would continue to visit them at their homes. After more veterans in their 90s are honoured, those in other age brackets will also be remembered, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-honours-armed-forces-superveterans-settled-in-canada/story-3Nhialw2QiS38Lbf892yiO.html
09-09-2020||World||Britain sets out details for post-EU life amid new Brexit row||Britain will set out new details of its blueprint for life outside the European Union on Wednesday, publishing legislation a government minister acknowledged would break international law in a “limited way” and which could sour trade talks.After leaving the EU in January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pushed on with plans for the end of a status quo period in December, and hoped a bill on Britain’s internal market would set in stone the transfer of powers from Brussels.But with talks with the EU all but stalled over fisheries and state aid, a statement from his Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis that the new bill would “break international law in a very specific and limited way” may only worsen matters.The EU has warned Britain that if it reneges on the divorce deal there would be no agreement. London has repeatedly said it will respect the withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol, saying its bill contained only “clarifications”.Also read: EU, UK blame each other over deadlocked post-Brexit talksBritain and the EU say they have until October to agree on a free trade deal, which would ease the worries of some companies who fear disruption at the borders and of supply chains at a time when many are struggling with the coronavirus crisis.In a statement, the government hailed its Internal Market Bill as a way of empowering Britain and ending the reign of “unelected EU bodies”.“This bill will also give the UK government new spending powers to drive our economic recovery from COVID-19 and support businesses and communities right across the UK,” said Michael Gove, a cabinet minister.“No longer will unelected EU bodies be spending our money on our behalf. These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK parliament and people of the UK.”The bill is intended to allow all companies to be able to trade unhindered in Britain’s four nations, to transfer powers to Britain allowing it to replace some of the EU’s spending programmes, and set up a new body to monitor internal trade.On Northern Ireland, Lewis said in a separate statement that the provisions would ensure businesses based in the British region would have “unfettered access” to the rest of Britain, without paperwork. It would also ensure there would be no legal confusion about the fact that while Northern Ireland would remain subject to the EU’s state aid regime, Britain would not.“As a responsible government it is also necessary for us to ensure there is a safety net in place which provides legal certainty that we can deliver on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland,” he said.Northern Ireland, which borders EU member Ireland, has always been a stumbling block in talks, and almost killed off the Brexit deal until Johnson found agreement with then Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar last year.Even after that, the government says there are ambiguities in the Northern Ireland protocol which need to be clarified in accordance with the election promises Johnson made last year.But Scotland and Wales said the planned bill would undermine the United Kingdom by stealing devolved powers from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Let me be clear – the UK government plans to sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations,” Jeremy Miles, Wales’ counsel general, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-sets-out-details-for-post-eu-life-amid-new-brexit-row/story-k2HHoB3Vug8tzPqB6kLJcK.html

Protests also broke out involving migrants, riot police, and firefighters.“It has been a very difficult night,” government spokesman Stelios Petsas said, adding that a state on emergency would be declared later Wednesday on the island.Some 12,500 people were living at the Moria camp and the surrounding area, where additional restrictions have been imposed over the past week after a Somali resident tested positive for the coronavirus.There were no reports of injuries.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe fires broke out overnight, police and fire officials on the island told The Associated Press, adding the cause of the blazes, as well as the full extent of the damage, remained unclear. They did not confirm local reports that the fires had been set deliberately in protest at the lockdown measures but said firefighters had “met resistance” from some camp residents.Government spokesman Petsas said that arson was being considered as a possible cause of the fire. Before dawn, riot police set up cordons along a highway near the camp to restrict the movements of migrants.Health authorities on Tuesday said 35 people at the camp had been confirmed infected with the virus so far after a major testing drive was ordered at the overcrowded facility. Those with confirmed infections were being kept in isolation at a separate site that was not affected by the fire, officials said.Lesbos was Europe’s busiest crossing point in 2015-16 for illegal migration during a massive westward movement of refugees, many fleeing war in Syria and Iraq and travelling through Turkey. After that wave of migration, Greece set up camps on Lesbos and four other islands, helped with European Union funding, and more recently also set up a network of camps on the mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-sweeps-through-largest-refugee-camp-in-greece-which-is-under-lockdown/story-uxapz9YeUkxEjRWF2uQ03N.html
09-09-2020||World||Fresh fires on oil tanker off Sri Lanka under control||Fresh fires that erupted on a large oil tanker drifting off Sri Lanka are under control again, the country’s navy said Wednesday.A new blaze broke out Monday on the MT New Diamond, which was carrying nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil, and reached the magnitude of last week’s fire, only a day after it was extinguished. Officials have warned of massive environmental damage to Sri Lanka’s coast if the ship leaks or explodes.“The fire has now been brought under control and the ship is being towed by a tugboat to out to sea,” said navy spokesperson Indika de Silva.“There are no flames or smoke to be noticed as of now,” he said, adding that the navy’s specially trained firefighting and disaster management team will join with firefighting experts from India’s coast guard and specialists sent by the ship’s owner on Wednesday to assess the situation.Ten British and Dutch professionals, including rescue operation specialists, disaster evaluators and legal consultants, reached the scene on Monday and are waiting to board the tanker to begin the mission of salvaging it. The experts were sent by New Shipping Ltd., the commercial owner of the New Diamond in Athens, Greece.The tanker is about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) off the coast and the plan is to position it is at 40 nautical miles to facilitate salvaging work, de Silva said.The tanker was transporting crude oil from the port of Mina Al Ahmadi in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip, where the state-owned Indian Oil Corp. has a refinery.High winds, extreme temperatures on the ship and sparks reignited the fresh fires, the navy said, adding that so far there is no risk of an oil leak or of the fire spreading into the oil storage area.The navy said the initial fire began in an engine room boiler but did not spread to where the oil is kept.The navy said Tuesday that “a diesel patch” had been spotted in the ocean about 1 kilometer (half a mile) from the ship. The patch is likely to be diesel fuel from the ship, it said. The ship has about 1,700 tons of fuel to power its engines.An Indian coast guard aircraft sprayed a chemical on the patch to minimize damage.The initial fire killed one Filipino crew member and injured another, while 21 other crew members escaped uninjured.Twenty of them were taken to the southern port city of Galle on Tuesday, while the captain remained on a ship near the tanker to help with firefighting efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-fires-on-oil-tanker-off-sri-lanka-under-control/story-AeWabO4wG6JAUnbY0uI1hN.html
09-09-2020||World||Covid-19: As cases in Indonesia rise, medical workers bear the burden||While Indonesia has recorded more deaths from the coronavirus than any other Southeast Asian country, it also has seen by far the most fatalities among medical workers in the region, leading to concerns about the long-term impact on the nation’s fragile healthcare system.The tribulations endured by Indonesian healthcare workers are similar to others globally: long working hours, hospitals filled to capacity and a lack of resources like personal protective equipment.Indonesia’s government has been able to provide PPE to healthcare workers after an initial shortage that saw doctors wearing plastic raincoats while working. But other issues remain in the country, where more than 200 medical workers, mostly doctors and nurses, have died from the virus.According to Dr. Halik Malik, spokesperson for the Indonesian Medical Association, coronavirus and non-coronavirus patients are often treated in the same healthcare facilities, increasing workers’ potential exposure to the virus. Only workers who are treating known Covid-19 patients are provided virus testing for themselves, he said, noting that results are often delayed.“We are worried that if positive cases in the community continue to increase, there will be many cases that cannot be handled properly,” Malik said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndonesia on Tuesday surpassed 200,000 cases of the coronavirus, the second-highest tally in Southeast Asia after the Philippines, which has reported more than 241,000 infections. In all of Asia, Indonesia’s death toll of 8,230 is second only to India, which has had over 73,000 fatalities.At least 213 healthcare workers have died from Covid-19 in Indonesia, including 107 doctors and 74 nurses, according to the Indonesian Medical Association.The Philippines, which has reported more than 3,900 deaths overall, has seen 33 of its medical workers die from the virus, second-most in the region. The only other Southeast Asian country with more than 100 overall deaths is Malaysia, with 128.Indonesia also has one of the lowest numbers of doctors per capita in Southeast Asia, at just 4.27 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.The deaths of so many of its doctors from Covid-19 will impact the country’s healthcare workforce for years to come, said Nurul Nadia, a public health expert from the Center for Indonesia’s Strategic Development Initiatives, an organization that focuses on health.“Our health system is weak, the number of doctors is not ideal, the number of specialist doctors is very few and many have become victims of Covid-19 now,” Nadia said.And the spread of the virus is only getting worse across the vast archipelago nation of more than 270 million people.According to the WHO, 66,420 cases were recorded in Indonesia in August alone, a 28% rise from July’s total. While a majority of the cases were in East Java province and Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, several other places have emerged as new hot spots. The true number of cases is suspected to be significantly higher, as Indonesia continues to have one of the lowest testing rates in the world.Yet businesses across the country continue to reopen. Bali, one of the country’s largest tourism hubs, began welcoming domestic visitors on July 9. According to Bali Tourism Agency chief Putu Astawa, the island welcomed at least 78,000 domestic tourists in August. In Jakarta, many offices have reopened, contributing to a spike in cases in the sprawling city.As a result of the spike in cases, hospitals are continuing to fill, leading to some becoming overcrowded. Isolation beds are now at 70% capacity in the country, “raising concern about the healthcare system’s capacity to cope with the increasing number of new cases every week,” the WHO said.Medical workers face other burdens for which there are no available statistics. They often work long hours, with no offer of psychological counseling, said Dr. Irman Pahlepi, who has worked in a Covid-19 intake center since March. The fear of exposure to the virus has also kept many healthcare workers away from their families, as they choose instead to stay in government-provided hotels.Pahlepi, who spent most of the past five months living away from his newlywed wife for fear of infecting her, recently found out his wife is pregnant and decided to move back home to help care for her. But the decision doesn’t come without risks, he said.“I’m getting more scared now, and getting sadder too,” Pahlepi said. “I remember my family at home more than before. What if we get infected?”Healthcare workers across Indonesia are facing other hardships as well. The secretary of the Legal Aid Agency of the Indonesian Nurses Association said that as of May 25, “330 nurses in government-owned or private-owned hospitals experienced pay cuts and did not receive any holiday bonus,” according to a report by Amnesty International.Indonesia’s government announced a plan last week to lessen the burden on healthcare workers by moving patients from hospitals to create more space, adjusting clinical work arrangements to reduce exposure to patients, and providing nutritional supplements to medical workers.“We are deeply sorry to our hero health workers, the front-liners, the fighters who have passed away while handling Covid-19 treatment,” National Covid-19 Task Force spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito said at a news conference. “Both the task force and the minister of health are very concerned (about) this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-as-cases-in-indonesia-rise-medical-workers-bear-the-burden/story-aL4rNRPeWf6CiOr3f9WwzH.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden run vastly different campaigns amid Covid-19 crisis||North Carolina caps outdoor gatherings at 50 people to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but don’t tell that to President Donald Trump. He basked in a largely maskless crowd of several thousand supporters during a Tuesday rally in this critical battleground state.“As far as the eye can see,” Trump said, revelling at the sight of people flouting public health guidelines. “I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago.” A day earlier in Pennsylvania, Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, held a socially distanced meeting in a backyard. His team has been so attentive to local regulations that some staffers have left the room if they risked breaking the rules on crowd limits.“I really miss being able to, you know, grab hands and shake hands,” Biden recently told supporters. “You can’t do that now.” With less than eight weeks until Election Day, Trump and Biden are taking diametrically opposite approaches to campaigning during a pandemic — and the differences amount to more than political theatre. The candidates are effectively staking out different visions for the country with Biden emphasizing guidelines supported by local health officials while Trump rails against restrictions that he argues — without evidence — are politically motivated.“By the way, your state should be open,” Trump said in North Carolina — a state where he has feuded with Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, over his abandoned plans to hold the Republican National Convention in Charlotte.“It’s you, it’s Michigan, it’s a couple others,” Trump added, as he sees a potent line of attack in battleground states run by Democrats.Trump aides and allies suggest the president sees his rallies as a manifestation of the reopening he’s preaching — and that he believes is vital to the nation’s economic recovery and what voters want. In a dig at those who warn against reopening too quickly, Trump suggested that these states would suddenly reopen the day after the election — when opponents advocating caution can no longer hurt his reelection.Outdoor events used to be few and far between for Trump, who prefers the deafening echo and air conditioning of indoor arenas. But in the wake of a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when the president addressed a half-empty arena and a promised five-figure overflow crowd never materialized, his campaign decided to move to lower-stakes airport hangars and tarmacs.The one thing that has stayed the same: crowing about his crowd sizes in comparison to Biden’s.“If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot,” Trump said Tuesday of his opponent. “Have you ever seen the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people.” Biden’s crowds, in fact, have been far smaller. The former vice president has appeared in public only sparingly since the pandemic hit — and with the strictest adherence to state guidelines: 25 people in Pennsylvania, 50 in Michigan and mandatory face-coverings all around. Biden’s approach reflects the reluctance of many of his supporters to attend large gatherings.For someone who has never been a natural in an arena, the smaller events allow Biden to have more personal interactions with representatives from key voting blocs, like labor and community leaders.But they also allow him to largely avoid any controversy created by a critical questioner or a protester, both of whom he was forced to grapple with multiple times on the campaign trail before the pandemic struck.Even when Biden is confronted with organic crowds of supporters, he’s rarely given the opportunity for an unscripted interaction with them.As Biden gave a speech last week focused on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus at a university building in Pittsburgh, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and continued to arrive even as his event wrapped up.They chanted “We want Joe!” and waved Biden signs, some of them homemade. But, after his speech, Biden remained inside the building to attend a virtual fundraiser, then abruptly left to pass out pizzas at a nearby firehouse without approaching the supporters.Three days later, after Biden visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, he and his wife, Jill, stopped at the home of a supporter in Wauwatosa, a leafy Milwaukee suburb.With so many people confined to their homes, the presence of Biden’s motorcade on a small street drew more than 200 people out onto their porches or the street. The Bidens spent more than half an hour meeting in a quiet back patio with two teachers and a parent concerned about how to resume in-person learning during the pandemic.The crowd cheered and chanted “Go Joe!,” but the private meeting ran so long that Biden only interacted with them for less than a minute. As he was leaving, he walked to the middle of the street and then, surrounded by Secret Service agents, bellowed, “Don’t forget to vote!” Earlier this week, however, Biden took a moment after an event focused on labor leaders at a supporter’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to greet a crowd of about two dozen supporters that had assembled across the street. Flanked by Secret Service agents, Biden said a few words to the crowd about his belief that Americans can do anything when they’re unified and about the need to vote, then spoke briefly to reporters and departed.Later that day, Biden waved at a crowd of about 100 from the window of the AFL-CIO Pennsylvania headquarters, but declined to come any nearer after leaving the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-run-vastly-different-campaigns-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-qjozv7CcC54ct8k0lFcoJK.html
09-09-2020||World||Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh targeted in Kabul, Haqqani network is prime suspect||Two days after Afghanistan First Vice President Amrullah Saleh raised the issue of Durand Line and talked about Peshawar as summer capital of Islamic Republic, the former intelligence chief was target of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack in Kabul that left three of his bodyguards injured, many bystanders killed or maimed in the explosion.The device was placed under a culvert over which Saleh’s cavalcade was passing en-route to the Vice President’s office. The IED was so powerful that gas cylinders in nearby shops exploded due to concussion. There are unconfirmed reports that 15 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the attack. Saleh, intelligence reports confirm, is safe.In a video message released after the attack, Saleh said that the attack took place at 7.30 am, when he was on his way to work. The place where the suicide attack took place was narrow, he said, thanking the swift action of the securitymen present there.Saleh, a former intelligence chief, has survived several assassination attempts, including one on his office last year that killed 20 people.The attack on Saleh comes at a time when the ultra-conservative Sunni Pashtun outfit Taliban is planning to hold intra-Afghan negotiations in Qatar with the support of US. “No Afghan politician of national stature can overlook the issue of Durand Line. It will condemn him or her in life & after life. It is an issue which needs discussions & resolution. Expecting us to gift it for free is un-realistic. Peshawar used to be the winter capital of Afg,” he said in a tweet on September 7.According to diplomats base in Kabul and New Delhi, the needle of suspicion for the attack on Saleh is towards the Haqqani network as the Zadran tribe, which is affliated to the global terrorist group, has a hold on Kabul city with the perpetrators of attack this morning based in Pakistan. Sirajjudin Haqqani, head of the Haqqani network, is deputy leader and sword arm of Taliban.While the decision of the US to withdraw after nearly two decades of active involvement in Afghanistan is well respected all around, its decision to foist the Taliban on the political and constitutional system by unilateral moves which are required to be honoured and accommodated by Kabul is causing much concern all around the region.Incidents such as these once again bring to fore that contrary to their public protestations, neither the outfit nor its sponsors-in-uniform in Pakistan are in the mood for any accommodation.The Taliban have not sent their delegation to Qatar for talks, they are seeking the release of Haji Bashir Noorzai, an Afghan drug lord who was arrested in 2005. Keen to make the Taliban sit with the Afghanistan’s government, the US is looking to entertain this request to release Noorzai and other Taliban detainees in Guantanamo Bay.“I think the TBN will not start talks in Doha till the release of Haji B Noorzai. According to the attached article, Dr Khalilzad guaranteed his release. Considering the timing, perhaps Haji Bashar might be released this week. Now the TBN have no incentive to reduce violence,” Afghan politician Rahmatullah Nabil said on Twitter. I think the TBN will not start talks in Doha till the release of Haji B. Noorzai.

09-09-2020||World||AstraZeneca pauses Covid-19 vaccine trial after unexplained illness||AstraZeneca Plc stopped giving shots of its experimental coronavirus vaccine after a person participating in one of the company’s studies got sick, a potential adverse reaction that could delay or derail efforts to speed an immunization against Covid-19 for the world.The pause stemmed from a standard review of the company’s vaccine trials after one person developed an unexplained illness, AstraZeneca said in a statement. The move was intended to give researchers time to examine safety data while maintaining the integrity of the trials, the company said.The vaccine, which AstraZeneca is developing with researchers from the University of Oxford, has been viewed as one of the leading candidates to reach the market. The decision to tap the brakes jolted investors, sending AstraZeneca’s U.S.-traded shares down sharply, while boosting the stocks of some rivals developing different potential Covid-19 shots.“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,” AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell said in a statement. She said that it’s too early to determine the sick participant’s specific diagnosis.Scientific sprintThe development has the potential to disrupt one of the most closely watched scientific sprints in history. Companies have been working to find a vaccine in hopes of blunting a pandemic that has sickened more than 27 million people and killed over 894,000 worldwide. Health officials in the U.S. and President Donald Trump have repeatedly said that it’s possible to have an immunization before the end of the year, and potentially as early as next month.The top U.S. official in charge of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s program to support the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, said experts monitoring the trials in the U.K. paused the late-stage trial in coordination with their U.S. counterparts.Moncef Slaoui, the head of the Warp Speed initiative, said in a statement that Data Safety Monitoring Boards in the U.S. and U.K. are “conducting an in-depth review of the company’s vaccine candidate which is standard procedure when an adverse event occurs.”A Data Safety Monitoring Board is a panel of outside experts that watches for potential harm from experimental drugs and vaccines during clinical trials. The bar to pause a vaccine trial is generally low since participants are healthy and may never need the immunization they have volunteered to receive.The members of the monitoring board have unparalleled insight into clinical studies. Unlike doctors and researchers, they are told whether those participating received the vaccine or a placebo, and they are given regular updates on how each group is faring.Oxford University’s Jenner Institute didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.‘Safety precaution’Some scientists downplayed the significance of the halt. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and clinical-trials expert at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, said such pauses in large studies are “not uncommon at all.” There is a high likelihood the adverse event will turn out not to be related to the vaccine, he said in an email.“It’s a safety precaution,” he said.Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the AstraZeneca shot involves giving large doses of a monkey adenovirus engineered so it can’t replicate. It is therefore important for researchers to investigate whether the adverse event wasn’t somehow being triggered by a reaction to that large viral dose, he said.“When you have that kind of viral load, you can have side effects,” said Offit. The question is whether the adverse event could somehow be related to the large number of viral particles being given, or whether it is just a coincidence. If after investigating, the monitoring board is comfortable there are reasons unrelated to the vaccine to explain the adverse event, the trial will be able to continue, he said.The U.S. and other governments have invested billions of dollars to develop a shot at an accelerated pace, and more than two dozen vaccines are now being tested in volunteers less than a year after the virus was first discovered. Eleven candidates are in late-stage trials.Raised questionsThe setback comes as a group of international scientists raised questions over a fast-moving vaccine from Russia, saying some results of a study appeared improbable. The two incidents highlight the difficulty in getting an effective vaccine to the public quickly as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads unabated.Politics have also complicated the pursuit of a vaccine. Amid concerns about the Trump administration politicizing the rollout of a vaccine before the elections, frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine pledged to avoid shortcuts on science as they face pressure to rush a shot to market.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that it’s “unlikely” a Covid-19 vaccine will be available to the public by Nov. 3.In late trading in New York, AstraZeneca shares fell as much as 8.3%, while Moderna Inc. and BioNTech SE saw their shares rise. All three companies are participating in Operation Warp Speed. News of AstraZeneca’s trial setback was first reported by STAT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-pauses-covid-19-vaccine-trial-after-unexplained-illness/story-YaCN7db9JBJLbjncnx1VxL.html

The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP’s parliamentary majority.Suga, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida will appear in a televised debate on Wednesday, making the case for who should lead the country after nearly eight years under Abe.Abe had early success with his “Abenomics” economic initiatives but the coronavirus pandemic has eradicated those gains.Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, sank deeper into its worst postwar recession in the second quarter of this year with a record 28% annualised contraction, government data showed the previous day.Suga said on Tuesday the biggest job for the new prime minister would be to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy.Ishiba has been a popular figure among the public while Kishida has the diplomatic experience that Suga lacks, but they have only a fraction of the LDP support that Suga enjoys, the Asahi tally shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-yoshihide-suga-in-pole-position-for-pm-as-debate-kicks-off/story-4M3r7KLtLElCi8ZGmbcyXL.html
09-09-2020||World||US Prez Donald Trump planning to withdraw additional troops from Iraq||The Trump administration will announce Wednesday that it is withdrawing additional troops from Iraq, as President Donald Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to disentangle the country from “endless wars.”A senior administration official discussed the draw-down with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday night, on condition of anonymity. The official said the administration is also looking to announce the withdrawal of additional troops from Afghanistan in the coming days.The planned announcements come as the president has been trying to make the case that he has fulfilled the promises he made four years ago as he tries to secure a second term.There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. In July, the top US general for the Middle East said he believed the US will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said he believes the Iraqis welcome the US and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.Trump told reporters two weeks ago that “we look forward to the day when we don’t have to be there.” The comments came during an Oval Office meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized at that same meeting that a full withdrawal of US troops would only occur once “we can complete the mission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-donald-trump-planning-to-withdraw-additional-troops-from-iraq/story-SNhJQJaTgQhIjUv6KTcxhI.html
09-09-2020||World||Donald Trump expands ban on new offshore drilling sites in Atlantic||President Donald Trump expanded a ban on new offshore drilling Tuesday, an election year reversal likely to appeal to voters in Florida and other coastal states. Two years ago, Trump had taken steps to vastly expand offshore drilling from coast to coast.“This protects your beautiful gulf and your beautiful ocean, and it will for a long time to come,” Trump said as he announced the expanded drilling ban during an appearance at the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse.The president signed a memorandum instructing the interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina for a period of 10 years — from July 1, 2022, to June 20, 2032.The existing moratorium covers the Gulf of Mexico, and Trump said the new one would also cover the Atlantic coast — a significant political concern in coastal states like Florida.Trump used the event to portray himself as an environmental steward and contrast his record against that of Democrat Joe Biden. But the Trump administration has overturned or weakened numerous regulations meant to protect air and water quality and lands essential for imperiled species.The trip comes as Trump steps up his travel to battleground states eight week before the election. From Florida, he headed for a campaign rally in North Carolina, another must-win for his re-election, before returning to the White House late Tuesday.Trump used the North Carolina stop to campaign against the state’s restrictive coronavirus guidelines, as he openly flouted the 50-person cap on outdoor events with a rally of thousands of supporters standing shoulder-to-shoulder on an airport tarmac.Also read: Trump slams Harris for doubting vaccine, says she’ll never be president“Your state should be open,” Trump said, baselessly claiming that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and others were trying to hamstring their economies with restrictions to hurt his reelection. “It’s a shame what’s going on, and I’ll tell you what, on November 4, every one of those states will be open. They’re doing it for political reasons.”Back in Florida, Trump used the taxpayer-funded event to lambaste his opponent with claims that Biden would “destroy America’s middle class” and give a “free pass to the world’s worst foreign polluters.”Biden has called for eliminating carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and modernizing the electric grid. Both moves would curtail fossil fuel demand. His plan also includes significant direct public spending and tax subsidies for other energy sources, which Biden’s campaign says would spur new jobs even as traditional energy jobs wane.Biden calls out China as the world’s biggest coal polluter and says he’d hinge all future trade deals with Beijing on carbon reductions. He supports an international alliance to help other nations afford low-carbon development and pitches a global moratorium on Arctic offshore drilling.The announcement could open Trump to charges of an election year flip-flop given that in January 2018 he acted to vastly expand offshore drilling from the Atlantic to the Arctic oceans and he has supported efforts to boost American energy production to lessen reliance on foreign sources.Biden accused Trump of “conveniently” changing his mind.“Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida,” Biden tweeted. “Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable. You don’t have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling.”Trump offered himself as the greatest environmental president since Theodore Roosevelt.“Who would have thought? Trump is the great environmentalist,” the president said. “You hear that? That’s good, and I am. I am. I believe strongly in it.”But Trump has rolled back numerous regulations designed to protect the environment, from power plant emissions to auto fuel standards to clean water. He withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Accord, a global agreement to address the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.The environment has also been the primary target of Trump’s push to eliminate regulations, eliminating or weakening dozens of rules that protect the air and water, along with lands essential for imperiled species while reversing Obama-era initiatives to fight climate change.Trump replaced Obama’s Clean Power Plan aimed at slashing greenhouse gas pollution from electric plants and eased automobile fuel economy standards. Under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency stripped federal protection from millions of acres of streams and wetlands. He lifted restrictions on oil and gas exploration in sensitive areas and shortened environmental reviews of construction projects such as highways and pipelines.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a longtime Trump ally who has opposed the administration’s drilling exploration expansion plans, applauded Tuesday’s announcement as “good news” but warned “we must remain vigilant in the conservation and preservation of our coastline.”Trump said he had also been discussing the moratorium with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who greeted Trump at the airport in West Palm Beach and attended the Jupiter event. About 200 people attended. Few wore face coverings or practiced social distancing.Jaclyn Lopez, Florida director for the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, said Floridians will remember it was Trump who previously proposed opening the state to drilling in the first place.“Voters shouldn’t be duped by this cheap, last-minute maneuver,” Lopez said in an emailed statement. “It can’t even begin to make up for the aggressive efforts to expand dirty offshore drilling since Trump’s been in office.”Energy industry groups said the decision was the “wrong approach” for the times.“Offshore access is critical for growing US energy leadership and providing affordable energy for American families,” said Lem Smith, vice president of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, in an emailed statement. The ban “puts at risk hundreds of thousands of new jobs, US energy security advancements and billions of dollars in critical revenue for states,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-expands-ban-on-new-offshore-drilling-sites-in-atlantic/story-MOxo26fZ3DKUWZQwLJ4snN.html
09-09-2020||World||Chinese journalists based in Australia raided, says state media||China’s state media is reporting that intelligence officials raided the residences of Chinese journalists based in Australia in late June, amid heightened tensions between the trading partners.The Global Times reported the journalists were questioned and their computers and phones seized, citing a source close to the matter that it didn’t identify. Xinhua News Agency had a similar article, while the China News Service said the homes of four journalists from three Chinese media outlets were raided by Australian police on June 26, who eventually found they did nothing wrong.A request for comment on the reports to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wasn’t immediately answered.The reports come after China confirmed that Cheng Lei, an Australian television anchor, was being held over suspected state security violations hours after the last two correspondents from the country’s media outlets fled the country. Australia was informed mid-August that she had been detained.While those issues highlight the mounting political pressures on foreign press corps operating in China, they also underscore fraying ties between Beijing and Canberra after Prime Minister Scott Morrison in April called for independent investigators be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Australia has been locked in a tussle over a series of diplomatic moves that China has interpreted as supporting the U.S. in the expanding trade and security dispute between Beijing and Washington. The media are only the latest sector to get swept up in the fight, after China curbed or launched trade actions against imports of Australian beef, wine and barley.A Sydney-based lawmaker had his home and office raided by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on June 26, the same day as the raids on Chinese media are alleged to have occurred. New South Wales state lawmaker Shaoquett Moselmane later said the probe was linked to people allegedly advancing the goals of the Chinese government, and denied being a suspect.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-journalists-nased-in-australia-raided-says-state-media/story-yVx8JEOQ67zS1rLy1E4kHO.html

Rising average temperatures, combined with recent heat waves, parched ground vegetation, creating optimal fire conditions.Pilots are flying at night using night vision goggles to see through dense smoke that during the daytime can make missions impossible.“Those night vision goggles allowed us to keep on going one ridge further,” Goding said.(Reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-than-combat-helicopters-rescue-hundreds-from-california-wildfire/story-kgYNonzhOEeGqHQEHVSVgK.html

Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him; Russia has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.Germany briefed the G7, which the United States is chairing this year, on its determination that Navalny “is the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve-agent of the ‘Novichok’ group, a substance developed by Russia,” the G7 statement said.“Any use of chemical weapons, anywhere, anytime, by anybody, under any circumstances whatsoever, is unacceptable and contravenes the international norms prohibiting the use of such weapons,” the statement added, calling on Russia establish who was responsible “for this abhorrent poisoning attack.”“We will continue to monitor closely how Russia responds to international calls for an explanation of the hideous poisoning of Mr. Navalny,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-foreign-ministers-condemn-navalny-s-confirmed-poisoning/story-c4CbSuUjOZvoVrQoFYqCRJ.html

I mean, it’s clear, we have all the evidence showing what is going on in Xinjiang,” he told AFP.Coronavirus victimBaduicao accused Disney of “double standards”, embracing western social justice movements such as MeToo and Black Lives Matter, while turning a blind eye to China’s rights abuses. The live-action remake of Disney’s 1998 animation classic, “Mulan” has had a troubled release. It was meant to hit global theatres in March but became an early victim of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, Disney rocked the industry -- and its own cast -- by announcing the film would in streamed into living rooms in many markets, including the United States, which it started Friday.Hollywood has been increasingly accused of hypocrisy over its relationship with authoritarian China.In August the anti-censorship group Pen America published a report which said screenwriters, producers and directors often change scripts, delete scenes and alter content to avoid offending Chinese censors.The actions include everything from deleting the Taiwanese flag from Tom Cruise’s bomber jacket in the upcoming “Top Gun: Maverick,” to removing China as the source of a zombie virus in 2013’s “World War Z.”But it also means completely avoiding sensitive issues including Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong politics, Xinjiang and the portrayal of LGBTQ characters, the report said.AFP contacted Disney for comment but has yet to hear back on the Labor Day holiday.Xinjiang is a resource-rich region home to mostly Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs and boasts spectacular desert and mountain backdrops.After sectarian unrest and attacks by Uighur militants, Beijing blanketed the region in a draconian security crackdown, building dozens of huge internment camps.Initially China denied the camps existed before switching to describing them as voluntary re-education centres.Even before the latest Xinjiang controversy the hashtag #BoycottMulan has been trending in recent weeks Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan.Activists in all three places have launched multiple online campaigns critical of China’s authoritarianism.Dubbed the “Milk Tea Alliance” -- named after a shared love of the drink -- they seized on social media comments made last year by actress Liu supporting Hong Kong’s police.They have also noted the resemblance of actor Tzi Ma, who plays Mulan’s heroic father, to China’s leader Xi Jinping.After her arrest last month under Beijing’s new security law, young Hong Kong dissident Agnes Chow was dubbed “the real Mulan” by supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mulan-movie-boycott-calls-grow-over-scenes-filmed-in-china-s-xinjiang/story-cCRXz4Qw8T2I4wnfIQpzVM.html

The suspected cases were self-isolating for a 14-day period, he said, adding the virus had sickened people working in different UN agencies across the country.Syria has recorded 3,229 cases of Covid-19, with 137 deaths registered in zones controlled by the Damascus government.The CEOs of nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 on Tuesday pledged to “uphold the integrity of the scientific process”. “We want to make clear our ongoing commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for Covid-19 in accordance with high ethical standards,” said the CEOs. The statement was signed by AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GSK, J&J, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi.China has passed “an extraordinary and historic test” with its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday at an awards ceremony for medical professionals.“We have passed an extraordinary and historic test,” Xi said. “We quickly achieved initial success in the people’s war against the virus.

09-09-2020||World||‘Brag about your feats, run for office’: Nikki Haley to Indian Americans||The time has come for Indian Americans to get more involved in politics, Nikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the UN, said Tuesday, exhorting the minority community to embrace their accomplishments, “brag” about them and not hide behind their traditional humility and shyness.“Whether it’s Republican or Democrat,” said Hailey, a lifelong Republican herself and a rising star in the party, adding, “get involved, don’t just get involved by vote. Get involved by running, get involved within government offices, in public sectors.”“I think Indians are so good at everything they touch, it’s a natural progression to have them get involved in politics as well,” she added further.Haley chose an unusual platform for her muscular message for the community — the annual summit of US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a trade body. She was in conversation, virtually, with Ajay Banga, the MasterCard CEO, another successful Indian American like herself. Haley is by far the tallest political leader in the community. No Indian had ever held a federal cabinet-rank position before she was named by President Donald Trump as ambassador to the UN in 2017. She is also a two-time state governor, an honour she shares with Bobby Jindal, a fellow Indian-descent Republican.Haley might have to concede that community crown to another Indian-American, Kamala Harris - if she wins. Harris is running for vice-president with Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president.In growing recognition of her standing in the party, Haley, despite being out of office, landed a major speaking spot at the just concluded party convention to re-nominate President Donald Trump. She is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nominee in 2024There are an estimated 4 million Americans of Indian descent. At just about 1% of the population, they are not big in numbers. But they are the most affluent and educated community, and the most philanthropic, something that Haley said makes her feel the proudest about being Indian American.“Those are things that we should brag about because those that have come before us have worked so hard to reach these points and we have to make sure that we take to the next level,” Haley said, urging the community to speak more about its accomplishments, and flaunt them.“I think that we have to not be so shy and not be super humble, but also go out there and try and share what we know we can be good at, and I think that there’s a lot of different aspects from business to education to health care, everything in between that we can share that will add to this country and make people more proud of the Indian community that is here,” Haley added.There are no counts of the number of Indian Americans running for office at any time — because the range includes everything from the White House to the county education board and lower — but the number of those elected to the most high-profile positions has been growing over the years.From just the one, Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, the number of Indian Americans in US congress has risen to five — Harris in the Senate and Ami Bera, Pramila Jayapal, Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna in the House of Representatives.Haley is calling for more, up and down the range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brag-about-your-feats-run-for-office-nikki-haley-to-indian-americans/story-pZGOxUHBwKsGkPGFv55s6O.html
09-09-2020||World||‘Those walks in India created a commitment in me’: Harris recalls her grandfather||The Vice Presidential nominee of Democratic Party, Kamala Harris on Wednesday (local time) recalled that her grandfather, P V Gopalan would often take her on his morning walks in India, where he would discuss the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights.“As a young girl, my grandfather would often take me on his morning walks in India, where he’d discuss the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights.

09-09-2020||World||Proud daughter of Indian immigrants: Haley||Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the UN, on Monday night said she is the proud daughter of Indian immigrants while seeking to address the issue of racism as she spoke at the Republican convention to nominate President Donald Trump for a second term.“They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world,” said Haley, one of the most anticipated speakers of the opening night of the convention. She added they faced discrimination and hardship. “But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor.”Also read: Donald Trump woos Indian-American voters, with clips from Howdy ModiHaley, who was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa, has been the first and only Indian American woman governor of a US state yet of any party. She also went to hold the highest federal government office by an Indian-American as Trump’s US ambassador to the UN, a federal cabinet-rank position.Haley is widely expected to run for president someday. Many thought she was looking at a 2020 run when she left her UN job in 2019.There has been speculation though that Trump could name her his vice-presidential nominee, replacing Mike Pence, the incumbent.Haley is not on the ticket yet. But for most Indian-American Republicans, she may be as their answer to Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Harris is the daughter of a mother from India and a father from Jamaica. Harris’s nomination as vice-president made headlines around the world. She is the first Indian-American and Black woman on a presidential ticket yet.Haley and Harris are crucial to their respective party’s evolving strategies for the elections on November 3. With 1.2 million voters, Indian-Americans have emerged as a key constituency for both parties, especially in battleground states, also called swing states, that could settle the race with wafer-thin margins.“Nikki Haley is a very powerful voice with a great appeal,” said Al Mason, who leads the Trump campaign’s outreach to the Indian-American community. “As she is of Indian Heritage; Indian Americans love her. She could be a big influence on the Indian-Americans, eDspecially in the battle the ground states.”“Nikki Haley told the story of America, and it is her personal story too and similar to the most immigrant who come to this great nation,” said Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican exploring a run for Lt Governor of Virginia, a swing state with growing Asian-American population.“A proud successful governor of South Carolina, she highlighted the successes of President Trump and policies of the Republican Party.”Haley remains close to the Trump family, especially Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. And she was given a speaking slot just ahead of Don Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, who spoke on the first night of the convention, which was a mix of in-person and virtually delivered speeches by leading lawmakers and supposedly ordinary Americans with undeclared political agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-daughter-of-indian-immigrants-haley/story-wMgihsQdMGSIrUU5OvZ6cP.html
09-09-2020||World||AstraZeneca pauses Covid-19 vaccine trial just after 9 drug makers take safety pledge||AstraZeneca has announced a pause on clinical trials of a candidate vaccine for Covid-19 developed by University of Oxford to review an “unexplained illness” in one of the participants in the UK, just hours after it joined eight other drug makers to make an unusual safety pledge.Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine had started in the US last week and first doses were expected to be delivered as early as October.There was no word on how long the review will last, or if the illness was caused by the in-trial vaccine.The British-Swedish company is a front-runner in the race for a vaccine for Covid-19 that has killed nearly 900,000 people globally and infected more than 27 million. Its vaccine candidate has been undergoing late-stage trials around the world, with the India leg expected to start soon.The company said in a statement the pause in the global trials was a “routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials”.“In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully,” it added.The announcement came just hours after AstraZeneca joined eight other pharmaceutical giants to release a joint pledge to not apply for regulatory approval or authorisation of their candidate vaccines till their safety and efficacy had been established, a move that they said was “historic”.Signed by the chief executive officers of AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Sanofi, BioNTech and Pfizer, it said the companies would seek regulatory approval or authorisation for vaccines only if their safety and efficacy had been established in Phase 3 clinical trials.“The safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals (is) our top priority,” the companies said in the pledge on Tuesday, titled ‘Biopharma Leaders Unite to Stand with Science.’The companies have between themselves developed 70 novel vaccines in the past.“We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,” they added.AstraZeneca began Phase 3 clinical trials in the US on August 31 on 30,000 volunteers. Called D8110C00001, it is funded by the US department of health and human services and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is led by Dr Anthony Fauci, the foremost US epidemiologist.According to an agreement AstraZeneca had signed with the US government, it was expected to make available at least 300 million doses of the vaccine to the country, with the first lots delivered as early as October 2020, subject to approval by the Food and Drug Administration, the US drug regulator, or its European counterpart.The US has invested billions of dollars in other vaccine projects as well, under a multi-agency programme called ‘Operation Warp Speed’.The safety pledge by the vaccine companies came amid growing perception that despite him claims to the contrary, President Donald Trump is rushing the search for a vaccine breakthrough before November 3, the election day, to help his re-election chances.Also Read: Russian vaccine trials show strong immune response, The Lancet reportsMany Americans are sceptical of the vaccine search and will not be queueing up for a shot when one becomes available, according to polls. A CBS/YouGov poll released on Sunday found that 65% respondents would think the vaccine is “rushed through”, if they were told it had been found. The rest said they would call it a “scientific achievement”.Only 21% of them will try to get a shot “as soon as possible”, down from 32% in July; and 58% will “wait to see what happens”, up from 51% in July. It’s a trend that has been reflected in many recent polls, showing growing scepticism about a coronavirus vaccine.Lately, the president has clashed with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris for their scepticism about his claims. He has demanded an apology from Harris for saying she “would not trust” the president on a vaccine.The Biden-Harris campaign doubled down on their criticism of the president on Tuesday, asking for the criteria that would be used to determine the vaccine is safe and works, who will make that determination and if the vaccine will be distributed “free, safely, equitably, and without politics”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-pauses-covid-19-vaccine-trial-just-after-9-drug-makers-take-safety-pledge/story-RynVLw8YEYgriGUpaX0dcP.html
