One was trapped with leg injuries, and had to be lowered to the ground by crane, Atlanta Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Glen Riley told reporters at the scene.Firefighters communicated with a crane operator using a construction worker’s radio to remove the worker who was trapped, Riley said.“That was an awesome job,” he said.A firefighter was also taken to a hospital with likely heat exhaustion, Riley said.The collapse involved a prefabricated parking deck under construction in Atlanta’s Midtown section, officials from Atlanta Fire Rescue said in a statement.There are concerns that more of the structure could collapse and fall onto the Downtown Connector, a busy thoroughfare through the heart of the city, Riley said. An on-ramp to that freeway was being closed as a precaution.“If the wall collapses, it may extend to the expressway,” he said.City inspectors planned to examine the structure in the next few hours, he said.The parking structure is near Emory University Hospital Midtown, in a commercial area just southeast of the Georgia Institute of Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parking-deck-collapse-in-atlanta-leaves-five-workers-injured/story-PR0gn5H7fri4WtMwq0cDfI.html
11-09-2020||World||No cameras allowed at Floyd criminal proceedings, for now||When four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death appeared for an omnibus hearing Friday, no cameras were allowed — just as at all other hearings so far in the case.In Minnesota, unlike many other states, cameras are not allowed before the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings unless both prosecution and defense agree. Attorneys for the officers have said they want cameras, but the prosecution team — led by state Attorney General Keith Ellison — has so far resisted. In a court filing, they have warned the cameras could change the way attorneys present evidence, force participants to endure even more media scrutiny and even intimidate witnesses.Prosecutors have said they might change their minds before the trial’s scheduled start in March. A coalition of media organizations, including The Associate Press, has requested access for cameras, arguing that they will increase transparency, especially with the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic may restrict access to court proceedings for the media and spectators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-cameras-allowed-at-floyd-criminal-proceedings-for-now/story-1K9z1G6bzW1WIJd4aQWeMI.html

He delivered remarks at the memorial site near Shanksville in Pennsylvania. Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden crossed paths at the 9/11 memorial site in New York, where on this day in 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people in the worst-ever terrorist attacks in the recent memories. At 8:46 AM local time, Trump and Melania participated in a moment of silence in a conference room cabin of the Air Force One to commemorate the moment the first plane hit the World Trade Center. “God bless America,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said when the moment of silence was concluded. “God Bless America,” the president repeated. “The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back,” Trump said in his address at the Flight 93 national memorial site in Shanksville. “Nineteen years ago, on this day at this very hour on this field 40 brave men and women try out over terror and gave their lives in defence of our nation. Their names and their stories are forever inscribed on the eternal rollcall of American heroes. Today we pay tribute to their sacrifice and we mourn deeply for the nearly 3,000 precious and beautiful souls that were taken from us on September 11, 2001. “While we cannot erase your pain, we can help to shoulder your burden…,” the president said. Other hijacked planes struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center and then the South Tower and then the Pentagon. “The terrorist on Flight 93 had a fourth target in mind. It was called our nation’s capital. They were just 20 minutes away from reaching their sinister objective. The only thing that stood between the enemy and a deadly strike at the heart of American democracy was the courage and resolve of 40 men and women, the amazing passengers and crew of flight 93,” he said. In New York, both Pence and Biden visited the 9/11 memorial. “In the memory of all those we lost on this day 19 years ago, in memory of the heroes that were forged that day and heroes forged on battlefields ever since and for the families, loved ones, and friends they left behind, I pray these ancient words will comfort your hearts and ours,” Pence said in his brief remarks as he read verses from Psalm 23. Biden said: “Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short on that God-awful September day: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of sons and daughters, parents, siblings, grandchildren and grandparents, neighbours and friends — loved ones faced with the harrowing, hollowing news that the dearest thing in their life had been suddenly taken away”. “Like a generation once did in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this generation of Americans bore the burden that history placed on our shoulders that day. “And this year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans, testing our resolve and character with each passing day,” Biden, who also visited the memorial in Shanksville, said. Defence Secretary Mark Esper led the ceremony at the Pentagon memorial. “It was a vicious assault directed not just at our people and our institutions, but also at our most sacred ideals, freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, in their attempt to shake the very foundations of our republic, to destroy our way of life, they underestimated our strength, our resolve and our unbreakable spirit. “We came together as a nation on that fateful day and witnessed a tremendous outpouring of courage, compassion and sacrifice amid the grief, darkness and the disarray,” Esper added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-first-lady-mark-9-11-moment-of-silence-on-air-force-1/story-ZQzDqghs1kxWuxLqr1nhsI.html

If we don’t fight for our freedom, we live like a slave and we promote a deadly ideology,” he said.Charlie Hebdo’s republication of the cartoons drew new condemnation from states including Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. But Sourisseau, who now lives under round the clock protection, said it had to republish them.“If we had given up the right to publish these cartoons, that would mean that we were wrong to do so” in the first place, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/al-qaeda-threatens-charlie-hebdo-for-republishing-mohammed-cartoons-site/story-7N9XjwnCaJhnhihAOkBmQJ.html

Opening direct dialogue and ties between these two dynamic societies and advanced economies will continue the positive transformation of the Middle East and increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region,” the joint statement said.The Israel-UAE accord, announced Aug. 13, is to be signed on Tuesday at the White House.The statement said Bahrain accepted Trump’s invitation to join Israel and the UAE at the signing ceremony. It said Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani of Bahrain will be signing a “historic Declaration of Peace” at the event.The parties “will continue their efforts in this regard to achieve a just, comprehensive, and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to enable the Palestinian people to realize their full potential,” the joint statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-agrees-to-normalise-ties-with-israel-says-trump/story-5UT0rhxGMSzjx46jcU3tYI.html

It also is testing the vaccine in thousands of people in Britain, and in smaller studies in Brazil and South Africa. Several other Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in development.Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, said the U.N. health agency wasn’t overly concerned by the pause in the Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine trial, describing it as “a wake-up call” to the global community about the inevitable ups and downs of medical research.Temporary holds of large medical studies aren’t unusual, and investigating any serious or unexpected reaction is a mandatory part of safety testing.AstraZeneca pointed out that it’s possible the problem could be a coincidence; illnesses of all sorts could arise in studies of thousands of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-trial-stopped-after-neurological-symptoms-detected-in-volunteer-astrazeneca/story-lWrJvqiN5dEZjyBE9gl9eI.html

He (Donald Trump) would push anything to get re-elected. Don’t fall for it, and by the way, I would take the vaccine if Ivanka takes it,” Behar is heard saying on the show.Taking up the challenge, Ivanka Trump took to Twitter to root for the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).“Deal @JoyVBehar. I would come on your show to do so. I trust the FDA and so should all Americans. Vanquishing this virus should be our collective top priority," she tweeted. Deal @JoyVBehar. I would come on your show to do so.I trust the FDA and so should all Americans. Vanquishing this virus should be our collective top priority. https://t.co/FXb0DqjdioNot just from Behar, but Trump has been receiving a lot of criticism on his promised Covid-19 vaccine, many calling it a campaign tactic to gain advantage at the upcoming US presidential election.On many occasions including campaign rallies, Trump has claimed a vaccine for coronavirus will have been found by the end of this year.Trump on Monday insisted that a vaccine may be ready “even before a very special date”, referring to November 3, the Election Day. “We are producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we are gonna have soon, very very soon...by the end of the year but much sooner than that perhaps,” Trump had said.On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and vote to elect a new government for the next four years or re-elect the Trump for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-will-take-covid-vaccine-on-your-show-ivanka-trump-accepts-tv-host-joy-behar-s-challenge/story-PT7xs0vF956lnJfqqr717N.html

The head was sitting on the chest, Trump is believed to have said to the writer.Jang Song Thaek, accused of treason, was executed in 2013.Five things to know about Jang Song Thaek:1. Jang Song Thaek became part of North Korea’s first family by marriage. He got married to one of the daughters of North Korea’s founder kim Il Sung, Kim Kyong Hui. Both attended Kim Il Sung university. The duo got married in 1972. they had a daughter who reportedly killed herself in 2006. 2. When Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, it is believed that Jang helped him cement his authorities.3. He was believed to be a reformist who wanted to open the doors of North Korea.4. Jang Song Thaek’s execution was one of the major purges that Kim Jong Un undertook after he came to power. Pyongang accused Jang of plotting to overthrow the government. Jang was described as “worse than a dog”, and “despicable human scum” by North Korea’s official news agency KCNA.5. Several conspiracy theories floated about how Jang was killed. It was rumoured that he was stripped naked and fed to dogs. But the account was later attributed to a satirical post that appeared on a Chinese social media network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-showed-off-headless-body-of-his-executed-uncle-all-you-need-to-know-about-jang-song-thaek/story-1JPaONyTIlUgpispkfMnbP.html

The move prompted China to issue its own sanctions against several prominent Americans, including prominent senators and senior figures in US-based human rights organisations.President Donald Trump has also provoked a furious reaction from Chinese officials by blaming Beijing for the global spread of the coronavirus, saying authorities there failed to contain the pandemic in its early stages. And Washington has also accused Chinese tech firms and platforms -- from Huawei to TikTok -- of working in the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.Beijing denied on Friday it was attempting to meddle in the upcoming US presidential election after American tech giant Microsoft said it had thwarted cyberattacks from overseas groups -- including from China -- against both the Republican and Democratic campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-impose-restrictions-on-all-us-diplomats-in-china/story-viKm4R3qoVORU4ALQjzH3M.html
11-09-2020||World||India-US statement panned Pak over terror. China rushes to its defence||China on Friday staunchly defended Pakistan’s record in fighting terrorism, saying its all-weather ally has made “tremendous efforts and sacrifices”, countering calls by India and the US that Islamabad must ensure that its territory is not used for terror activities. India and the US in a joint statement after the 17th meeting of the India-US Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and the third session of the India-US Designations Dialogue held on September 9-10, denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms.New Delhi and Washington Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai strike and the Pathankot airbase attack.Asked for his reaction, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian during a media briefing here said that terrorism is a common challenge faced by all countries and Pakistan has made “tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting terrorism.“The international community should fully recognise and respect that. China opposes all kind of terrorism. All countries on the bases of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit engage in anti-terrorism international cooperation to jointly safeguard the international peace and security,” he said.On the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Zhao said that the terror attack brought many challenges to global security.“Now, the counter-terrorism situation is still severe and has posed risks to all countries,” he said.Watch: China defends Pakistan after India & US call for action against terror “China opposes all kind of terrorism and we believe that the UN should play a leading role and we oppose double standards on counter-terrorism and we oppose the attempt to link the terrorism to any specific country,” he said.He emphasised that all countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard world’s peace and stability.“So on this very special day, I would like to say that we hope the US won’t forget terrorism and Covid-19 are common enemies to all mankind. And China and Pakistan are not the enemies of the US,” he said.About the meeting between Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on Thursday on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he said Wang assured that China will continue to provide Pakistan with anti-epidemic support until Pakistan completely overcomes the Covid-19 pandemic.“China will like to work with Pakistan in advancing the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and further agricultural cooperation, which will deliver benefits to people,” Zhao said.India has objected to the USD 60 billion CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK).“We believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, the corridor will play a greater role in Pakistan’s economic development and people’s welfare,” he said.China will continue working with Pakistan, firmly supporting each other on international multilateral occasions to uphold international fairness and justice, he said.“Next year is the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. We will build on our friendship, plan for the future, and make new progress in our bilateral relations,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-close-ally-pak-made-tremendous-efforts-sacrifices-in-fighting-terrorism/story-LZxqQ8qKl5oPl5qHsRB0EK.html
11-09-2020||World||‘Nirav Modi won’t get fair trial in India’: Ex-SC judge Katju tells London court||Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi will not get a fair trial in India if extradited to face charges of major financial offences, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju claimed on Friday while deposing as a defence witness in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court.Appearing via video link from New Delhi, Katju alleged in his 130-minute deposition that the judicial system in India had collapsed, claiming that investigative agencies such as the CBI and Enforcement Directorate were acting at the behest of political masters.The five-day hearing is part of Nirav Modi’s extradition trial in which the judge needs to decide whether there is a prima facie case against him in India on the basis of evidence submitted by the government of India – not to reach a judgement of conviction or guilt.Katju talked about several cases and issues to substantiate his allegations, including the 2019 Ayodhya judgement by a Supreme Court bench headed by former chief justice Ranjan Gogoi, the latter’s subsequent nomination as a Rajya Sabha MP, the post-retirement appointment of judges, media trials and alleged corruption in the judiciary.Questioning law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s claim in a press conference in May that Modi was a “criminal”, Katju said: “The government of India has made up its mind that Nirav Modi is a criminal. Is Prasad the judge? What kind of law minister is he? How can we expect a fair trial?”“All ministers have pronounced him (Modi) guilty and the courts will do what they say…The present government needs a scapegoat to divert attention from other issues. Nirav Modi is the scapegoat, blamed for all ills,” the retired top court judge claimed.“They have already pronounced him a criminal. I am definite that he will not get a fair trial in India. No lawyer will pick up his case. The justice system has collapsed; it is beyond redemption; it has bowed before political masters.”Katju clarified that he cannot say anything about the charges of financial offences brought against Nirav Modi by CBI and ED, since he is not aware of the details, but repeated several times that he will not get a fair trial under the present circumstances.Recalling the SC’s 2013 description of the CBI as a “caged parrot”, Katju alleged that things had worsened, claiming that CBI and ED were not politically neutral, with the Central Vigilance Commission “doing nothing”. According to him, such agencies had become “tools of political masters”.Helen Malcolm, appearing on India’s behalf, questioned Katju about speaking to the news media in India on Thursday about his court appearance, and wondered if it was anything to do with his being a “self-publicist” keen to exploit the high-profile case.Malcolm read out Katju’s remarks published in the past on same-sex relationships, about single women allegedly being prone to psychological problems, about “90% Indians are fools”, provoking agitated responses from Katju. At one point, he said: “I know more English literature than you”.Malcolm said: “I don’t want to be discourteous but is it possible that you are a self-publicist who will make any outrageous comment to reach the press in this high-profile case. It is up to others to make a judgement about the use of your evidence”.Katju said that Malcolm’s accusation that he is motivated by personal vanity or vainglory is not fair.The next date of hearing in the case is November 3 and the judgement on Modi’s extradition is expected in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-a-scapegoat-ex-sc-judge-katju-tells-uk-court/story-lFS0QgEXzAHAkDk1rakO0L.html

ByteDance decided last year to locate its regional headquarters in Singapore, which in recent years has ramped up efforts to attract tech firms and investors, the source said.“Even though we are in the midst of an uncertain environment, many companies from all over the world ... continue to grow their operations in Singapore to serve Asia and international markets,” Kiren Kumar, executive vice president of Singapore Economic Development Board said.PayPal, Siemens, Twitter and Zoom had said that they were investing in Singapore this year, Kumar added. Bloomberg earlier reported that ByteDance was planning to make the city-state its beachhead for the rest of Asia as part of its global expansion plans and set up a data centre there.However, the source told Reuters that ByteDance has yet to make a decision about such a move, while another source said TikTok had this year moved some engineers there from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-invest-billions-in-singapore-over-three-years-report/story-VQM763GwTepvjnJaBALrbM.html
11-09-2020||World||UK secures first major post-Brexit trade deal with Japan as talks with EU turn sour||The UK secured its first major post-Brexit trade deal on Friday after signing an agreement with Japan just as discussions with the European Union appeared to be teetering on the brink of collapse.The deal, which has so far only been agreed upon in principle and for which details are thin, will increase commerce with Japan by around 15 billion pounds ($19 billion), the UK said.“The agreement we have negotiated — in record time and in challenging circumstances — goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,” said Britain’s international trade secretary, Liz Truss, who pointed to concessions on English sparkling wine and Wensleydale cheese.The government said UK businesses will benefit from tariff-free trade on 99% of exports to Japan and that it will give British businesses a gateway to the Asia-Pacific region. Overall, it said the deal with Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, will deliver a 1.5 billion-pound boost to the UKBritain’s Conservative government has said that one of the benefits of Brexit is that it allows the country to negotiate trade deals with whoever it wishes — the EU negotiates trade deals on behalf of its members.Skeptics say the deal with Japan is little different to the one already in place via the UK’s former membership of the EU. They also say that nothing can mitigate for the losses Britain would suffer in the event of a ‘no-deal’ outcome with the EU. Such a scenario would see tariffs and other impediments imposed on trade between the UK and the EU. Though both sides would suffer from the new barriers to trade, most economists think Britain would be hit disproportionately.In 2019, the UK exported some 36.7 billion pounds of goods to Germany, Europe’s largest-economy, or 10% of its total. Exports to Japan were just 7.2 billion pounds, or 1.9% of the total.The talks with the EU have not collapsed yet and discussions are set to resume on Monday in Brussels. Though the UK left the bloc on Jan. 31, it is in a transition period that effectively sees it benefit from tariff-free trade until the end of this year. The discussions are about agreeing on the broad outlines of the trading relationship from the start of 2021.Concerns over a post-Brexit deal have heightened in the past few days since the British government said that new legislation breaches parts of the withdrawal agreement, which allowed for the country’s smooth departure from the bloc.The diplomatic shockwaves from the British announcement could derail any hopes Prime Minister Boris Johnson may have of negotiating a U.S. trade deal. The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned the British government that there will be “absolutely no chance” of a trade deal if the UK violates its international obligations as they apply to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Congress has to ratify all U.S. trade deals.Even before the current standoff, the trade discussions with the EU had made little progress, with the two sides wide apart on business regulations, the extent to which the UK can support certain industries and over the EU fishing fleet’s access to British waters.The renewed Brexit uncertainties come as the British economy gradually recovers from a deep recession caused by the shutdown of businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by a month-on-month rate of 6.6% in July as many sectors, including pubs and restaurants, started reopening. Despite the increase, the economy remains 11.7% smaller than it was in February.The looming end of a salary-support scheme that will likely see unemployment rise and the heightened Brexit uncertainties are expected to weigh on growth in the months ahead.Former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, urged the government to provide more support for those likely to be unemployed after the end of the Job Retention Scheme in October and to avoid a “huge act of self-harm” in its discussions with the EU.“We’ve got a cliff-edge on the furlough scheme on Oct. 31 and we’ve now got a cliff-edge on Brexit,” he told BBC radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-secures-first-major-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-japan-as-talks-with-eu-turn-sour/story-VhqFBPJx09gJHazWDfBhrN.html

And Pakistan has made tremendous efforts and sacrificed in fighting terrorism. The international community should fully recognise and respect that,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular briefing.His remarks came a day after a joint statement at the end of the 17th meeting of the US-India Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and the third session of the Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10.It said India and the US “underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot.” Also Read: Pak needs to take irreversible action against terror groups: Indo-US joint statementNoting that Friday is the 19th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks on the US, Zhao said: “All countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard world’s peace and stability. So, on this very special day I would like to say that we hope the US won’t forget terrorism and Covid-19 are common enemies to all mankind. And China and Pakistan are not the enemies of the US.”“China opposes all kind of terrorism and we believe that the UN should play a leading role and we oppose double standards on counter terrorism. And we oppose the attempt to link the terrorism to any specific country,” he added.Zhao said that all countries should work together to prevent and fight terrorism and safeguard world’s peace and stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-pak-on-terrorism-after-strong-india-us-statement/story-9P1oRsicxl6F2YKN4cMSRM.html
11-09-2020||World||Trump, Biden to commemorate Sept 11 attacks in Pennsylvania, New York||President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will commemorate the 19th anniversary on Friday of the Sept. 11 attacks, with both candidates separately visiting the rural Pennsylvania field where one of the hijacked planes crashed.Biden and his wife, Jill, will first attend a morning ceremony in lower Manhattan in New York, where al Qaeda hijackers flew two airplanes into the World Trade Center’s twin towers. Republican Vice President Mike Pence will also be on hand for the ceremony.Trump will speak at a morning ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, a White House official said. The event, in remembrance of the 40 passengers and crew who died when the plane plunged into a field after they struggled with the hijackers, will be closed to the public because of coronavirus concerns, the National Park Service said.Later in the day, the Bidens will visit the Shanksville site to pay their respects to the victims. The two candidates were not expected to cross paths in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is vital to the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Biden.Flight 93, bound for San Francisco from Newark, New Jersey, never hit its intended target — the four hijackers were believed to be planning to crash it into either the US Capitol or the White House — after passengers stormed the cockpit and attempted to regain control of the aircraft.In all, nearly 3,000 people died in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which also included a fourth hijacked plane that slammed into the Pentagon outside Washington.The ceremonies marking the attacks are a regular stop for presidential candidates and officials. Trump visited Shanksville for the 9/11 anniversary in 2018, and has attended memorial ceremonies at the Pentagon.Biden went to memorials in Shanksville during his years as vice president under Barack Obama.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton both visited the Ground Zero memorial in New York on the anniversary of 9/11.Biden’s campaign said it was pulling its television ads off the air on Friday to commemorate the anniversary of the attacks.The non-profit 9/11 Day had asked both campaigns to pull its ads. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-to-commemorate-september-11-attacks-in-pennsylvania-new-york/story-FRKHxThXLkotImGjMaLeaN.html

It said the two agreed that the current situation in the border areas “is not in the interest of either side.” “They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.”Jaishankar and Wang had “held full, in-depth discussion with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on the situation in the border areas as well as bilateral ties here on Thursday,” the Xinhua report said.It quoted Wang as saying that it is normal for China and India to have differences as two neighbouring major countries. “What is important is to put these differences in a proper context vis-a-vis bilateral relation,” the report said, quoting the senior Chinese official.Also Read: India, China differences remain despite five-point consensus on easing tensionsState-run hawkish nationalist tabloid Global Times carried opinion pieces, saying the ball is now in New Delhi’s court to resolve the tensions.In an editorial published ahead of the meeting, the tabloid said Beijing’s talks with India “come with war preparedness”.On the outcome of the bilateral meeting, the tabloid said it exceeded the “expectations of most international observers and created favorable conditions for a possible future meeting between the leaders of the two countries”.The article then quickly changed track to say the “successful implementation of the joint statement, however, depends on whether the Indian side can truly keep its word.”Quoting experts, it argued that it is possible that the joint statement will end up as merely “paper talk,” if India did not follow-up.“We should not only observe what India says, but also what it does. For a country like India, the most important thing is how it acts,” it quoted Hu Zhiyong, from the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, as saying.In a separate opinion piece, the tabloid’s editor Hu Xijin claimed the border tension is a result of the aggressive attitude of the Indian army.“The meeting between the two foreign ministers maintained the political communication channels between the two sides under the current critical situation. However, due to the huge differences in the understanding of the actual border control line between the two sides, the Indian army adopted an aggressive stance on the ground,” Hu wrote in a commentary published in Mandarin.“The two foreign ministers eased the political situation. Whether the wishes can be implemented on the spot is uncertain,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-state-media-cautiously-welcomes-india-china-joint-statement/story-bAAPIHV8IU5JZGVBZ5B0FP.html

He called for a swift investigation.Many Lebanese are frustrated that they have yet to be told about any initial findings from a probe into last month’s explosion that killed about 190 people and injured 6,000.The government resigned after the port blast, and Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib is racing to form a new cabinet by early next week to meet a two-week deadline agreed under French pressure. Forming a government in Lebanon usually takes months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-firefighters-douse-remains-of-beirut-port-fire/story-TbUcISpgqg7grJnuqvFaVN.html
11-09-2020||World||Russian police seek to question Alexei Navalny in Germany||Russian police said Friday they were seeking to question opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Berlin after Moscow rubbished Germany’s declaration that he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. The 44-year-old Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia and was hospitalised there before being flown to Berlin.Germany reported “unequivocal evidence” that he was poisoned with the nerve agent but Russia says its doctors found no trace of poison.The Siberian transport police, who have been retracing Navalny’s movements, said in a statement that Russia would be preparing a request for its officers and an “expert” to shadow German investigators.Also read: US could restrict funds for ‘malign activities’ over Navalny poisoningThe police said following reports that Navalny had emerged from a coma, officers could “ask clarifying and additional questions” and be present as “German colleagues carry out investigative activities with Navalny, medics and experts”.The Kremlin has denounced attempts to blame the Russian state for the poisoning as “absurd” and said it wants to know what happened.International politicians have said the incident appears likely to have been state-ordered and urged Moscow to prove its lack of involvement.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday there was a “substantial chance” the order to poison the dissident “came from senior Russian officials,” a claim the Kremlin slammed as “unacceptable”.Navalny’s associates say the use of Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, shows only the Russian state could be responsible.The case has prompted international calls for Russia to carry out a transparent investigation or risk sanctions, but the country has not opened a criminal investigation saying its medics did not find evidence of poison in tests.Siberian transport police have been conducting a “check” into what happened and on Friday published some findings on Navalny’s activities.Wine and cocktail They identified where Navalny stayed, what he and ate and that he drank “wine and an alcoholic cocktail”. They confirmed that he visited the “Vienna Coffeehouse” at the airport at Tomsk where supporters suspect he was poisoned with a cup of tea.The police also said they had questioned all those accompanying Navalny except for one woman, Marina Pevchikh, who “lives permanently in Britain”.They were now working to trace passengers on the flight from Tomsk to Moscow where Navalny fell ill on August 20, the statement said.Russia has repeatedly complained that Germany has not answered its request to see the medical data that led to the declaration that Navalny had been poisoned with Novichok. Russian doctors nevertheless said they administered an antidote to nerve agents that was also used by doctors at the Berlin hospital now treating the anti-corruption campaigner.Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya told the Security Council on Thursday that Russian doctors “saved Alexei Navalny”, Russian news agencies reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-police-seek-to-question-alexei-navalny-in-germany/story-ZZ7g5hmVs5biRi7ip4RxaM.html
11-09-2020||World||Abe plan for land-attack counterpunch could mark major military shift for Japan||Months before he announced his resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set in motion a policy change that could for the first time allow Japan’s military to plan for strikes on land targets in China and other parts of Asia.Japan’s Self Defence Forces are geared toward stopping attackers in the air and the sea. The policy change would direct the military to create a doctrine for targeting enemy sites on land - a mission that would require the purchase of long-range weapons such as cruise missiles.If adopted by the next government, the policy would mark one of the most significant shifts in Japan’s military stance since the end of World War Two. It reflects Abe’s longstanding push for a more robust military and Tokyo’s deepening concern about Chinese influence in the region. The Japanese government is worried by China’s increased military activity around disputed East China Sea islets.“The main reason for our action is China. We haven’t really emphasised that too much, but the security choices we make are because of China,” Masahisa Sato, a lawmaker from Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party who has served as a deputy defence minister and a deputy foreign minister, said in an interview.Japan renounced its right to wage war after World War Two, making the issue of striking targets on land - which would entail attacks on foreign soil - contentious for its Asian neighbours, particularly China. Abe said last month he was stepping down because of worsening health. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who is seen as less hawkish than Abe but is closely aligned with him, is expected to win the race to replace him as party leader and become premier.GOVERNMENT POLICYAbe instructed senior defence policymakers in June to come up with LDP proposals for the military that included a land-attack, or strike, doctrine. That proposal will become government policy if it is included in a revised national defence strategy, which appears likely, according to two insiders, including LDP acting Secretary General Tomomi Inada. “I don’t think there is much opposition to it in the LDP,” Inada told Reuters. “That direction doesn’t change even with a new prime minister.”The military can already use long-range missiles to strike ships. It considers such plans justified because it needs to be able to destroy weapons threatening Japan. The land-attack proposal is framed using the same reasoning, according to former defence minister Itsunori Onodera.Therefore, proponents say, Japan’s laws will not need to change. During his eight years in office, Abe pushed for but failed to achieve his goal of revising the post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9.Japan’s National Security Council, which Abe leads and includes key cabinet officials, including Suga, will meet Friday to discuss defence strategy.US-made BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles would be an option for land-attack weapons, said Katsutoshi Kawano, who until last year was Japan’s most senior military officer, the Chairman of Self Defense Forces Chief of Staffs.Tomahawks can hit targets 2,500 kilometres (1,553 miles) away. That would put most of China and much of the Russian Far East within range.“Japan could probably have strike capability within five years,” Kawano said. “A full strike package including targeting satellites and electronic warfare components would, however, be far more expensive and take more than 10 years to acquire.”In the meantime, Japan would have to rely on the United States for intelligence and surveillance. POLITICSTo move the proposal forward, the next government will need to complete a revised defence strategy and midterm procurement plan by the end of December, before the defence ministry submits its annual budget request. That could meet resistance from the LDP’s coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which worries such a move would antagonise China and threaten Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. “It could spark an arms race and raise tension. It would be technically difficult and would require huge investment,” Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said in an interview. “This is something that has to be thought seriously about under the new Prime Minister.”Even some LDP’s security hawks, including one of Suga’s leadership rivals, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, see a potential downside to acquiring long-range cruise missiles. “What happens if the United States asks Japan to fire them, and we don’t want to?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abe-plan-for-land-attack-counterpunch-could-mark-major-military-shift-for-japan/story-h7OidNNxR3bMghXKGZDhMI.html
11-09-2020||World||Khalistan fantasy exists due to Pak support: Think tank report author||The idea of a Sikh homeland is a fantasy that exists only due to the backing of Pakistan to Khalistan extremists, says the author of an explosive report detailing Islamabad’s role in fomenting terrorism in Punjab and keeping the issue alive abroad.Veteran Canadian journalist Terry Milewski, who wrote the report Khalistan: A Project of Pakistan, also asserted that the so-called Referendum 2020 will only be voted on by those who are already separatist elements and thus may result in skewing the outcome.“I believe that without Pakistan they (Khalistanis) wouldn’t have much to live for. It would be all rhetorical, all performative, with no substance,” Milewski told Hindustan Times in an interview.“This thing isn’t real, it’s just a fantasy. Pakistan gives them something, gives the Khalistanis an illusion that their dream might become a reality,” said Milewki, who spent decades with Canada’s national broadcaster CBC, including years as a prime time news host.Milewski said his objective behind bringing out the report at this time was because the Punjab Referendum 2020, organised by the separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), is scheduled for November. He pointed out that election results in India have clearly shown that Khalistan has little popular support, and that even within the Sikh community in Canada, the vast majority will not participate in the process. However, that will ensure the results of the referendum are skewed in favour of those that actually support Khalistan. “The problem is, it’s a referendum of the people that support the referendum,” he said.The results, however insignificant they may be, “is designed to rally supporters” of a waning Khalistan cause, he added.Milewski’s report was released by the think tank MacDonald-Laurier Institute (MLI) in Ottawa. It places the focus sharply upon Pakistan’s role in the Khalistan issue, which it fanned since the 1970s and continues to till this day.It traces the origins of the Khalistan project to Zulqikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistani prime minister in the early 1970s. It was fomented further by military dictator Zia ul Haq. The report also points to the links of Canadians involved in the movement to Pakistan, including the visits of Talwinder Singh Parmar there. Parmar is considered the mastermind behind the bombing of Kanishka, the Air India flight 182, in June 1985, which claimed 329 lives and remains the worst incident of terrorism in Canadian history. However, many Khalistani elements refuse to believe that fact, or continue to consider him a martyr. Milewski said this “fosters denial and rejection of the Canadian court system” and creates a conspiracy theory catchment like QAnon in the US. “The problem is not they’re planning assassinations and terrorist attacks in Canada, they are telling their children Parmar was a martyr that he was innocent,” he said. Milewski has often faced attacks over his reporting on the matter, including the argument that there was no violence associated with the Khalistan movement in Canada since the mid-1980s. That argument, he said, isn’t completely valid since “death threats against witnesses in the Air India case are still in operation today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalistan-fantasy-exists-due-to-pak-support-think-tank-report-author/story-TFBwKJBkU4QJehBVHQD4xH.html
11-09-2020||World||India-China joint statement stresses need for more confidence building||The joint statement issued after the foreign ministers of India and China met in Moscow proposes a new set of confidence building measures (CBMs) to maintain peace along the disputed boundary, an indication that existing bilateral agreements have failed to cover the cracks in trust between the troops of the two countries at the border.“The two foreign ministers agreed that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite the completion of new mutual trust-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquility in the border area,” said the statement issued after external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met in Moscow on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting on Thursday.It did not detail what the CBMs could be but does indicate New Delhi and Beijing believe more measures need to be put in place before the situation spirals out of control in the hostile Himalayan terrain.The priority, of course, is first to disengage the two militaries along the points of friction.The ongoing, four-month long tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh indicates that some half-a-dozen boundary agreements and dozens of rounds of talks – including 22 rounds under the high-profile Special Representatives (SR) mechanism – failed to prevent what happened on the night of June 15 in Galwan Valley – the death of soldiers and the rapid erosion of trust.Until now, the main agreements which bind New Delhi and Beijing to maintain peace at the border are the Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border (1993), Agreement on Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field along the Line of Actual Control in the Sino-Indian Border (1996), and Border Defence Cooperation Agreement between India and China (2013), which list ways to reduce misunderstandings between the two countries along the border, including prohibiting one side from actively following or tailing the patrols of the other side.Other agreements signed in 2005 and 2012 talk about building CBMs, the political parameters and guiding principles of settling the boundary question and the setting up of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on China-India Border Affairs.New Delhi believes that Beijing’s action at Galwan Valley reneged on three of the key bilateral agreements – of 1993, 1996 and 2013 – which have kept the disputed boundary mostly quiet.Evidently, more needs to be done.“The Indian side does not consider the development of India-China relations to be dependent on the settlement of the boundary question and India does not want to go backwards,” a read-out from China on the meeting said, quoting Jaishankar.It is, however, fairly clear that the boundary issue, especially after the current round of tension and the death of troops, are tied to the overall relationship.The friction and violence have impacted economic and trade ties besides dampening people-to-people exchanges – all in a year that’s marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-India diplomatic relations.The new round of friction has also hit the expanding economic interdependence between the two countries.To be sure, the planned new CBMs to maintain peace at the border need to zero in on and address the gaps in trust at the ground-level between the two militaries.The problem is the fact that LAC is not demarcated – perceptions differ on both sides. There also needs to be a consensus among the top leadership on the new CBMs, which may not be that easy.“Both leaders (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping) are embracing a more assertive posture toward all rivals, including each other; attributing military tensions to the other side’s hostility, and demanding that soldiers be firm to defend national borders and strongly push back against perceived aggression,” Toby Dalton and Tong Zhao from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace write in a research paper on the ongoing tensions.Jaishankar and Wang, however, seem to agree that there is an urgent need to disengage from the hostility and reset the engagement both diplomatically and militarily.According to the India-China joint statement, both agreed “the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side”, and “therefore...the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.”The ministers agreed that “both sides shall abide by all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs, maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas and avoid any action that could escalate matters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-joint-statement-stresses-need-for-more-confidence-building/story-Bmekw6nnG16BfitfsugcoI.html
11-09-2020||World||Joe Biden family selling country to China, says Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump has accused his Democratic challenger Joe Biden of being “weak” on China and that his family was “selling” the country directly to the Chinese military. Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee Biden and his Indian-American running mate Kamala Harris are challenging President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the November 3 Presidential election. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday, Trump said, “Biden is weak on China. Yesterday, it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor.” Hunter Biden owns 10 per cent of Shanghai-based private-equity firm Bohai Harvest RST. The president charged reporters that they were not reporting on the Michigan transaction. “You don’t want to write about that, do you? Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China,” he said. “Now the Biden family is selling out our country directly to the Chinese military. He didn’t have a job. Now, all of a sudden, he’s selling companies from Michigan to China,” Trump said. He alleged the Chinese military got American manufacturing jobs, and the Biden family got paid in return. “I said ‘If Joe Biden ever got elected, China will own America’, they will own America,” Trump said. The president also accused his Democratic challenger of undermining his efforts to bring out a coronavirus vaccine. “Joe’s decision to publicly attack the China (flight) ban proved he lacks the character or intelligence or instinct to do what is right. Now, Biden has launched a public campaign against the vaccine, which is so bad, because we have some vaccines coming that are incredible,” he said. “Biden is perfectly happy to endanger the lives of other people by doing something that he thinks is going to help him politically because his polls are getting very bad. They’re getting very shaky,” he said. “This was an election that was going to be very easy, very quick, and then the China virus (COVID-19) came in and I had to go back to work politically, unfortunately. I had to devote more time politically than to the other things we do, which are very important for our country. But I had to go back to work. It looks like we’re going up (opinion polls) very rapidly. More rapidly than the media wants to admit,” Trump said. He alleged that when Biden was vice president, his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous. “His own chief of staff said that when Biden helped manage the swine flu in 2009, they, quote “did everything possible wrong.” And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time,” he said. “In other words, Biden’s record demonstrates that if he had been in charge of this very serious, highly, highly contagious epidemic or pandemic countless more Americans would have died,” Trump said. The president predicted victory for himself in the key battleground state of Michigan, where he addressed thousands of enthusiastic supporters on Thursday. “This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that,” Trump told his supporters at the rally in Freeland, Michigan, His comments were responded by euphoric chants of “Four More Years. Four More Years,” which is Trump’s campaign slogan. Trump drew parallels between the last time he campaigned in the state in 2016, saying the Democrats did a “lousy job” campaigning in the state the last time and this time would be the same. Trump said the people should vote for him as he revived the economy, stopping a number of car plant closures. “We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right? Long time. It’s been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three-and-a-half-years and we’re going to bring you a lot more,” he said. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the American economy is now on revival mode, he said. “Now we’re building it again and it’s being built fast,” he said. The president said Biden will fill the state with refugees, which will diminish jobs. “He’s promised to flood your state with refugees, and you know that as well as I do and you see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden’s pledged to have a 700 per cent increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie (Sanders). A 700 per cent increase in the flow of refugees. This is in their manifesto,” Trump alleged. Meanwhile, Biden has criticised Trump for withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal negotiated by the Barack Obama administration. “Iran is closer to a weapon now (more) than we were when we left office in 2017,” Biden said at a fund raiser. Biden said he would re-enter the deal if Iran “returns to compliance.” However, he noted that restarting talks would not be easy, and would require support from America’s allies in Europe as well as China and Russia. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden is leading in Michigan by 4.2 points and by 3.9 percentage points in the battleground states. Overall, Biden is leading in national polls by 7.5 percentage points.

11-09-2020||World||Four Houston officers fired for fatally shooting man in April||Four Houston police officers have been terminated after an internal investigation determined they did not use reasonable force when they fired their weapons 21 times at a man who had been experiencing a mental health crisis, killing him in April after he was already injured and on the ground, the city’s police chief announced Thursday.During a news conference, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo presented video footage from body cameras that showed 27-year-old Nicolas Chavez, who had already been shot and was bleeding, kneeling on the ground and grabbing a stun gun that had been dropped when the four officers shot him.Acevedo said although Chavez had picked up the stun gun, the officers had plenty of time to back up and take cover. Investigators later determined the stun gun Chavez grabbed was empty as both of its cartridges had been discharged. The officers indicated they weren’t aware it was empty at the time of the shooting, Acevedo said.Chavez was already injured, having been hit by gunfire earlier in his standoff with police. Officers had also fired bean bag rounds and stun guns at him before he was killed, Acevedo said.“Quite frankly, its inexplicable to me when they had plenty of opportunity to back up and continue to be doing what they were doing for them to stay the line and shoot a man 21 times,” Acevedo said. “I cannot defend that.” Acevedo said Chavez was not a threat to the 28 officers who were at the scene.An autopsy showed that Chavez had 29 total entry and exit wounds, many the result of bullet fragments created when rounds hit the pavement and broke apart. It also showed he had methamphetamine, amphetamine and ethanol in his system.Leaders with the Houston Police Officers’ Union denounced the firings, saying the officers followed their training and tried to de-escalate the situation but were forced to shoot Chavez when he pointed the stun gun at them.“It was clear ... these officers did not want to shoot Mr. Chavez and did everything in their power not to,” said union president Joe Gamaldi.Leantha Chavez, Nicolas Chavez’s mother, said she was pleased that the officers had been fired.“However, it doesn’t change how my heart feels. It’s very hard to be happy and sad about something so tragic,” she said. “Now it’s time to move on to the next step, which is charging them.”Leantha Chavez has been one of many people who attended protests earlier this year calling on authorities to take action in her son’s shooting.His shooting is still being investigated by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office and was set to later be presented to a grand jury.“I met with the mother, father and wife of Nicolas Chavez to listen to their concerns and personally assure them that our Civil Rights Division prosecutors will conduct a thorough, independent review of all the evidence in his death,” Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement.Those fired were identified as: Officer Patrick Rubio, who had been with the department since May 2018; Officer Luis Alvarado, with the department since March 2019; Officer Omar Tapia, with the department since March 2019; and Sgt. Benjamin LeBlanc, with the department since October 2008.Before body camera footage was released on Thursday, cellphone video of the shooting taken by a bystander had been circulated widely online in the week after the April 21 shooting.Chavez’s shooting followed a 15-minute confrontation with police. Officers were responding to a call about a possibly suicidal man who was running in and out of traffic.Chavez’s family has said he had a history of mental illness.In a video presentation of the body camera footage that was narrated by Acevedo, portions of 911 calls made the night of Chavez’s shooting can be heard where callers tell operators that a man is running around and “having a mental breakdown.”In the video footage, officers can be heard telling Chavez, “Hey buddy, hey bud, we’re here to help you, man” and “just relax. No one is shooting” and “we’re trying to help you man.”Chavez, who can be heard cursing at officers, could be seen wildly flailing his arms and legs. Officers fired bean bag rounds from shotguns at Chavez and deployed their stun guns, but it had little affect on him.At one point in the video, an officer said Chavez had a knife. Officers told him to put it down. Investigators later determined that Chavez had a piece of metal that he used to cut himself.Before Chavez was fatally shot, two officers had fired three times at him when Chavez had come toward officers, injuring him. Acevedo said those discharges of officer weapons were justified.“The action being taken today does say in our city, we hold everyone accountable,” said Mayor Sylvester Turner.Gamaldi said the fired officers used every non-lethal option available to them to subdue Chavez, but that he refused to surrender.“These officers were distraught over having to take a life out there,” said Doug Griffith, the union’s first vice president.While Griffith said the shooting was found to be justified by the city’s independent police oversight board, Acevedo disputed that claim. Acevedo declined to comment further, citing confidentiality.Chavez’s shooting took place about a month before George Floyd died in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd’s death sparked protests worldwide, including in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, against racial injustice and police brutality.The police union suggested the firings in Chavez’s case were the result of political pressure following the marches for police reform.Chavez’s death was the first of six fatal shootings involving Houston police over several weeks in April and May.Activists in Houston had earlier called on Acevedo to release body camera footage from Chavez’s shooting as well as the other recent ones.___Follow Juan A.

11-09-2020||World||US President Trump says Kim Jong Un is in great health||US president Donald Trump on Thursday said that no one should underestimate the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he is in good health.Trump wrote in a tweet, “Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!”Several media outlets had reported in the months of April and May, that the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had undergone a heart surgery and speculations arose regarding his health. There were reports that his sister Kim Yo Jong was being prepped for taking his position. Kim made two appearances in the public after these reports had surfaced but speculations regarding his health remain. Trump posted several tweets after excerpts from Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’ came out in the public. The book is a sequel to ‘Fear: Trump in the White House’. Woodward’s book revealed that Trump believed that when he met Kim Jong Un for the summit, he lent legitimacy to the North Korean autocratic leader, according to a report by the Associated Press. Trump also believes that intelligence officials have wrongly assessed that Pyongyang would never give up its nuclear weapons. “It takes me two days. I met... I gave up nothing, they just can’t sell it,” US president told Bob Woodward during an interview. The book also highlights how Kim Jong Un gave a graphical account to Trump about how he got his uncle killed.US president Donald Trump has come under huge criticism after the book revealed that he downplayed the effects of coronavirus. The revelations have come out in the public eight weeks before United States goes into polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-says-north-korean-dictator-is-in-great-health/story-F1CoeilGiM9Y986QrNqAuO.html
11-09-2020||World||Pakistan foments ‘culture of violence’ at home, across its borders: India at United Nations||Hitting out at Pakistan, India has said the country foments a “culture of violence” at home and across its borders and its “deplorable” human rights records and discriminatory treatment of religious minorities is a cause of “persistent concern” for the global community. “Unfortunately, we have witnessed another attempt by the delegation of Pakistan to exploit a UN platform for hate speech against India,” Counsellor in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN, Paulomi Tripathi, said on Thursday at the high-level forum on the ‘Culture of Peace’ at the 74th United Nations General Assembly. “This happens at a time when Pakistan continues to foment a culture of violence at home and across its borders,” Tripathi said. India’s strong rebuke came as Pakistan’s UN envoy Munir Akram made references to Jammu and Kashmir, the Babri Masjid demolition and construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya during his remarks to the virtual forum on ‘Culture of Peace.’ “Pakistan’s deplorable human rights records and discriminatory treatment of religious and ethnic minorities is a cause of persistent concern for the international community,” Tripathi said. “Blasphemy laws are used against religious minorities such as Hindus, Christians and Sikhs, to violate their human rights and dignity,” she said, adding that women and girls remain particularly vulnerable in Pakistan as they are abducted, raped, forcefully converted and married to their violators. The pandemic has only aggravated the situation, she said. “Talk of ‘culture of peace’ from the delegation of Pakistan is nothing but a decoy to divert attention from their own shameful records. Before making absurd allegations against India, where equal rights of people of all faiths are guaranteed by the constitution, the delegation of Pakistan must do itself a favour of looking at their own system and records of protecting minorities,” Tripathi said. The Indian diplomat emphasised that a culture of peace does not merely signify absence of war but embodies a predisposition towards resolving differences through dialogue and understanding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-foments-culture-of-violence-at-home-across-its-borders-india-at-united-nations/story-r7GQ6rrXLwMiZjcJytlxuK.html
11-09-2020||World||US remembers 9/11 as coronavirus pandemic alters tribute traditions||Americans are commemorating 9/11 with tributes that have been altered by coronavirus precautions and woven into the presidential campaign, drawing both President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden to pay respects at the same memorial without crossing paths.In New York, a dispute over coronavirus-safety precautions is leading to split-screen remembrances Friday, one at the September 11 memorial plaza at the World Trade Center and another on a nearby corner. The Pentagon’s observance will be so restricted that not even victims’ families can attend, though small groups can visit the memorial there later in the day.Trump and Biden are both headed — at different times — to the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.Trump is speaking at the morning ceremony, the White House said. Biden plans to pay respects there in the afternoon after attending the observance at the 9/11 memorial in New York.Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is also due at ground zero — and then at the alternate ceremony a few blocks away.In short, the anniversary of 9/11 is a complicated occasion in a maelstrom of a year, as the U.S. grapples with a health crisis, searches its soul over racial injustice and prepares to choose a leader to chart a path forward.Still, 9/11 families say it’s important for the nation to pause and remember the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the trade center, at the Pentagon and near Shanksville on September 11, 2001, shaping American policy, perceptions of safety and daily life in places from airports to office buildings.“I know that the heart of America beats on 9/11 and, of course, thinks about that tragic day. I don’t think that people forget,” says Anthoula Katsimatides, who lost her brother John and is now on the board of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum.Friday will mark Trump’s second time observing the 9/11 anniversary at the Flight 93 memorial, where he made remarks in 2018. Biden spoke at the memorial’s dedication in 2011, when he was vice president.The ground zero ceremony in New York has a longstanding custom of not allowing politicians to speak, though they can attend. Biden did so as vice president in 2010, and Trump as a candidate in 2016.Though the candidates will be focused on the commemorations, the political significance of their focus on Shanksville is hard to ignore: Pennsylvania is a must-win state for both. Trump won it by less than a percentage point in 2016.Around the country, some communities have canceled 9/11 commemorations because of the pandemic, while others are going ahead, sometimes with modifications.The New York memorial is changing one of its ceremony’s central traditions: having relatives read the names of the dead, often adding poignant tributes.Thousands of family members are still invited. But they’ll hear a recording of the names from speakers spread around the vast plaza, a plan that memorial leaders felt would avoid close contact at a stage but still allow families to remember their loved ones at the place where they died.But some victims’ relatives felt the change robbed the observance of its emotional impact. A different 9/11-related group, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, set up its own, simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying there’s no reason that people can’t recite names while keeping a safe distance.The two organizations also tussled over the Tribute in Light, a pair of powerful beams that shine into the night sky near the trade center and evoke its fallen twin towers. The 9/11 memorial initially canceled the display, citing virus-safety concerns for the installation crew. After the Tunnel to Towers Foundation vowed to put up the lights instead, the memorial changed course with help from its chairman, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Tunnel to Towers, meanwhile, arranged to display single beams for the first time at the Shanksville memorial and the Pentagon.Over the years, the anniversary also has become a day for volunteering. Because of the pandemic, the 9/11 National Day of Service and Remembrance organization is encouraging people this year to make donations or take other actions that can be accomplished at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-remembers-9-11-as-coronavirus-pandemic-alters-tribute-traditions/story-VTkG257CMUwyp3ldqGUrhP.html
11-09-2020||World||North Korea issues shoot-to-kill orders to prevent coronavirus: US||North Korean authorities have issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the coronavirus entering the country from China, according to the commander of US forces in the South.The impoverished North -- whose crumbling health system would struggle to cope with a major virus outbreak -- has not confirmed a single case of the disease that has swept the world since first emerging in China, the North’s key ally.Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent contamination, and in July state media said it had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level.US Forces Korea (USFK) commander Robert Abrams said that the border shutdown had increased demand for smuggled goods, prompting authorities to intervene.The North introduced a new “buffer zone, one or two kilometers up on the Chinese border,” Abrams told an online conference organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington on Thursday.“They’ve got North Korean SOF (Special Operations Forces) out there. ... Strike forces, they’ve got shoot-to-kill orders in place.”The border closure had effectively “accelerated the effects” of economic sanctions imposed on the North over its nuclear programs, he added, with imports from China plunging 85 percent.The isolated country is also grappling with the aftermath of Typhoon Maysak, with its state media reporting more than 2,000 houses have been destroyed or inundated.As a result, Abrams did not expect to see any major provocations from Pyongyang in the near future, although he said it might show off a new weapons system at next month’s celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Kim Jong Un’s ruling party.“The regime right now -- the military -- is focused principally on getting their country recovered and to help mitigate the risk of Covid-19,” he said. “We’re not seeing any indications right now of any sort of lashing out.”But CSIS published on its website a satellite image of North Korea’s Sinpo South naval shipyard, which its experts believe shows activity that could indicate preparations for a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.A new North Korean missile test would be yet another sign of the lack of progress in denuclearization talks between the US and Pyongyang, which have been stalled despite multiple meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump.Trump, who is seeking reelection in November, was the first sitting US leader to meet a member of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled North Korea since its founding.On Thursday, Trump tweeted, without further explanation: “Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-issues-shoot-to-kill-orders-to-prevent-coronavirus-us/story-RDeiVEMZK746aHnqH3mdCN.html

11-09-2020||World||Trump says US has incredible N-weapons; denies reports of leaking classified info on them||President Donald Trump has said the US has some “incredible” nuclear weapon systems that nobody knows about but refuted allegations of leaking classified information about them to a renowned investigative journalist in his upcoming book. Penned by American journalist Bob Woodward, the book ‘Rage’ to be launched on September 15 has stirred several controversies around Trump’s presidency, weeks before the US election to be held on November 3. According to the excerpts of the book released by The Washington Post, Trump during an interview with Woodward said, “I have built a nuclear -- a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping have never heard about before. There’s nobody -- what we have is incredible.” “Woodward writes that anonymous people later confirmed that the US military had a secret new weapons system, but they would not provide details, and that the people were surprised Trump had disclosed it,” The Washington Post said. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump denied having talked about classified information about US nuclear weapons. “We have great weaponry. No, I’m not talking about classified (information). I’m talking about what we build. We’re building great weaponry,” the president said when asked if he shared classified information about a nuclear weapons system with Woodward. “What were you talking about when you talked about that?” Trump was asked. “Our military is stronger now than it’s ever been. We spent USD 2.5 trillion on our military over the last three-and-a-half years. We now have new rockets and missiles. And, frankly, our nuclear -- we have to hope to God we never have to use it -- but our nuclear now is in the best shape it’s been in decades,” he asserted. Trump told reporters the US has some nuclear systems that nobody knows about. “And, frankly, I think I’m better off keeping it that way. We have some incredible systems,” he said. James Acton, co-director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s nuclear policy programme, tweeted that Trump might have been mentioning about a 2017 announcement of a plan to reduce the explosive power of some nuclear warheads on submarine-launched missiles. “The timing was kept secret. My guess is that Trump told Woodward about the first deployment before it was made public. This weapon is usually called the low-yield D5 (because the missile is the Trident D5 sea-launched ballistic missiles). The warhead is the W76-2,” he tweeted on Thursday. “I don’t believe that the US could build an actually new nuclear weapon in secret. Too much money for classified budgets. Too many people involved for it not to leak,” Acton said in another tweet. Meanwhile, addressing a public rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump asserted that he did not leak any information and asserted that he just wanted to inform the people that the US has the greatest weaponry in the world. “I said, we have systems and missiles and rockets and military — we have systems that you’ve never even seen before. (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) has nothing like it. Russian President (Vladimir) Putin has nothing like it. “They (the media) said he may be giving away classified information. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology...I just want to let people know we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There is nobody like the US military,” Trump told the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-us-has-incredible-n-weapons-denies-reports-of-leaking-classified-info-on-them/story-5x59HMcvE4UvuVzK8VIOYP.html
11-09-2020||World||China approves first nasal spray Covid-19 vaccine for trials: Report||China has approved for trials its first nasal spray vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus that has claimed over 904,000 lives and infected more than 27 million people globally, official media here reported on Thursday. China’s only nasal spray vaccine against the coronavirus is expected to start phase I clinical trials in November, and it is recruiting 100 volunteers. It is the only vaccine of its type approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration, the state-run Global Times reported. The vaccine is a collaborative mission between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland that involves researchers from the University of Hong Kong, Xiamen University, and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy. Microbiologist from the University of Hong Kong, Yuen Kwok-yung, said the vaccine stimulates the natural infection pathway of respiratory viruses to activate the immune response. The nasal spray vaccination could generate double protection for vaccine recipients - influenza and the novel coronavirus — if it also contains influenza viruses including H1N1, H3N2 and B, Yuen said, adding that it would take at least another year to finish the three clinical trials. A Beijing-based immunologist told the daily that compared with injections, a nasal spray vaccination is easier to administer and would also be easy to mass-produce and distribute as it adopts the mature influenza vaccine production technology. The nasal spray vaccine uses live attenuated influenza vaccine; the other four technical routes China is using to develop the coronavirus vaccines are inactivated vaccines, adenoviral vector-based vaccines, and DNA and mRNA vaccines. The inactivated vaccine is estimated to be the earliest to be in the market, the report said. The immunologist said the new vaccine may not cause systemic side effects, but side effects may occur in the respiratory system such as asthma and shortness of breath. Ideally, scientists do not expect side effects except for minor nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, Yuen said. It is not yet clear whether immunity generated from nasal spray vaccinations will last longer than for injected vaccines, the report said. China has approved three Covid-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials. It has also authorised emergency usage of Covid-19 vaccines developed by some select domestic companies. “We’ve drawn up a series of plan packages, including medical consent forms, side-effects monitoring plans, rescuing plans, compensation plans, to make sure the emergency use is well regulated and monitored,” Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s coronavirus vaccine development task force told the official media here last month. An emergency use authorisation, which is based on Chinese vaccine management law, allows unapproved vaccine candidates to be used among people who are at high risk of getting infected in a limited period. The Global Times has previously reported that employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) preparing to go abroad and the frontline medics have been offered two choices of domestic inactivated vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm for urgent use. The novel coronavirus, which originated from China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has claimed 904,485 lives and infected 27,902,002 globally. The US is the worst affected country with 190,887 deaths and 6,363,729 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-first-nasal-spray-covid-19-vaccine-for-trials-report/story-5z8MMpZzAd1GYD1JdRyo2O.html
11-09-2020||World||At least nine killed as scores of wildfires scorch US West Coast||Dozens of extreme wind-driven wildfires burned through forests and towns in US West Coast states on Thursday, destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least nine people, authorities said.In the past 48 hours, four people died from fires in California, while four were killed in Oregon and a 1-year-old boy died in Washington state, police reported. Thousands faced evacuation orders in the three states.Oregon bore the brunt of nearly 100 major wildfires ripping across the western states, with around 3,000 firefighters battling nearly three dozen blazes.Police have opened a criminal investigation into at least one Oregon blaze, the Almeda Fire that started in Ashland near the border with California, Ashland Police Chief Tighe O’Meara said.O’Meara said investigators were treating the origins of the Almeda fire as suspicious. “We have good reason to believe that there was a human element to it. so we’re going to pursue it as a criminal investigation until we have reason to believe that it was otherwise.”Police in Medford as well as in Douglas County to the north cautioned against rumors left-wing anti-fascists and right-wing Proud Boy arsonists were starting the fires. The Oregon blazes tore through at least five communities in the Cascade mountain range as well as areas of coastal rainforest normally spared from wildfires. In eastern Washington state a fire destroyed most of the farming town of Malden.In central Oregon search and rescue teams entered torched communities like Detroit where firefighters led residents on a dramatic mountain escape after military helicopters were unable to evacuate the town.A 12-year-old boy was found dead with his dog inside a burned car and his grandmother was believed to have succumbed after flames engulfed an area near Lyons, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Portland, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said.To the south, a Reuters photographer saw small communities near Medford, including Bear Lake Estates, reduced to ashes as he drove south on Interstate 5 towards Ashland. Some people counted their blessings after fleeing the Bear Creek trailer park where nearly every house burned.“Thank God we were at home,” said Julio Flores, a resident of the community who escaped with two children who would have been alone had his restaurant working hours not been cut due to the coronavirus pandemic.Firefighters said unusually hot, dry winds out of the east supercharged blazes, spreading flames from community to community, and then from house to house.“When it really gets windy these embers are going for miles,” said Firefighter Andy Cardinal in Eagle Point, north of Medford where the town of around 10,000 was on standby to evacuate.Oregon Governor Kate Brown said up to 40,000 people had evacuated across the state where 900,000 acres had burned, dwarfing Oregon’s average 500,000 acre full-year total.“We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,” Brown told a news conference. “We are feeling the acute impacts of climate change.”Climate scientists say global warming has contributed to greater extremes in wet and dry seasons, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out in the U.S. West, leaving more abundant, volatile fuel when fires.Firefighters expected two of Oregon’s largest fires, burning around 24 miles southeast of downtown Portland, to merge. Nearby Molalla, with about 10,000 residents was evacuated, and Canby, a community of 18,000 around 10 miles from central Portland, was told to be ready to leave.Asked by a reporter whether Portland metro areas might be evacuated, Chief Deputy State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz Temple said she discussed such a possibility with local authorities and everything would depend on wind direction and force. CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON FIRES In California, officials said some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders while crews battled 29 major fires across portions of the most populous U.S. state.About a third of those evacuees were displaced in Butte County alone, north of the capital Sacramento, where the North Complex wildfire has scorched more than 247,000 acres and destroyed over 2,000 homes and structures.The remains of three victims were found in two separate locations of that fire zone, according to Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, bringing the total death toll from this summer’s devastating spate of California wildfires to at least 11.Another person died in Siskiyou County in Northern California, state fire authority Cal Fire reported, providing no further details.Wildfires have now burned over 3.1 million acres in California in 2020, marking a record for any year, with six of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history occurring in 2020. In Washington, a man and a woman were in critical condition with burns after their 1-year-old son died as they tried to escape the state’s largest wildfire burning in mountains about 100 miles northwest of Spokane, the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

11-09-2020||World||Trump administration considers postponing refugee admissions: Report||US officials are weighing whether to postpone or further cut refugee admissions in the coming year amid legal fights over President Donald Trump’s refugee policy and uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a senior official said.The possible postponement - one of several options under discussion - would mean some or all refugee admissions could be frozen until a legal challenge to a 2019 Trump order on refugees is resolved “with some greater degree of finality,” the official told Reuters. It is not clear when that lawsuit may be resolved, especially if the case goes all the way to the US Supreme Court, a process that could take months or even longer. The president typically sets yearly refugee levels around the beginning of each fiscal year and the Trump administration has not yet announced its plans for fiscal 2021, which begins on Oct. 1. The refugee cap was cut to 18,000 this year, the lowest level since the modern-day program began in 1980. So far, roughly half that many refugees have been let in as increased vetting and the coronavirus pandemic have slowed arrivals. The senior official said that even if 2021 admissions are not delayed, next year’s cap could be cut below current levels.“The arc of this administration’s refugee policy is going to continue,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the ongoing deliberations.Trump and his top officials have said refugees could pose threats to national security and that resettlement should take place closer to countries of origin. The administration also contends that refugee resettlement can be costly for local communities, although refugee backers reject those arguments.The possible moves remain under discussion and no final decision has been reached, the official stressed. Democratic challenger Joe Biden has pledged to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 per year if he defeats Trump in November. However, Biden has not said how quickly he would raise the cap and advocates say the program could take years to recover after Trump-era reductions.If he wins, Biden could seek to raise the cap soon after taking office, just as Trump moved to halve refugee admissions in early 2017. But refugee groups say that restoring the pipeline of travel-ready refugees and rebuilding the organizations that receive them in the United States will take months or years as refugees will need to undergo renewed security and medical checks and shuttered resettlement offices will need to reopen.Trump, who is seeking another four-year term on Nov. 3, has made his immigration crackdown a focus of the presidency and 2020 campaign. In addition to greatly reducing refugee admissions to the United States, Trump also issued an executive order in September 2019 that required state and local elected officials to consent to receive refugees, saying it would better ensure refugees were sent to areas with adequate resources to receive them. In January, a Maryland-based US district judge blocked the order from taking effect, prompting Trump administration officials to consider a possible “deferral” of refugee admissions until the court case is resolved, the senior official said. The administration’s refugee cap discussions involve officials from the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and have been coordinated by the White House National Security Council, according to the senior official, who declined to provide the names of those involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-considers-postponing-refugee-admissions-report/story-pHisWxtynWhbXKVI6rb3fI.html
11-09-2020||World||US could restrict funds for ‘malign activities’ over Navalny poisoning||The United States told the UN Security Council on Thursday it would work with allies to hold accountable those responsible for poisoning Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, including “through restricting  funds for  malign activities.”“Russia has used  chemical nerve agents  from the ‘Novichok’ group  in the past.  The Russian people have  a right to express their views  without fear of retribution of any kind,” the deputy US ambassador to the United Nations, Cherith Norman-Chalet, told a council meeting on chemical weapons in Syria.The Kremlin critic is being treated in Berlin’s Charite hospital after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent. Moscow has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny, 44, was poisoned.“We urge Russia to cooperate fully with the international community’s investigation,” Norman-Chalet told the council.   ”Wherever the evidence leads, we will work with allies and the international community to hold perpetrators accountable, including through restricting  funds for  malign activities.”Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to know what happened to Navalny but that Russian authorities did not have any grounds to open an investigation as they did not have any evidence.“Our doctors who, by the way, saved Alexey Navalny did not find any chemical weapon substances in his analyses. The German laboratory claims it did,” he told the Security Council.“But we received no evidence from Germany that would allow us to make a conclusion that it was a crime by attempted poisoning and thus start an investigation,” he added.Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said Berlin was working with the global chemical weapons watchdog - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - on the issue and urged Moscow to do the same.“It’s not a bilateral issue – it’s an issue of international concern (when) chemical agents are used, and therefore, the OPCW will have all the evidence and it would be very good if Russia would work with OPCW,” Heusgen told the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-restrict-funds-for-malign-activities-over-navalny-poisoning/story-Te5fuZSCt26M3WoNywDAsM.html

In a joint statement issued after the 17th meeting of the India-US Counter Terrorism Joint Working Group and the third session of the India-US Designations Dialogue held virtually on September 9-10, both sides denounced the use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms. The Indian delegation was led by Mahaveer Singhvi, Joint Secretary for Counter Terrorism, Ministry of External Affairs, while the American side was led by Nathan Sales, State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism. The joint statement stated that the meeting was a far-reaching conversation on counterterrorism cooperation, resolving to continue close coordination on this important element of the comprehensive global strategic partnership that exists between the two countries. “The two sides underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take immediate, sustained, and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for terrorist attacks, and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot,” the joint statement said. The US side reiterated its support for the people and the government of India in the fight against terrorism. They exchanged views on threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasized the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks, including al-Qa’ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and Hizb-ul Mujahideen, a media statement said. During the meeting, the two sides also shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions and designations against terrorist groups and individuals, particularly in light of recent legislative changes in India. There was a joint commitment to strengthen cooperation on information sharing and other steps to disrupt the ability of international terrorists to travel, consistent with the important provisions and obligations outlined in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2396. Participants of the meeting also highlighted their efforts to address some of the world’s most pressing counter-terrorism challenges, including countering the financing and operations of terrorist organisations, countering radicalisation and terrorist use of the internet, cross-border movement of terrorists and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning terrorist fighters and family members. India and the US also discussed mutual legal and extradition assistance, bilateral law enforcement training and cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urgent-need-for-pakistan-to-take-immediate-irreversible-action-against-terror-groups-indo-us-joint-statement/story-l9CknOi36sHr85zee3ewuK.html
11-09-2020||World||In a year of social distancing, coronavirus alters September 11, too||In a year when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged. The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the September 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, while President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden plan to attend a truncated ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania. In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly cancelled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar sparked a change of heart. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly the 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters. Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to “Never Forget” is fading. “It’s another smack in the face,” says Jim Riches, who lost his son Jimmy, a firefighter. The father is staying home on the anniversary for the first time this year because he doesn’t want to take chances with the coronavirus after a prior illness. But he feels others should have the option of reciting the names of the dead on the memorial plaza, instead of listening to a recording. Memorial leaders said they wanted to avoid close contact among readers, who are usually paired at the podium. But to Riches, a retired fire battalion chief and frequent critic of the memorial organization, the decision sounds like an excuse for sidelining the families’ role in commemorating 9/11. “I wish they wouldn’t forget, but they’re trying to,” he says. But Anthoula Katsimatides sees the differences this year as an effort to ensure victims’ relatives feel comfortable attending - including her mother, who hasn’t left home since March because health issues make her especially worried about the virus. But she is determined to go in honor of her son John, a bond trader, her daughter said. In a year when many events have been called off, “this wasn’t canceled. It’s just been changed in such a way where we still get to pay tribute to our loved ones in a respectful and safe way,” said Katsimatides, who’s on the memorial board. She says the change wasn’t motivated by anything except a public health emergency. “Who expected Covid-19? ... It was completely unforeseen. As was 9/11,” she said. This year’s plans have been a balancing act at the sites where hijacked planes piloted by al-Qaida terrorists crashed on September 11, 2001: New York, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The Flight 93 memorial near Shanksville is trimming its usual 90-minute ceremony, partly by eliminating musical interludes. Memorial spokeswoman Katherine Cordek said the names of the 40 people killed there would be read, but by one person instead of multiple family members. The Pentagon hasn’t yet detailed its plans for the anniversary. In New York - where the nation’s deadliest coronavirus spike early happened this spring but has since been fairly well contained - leaders of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum said their plan for a no-reading ceremony would honor both virus precautions and 9/11 families’ attachment to being at ground zero on the anniversary. But another 9/11-related organization, the Stephen Stiller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, quickly arranged its own simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying victims’ relatives could recite names while keeping a safe distance. “We need to keep letting America know what happened 19 years ago. And they need to see that emotion of the day, not a recording,” says chairman Frank Siller. He says he may attend both observances to honor the brother he lost, firefighter Stephen. Meanwhile, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told current firefighters in a memo last month that the department “strongly recommends” members not participate in 9/11 observances. The department did hold a limited-attendance ceremony Wednesday to add names to a memorial wall recognising members who died after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage. Tensions over anniversary plans flared anew when the memorial announced last month it was nixing the Tribute in Light, twin blue beams that shine into the night sky over lower Manhattan. While there’s no official gathering to view the lights, the memorial cited virus risks to the installation crew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-year-of-social-distancing-coronavirus-alters-september-11-too/story-FlG26CV5yJnJs1BcYdz2gO.html
11-09-2020||World||Brazil, Turkey plan to conduct phase III trials of Russia’s Sputnik V: The latest on coronavirus vaccine||The race to find a vaccine to coronavirus continues but it has been a mixed week so far in that pursuit. AstraZeneca had to pause their vaccine trials as a woman developed severe neurological symptoms, the drugmaker told news agencies on Thursday.The Drug Controller General of India asked Serum Institute of India to cite reasons on why they had failed to inform of the casualty analysis of the “reported serious adverse events”. The latter said that the trials were ongoing and they were adhering to the DCGI’s safety concerns. Coronavirus has affected more than 28 million people worldwide. More than 900,000 people have died. India has reported more than 90,000 cases and currently is close to reporting at least 100,000 cases per day. Here are the latest developments on the coronavirus vaccine: • The US Food and Drug Administration’s office has said on Thursday that the emergency authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine will have to meet a higher standard of efficacy than what would normally be required for such clearance. • The Bolsonaro-led Brazil government is yet to decide whether to join the COVAX Facility - the worldwide vaccine allocation plan led by the World Health Organisation (WHO). COVAX aims to procure and deliver 2 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2021. The deadline for Brazil to join the WHO-led initiative ends on September 18. • WHO has called the recent halting of the coronavirus vaccine tests of Astrazeneca a ‘wake-up call’. World Health Organization’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said that the global community needs to realize that “there are ups and downs in research.”• Turkey’s health minister Fahrettin Koca said that the nation’s health ministry will decide next week whether to conduct the Phase III testing of Russia’s coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V. “Our vaccine science team will have made its evaluation on the issue in the coming days. We may probably allow Phase III work for the vaccine in Russia next week,” he said while speaking to Reuters.• The Brazilian state of Bahia has signed a confidentiality agreement on Tuesday to undertake the trials of the Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and shall receive 500 doses as soon as Anvisa, Brazil’s health regulator, approves the testing protocols. Governor Rui Costa told Reuters that Brazil will also buy 50 million doses of the vaccine and plans to commit to that decision within Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-turkey-plan-to-conduct-phase-iii-trials-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-the-latest-on-coronavirus-vaccine/story-lNO2tTLRpnZ5c6RkDKtkuO.html
11-09-2020||World||‘I hope I don’t take the bait’ in debate with Donald Trump: Joe Biden||Joe Biden has said he’d “beat the hell out of” President Donald Trump over his comments about women if they were in high school. But on the debate stage, as opponents for the presidency, it’s a different story.When Biden and Trump meet in their first presidential debate later this month, Biden says he has one goal: “I hope I don’t take the bait.”“I hope I don’t get baited into a brawl with this guy, because that’s the only place he’s comfortable,” Biden said Thursday during a fundraiser.His comments offer a hint at how the former vice president is looking at the upcoming debate on September 29, in Cleveland, Ohio. Biden has previously said he plans to be a “fact checker” on the debate stage, and hold Trump accountable for any misstatements or falsehoods. But on Thursday night, Biden said that “people know what a liar” Trump is.“This is a guy who is absolutely tasteless. Completely tasteless. So pointing it out doesn’t do much,” he said.But Biden acknowledged that he expects the president to “say awful things about me and my family” during the debate to try to get a rise out of him — and the debate is almost certain to feature clashes about the two candidates’ families, as such attacks have been central themes that have already played out on the campaign trail.The Trump campaign in particular has targeted Biden’s son Hunter for his ties to Chinese and Ukranian companies. And Biden has grown visibly angry at events in recent days about Trump’s reported comments calling fallen Marines “suckers” and “losers,” speaking about his son Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015. And Democrats often criticize Trump for the use of his children in government positions and policy negotiations, as well as the financial benefit his family’s business has seen from the presidency.While Biden said he doesn’t want to get baited by Trump, he did express confidence that “I know how to handle bullies.”But Biden suggested his strategy in the debate will be focused more on drawing a contrast with Trump on competency and policy, and offering Americans an alternative to the Trump presidency.“The place he is most uncomfortable is on the facts. The place he’s most uncomfortable is in the area of what he’s going to do. The place he’s most uncomfortable is knowing the policy. He’s one of the most ill-informed presidents substantively that I’ve ever worked with,” Biden said.Biden added: “Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. I plan to tell them who I am.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-hope-i-don-t-take-the-bait-in-debate-with-donald-trump-joe-biden/story-zg2vVRKLBeAWtixNJiJaCN.html
11-09-2020||World||Brazil still mulling whether to join COVAX vaccine allocation plan||Brazil, with the third worst outbreak of novel coronavirus, is still studying whether to join the COVAX Facility, a global Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the acting health minister said on Thursday.Eduardo Pazuello said the decision was still under consideration, speaking by videoconference at a meeting of ACT, the global alliance to accelerate development, production and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines.“If we opt for membership, Brazil could be the biggest contributor,” Pazuello, an active duty Army general, said.Brazil’s was making available its “robust vaccine production capacity” and its experience with universal access to health services and vaccination of the entire population, he said.The decision on joining COVAX is up to President Jair Bolsonaro. The deadline is Sept. 18.One part of ACT, short for Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), is the COVAX Facility that aims to help buy and fairly distribute vaccine shots when they become available.More than 70 nations have so far committed to joining, agreeing to procure Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX for their populations. The United States said last week that it would not join because the Trump administration objects to WHO involvement.COVAX’s aim is to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021. It has nine Covid-19 vaccine candidates in its portfolio that employ a range of different technologies and scientific approaches.Brazil has registered more than 4.2 million novel coronavirus cases, the worst outbreak after the United States and India. The death toll stands at 129,522.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-still-mulling-whether-to-join-covax-vaccine-allocation-plan/story-xJhkGvteEOT5xrQ77zUvTI.html
11-09-2020||World||NASA sets out to buy moon resources mined by private companies||NASA on Thursday launched an effort to pay companies to mine resources on the moon, announcing it would buy from them rocks, dirt and other lunar materials as the US space agency seeks to spur private extraction of coveted off-world resources for its use.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote in a blog post accompanying the announcement that the plans would not violate a 1967 treaty that holds that celestial bodies and space are exempt from national claims of ownership.The initiative, targeting companies that plan to send robots to mine lunar resources, is part of NASA’s goal of setting what Bridenstine called “norms of behavior” in space and allowing private mining on the moon in ways that could help sustain future astronaut missions. NASA said it views the mined resources as the property of the company, and the materials would become “the sole property of NASA” after purchase.Under NASA’s Artemis program, President Donald Trump’s administration envisions a return of American astronauts to the moon by 2024. NASA has cast such as mission as a precursor to a future first human voyage to Mars.“The bottom line is we are going to buy some lunar soil for the purpose of it demonstrating that it can be done,” Bridenstine said during an event hosted by the Secure World Foundation, a space policy organization.Bridenstine said NASA eventually would buy more types of resources such as ice and other materials that may be discovered on the moon.NASA in May set the stage for a global debate over the basic principles governing how people will live and work on the moon, releasing the main tenets of what it hopes will become an international pact for moon exploration called the Artemis Accords. This would permit companies to own the lunar resources they mine, a crucial element in allowing NASA contractors to convert the moon’s water ice for rocket fuel or mine lunar minerals to construct landing pads.Under the initiative disclosed on Thursday, NASA offered to purchase limited amounts of lunar resources and asked companies to offer proposals. Under contracts whose terms would vary, a company mining on the moon would collect lunar rocks or dirt to sell to NASA without having to bring the resources back to Earth.“This is one small step for space resources, but a giant leap for policy and precedent,” Mike Gold, NASA’s chief of international relations, told Reuters.“They are paying the company to sell them a rock that the company owns. That’s the product,” Joanne Gabrynowicz, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Space Law, said in an interview. “A company has to decide for itself if it’s worth taking the financial and technological risk to do this to sell a rock.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sets-out-to-buy-moon-resources-mined-by-private-companies/story-PgHXjp9yNtzfajggljyDLP.html
11-09-2020||World||Russia, China hackers boost election attacks, says Microsoft||Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers have stepped up efforts to disrupt the US election by targeting the campaigns of President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a Microsoft Corp. investigation found.Cyber-attacks have also been aimed at political parties, advocacy groups, academics and leaders in the international affairs community, according to a blog post Thursday from Tom Burt, corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft.SKDKnickerbocker, a public affairs and political consulting firm working with Biden’s campaign, was also recently targeted in an unsuccessful hack by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which said that Microsoft had alerted the firm.The attempted hack on SKDKnickerbocker reflects a broader trend documented by Microsoft: that a Russia-based group had attacked “political campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants.”Attempts by foreign adversaries to disrupt the Nov. 3 presidential election echo the efforts by Russia in 2016 to meddle in the campaign on Trump’s behalf. The president is trailing Biden in the 2020 race by more than 7 percentage points in a national average of polls.The findings emerged hours after the US sanctioned Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Trump’s personal lawyer last year, alleging he’s a Russian agent trying to influence the 2020 election.Microsoft’s report also came a day after a Homeland Security Department official alleged that Trump administration appointees suppressed intelligence on Russian election interference while promoting China as the prime threat.Microsoft reported that about 200 organizations directly or indirectly tied to the US election and political organizations in Europe were affected by a Russian-operated group, called Strontium, including US-based consultants serving Republicans and Democrats. The same group was also identified in the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as being responsible for the attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016, according to Microsoft. Strontium is also known as APT28, or Fancy Bear.Microsoft also reported unsuccessful cyber-attacks from Iran on people associated with the Trump campaign, and attempted attacks from China on people associated with the Biden campaign, as well as a “prominent” individual formerly associated with the Trump administration. The people who were targeted weren’t named.The Chinese group, referred to as Zirconium, has mounted thousands of attacks from March through September on campaign officials as well as prominent academics and others in international affairs. Of those attempts, about 150 were successful breaches, but Microsoft didn’t identify the victims other than to say they weren’t associated with the presidential campaigns.According to John Hultquist, who serves as the senior director of analysis at cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc.’s Mandiant, the recent Russian activity poses the greatest threat to the election. “It’s likely Iranian and Chinese actors targeted US campaigns to quietly collect intelligence, but APT28’s unique history raises the prospect of follow-on information operations or other devastating activity,” he said.Microsoft’s findings echo those of US government officials.“Our adversaries are continuously looking for vulnerable US networks to exploit, and networks associated with political organizations and campaigns are no exception,” the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on Thursday.In August, William Evanina, head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said Russia, China and Iran are trying to “use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway US voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift US policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people’s confidence in our democratic process.” And on Wednesday, Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said “the governments of China, Iran and Russia target our election systems, each with its own separate and nefarious motives and tactics.”“Protecting our elections is a team effort with the federal government and the private sector joining together to thwart foreign malign actors,” Wolf said in a Thursday statement about the Microsoft findings.‘Stepped up’The recent attacks reveal that “foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election,” according to Microsoft. “What we’ve seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those who they consult on key issues.”The majority of attacks were detected and stopped by security tools built into Microsoft’s software, Burt said.Foreign groups used tactics including rotating IP addresses to disguise attacks, web bugs planted in purchased domain names and phishing, in an effort to harvest login credentials and gain information on targeted individuals and organizations. Phishing attacks can be for routine espionage against campaigns or, in some cases, to conduct hack and leak operations -- a key feature in Russia’s campaign to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.Disinformation experts are on high alert for strategic leaks of real or fabricated documents in the weeks ahead of election day, as a foreign influence tactic that could significantly harm a candidate’s chances, particularly if there isn’t enough time for them to adequately respond.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released public guidance for combating email attacks related the election. “CISA strongly recommends elections-related individuals and organizations to prioritize the protection of email accounts and systems,” the agency said.“We disclose attacks like these because we believe it’s important the world knows about threats to democratic processes,” Microsoft’s Burt said. He also said more federal funding is needed in the US so states can better protect their election infrastructure.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement Thursday that the “private sector plays a crucial role” in safeguarding elections and national security. “We welcome their assistance and will continue partnering with them to combat foreign efforts to target political candidates, campaigns and others involved in the US elections,” according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-hackers-boost-election-attacks-says-microsoft/story-1L3XGrGqz2w40tybEIECDN.html
11-09-2020||World||Taliban say peace talks with Afghan team to start Saturday||The long-awaited peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government’s negotiating team are to begin on Saturday in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, the Taliban and Qatar’s foreign ministry said Thursday.The talks — known as intra-Afghan negotiations — were laid out in a peace deal that Washington brokered with the Taliban and signed in February, also in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. At the time, the deal was seen as Afghanistan’s best chance at ending more than four decades of relentless war.Shortly after the announcement, President Donald Trump said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would travel to Qatar, to attend the start of the negotiations. Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, confirmed in a tweet that their delegation will be in Qatar’s capital of Doha for the talks and said the president wished the negotiating team success.Pompeo issued a statement welcoming the start of negotiations and saying they will mark “a historic opportunity for Afghanistan to bring an end to four decades of war and bloodshed.”“The people of Afghanistan have carried the burden of war for too long,” Pompeo said.That deal Washington signed with the Taliban aims to end Afghanistan’s protracted war and bring American troops home while the intra-Afghan talks are to set a road map for a post-war society in Afghanistan.The negotiations are expected to be a difficult process as the two sides struggle to end the fighting and debate ways of protecting the rights of women and minorities. The Taliban have promised women could attend school, work and participate in politics but stressed that would all be allowed in keeping with Islamic principles — without saying what that might mean.The Taliban have also said they would not support a woman becoming president of Afghanistan and that while they would allow for women to judges, a woman could not serve as a chief justice.Meanwhile, Kabul’s reconciliation council has an array of disparate figures, including hard-liners such as Abdul Rasool Sayyaf, a former warlord who served as the inspiration for the Philippine’s Abu Sayyaf militant group, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a one-time U.N.-listed terrorist. Both espouse deeply restrictive interpretations of Islam.Hekmatyar in an earlier interview with The Associated Press also rejected women serving as chief justice. Afghanistan’s Parliament has so far been unable to ratify a Violence Against Women’s bill because it is feared that hard-line lawmakers would defeat any such legislation.The government’s negotiation team includes several women who will carry a heavy burden to defend and protect rights for their gender, analysts say. The Taliban have no women on their team.The fate of the tens of thousands of armed Taliban, as well as militias loyal to government-allied warlords, will also be on the agenda, along with constitutional changes for Afghanistan.There’s also the issue of power sharing. While the Taliban have said they do not want to monopolize power, the suggestion of an interim administration has largely been rejected by Kabul. Deep mistrust also exists on both sidesWashington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who negotiated the US-Taliban deal signed on Feb. 29, has been in Doha for the past week, trying to push the talks forward.The withdrawal of US troops are not dependent on the success of the upcoming negotiations but rather on commitments taken by the Taliban under the deal with the US to fight other militant groups, most specifically the Islamic State group, and to ensure that Afghanistan is not used as a staging ground for attacks on the United States or its allies.Washington and NATO have already begun withdrawing troops and by November America expects to have less than 5,000 troops still in Afghanistan.The start of negotiations had been plagued by delays as the two sides squabbled for months over the release of prisoners until the exchange was complete earlier this month — 5,000 Taliban freed by the Afghan government and 1,000 government and military personnel who were released by the Taliban. The prisoner release was also set in the US-Taliban deal as a prerequisite for the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations.However, the negotiations will begin under difficult circumstances, marred by stepped up attacks on Afghan forces by the Taliban, target killings and attempted assassinations. Scores of civilians have died in the crossfire. There have also been attacks on released Taliban prisoners returning to their homes and accusations by the insurgents of being attacked inside their homes with their families.Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, the body that is overseeing the negotiations on behalf of the government, will attend the opening of the talks but the day-to-day negotiations will be carried out by a team headed by Mohammed Masoom Stanikzai, a former intelligence chief.Abdullah was appointed head the council as part of a power-sharing agreement with Ghani to end a political standoff between the two following last year’s controversial presidential elections. The country’s election commission declared Ghani the winner while Abdullah claimed he had won and went on to self-declare himself president.The impasse lasted for months — also delaying the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations — before the US negotiated a power-sharing deal under which Abdullah joined the government.The Taliban’s 21-member negotiation team is headed by their chief justice Abdul Hakim and includes 13 members of the insurgent’s leadership council.Pompeo in his statement warned both sides against squandering this opportunity to hammer out a negotiated end to the fighting.“This opportunity must not be squandered,” Pompeo said. “Immense sacrifice and investment by the United States, our partners, and the people of Afghanistan have made this moment of hope possible. I urge the negotiators to demonstrate the pragmatism, restraint, and flexibility this process will require to succeed. The people of Afghanistan and the international community will be watching closely.”Also Thursday, Trump, who promised in the 2016 presidential campaign to bring US troops home from Afghanistan, announced he has picked William Ruger, vice president for research and policy at the Arlington, Virginia-based Charles Koch Institute, as the next ambassador to Kabul.Picking Ruger, a veteran of the war who advocates withdrawing US forces from the country, is seen as a way for Trump to underscore his desire to do just that.“There are those who would like to see us remain at war in Afghanistan long into the future,” Ruger has said. “But the president should not allow a withdrawal deal to be bogged down by conditions that aren’t necessary for America’s safety.”Trump has a narrow window to get Ruger confirmed by the Senate, which is set to recess in mid-October before the US presidential election in early November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-peace-talks-with-afghan-team-to-start-saturday/story-XwN1GVwnnLRUotDOlQIBeP.html
11-09-2020||World||Questions over Russia vaccine study ‘inconsistencies’||The Lancet medical journal said Thursday it had asked authors of a study on a potential Russian Covid-19 vaccine for clarifications after their research came under scrutiny.Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval.This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous.Russian researchers published their trial findings last week in the Lancet, meaning their research had undergone review from a selection of their peers.Also read: Russia in touch with India over vaccine trials, manufacturingIt said that the vaccine had proven to be “safe and well-tolerated” among a few dozen volunteers.However an open letter signed this week by more than 30 Europe-based experts cast doubt on the findings, pointing towards “potential data inconsistencies”.The researchers identified what they said appeared to be a number of duplications in figures presented and concluded that the data within the study was “highly unlikely” to be correct.The lead study author was quoted Thursday by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency saying he rejected the letter’s claims.A spokeswoman for The Lancet told AFP that they were aware of the open letter.“We have shared the letter directly with the authors and encouraged them to engage in the scientific discussion,” she said.The spokeswoman added that the research had been reviewed by independent experts before publication.The pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.Pharma giant AstraZeneca said this week it was halting Phase 3 trials of its candidate vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, after one volunteer fell ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-over-russia-vaccine-study-inconsistencies/story-7kgaYXvXQL0cfieTC2zaHK.html

The group have attacked Riyadh several times before.“The attacks are a response to the enemy’s permanent escalation and its continuing blockade against our country,” Sarea said in a statement posted on Twitter.He promised more attacks if Saudi Arabia “continues its aggression” against Yemen.A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said Houthi forces had launched the missiles and drones at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia, without giving more details.The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and most cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The Western-backed coalition that Saudi Arabia leads intervened to try to restore Hadi to power but the war, which has killed 100,000 people, has been stuck in a stalemate for years.The conflict has led to what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-houthis-say-attacked-important-target-in-riyadh-with-missile-drones/story-hPYu3pu2kS5ZuONjvE7rIP.html

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the government will remove those edicts beginning Monday.The CDC said the current screening, which includes temperature checks and travelers vouching for their health, “has limited effectiveness” because some infected people show no symptoms. The health agency said instead it will focus on other measures including a stronger response to reports of illness at airports, collecting passenger-contact electronically to avoid long lines, and “potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission” of the virus.The extra health screening applies to people who have been in China, Iran, most countries in continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil. Most people coming from those countries who aren’t U.S. citizens have been barred entry to the country.The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-will-end-current-health-screening-of-some-travelers/story-vINuMrXbgzfxboymr1Bv0J.html
11-09-2020||World||What Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’ reveals about US President Donald Trump||American journalist Bob Woodward’s book ‘Rage’, set to be launched on September 15, has stirred several controversies around the presidency of Donald Trump weeks before US Elections are scheduled to be held in November. The much anticipated book is based on 18 interviews that Woodward conducted with Trump. The journalist was also granted special access to the top officials inside the White House and the book reveals inner workings of the president and his administration.‘Rage’ is the sequel to his 2018 book ‘Fear: Trump in the White House’.Here are a few interesting takeaways from the book:Donald Trump’s equation with the North Korean leader According to an article published in The Washington Post (where Woodward is an editor) containing excerpts of the book, Trump said he was impressed with Kim Jong Un when he first met him in Singapore in 2018 and that Kim was “far beyond smart.”In engaging with nuclear arms talks with Kim, the US President ignored the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) assessments that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons.CIA has “no idea” how to handle Pyongyang, Trump had reportedly told Kim, and the North Korean reportedly described his relationship with Trump as “a fantasy film”.Dismissal of Black Americans’ painWhen asked if the US President, as a white man, had a responsibility to better understand the anger and pain of Black Americans, he said, “No, I don’t feel that at all.”According to Trump, the unemployment rate among Black Americans fell right before the coronavirus pandemic and the systemic racism the journalist was trying to highlight was present everywhere. “I think probably less here than most places. Or less here than many places,” the Trump said. When asked by Woodward whether racism is in the United States in such a way that it affects people’s lives, Trump replied: “I think it is. And it’s unfortunate. But I think it is.” Downplayed the Covid-19 risk“This is deadly stuff,” Trump had told Woodward on February 7. Even as the President told the journalist several times that he was aware of the ‘deadly’ and ‘highly contagious’ nature of coronavirus, he repeatedly downplayed its threat in his public rallies and meetings.Trump revealed that he “played it down” with regard to the severity of Covid-19 to the American people as he “didn’t want to create panic”. “The virus has nothing to do with me. It’s not my fault. It’s -- China let the damn virus out,” CNN quoted Trump in his interaction with the journalist.The President has recently come under fire for not taking the virus threat seriously. Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris in a statement said, “So much of this pain could have been avoided, but President Trump refused to tell the truth or to act to protect the American people. The horrifying toll of Trump’s deadly disinformation and negligence in the lives of grieving families and to our economy is a historic national tragedy.”‘Dangerous’ and ‘unfit’ to be commander in chiefThe book also mentions viewpoints of Trump’s former top national security officials on his presidency. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis, former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are some of them.According to James Mattis, Trump is ‘dangerous’ and ‘unfit’ to be commander in chief. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US administration’s top infectious disease expert, is quoted in the book too. Trump’s leadership is ‘rudderless’ and that his ‘attention span is like a minus number’, he reportedly said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-bob-woodward-s-book-rage-reveals-about-us-president-donald-trump/story-bYeO1SSYC56D3SN0AhqRZJ.html
11-09-2020||World||It’d be an ‘insult’ if Harris became first woman President, says Donald Trump||Donald Trump said it would be an “insult” if Senator Kamala Harris became the first woman to be elected president, repeatedly mocking the Democratic vice presidential nominee at a North Carolina rally.“People don’t like her,” Trump said after recounting her slide in polls while she was running for the Democratic nomination for president last year.“Nobody likes her,” he said in Winston-Salem, N.C. “She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.”Trump said his re-election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, “has now formed an unholy alliance” with the “radical left” through Harris.“You know who’s further left than crazy Bernie?” Trump asked, referring to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. “Kamala,” he said, theatrically stretching out and mispronouncing her name three times in a row.Harris, California’s junior senator and a former attorney general of that state, is the first Black and Indian-American and Black woman on a on a major presidential party ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/us-presidential-election/it-d-be-an-insult-if-harris-became-first-woman-president-says-donald-trump/story-OVQ2EvRAEjLJ3c0il8rEKN.html
11-09-2020||World||Thousands sleep in open after Greek refugee camp burns down||Thousands of refugees and migrants have spent a third night in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos after two consecutive nights of fires in the notoriously overcrowded Moria camp left them homeless.Some awoke Friday after sleeping by the side of the road, having cut down reeds and used salvaged blankets to make rudimentary shelters to protect them from the night-time chill and the scorching day-time sun. Others used tents or had just sleeping bags to protect them from the elements.Greek authorities have said the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday evening were deliberately set by some of the camp’s residents angered by isolation orders issued to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after 35 residents were found to have been infected.The camp had been under a lockdown due to last until mid-September after the first virus case was identified in a Somali man who had been granted asylum and left the camp but later returned to Moria from Athens.“We have spent three days here without eating, without drinking. We are in conditions that are really, really not very good,” Freddy Musamba, a former camp resident from Gambia who denounced the situation in Greece and the conditions under which he had been living.“I want to speak about the European Union, who abandoned us, who left us here like this,” Musamba said. He called for the EU “to come and support us, to not leave us. We are like abandoned children. We have endured things we didn’t know could happen.”Aid organizations have long warned about dire conditions in the camp, which has a capacity of just over 2,750 people but was housing more than 12,500 inside and in a spillover tent city that sprang up in an adjacent olive grove.The situation has led to spiraling tension, both among migrants and refugees inside the camp and with local residents who have long called for Moria to be shut down.Moria houses people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who arrived on the island from the nearby Turkish coast fleeing poverty or conflict in their homeland. Under a 2016 deal between the European Union and Turkey, those arriving on Greek islands would remain there pending either their successful asylum application, or deportation back to Turkey.But a backlog in asylum applications, combined with continued arrivals and few deportations, led to massive overcrowding in Moria and other camps on eastern Aegean islands.The overcrowded camp and its dire conditions have been held up by critics as a symbol of failures in the EU’s migration and refugee policy.“Moria is a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe,” European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, who also handles migration for the 27-nation bloc, said.“The clock has run out on how long Europe can live without a migration policy,” said Schinas, who was in Greece to discuss the Moria fire with Greek officials. The EU’s executive commission plans to present a new “pact for migration and asylum” on Sept. 30, he said.According to Schinas, the pact will foresee agreements with migrants’ countries of origin and transit to persuade people not to embark for Europe, as well a “robust” system to manage the EU’s external borders, including “a new European border and coast guard, with many more staff, boats, instruments and tools.”It will also include “a system of permanent, effective solidarity in shouldering the responsibility of asylum” among EU countries, Schinas said.He said that after the fire that gutted Moria, Greek authorities will have to “set up a new, more modern installation.”“The European Union is ready not only to finance and support the construction of this new facility, but we are ready also to consider any Greek request for a more active role in the management of this new facility,” Schinas said.On Thursday, French President Emanuel Macron announced that France and Germany were in talks to take in some of the children who had been living in Moria.German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Friday that 10 EU countries had agreed to participate in taking in the unaccompanied children from Moria and that talks were ongoing with others.He said Germany and France would take the largest share, “about two-thirds” of the 406 teenagers and children who had been living at the camp without parents or guardians.German officials identified the other countries that would help take in the unaccompanied children as Finland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland.A program was already in place before the fire for several European countries to take in some of the thousands of unaccompanied minors, mostly teenagers, who were staying in refugee and migrant facilities across Greece.The first fire in Moria on Tuesday night left around 3,500 of the camp’s inhabitants homeless, Greece’s migration minister had said. Tents were flown in and a ferry and two navy ships were to provide emergency accommodation. But the remnants of the camp were burned down on Wednesday night, leaving the remaining inhabitants with nowhere to stay.On Wednesday, government spokesman Stelios Petsas stressed that none of the camp’s residents, except for unaccompanied children who had been living there, would be allowed to leave the island. The unaccompanied minors were flown to the mainland and temporarily housed in hotels on Wednesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-sleep-in-open-after-greek-refugee-camp-burns-down/story-LupWQbVBrtKiesevREGzXP.html

The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg”.More than 300 cases have been reported globally in at least 25 countries.Two people have died outside the mainland - one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.The worst-hit central Chinese province reported 2,618 new cases of the NCP on February 9, with 91 new deaths and 356 recovered.The total infection number in the province increased to 29,631, with 871 dead and 1,795 recovered, officials said.The NHC said 6,484 patients remained in severe condition, and 23,589 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.The commission said 399,487 close contacts had been traced, adding that among them, 29,307 were discharged from medical observation Sunday, with 187,518 others still under medical observation.The raging outbreak, first detected in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city, has prompted the government to lock down nealy 15 cities in the province to contain the spread of the virulent virus.China’s new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia outside Hubei province, where the epicentre city of Wuhan is located, has dropped for five consecutive days, the National Health Commission (NHC) said Sunday.A total of 509 new confirmed cases were reported on Saturday outside Hubei, about 42.8 percent lower than the number reported on Monday, said the NHC spokesperson, Mi Feng.The numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 (Monday), 731 (Tuesday), 707 (Wednesday), 696 (Thursday) and 558 (Friday).Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said on Sunday the “stable period” of the outbreak “may reflect the impact of the control measures”.State media reported Monday that China has allocated 71.85 billion yuan (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) of fiscal funds to support the control of the novel coronavirus outbreak.As of 6 pm Saturday, 31.55 billion yuan of the funds were spent, finance minister Liu Kun at a national teleconference on Sunday evening.Meanwhile, WHO chief, Tedros, said though the virus spread outside China appears to be slow but it could accelerate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-kills-nearly-100-in-a-day-in-china-who-says-tip-of-the-iceberg/story-emGqDlWvR6gaaQLzIy2WhO.html
