He was charged earlier in the year by the US with narco-terrorism, corruption, drug-trafficking and other criminal offences, and carries a reward of $15 million for information leading to his arrest.“The United States has now restored UN sanctions on Iran,” President Donald Trump said in a statement announcing the executive order he signed on the UN arms embargo and the new sanctions on 27 entities and individuals connected to Iran’s “proliferation networks”.“The Iranian regime has repeatedly lied about its secret nuclear weapons archive and denied access to international inspectors, further exposing the deep flaws of the last administration’s failed nuclear deal from which I withdrew the United States,” he added, referring to the 2015 nuclear deal signed by Iran, US, UK, France, China and Russia and Germany. The deal had temporarily frozen Iranian nuclear weapons programme in return for lifting of all curbs and sanctions, including those related to conventional arms.France, Britain and German have already rejected the US call to restore the UN sanctions for alleged violation of the nuclear deal, saying Washington did not have any authority to demand a ‘snapback’ of curbs after having left the agreement.The US has gone ahead nevertheless, and secretary of state Mike Pompeo told reporters on Monday, “We have made very clear that every member state in the United Nations has a responsibility to report the sanctions.”“That certainly includes the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We will have every expectation that those nations enforce these sanctions,” he added.The UN Security Council had rejected in August a US proposal to snap back the 2010 UN embargo on sale of conventional arms to Iran. China and Russia had opposed it in a vote and France, Germany and the United Kingdom had abstained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unilaterally-restores-un-sanctions-against-iran/story-3Qqh1rAt6bX2DTe41DZdUM.html

The police released new CCTV footage that shows a vehicle parked on the street where the offence took place before the burglary. The suspects are described as three white men with eastern European accents. One Beretta ‘Cheetah’ Auto Pistol featured in Die Another Day; one Walter PP featured in A View to a Kill; one Revolver Smith and Weston 44 Magnum featured in Live & Let Die; one Beretta ‘Tomcat’ Auto pistol featured in Die Another Day; and one Llama 22 cal featured in Die Another Day were stolen.The yellow-handed Llama pistol was recovered by a member of the public in a field in Essex in April. Detective inspector Paul Ridley said: “It has now been six months since the burglary and only one of the firearms has been recovered. Sadly, this has been severely rusted due to being exposed to the elements outdoors and its integrity destroyed”.“We now have images of a vehicle that was parked near to the scene of the crime and appears to be carrying out reconnaissance in the area. In scenes reminiscent of a James Bond movie you can even see the flash of a camera from the occupant engaged in the surveillance”. “I believe these individuals were involved in the crime, it was only a matter of minutes prior to the raid. The firearms which were stolen are very distinctive and will almost certainly be recognised by the public and anyone who is offered them for sale”, he added.The police said the stolen items are unique. For example, the Magnum is the only one in the world ever made where the whole gun is finished in chrome. It has a six-and-a-half inch barrel and wood grips. The Walther PPK was the last gun used by Roger Moore, who played James Bond in View to a Kill in a famous scene with Grace Jones who descends the Eiffel Tower on a parachute, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cops-issue-new-appeal-to-find-james-bond-guns-stolen-in-london-heist/story-pFeeUCdi0Ak7dKJvzhWENI.html
21-09-2020||World||UK considering new national lockdown as Covid-19 cases ‘doubling each week’||The United Kingdom could see 50,000 new Covid-19 cases every day by mid-October if no swift action is taken, top experts warned on Monday, as the Boris Johnson government considered imposing another national lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.Chief scientific officer Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the number of cases is doubling every seven days. For the first time in recent months, they appeared on live television without a minister present to report the new data described as “critical”.“If, and that’s quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days...you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day”, Vallance said. He projected more than 200 daily deaths by mid-November. “The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down.” Health secretary Matt Hancock is due to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon. The Johnson cabinet is reported to be divided on the issue of a fresh lockdown in view of another severe blow it would inflict on the economy.After daily increases in cases in the hundreds in July and August, the figures have consistently been in the thousands in September. On Sunday, 3,899 new cases and 18 deaths were reported across the UK, as the experts reiterated basic precautions needed.Setting out current situation in Spain and France, the experts said the UK is seeing similar increases, with new cases rising across all age groups, but particularly among the youth. The call for action is also prompted by the annual challenge of dealing with seasonal ailments in winter.Parts of the UK are already under local lockdowns, with a range of heavy fines to be imposed from September 28 on those breaching self-isolation or lockdown rules. Parts of London are also due to face new restrictions.The opposition Labour urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government’s incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system”.“Labour’s priority is that there must be a national effort to prevent another national lockdown. The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people’s wellbeing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-considering-new-national-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-doubling-each-week/story-foe2BYkTDqeWKNAcC8ItYM.html
21-09-2020||World||Drug used to treat coronavirus infections in cats may be effective against Covid-19: Study||According to a study, a drug used to treat deadly coronavirus infections in cats could potentially be an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the global coronavirus pandemic. The finding, published in the journal Nature Communications, paves the way for human clinical trials of the drug, a protease inhibitor called GC376. “This drug is very likely to work in humans, so we are encouraged that it will be an effective treatment for Covid-19 patients,” said Joanne Lemieux, a professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. However, the researchers said clinical trials will need to run their course before anyone can be sure that the drug is both safe and effective for treating Covid-19 in humans. In cats at least, GC376 works by interfering with a virus’ ability to replicate, thus ending an infection, they said. Derivatives of this drug were first studied following the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it was further developed by veterinary researchers who showed it cures fatal feline affliction. Lemieux and colleagues first tested two variants of the feline drug against SARS-CoV-2 protein in test tubes and with the live virus in human cell lines. They then crystallised the drug variants in conjunction with virus proteins. The researchers determined the orientation of the cat drug as it bound to an active site on a SARS-CoV-2 protein, revealing how it inhibits viral replication. “This will allow us to develop even more effective drugs,” Lemieux said, adding the team will continue to test modifications of the inhibitor to make it an even better fit inside the virus. Aina Cohen, from the US Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, said she was excited by the drug’s effectiveness. “Until an effective vaccine can be developed and deployed, drugs like these add to our arsenal of Covid-19 treatments,” Cohen said. “We are thrilled to learn of these important results and look forward to learning the outcome of clinical trials,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-used-to-treat-coronavirus-infections-in-cats-may-be-effective-against-covid-19-study/story-xlouFanOq83IiOWkyt9tSI.html
21-09-2020||World||UK faces 50,000 Covid-19 cases per day by October without action now||The UK is on course for 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October if urgent measures are not taken to prevent the spread of the disease, the government’s chief scientific adviser said.That infection rate would likely lead to more than 200 deaths per day in mid-November, Patrick Vallance warned in a live TV broadcast on Monday. “Cases are increasing, hospitalizations are following,” he said. “Deaths unfortunately will follow that, and there’s the potential for this to move very fast.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out further restrictions on Tuesday, as ministers try to strike a balance between stamping down on the pandemic and avoiding a full lockdown that would snuff out the recovery after the economy plunged into its deepest recession for more than 100 years.On ITV earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government’s plans have not been finalized, though he reiterated the government is determined to keep schools open and the economy running as much as possible.Testing data show social activities -- rather than the reopening of schools and offices -- are the main reason for the recent surge, Hancock said, indicating that will be the government’s focus with new rules. Pressed on whether pubs will have to close, Hancock said: “It’s not a no and it’s not a yes.”The latest government statistics, released on Sunday, showed a further 3,899 daily Covid cases and 18 deaths in the UK Vallance said the epidemic is “doubling roughly every seven days.”The figures showed that without action, the UK is on course for as many as 49,000 cases per day by Oct. 13. Vallance said that these 50,000 new daily infections would be followed a month later by around 200 deaths per day, if steps are not taken to tackle the outbreak and the disease continues to spread at current rates. He emphasized that this was a modeling projection, not a prediction of what will happen.England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, sitting alongside Vallance, said the UK must take Covid-19 “very seriously” for the next six months as the country enters the more dangerous autumn and winter months. He said there was no evidence the virus is milder now than it was in the spring.“If we do too little, this virus will go out of control and you will get significant numbers of increased direct and indirect deaths,” Whitty said. “But if we go too far the other way, then we can cause damage to the economy which can feed through to unemployment, to poverty, to deprivation -- all of which have long-term health effects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-faces-50-000-covid-cases-per-day-by-october-without-action-now/story-LAXI23QzkaNWBUfdVS3ZNL.html
21-09-2020||World||Seven choices for Boris Johnson as UK faces second coronavirus lockdown||Boris Johnson’s top team is grappling with a spike in coronavirus infections that’s seen the UK outbreak spreading exponentially again.Ministers are trying to decide how to balance tackling the virus with helping the economy recover from its worst recession in more than a century, sparking divisions within the Cabinet over the best way forward.Here’s what could happen next:More local lockdownsThe existing “whack a mole” strategy has already seen vast swathes of the country under local lockdown, restricting social contact between households and imposing early closing times on pubs, bars and restaurants.The measures cover some 10 million people, and there’s only so far they can go before they start resembling a national lockdown again. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is pushing urgently for measures in the capital, which has so far avoided fresh restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people in London could be told to work from home again this week.Social RestrictionsThe government’s strategy so far has been to try to keep schools and businesses open while stamping down on social interaction. This month, ministers replaced complicated rules on social mixing with a blanket rule than no more than six people could meet socially, unless they were all from the same household. The next step would be to ban people from different households from mixing altogether.“We’re at a really critical moment and I think that if we don’t make sure that we’re adhering to all the various different requirements – the rule of six, self isolation, quarantine when required, then we are going to end up needing to apply stronger brakes on this,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Monday.Work From HomeThe advice at the beginning of the pandemic was that everyone who could, should work from home. But as the outbreak died down over the summer, the government started encouraging people to return to their offices, particularly in city centers where bars, cafes and shops that relied on commuters were struggling.But with the virus on the rise again, the authorities may tell people to stay in their homes again.Circuit BreakerJohnson has compared the idea of a second national lockdown to a nuclear deterrent -- the option of last resort, and ministers consistently say they want to avoid such a radical step at all costs. But gaining traction is the idea of a so-called circuit breaker -- a two week shutdown, perhaps coinciding with the half-term holiday in schools next month.Asked about the notion on Sunday, Hancock said “that was another proposal that came from the scientists,” and stressed officials were looking at “all” options. Enforcing the rules is seen as key.“We’ll be increasingly stringent on the people who are not following the rules – if everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdowns,” Hancock said. “But we, of course, have to be prepared to take action if that’s what’s necessary.”Close SchoolsJust about the last thing the government will countenance, having rested a lot of political capital in getting them open again in September. Ministers are concerned that having children at home hits the ability of their parents to work effectively, whether from home or in their workplaces.Test and traceThe government says it will increase testing to 500,000 a day by the end of October, but the system is ridden with well-publicized failings. If the government can make the system more effective, speeding up the time it takes to give people results and then reaching more of their close contacts to tell them to self-isolate, the U.K. could begin to bear down more effectively on its infection rate.VaccinateThe government has ensured it has orders for six different vaccines should they succeed in clinical trials. Hancock said on Sunday that “there is still hope that we will get one of the vaccines over the line this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-choices-for-boris-johnson-as-uk-faces-second-coronavirus-lockdown/story-z4RA4DCR2pEO3gTndLrdqJ.html

21-09-2020||World||Tropical Storm Beta forecast to make landfall Monday||Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Monday morning in parts of Texas and Louisiana as Tropical Storm Beta slowly worked its way into a part of the country that’s already been drenched and battered during this year’s exceptionally busy hurricane season.No longer expected to gain hurricane strength, forecasters also decreased estimated rainfall totals from Beta early Monday, saying in a US National Hurricane Center advisory that up to 15 inches of rain could fall in some areas.That’s down from earlier predictions of up to 20 inches.Maximum sustained winds also decreased to 85 kph Monday morning. Beta was moving west at 9 kph, forecasters said.It was the system’s slow movement and storm surge were generating concerns in coastal communities. Storm surge up to 5 feet was forecast from San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass in Texas.Beta was set to make landfall along Texas’ central or upper Gulf Coast late Monday night, forecasters said.It was then expected to move northeastward along the coast and head into Louisiana sometime mid-week, with rainfall as its biggest threat.Forecasters said Beta was not expected to bring the same amount of rainfall that Texas experienced during either Hurricane Harvey in 2017 or Tropical Storm Imelda last year. Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on Houston and caused USD 125 billion in damage in Texas. Imelda, which hit Southeast Texas, was one of the wettest cyclones on record.The first rain bands from Beta reached the Texas coast on Sunday, but the heaviest rain wasn’t expected to arrive until late Monday into Tuesday.In low-lying Galveston, which has seen more than its share of tropical weather over the years, officials didn’t expect to issue a mandatory evacuation order but they advised people to have supplies ready in case they have to stay home for several days if roads are flooded.“We’re not incredibly worried,” Galveston resident Nancy Kitcheo said Sunday. Kitcheo, 49, and her family had evacuated last month when forecasts suggested Hurricane Laura could make landfall near Galveston, but they’re planning to buy supplies and wait out Beta. Laura ended up making landfall in neighboring Louisiana.Kitcheo, whose home is 18 feet above the ground on stilts, said she expected her street to be impassable as water from rising tides was already flooding neighboring roadways on Sunday.“This has definitely been more stressful, this hurricane season,” she said.Galveston, which has about 50,000 residents, was the site of the deadliest hurricane in US history, a 1900 storm that killed an estimated 6,000 people.The city was also hit hard in 2008 by Hurricane Ike, which caused about USD 30 billion in damage. Kitcheo’s previous home was heavily damaged during Ike and had to be torn down.Beta was churning slowly through the Gulf of Mexico on Monday morning about 180 kilometers south of Galveston, and 150 kilometers east-southeast of Port O’Connor, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner on Sunday said while Beta was not expected to bring rain like Harvey, he cautioned residents to “be weather alert.” “Be weather aware because things can change.This is 2020 and so we have to expect the unexpected,” said Turner, adding the city expected to activate its emergency center on Monday.In Victoria County, about 193 kilometers southwest of Houston, officials asked residents to prepare for up to 10 to 15 inches of rain.“As with any event, panic is never helpful or necessary, but preparation is, and now is the time to finalize those plans,” said County Judge Ben Zeller, the top elected official in Victoria County.Beta is forecast to dump heavy rain on the southwestern corner of Louisiana three weeks after the same area got pounded by Hurricane Laura.More than 41,000 homes and businesses remain without electricity, and Beta could add to that figure by toppling trees that were left leaning by the previous storm, said meteorologist Donald Jones of the National Weather Service office in Lake Charles, Louisiana.Storm debris from Laura clogging draining ditches in hard-hit areas such as Lake Charles could increase the threat of flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-beta-forecast-to-make-landfall-monday/story-rOY52DW7oQbrdkZ9YRphJL.html

21-09-2020||World||Around 270 whales stranded on sandbar off Australia’s Tasmania||Marine biologists were planning the rescue of around 270 whales stranded on a sandbar off the remote west coast of the Australian island of Tasmania on Monday.Government scientists said it appeared that at least 25 of the animals, believed to be pilot whales, had already died. Pilot whales are a species of oceanic dolphin that grows 7 metres (23 ft) long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes.“While strandings are not uncommon in Tasmania, and while strandings of this scale aren’t (unprecedented), we certainly haven’t had one for at least 10 years,” Nic Deka, a regional manager for Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said.Tasmania’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment said the whales were stranded in three groups in shallow water at Macquarie Heads, some 200 kms (120 miles) northwest of the state capital Hobart.Rescuers with specialised equipment arrived at the site on Monday afternoon to assess the situation. They were expected to regroup on the shore as it grew dark to discuss a rescue strategy.Officials usually respond to reports of strandings of dolphins and whales in Tasmania once every two or three weeks, on average.Government scientists had first thought the mass stranding involved about 70 whales when it was viewed from the air, but a closer inspection revealed the larger number.The last mass stranding off the coast of Tasmania was in 2009, when around 200 whales beached themselves. In 2018, more than 100 pilot whales died after beaching themselves off the coast of New Zealand.It is not known why whales, which travel together in pods, sometimes beach themselves but they are known to follow a leader, as well as gather around an injured or distressed whale.“Their social groups and strong bonding between the groups causes often all of them to strand,” Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher and Project Manager of whales and climate at Griffith University, told Reuters.

21-09-2020||World||China air force video appears to show simulated attack on US base on Guam||China’s air force has released a video showing nuclear-capable H-6 bombers carrying out a simulated attack on what appears to be Andersen Air Force Base on the U.S. Pacific island of Guam, as regional tensions rise.The video, released on Saturday on the People’s Liberation Army Air Force Weibo account, came as China carried out a second day of drills near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to express anger at the visit of a senior U.S. State Department official to Taipei.Guam is home to major U.S. military facilities, including the air base, which would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.The Chinese air force’s two minute and 15 second video, set to solemn, dramatic music like a trailer for a Hollywood movie, shows H-6 bombers taking off from a desert base. The video is called “The god of war H-6K goes on the attack!” Halfway through, a pilot presses a button and looses off a missile at an unidentified seaside runway.The missile homes in on the runway, a satellite image of which is shown that looks exactly like the layout of Andersen.The music suddenly stops as images of the ground shaking appear, following by aerial views of an explosion.“We are the defenders of the motherland’s aerial security; we have the confidence and ability to always defend the security of the motherland’s skies,” the air force wrote in a brief description for the video.Neither China’s defence ministry nor U.S. Indo-Pacific Command immediately responded to requests for comment on the video.Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said the video was aimed at highlighting China’s growing prowess in long-range power projection.“The video is meant to warn the Americans that even supposedly safe, rearward positions such as Guam may come under threat when conflicts over regional flashpoints, be it Taiwan or South China Sea, erupt,” he said.The H-6 has been involved in multiple Chinese flights around and near Taiwan, according to Taiwan’s air force, including those last week.The H-6K is the latest model of the bomber, which is based on the 1950s vintage Soviet Tu-16.On Monday, China’s Eastern Theatre Command, which would be in charge of an attack on Taiwan, released a propaganda video of its own, called “what if war broke out today?”, showing soldiers running in wooded hills and ballistic missiles launching.“Motherland, I swear I will fight for you until my death!” large golden Chinese characters read at the end of the montage as explosions go off in the background.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-air-force-video-appears-to-show-simulated-attack-on-us-base-on-guam/story-TGOjOTO7oEZ5v1NHtppaOJ.html

Students will attend in-person classes once or twice a week.South Korea managed to contain the virus and avoid a full lockdown earlier this year, but infections at a church and political rally in August sparked the country’s largest outbreak forcing authorities to impose social distancing curbs. Many schools closed on Aug. 26, though high school seniors facing a key test were allowed to continue in-person classes.Authorities on Sunday, meanwhile, extended phase 2 social distancing for a week until Sept. 27, which limits indoor gatherings to below 50 and outdoor to less than 100. They said they would impose stricter restrictions on Sept. 28, ahead of the three-day Chuseok holiday when people traditionally reunite with families.“We are not at a stage to let our guard down yet,” health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho told a briefing.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 70 new cases as of midnight Sunday, the lowest daily increase since the middle of August. The latest outbreak peaked at more than 440 new cases at the end of August, and despite the steady decline officials say they fear the upcoming holiday may lead to another spike.Yoon urged residents to hold online visits during the holiday, and said the government is arranging for proxy services for some of the Chuseok traditions, including tidying around ancestors’ graves.Overall South Korea has reported 23,045 coronavirus cases with 385 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-schools-resume-in-person-classes-as-south-korea-coronavirus-cases-dip/story-X4005cZm2dlbZYUN4zLSEM.html
21-09-2020||World||Ginsburg’s death injects new doubt into fate of Obamacare||The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg injects new uncertainty into the fate of the Affordable Care Act as the landmark health-care law heads to a third showdown before US Supreme Court.President Donald Trump’s administration is asking the court to declare the law invalid and wipe out its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The court is scheduled to hear arguments on November 10, a week after the election, and probably will rule in the first half of 2021.With Ginsburg on the court, the law’s supporters held a strong, perhaps even unbeatable, hand. She was one of five justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, who remained on the court after voting in 2012 to uphold the core of the law in a case that raised similar issues.Her death Friday means defenders of the law will have to pick up a fifth vote from one of the other Republican-appointed justices.“I think you have to say that Affordable Care Act is in a more tenuous position today than it was on Friday morning,” said Nicholas Bagley, a health-care law professor at the University of Michigan Law School. “And you can hold that thought and still think that the likeliest outcome is that this very silly lawsuit will be turned away.”The law’s supporters have a strong candidate in Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose past votes and opinions term suggest he would be unlikely to throw out the entire ACA. Justice Samuel Alito’s record also suggests he would be open to upholding the bulk of the law, though he voted to invalidate it in 2012.Democrats are seeking to make Trump’s stance in the case a pivotal issue in the presidential election. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday Trump is trying to “strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.”Republican ChallengesThe law, also known as Obamacare because it was signed by President Barack Obama, brought health insurance to 20 million people. Republicans have tried repeatedly to kill the law since it was enacted in 2010. The court also upheld Obamcare’s crucial tax credits in 2015 in a clash that centered on a glitch in the wording of the statute.The latest legal fight stems from a provision known as the individual mandate, which originally required people to acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty.Writing for the court in 2012, Roberts said that provision was a legitimate use of Congress’s taxing power. A Republican-controlled Congress later joined with Trump to zero-out the tax penalty, leaving the mandate without any practical consequences.Republican-led states then sued to challenge the law. They argue that, without the tax penalty, Roberts’s rationale for upholding the individual mandate no longer applies. And the Republicans say the mandate is so integral to the law, even without any penalty attached to it, that the court now must strike down the whole thing.Kavanaugh’s VoteThe Trump administration is largely backing that position, while Democratic-run states are leading the defense of the law.Kavanaugh now could cast the pivotal vote. In other contexts, he has indicated reluctance to throw out an entire statute just because one part is unconstitutional.“Constitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute,” Kavanaugh wrote in July in a case involving the federal ban on robocalls to mobile phones.Roberts and Alito joined that opinion, which stripped out an exception for robocalls made to recoup debt owed to or guaranteed by the federal government.CFPB PrecedentThose three were also in the majority this year when the court resolved a case over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by stripping out a provision that shielded the director from being fired by the president. As with the robocall case, the court severed the job-protection provision from the statute that set up the CFPB.The reasoning in those cases, as well as a law review article Kavanaugh wrote before joining the Supreme Court, suggests the court will leave most of the ACA intact even if it decides the individual mandate is invalid, says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.“I don’t think there are five votes on the Supreme Court for holding that what’s left of the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the ACA,” Somin said.If a successor to Ginsburg hasn’t been confirmed by the argument date, the court in theory could split 4-4. That probably would mean a second argument to let the newest justice take part. The court could also take the preemptive step of rescheduling the argument to help ensure that nine justices can take part.No matter what the court decides, if Democrats win both the White House and the Senate, they could override the decision with a new law. They could even try to scuttle the case by re-imposing the tax before the court issues its ruling.And if Trump wins re-election, he will have four more years in the White House to try to kill the ACA.“Whoever wins the presidential election will have much more to say about the success or failure of the act than the court,” said Theodore Ruger, a health-law expert and dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School. “If it’s Trump, there are many administrative ways he could stifle it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ginsburg-s-death-injects-new-doubt-into-fate-of-obamacare/story-dBZh74pxCJkxIva5Hq9hwI.html
21-09-2020||World||China to lose access to Australian space tracking station||China will lose access to a strategic space tracking station in Western Australia when its contract expires, the facility’s owners said, a decision that cuts into Beijing’s expanding space exploration and navigational capabilities in the Pacific region.The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) has had a contract allowing Beijing access to the satellite antenna at the ground station since at least 2011. It is located next to an SSC satellite station primarily used by the United States and its agencies, including NASA.The Swedish state-owned company told Reuters it would not enter into any new contracts at the Australian site to support Chinese customers after its current contract expires. However, it did not disclose when the lease runs out.“Given the complexity of the Chinese market, brought about by the overall geopolitical situation, SSC has decided to focus mainly on other markets for the coming years,” the SSC said in an emailed response to questions.The site is owned by SSC subsidiary, SSC Space Australia.The Australian government did not immediately respond to questions on Monday.The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The expansion of China’s space capabilities, which includes the growing sophistication of its Beidou navigation network, is one of the new frontiers of tension between the U.S. and China, who are clashing on everything from technology and trade to Chinese activities in the disputed South China Sea.Australia has a strong alliance with the United States, which includes working together on space research and programmes, while Canberra’s diplomatic and trade ties with Beijing have also been fracturing.China last used the Yatharagga Satellite Station, located about 350 km (250 miles) north of the Australian city of Perth, in June 2013 to support the three-person Shenzhou 10 mission which completed a series of space docking tests, SSC said.The SSC said the current contract supports Chinese scientific space missions within its programme for manned-space flights for telemetry, tracking and command services.Overseas ExpansionGround stations are a vital part of space programmes given they create a telecommunications link with spacecraft. While stations have different capabilities, they can be equipped to co-ordinate satellites for civil-military Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Beidou, Russia’s GLONASS, the European Union’s Galileo system and U.S.-owned GPS.China’s space programme has been increasing its access to overseas ground stations in recent years in line with the expansion of its space exploration and navigational programmes.“Generally speaking anywhere you put a GNSS monitoring ground station will improve the accuracy of positioning for that region,” said Joon Wayn Cheong, a senior research associate at the University of New South Wales’ School of Electrical Engineering.Christopher Newman, professor of Space Law and Policy at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, said China wants to remove its dependence on GPS as part of broader plans to expand its global influence.“GPS could be made unavailable to them in a military conflict. An independent secure system is crucial for the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army in respect to targeting, weapons, navigation,” Newman told Reuters.Beijing last year re-established diplomatic ties with the small Pacific island nation of Kiribati, where it has a mothballed ground station in the central Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-lose-access-to-australian-space-tracking-station/story-1zoPf0EEyP4QV8YFwNweVM.html
21-09-2020||World||Elon Musk says Tesla has ‘shot at record quarter’ if employees rally||Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is rallying the troops as the end of the third quarter nears, urging employees in an email to make and sell as many electric cars as possible before Sept. 30.“We have a shot at a record quarter for vehicle deliveries, but will have to rally hard to achieve it,” said Musk in an internal email Sunday in the US that was seen by Bloomberg News. “This is the most number of vehicles per day that we’ve ever had to deliver.”Tesla makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y at its automotive plant in Fremont, California, and the Model 3 at its gigafactory in Shanghai. The company is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Sept. 22 and its first-ever so-called ‘Battery Day’ for investors.Tesla representatives in the US didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours. A Tesla China representative declined to comment.“Please consider vehicle deliveries to be absolute top priority,” Musk said in the email, which was titled ‘All hands on deck!’. “It’s also extremely important that we keep factory output as high as possible over the remaining 10 days. This is vital for the California market.”Musk, 49, has made a habit of sending end-of-quarter staff emails to urge productivity as well as to send a signal to investors. Tesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic dented consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars.The company hopes to deliver half a million vehicles in 2020, and has delivered roughly 179,000 through the first half. Blog Electrek reported on the internal communication earlier on Sunday.Tesla plans to ship China-built Model 3 cars made at its Shanghai factory to other countries in Asia and Europe and will likely start mass production of those vehicles in the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-shot-at-record-quarter-if-employees-rally/story-a1khDt8y4vkQGopyh5A0FI.html
21-09-2020||World||Hungary PM Viktor Orban endorses Donald Trump in November US election||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Monday endorsed Donald Trump’s re-election bid for the U.S. presidency, saying his rival Democrats have forced a “moral imperialism” on the world that illiberal leaders like himself reject.“We root for Donald Trump’s victory, because we know well American Democratic governments’ diplomacy, built on moral imperialism. We have been forced to sample it before, we did not like it, we do not want seconds,” Orban wrote in an essay.Nationalist Orban faces a steep challenge to his decade-long rule in parliamentary elections due in early 2022 as Hungary braces for the economic and social impact of a second wave of coronavirus infections.The vote would be decisive as the international liberal elite was out to destroy Christian conservatives in Europe, he wrote in the pro-government daily Magyar Nemzet.“They prepare for a decisive battle in 2022, backed by the international media, Brussels bureaucrats, and NGOs disguised as civil organisations,” Orban said. “It is time for us to line up too.” Hungary and other central European countries would place economic efficiency over European Union policies such as “climate goals elevated to absurdity, a social Europe, a common tax code and a multicultural society”, he said.The EU will try to implement the multi-trillion euro post-pandemic revival plan with key political discussions yet to be conducted among member states, some of which want to regulate the self-styled illiberal Orban much more strongly.The idea of strict conditions on the disbursement of EU aid and funds to the rule of law has prompted a threat of veto for the whole package from Orban, who said the system was more aptly described as “rule of blackmail.”Orban said the outcome much depended on the succession battle in Germany as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s term nears an end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-pm-viktor-orban-endorses-donald-trump-in-november-us-election/story-9phh4OTGbBsHZ68pqeNRmJ.html
21-09-2020||World||Why is Taiwan-China tension rising and what are the risks?||China sent numerous aircraft close to Taiwan during two days of drills from Friday, causing the island’s air force to scramble, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei.Why is the tension rising now?China claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, a threat the island has lived with since 1949, when defeated Kuomintang, or Nationalist, forces fled there after their defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war.China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for Taiwan, including two visits in as many months by top officials, one in August by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the other last week by Keith Krach, the undersecretary for economic affairs.In addition, the United States is planning major new arms sales to Taiwan. China views all these steps as effectively being U.S. support for Taiwan independence, with the eventual establishment of a Republic of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that the People’s Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan and has no right to.China calls Taiwan its most important and sensitive issue in U.S. ties. For China’s ruling Communist Party, Taiwan is the last part of the nation still awaiting “liberation” after the 1949 victory, adding an extra historical significance.What are the risks?Taiwan and China do not have an official dialogue mechanism, meaning that any accidental clash between their fighter jets, for example, could quickly spiral out of control.Taiwan’s air force now regularly scrambles to see off approaching Chinese aircraft.A conflict over Taiwan may suck in the United States and its Asian allies, though it is an open question whether Washington would, or could, come to Taipei’s aid.China may quickly overwhelm Taiwan with missile and cyber attacks before the United States even has a chance to respond.However, any war would be damaging for China too, in terms of its international reputation and economically, especially if it is subject to broad Western economic sanctions. Why is Taiwan strategically important? Not only is Taiwan in a key geographic location on the edge of the Pacific between the disputed South China Sea and Japan, but it is a tech powerhouse, home to the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.The United States views China’s tech firms as a security risk and has moved to cut off its access to advanced chips, including those from Taiwan.How do the armed forces on the two sides compare?Taiwan’s military is well-trained and well-armed, but is dwarfed by China’s People’s Liberation Army, which is adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and advanced missiles in the throes of an impressive modernisation programme.Tsai has made upgrading Taiwan’s military a priority, stressing “asymmetric warfare”, to make any attack as painful and as difficult for China as possible. This could include, for example, pinpoint strikes by long-range missiles on targets in China.What would happen in a war between Taiwan and China?While China could easily overwhelm Taiwan with missiles and air attacks, it has other options to bring the island to its knees, such as cyberattacks to take down basic infrastructure, or a naval blockade to force surrender.Whatever happens, the reaction of the United States will be crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-is-taiwan-china-tension-rising-and-what-are-the-risks/story-13ts1V9LoOHNinEeBxteyJ.html
21-09-2020||World||Australia’s Covid-19 hotspot reports lowest daily rise in infections since June||Australia’s coronavirus hotspot of Victoria reported on Monday its lowest daily rise in infections in three months, although state Premier Daniel Andrews said there were no plans yet to ease restrictions sooner than expected.Victoria, Australia’s second-most populous state and home to a quarter of its 25 million people, reported 11 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the smallest one-day jump since June 16. It also reported two deaths due to the virus.“This is not just a good day. This is a great day,” Andrews told reporters in the Victorian capital, Melbourne.But the premier said his government would not accelerate a timetable for easing restrictions, which were imposed after daily case numbers topped 700 in early August.“The formal position is clear,” Andrews said.“If circumstances change, if we find ourselves ahead of schedule, not for one day, but in a manifest sense, common sense always guides us,” he added.Melbourne has been under one of the toughest lockdowns, including nightly curfews, but the state government has said it will let construction sites, manufacturing plants, warehouses and childcare facilities in the capital reopen on Sept. 28 if the average number of cases over two weeks is below 50.The average in Melbourne is now below 35.The bulk of all restrictions in Victoria will be lifted in late October if the two-week average for the state is below 5, a target that has been criticised by Prime Minister Scott Morrison as too punitive and costly to the country’s economy.Australia has recorded its first recession in 30 years, while effective unemployment is still to top 13%, as virus-related restrictions paralysed business activity.The restrictions in Victoria, the epicentre of Australia’s Covid-19 outbreak, have however prevented a second wave of infections in the country.Australia has reported nearly 27,000 cases, 75% of which have been in Victoria, and 851 deaths due to the virus. Nearly 90% of all Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Victoria.New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, reported four new cases in the past 24 hours, though three of them were already in hotel quarantine after returning from overseas.Queensland state also reported one new infection in its hotel quarantine system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-covid-19-hotspot-reports-lowest-daily-rise-in-infections-since-june/story-ZBbDcpGLB7tomGHxxw0I8K.html

Abe stepped down due to ill health after nearly eight years in office.“I told him that the Japan-US alliance is the foundation of regional peace and stability, and we agreed to continue to coordinate closely,” Suga told reporters late Sunday night after the call with Trump.Suga said Trump also said he wanted to further develop the alliance together.Suga said the two leaders agreed to cooperate in the fight against the coronavirus and on North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats.Japan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement early Monday that the during their 25-minute call the two leaders also pledged cooperation in the development of the coronavirus vaccines and treatment, as well as regional security concerns.Known for his political prowess on domestic issues, Suga has hardly travelled overseas and his diplomatic skills are largely unknown, though he is expected to pursue Abe’s priorities.Suga inherits a range of international challenges, including balancing relations with China in the face of an ongoing US-China dispute over trade and other issues.Suga said Trump told him he can call him any time if something happened.“Now I’ve gained confidence,” he said, adding that he hoped to hold phone talks with other global leaders to explain Japan’s stance and deepen mutual understanding and cooperation.Suga also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier on Sunday and agreed to continue cooperating between the countries, the foreign ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-japan-prime-minister-suga-holds-first-talks-with-us-president-donald-trump/story-DwpoIH8Rgc3bHwr1y1vO3O.html
21-09-2020||World||Bahrain says it broke up militant attack plot by Iran in early 2020||Bahrain said on Monday that it broke up a plot by militants backed by Iran earlier this year to launch attacks on diplomats and foreigners in the island nation home to the US Navy’s 5th Fleet.The announcement came hours after Saudi state television and a Bahraini local newspaper implied the plot was new in their reporting Sunday night, just days after the island kingdom normalised relations with Israel. Bahraini government officials, who routinely claim breaking up plots by militants backed by Iran, did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press over the confusion.The details of the plot became public as tensions between Iran and the US remain high after the Trump administration claimed to have re-invoked all United Nations sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme — something disputed by other world powers. The militants reportedly sought revenge for the US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in January, something long threatened by his colleagues in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.Iran’s mission to the UN dismissed Bahrain’s claim of Tehran being involved as just “another instance in a long line of preposterous and false allegations, with no basis in truth.” “It appears there is no limit to Iran-bashing by the US and its client states in the region, who are trying to divert attention from their recent betrayal to Palestinians and their own people,” mission spokesman Alireza Miryousefi told the AP.The Saudi state TV report aired previously unseen footage of what appeared to be police raiding a home with a hidden passage. The footage showed assault rifles and explosives, apparently seized in the raid.Nine militants have been arrested, while another nine are believed to be in Iran, the Saudi state TV report said.Authorities uncovered the plot after finding an explosive on the street believed to have been planted to target a “foreign delegation,” the pro-government Bahraini newspaper Akhbar Al-Khaleej reported, citing the Interior Ministry. The ministry accused the Guard of supporting the militants, who also had surveilled oil sites and military bases, the newspaper said. The militants also planned on assassinating bodyguards of Bahraini officials, the newspaper said.It wasn’t clear when all the arrests and alleged plots took place, as the Akhbar Al-Khaleej report referred to incidents dating as far back as 2017. The newspaper linked the militants to the al-Ashtar Brigade, a Shiite group that has claimed responsibility for a number of bombings and attacks in Bahrain, including two that killed police. The group has been sanctioned by the US.Bahrain’s Interior Ministry later published what it described as a “clarification” saying the cases dated to the start of the year and “is not new”. However, media is tightly controlled on the island and access to such trials is routinely limited, suggesting authorities at the least encouraged the initial reporting.Bahrain is home to the 5th Fleet, which patrols the waterways of the Mideast. Officials have worried in the past that the sailors and Marines attached to the base in Manama could be targeted, as well as others who make up the 7,000 American troops there. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the 5th Fleet, declined to comment and referred questions to the Bahraini government.Bahrain, an island off the coast of Saudi Arabia, just last week normalised relations with Israel alongside the United Arab Emirates, in part over their joint suspicion of Iran. The UAE has said their move also pushed Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians. Civil society groups in Bahrain have opposed the normalisation decision.Israel’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the reported arrests in Bahrain.Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had pushed to take over Bahrain after the British left the country, although Bahrainis in 1970 overwhelmingly supported becoming an independent nation and the UN Security Council unanimously backed that. Since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Bahrain’s rulers have blamed Iran for arming militants on the island. Iran denies the accusations.Bahrain’s Shiite majority long has accused its Sunni rulers of treating them like second-class citizens. They joined pro-democracy activists in demanding more political freedoms in 2011, as Arab Spring protests swept the wider Middle East. Saudi and Emirati troops ultimately helped violently put down the demonstrations.Bahrain promised change after the protests. But in recent years, Bahrain has cracked down on all dissent, imprisoned activists and hampered independent reporting on the island. Militant groups like the al-Ashtar Brigade have launched small, sporadic attacks amid that crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-says-it-broke-up-militant-attack-plot-in-early-2020/story-IIG7TDMUnHkebsdJ1qEzrL.html
21-09-2020||World||Thailand protests: Plaque, placed by demonstrators challenging monarchy, removed||A plaque placed by Thai pro-democracy protesters near the Grand Palace in Bangkok that declared that Thailand belongs to the people and not the king has been removed, as police warned on Monday they may charge those behind the symbolic gesture. The plaque was placed on Sunday after a rally by tens of thousands of people who cheered calls for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.“I’ve received a report that the plaque is gone but I don’t know how and I don’t know who did it,” Bangkok’s deputy police chief Piya Tawichai told Reuters.“Police are checking with the BMA (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration) and checking who took it out as the plaque is part of the evidence to charge the protest group (for this wrongdoing),” Piya said.At the biggest demonstration in Thailand in years, protesters cheered calls for reform of the monarchy as well as for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution and elections.After the protest, people queued up to take pictures next to the plaque, which also features a hand giving the three-finger salute adopted by pro-democracy protesters.But far from all Thais support the new plaque, which resembles one that had commemorated the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 and which was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017, after Vajiralongkorn took the throne.Prominent right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom said on Sunday the plaque was inappropriate and the king was above politics.“It didn’t achieve anything,” he told Reuters. “These actions are symbolically against the king, but the king is not an opponent.”Craig Kunakorn, 33, a barber who had been at the protests came to visit the spot where the plaque had been cemented into the ground on Monday.“Everyone knew it would disappear soon but the success of creating it is something that will continue. It is still an important symbol,” Craig said.Anon Nampa, an activist and human rights lawyer, told Reuters the plaque should be returned to the people.“We will go and file a complaint to police today to find that plaque which is the people’s property and who took it,” said Anon, one of the leading figures in the loosely organised protest movement.Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailand’s palace and military-dominated establishment, breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy - which is illegal under lese majeste laws. The demonstrators say the constitution gives the king too much power and that it was engineered to allow Prayuth to keep power after elections last year. He says that vote was fair.The next protest is scheduled for Thursday. Protest leaders also called on Thais to take Oct. 14 off work to show their support for change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-protests-plaque-placed-by-demonstrators-challenging-monarchy-removed/story-RFKnFxJvYkh9qnsVFrxbLP.html

21-09-2020||World||Iran dismisses US efforts for UN sanctions as currency drops||Iran’s president dismissed US efforts to restore all UN sanctions on the country as mounting economic pressure from Washington pushed the local currency down to its lowest level ever on Sunday.Iran’s currency dropped to 272,500 to the US dollar at money exchange shops across Tehran.The rial has lost more than 30 per cent of its value to the dollar since June as sweeping US sanctions on Iran continue to crush its ability to sell oil globally.Iran’s currency was at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which was signed by the Obama administration but which the Trump administration pulled the US out of.Also read: US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushbackAs the currency plummeted, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani slammed the Trump administration’s declaration Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been reimposed because Tehran is not complying with the nuclear deal.“If America uses its bullying ... and does something in practice, it will have to face our decisive response,” Rouhani said in a Cabinet meeting Sunday.Rouhani said that, if the deal’s remaining signatories fully carry out their obligations under the agreement, Iran will walk back its steps away from the deal.For Iran, being able to sell oil remains its most important concern.The US move to reimpose sanctions has been rejected as illegal by most of the rest of the world and sets the stage for an ugly showdown at the world body ahead of its annual General Assembly this week.Even before the US declaration, other Security Council members had vowed to ignore it.They say the US lost legal standing to invoke snapback sanctions when President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and began reimposing US sanctions on Iran.France, Germany and Britain issued a joint statement Sunday reiterating that they contest the legal basis of the Trump administration’s bid to activate the “snapback” sanctions mechanism because the United States withdrew from the nuclear accord.The statement said “it follows that any decision or action taken on the basis of this procedure ... are without effect in law.” The three countries stressed they remain determined to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran.Also read: France, UK, Germany reject US call to return Iran sanctionsIsraeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi on Sunday welcomed the US sanctions efforts.He called on France, Britain and Germany to withdraw their opposition and support a “rigorous implementation of the sanctions.” Israel views Iran as its greatest threat, and has hailed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions.Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the snapback sanctions have only happened in “the fantastical world” of the Trump administration. He said the US stands on the wrong side of history.“They are attempting to make everyone believe it, but nobody is buying it except for themselves,” Khatibzadeh said during his weekly press briefing on Sunday.“It is a television show whose sole presenter, viewers and those cheering it on are Mr. Pompeo himself and a handful of others,” the spokesman said, referring to the US secretary of state.The White House plans to issue an executive order on Monday spelling out how the US will enforce the restored sanctions, and the State and Treasury departments are expected to outline how foreign individuals and businesses will be penalized for violations.Tensions are running high between Iran and the US, particularly since a US strike in January killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, prompting Tehran to retaliate with a ballistic missile strike on Iraqi bases housing American troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-dismisses-us-efforts-for-un-sanctions-as-currency-drops/story-OrsIEP9vt2El138BQNKdNL.html
21-09-2020||World||‘FinCEN’ documents reportedly show banks moved illicit funds: Report||Several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two decades, despite red flags about the origins of the money, BuzzFeed and other media reported on Sunday, citing confidential documents submitted by banks to the US government. The media reports were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the US Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen). The SARs, which the reports said numbered more than 2,100, were obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and other media organizations. In all, the ICIJ reported that the files contained information about more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, which were flagged by internal compliance departments of financial institutions as suspicious. The SARs are in themselves not necessarily proof of wrongdoing, and the ICIJ reported the leaked documents were a tiny fraction of the reports filed with FinCEN. Five global banks appeared most often in the documents — HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the ICIJ reported. The SARs provide key intelligence in global efforts to stop money laundering and other crimes. The media reports on Sunday painted a picture of a system that is both under-resourced and overwhelmed, allowing vast amounts of illicit funds to move through the banking system. A bank has a maximum of 60 days to file SARs after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction, according to the Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The ICIJ report said in some cases the banks failed to report suspect transactions until years after they had processed them. The SARs also showed that banks often moved funds for companies that were registered in offshore havens, such as the British Virgin Islands, and did not know the ultimate owner of the account, the report said. Staff at major banks often used Google searches to learn who was behind large transactions, it said.Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank. “I hope these findings spur urgent action from policymakers to enact needed reforms,” said Tim Adams, chief executive of the trade group Institute of International Finance, in a statement. “As noted in today’s reports, the impacts of financial crime are felt beyond just the financial sector – it poses grave threats to society as a whole.”In a statement to Reuters, HSBC said “all of the information provided by the ICIJ is historical.” The bank said as of 2012, “HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.”Standard Chartered said in a statement to Reuters, “We take our responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously and have invested substantially in our compliance programmes.” BNY Mellon told Reuters it could not comment on specific SARs. “We fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and assist authorities in the important work they do,” the bank said. JPMorgan said it has “thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to this important work.” “We have played a leadership role in anti-money laundering reform,” the bank said in a statement.In a statement on Sunday, Deutsche Bank said the ICIJ had “reported on a number of historic issues.” “We have devoted significant resources to strengthening our controls and we are very focused on meeting our responsibilities and obligations,” the bank said.FinCen said in a statement on its website on Sept. 1 that it was aware that various media outlets intended to publish a series of articles based on unlawfully disclosed SARs, as well as other documents, and said that the “unauthorized disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States.” Representatives for the US Treasury declined comment beyond the FinCen statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fincen-documents-reportedly-show-banks-moved-illicit-funds-report/story-pjVsNk1sATXIULiJA8WcWM.html
21-09-2020||World||Don’t jam through Ginsburg nominee: Joe Biden to GOP senators||Joe Biden on Sunday slammed President Donald Trump and leading Senate Republicans for trying to jam through a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and urged more senators to stand with a pair of GOP colleagues who oppose the election-season rush.The extraordinary televised plea from the Democratic presidential candidate to Republican senators reflected the ferocious maneuvering that has followed Ginsburg’s death at 87 on Friday. Her passing upended a campaign that had, until then, focused on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the nation’s economic collapse and racial unrest that has stoked protests in US cities.Trump has said he intends within days to name a woman to succeed the liberal icon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was moving toward the first hearings this week.Just hours before Biden spoke, a second Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in opposing efforts to fill Ginsburg’s seat before the next president is elected.It takes four Republicans to break ranks to keep Trump’s nominee off the court. Attention quickly focused on Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who voted to convict Trump on one count of impeachment, and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Also read: How Ginsburg’s death could reshape the presidential campaignBiden acknowledged that those Republicans and others like them were his target audience when he warned that Trump’s plan was an “abuse of power.”“Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience,” said Biden, speaking in battleground Pennsylvania. “Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have engulfed our country.”There was little chance of calm overtaking the historic campaign as early voting progressed and the death toll from the virus reached 200,000 Americans.Just before Murkowski joined Collins, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to the House having “options” she did not name to stall or prevent the Senate from confirming Ginsburg’s successor to the lifetime job.“We have arrows in our quiver that I’m not about to discuss right now,” Pelosi said on ABC’s “This Week.” The House has no formal role in the confirmation of Supreme Court justices. But Pelosi would not rule out a new round of impeachment proceedings that might divert the Senate’s attention, though that route seemed unlikely.Meanwhile, Murkowski raised by one the number of Republicans opposing a rush to confirmation.“For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up” a potential nomination as the presidential election neared. “Sadly,” she said, “what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed.”Collins, meanwhile, said the next president should name Ginsburg’s replacement.Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the Senate. If there were a 50-50 tie, it could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence.There is another potential wrinkle: Because Arizona’s Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30, which would narrow the window for McConnell if Democrat Mark Kelly wins.Trump has said he is obligated to act as soon as possible and had at least two women in mind for the seat. Most Republicans concurred on the need for speed and one named a practical reason: The nine-member court, argued Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, must be full if called upon to decide the outcome of a disputed presidential election.But Biden and other Democrats said voters should choose the next president, who should pick Ginsburg’s successor. Health care, abortion rights and religious freedom are on the line, they said.Biden, who has run on uniting the country after Trump’s divisive tenure and imparting a sense of comfort to despairing Americans, warned against more upheaval.“The last thing we need is a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss and deeper into the darkness,” he said. He acknowledged that if Trump wins, his pick should be approved.But he added, “If I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn and as the new president I should be the one to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor.”Nonetheless, the process for replacing her moved swiftly ahead. On a call with McConnell, R-Ky., late Saturday, Trump mentioned two federal appeals court judges: Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa, according to a person familiar with the private conversation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the call and spoke on condition of anonymity.To the chants of “Fill that seat,” Trump told supporters at an event Saturday night in North Carolina that he would nominate a woman as soon as this week.“We win an election and those are the consequences,” said Trump, who then seemed to signal that he’d be willing to accept a vote on his nominee during the lame-duck period after the election. “We have a lot of time. We have plenty of time. We’re talking about January 20th” — when the next president is inaugurated.Democrats have denounced McConnell’s move to push ahead as hypocritical, pointing out that he refused to call hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, 237 days before the 2016 election.If the court were to take cases with eight justices, 4-4 ties would revert the decision to a lower court; for instance, the Affordable Care Act could then be struck down by a lower Texas court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-jam-through-ginsburg-nominee-joe-biden-to-gop-senators/story-nQipakphrRp9pvs3RncAaM.html
21-09-2020||World||Donald Trump to nominate female judge to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg||President Donald Trump has said he intends to name a woman as his nominee to replace late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and will make an announcement next week.“It will be a woman — a very talented, very brilliant woman,” Trump said at an election rally in North Carolina on Saturday. “We haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list.”The president first spoke of picking a woman for the seat left vacant by the passing of Ginsburg while talking to reporters before departing for the rally. Asked if he would pick a woman, he said he could. “I could see, most likely, it would be a woman, yeah. I think I can say that it would be a woman. I would - if somebody were to ask me now, I would say that a woman would be in first place, yes.” He also said in a response to another question he expects to announce his pick next week .Female judges reportedly in his shortlist include Amy Coney Barrett, a judge on the Seventh Court of Appeals (similar to Indian high courts). He had interviewed her in 2018 when considering a nominee to replace Stephen Kennedy. He went with Brett Kavanaugh instead.Whoever Trump picks eventually will face a bruising confirmation process in the Senate, with fierce opposition expected from Democrats. They want the seat to be filled by the next president, whoever wins the November 3 elections, as Republicans had argued in 2016 to block President Barack Obama’s pick for a vacancy in the court.With Trump announcing he will pick a woman, chances have diminished for Amul Thapar, an Indian-American judge who was earlier reported to be among front-runners for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-nominate-female-judge-to-replace-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg/story-AZka4WMpL0VVNMiCyYAr7H.html
21-09-2020||World||US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushback||The US said international sanctions on Iran are automatically “snapping back,” in a move that most nations say the Trump administration doesn’t have the authority to demand since quitting a 2015 nuclear deal two years ago.“Sanctions are being re-imposed on Iran,” secretary of state Michael Pompeo said in a statement late on Saturday. “The United States expects all UN member states to fully comply with their obligations to implement these measures.”That’s unlikely to happen, with key European powers on Sunday stressing their commitment to the nuclear agreement.Their support for the deal has left the US isolated on the United Nations Security Council, and most nations say America has no authority to demand the return of international sanctions, since it’s no longer a party to the deal.“We have worked tirelessly to preserve the nuclear agreement and remain committed to do so,” the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK said in a statement on Sunday. The accord is “a key pillar of the global non-proliferation architecture,” Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said in a separate statement, adding that all parties should “do their utmost to preserve the agreement.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, at a cabinet meeting on Sunday shown on state television news, called the US move a sign of “certain failure” which only demonstrates that President Donald Trump’s strategy has resulted in “maximum isolation” for Washington. On Saturday, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that Iran would set Washington’s military outposts in the Persian Gulf “on fire at once” if its adversary tried to start a war.The US on Monday will sanction more than two dozen people and entities involved in Iran’s nuclear, missile and conventional arms programmes, a senior US official told Reuters, putting teeth behind UN sanctions that Washington argues have resumed.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide detailed evidence regarding either assertion.A major part of the new US push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms and will also be unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-move-on-un-iran-sanctions-faces-pushback/story-oRuEVL1Ewgj7DOekFrOKTJ.html
21-09-2020||World||Hackers leak personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police on weekend of protests||Anonymous hackers leaked the personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police officers in retaliation for a crackdown on street demonstrations against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko, as protesters geared up for another mass rally on Sunday.“As the arrests continue, we will continue to publish data on a massive scale,” said a statement that was distributed by the opposition news channel Nexta Live on the messaging app Telegram. “No one will remain anonymous even under a balaclava.”The government said it would find and punish those responsible for leaking the data, which was widely distributed on Telegram channels on Saturday evening. “The forces, means and technologies at the disposal of the internal affairs bodies make it possible to identify and prosecute the overwhelming majority of those guilty of leaking personal data on the Internet,” said Olga Chemodanova, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.The loyalty of the security forces is crucial to Lukashenko’s ability to cling on to power following last month’s presidential election, in which he claimed a landslide victory but his opponents say was rigged to hand the former Soviet collective farm boss a sixth term. Security forces have detained thousands of people to tackle a wave of protests and strikes, their faces often obscured by masks, balaclavas or riot helmets. Some protesters have physically torn off the masks of some officers.The government said 390 women were detained for taking part in a protest on Saturday against Lukashenko. Most have been released. Lukashenko’s crackdown on the protests has prompted the European Union to weigh fresh sanctions against his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-leak-personal-data-of-1-000-belarusian-police-on-weekend-of-protests/story-SW0dgSwoUr8uG1TX8ClFOK.html
21-09-2020||World||UK curb flouters face fines of $13k||From September 28, those who violate Covid-19 restrictions in the UK will face fines of up to £10,000 (nearly $13,000), as health secretary Matt Hancock said the country is at a “tipping point” with cases rising exponentially.The country reported a further 4,422 new cases on Saturday, the biggest daily increase since early May. Hancock told TV channels on Sunday: “This country faces a tipping point. We face a choice. If everybody follows the rules ...then we can avoid further national lockdowns”. “But we of course have to be prepared to take action if that is what is necessary. I don’t rule it out; I don’t want to see it.” The fines for those breaching self-isolation rules will start at £1,000 (nearly $1,300), but could increase to up to £10,000 for repeat offences and for the most egregious breaches, including for those preventing others from self-isolating. Russia reported 6,148 cases of Covid-19 in the past day, the most new cases registered in two months. The number of new infections is up 30% since September 1, when schools opened. France’s daily coronavirus cases surged to the highest since the national lockdown ended in May. Another 13,498 cases were reported on Saturday, the second straight day over 13,000.To the alarm of experts, Italians headed to the polls for a referendum and regional elections. Just a week after a Herculean effort by schools to reopen in line with last-minute Covid-19 rules, classrooms across the country were shut to pupils and transformed into ballot stations.In Spain, nearly a million Madrid residents went into a partial lockdown from Sunday. Meanwhile global fatalities neared 1 million, and deaths in the US, the worst-hit country, moved closer to 200,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-curb-flouters-face-fines-of-13k/story-y62jhi3DtT7tx9inlKmhUN.html
