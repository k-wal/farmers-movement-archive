Both measures are intended to ensure American workers were not displaced or denied jobs because of cheaper foreign workers. Critics of the H-1B programme argue that US companies are hiring foreign workers to displace American ones, and that they are not highly skilled as they ought to be. More than 70% of these H-1B visas go to Indians hired by US companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, and US subsidiaries of Indian IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS.Office of Management and Budget of the White House has posted a notice on its website saying a review was under way of H-1B and other visas, but no details were available.White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Reuters news agency that these measures will be “utterly transformative” and will ensure there is “no market for someone to drive back down wages on H-1Bs to displace American workers”.The administration would expect to have them in place for maximum impact before elections on November 3. Reuters reported that these measures were being fast-tracked and the final bunch of orders could also include restriction on international students.The H-1B visa programme has been on the crosshairs of the Trump administration from the beginning and it has been changed and altered incrementally since, through executive orders. It was suspended temporarily in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs that were becoming available from the lockdown. The president has also suspended all immigration till December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-set-to-make-it-tough-for-cos-to-hire-h-1b-visa-holders/story-kOoWvLwYlpzcX6s8NtVr3O.html
22-09-2020||World||UN chief slams countries for making Covid-19 vaccination ‘side deals’ for their own population||With the Covid-19 pandemic soon reaching the grim milestone of a million deaths, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday chided those countries who are making “side deals” to have vaccine exclusively for their own populations, saying such “vaccinationalism” is “self-defeating.” “We are working to advance treatments and therapies as a global public good – and backing efforts for a people’s vaccine available and affordable everywhere. Yet some countries are reportedly making side deals exclusively for their own populations,” Guterres said.“Such ‘vaccinationalism’ is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe, until all of us are safe. Likewise, economies cannot run with a runaway pandemic,” he said in his address to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly that commenced on Tuesday in the shadow of the devastating and still raging Covid-19 pandemic.Global organisation Oxfam has warned that wealthy nations representing just 13 per cent of the world’s population have already cornered more than half (51 per cent) of the promised doses of leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Oxfam said the efforts of rich countries, especially the US, to adopt a “me first” nationalistic approach prevents coordination and could prevent or delay the vaccine from reaching people who are at most risk, both living in developing countries and here at home.The Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected over 30 million people and more than 958,000 people have died. The US, with 6.7 million infections, crossed the grim milestone of 200,000 deaths.Guterres said that since the beginning of the pandemic, the UN has pushed for a massive rescue package worth at least 10 per cent of the global economy. “Developed countries have provided enormous relief for their own economies. They can afford it. But we need to ensure that the developing world does not fall into financial ruin, escalating poverty and debt crises. We need a collective commitment to avoid a downward spiral,” he said. The UN system, led by the World Health Organisation, has supported governments — particularly in the developing world — to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, he said.“Our global supply chains have helped to provide personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to more than 130 countries,” Guterres said, adding that the UN has has extended life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable countries and people through a Global Humanitarian Response Plan.The UN’s ‘Verified’ campaign is also fighting misinformation online — in and of itself a toxic virus shaking the democratic underpinnings in many countries, he said.Guterres also gave a clarion call for an inclusive and effective multilateralism that meets the test of the 21st century, cautioning that countries cannot respond to the crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic by “withdrawing into national shells.” “More than seven decades on, multilateral institutions need an upgrade to more equitably represent all the people of the world, rather than giving disproportionate power to some and limiting the voice of others,” he said.“We don’t need new bureaucracies. We need a multilateral system that constantly innovates, delivers for people, and protects our planet,” he added. He underscored that 21st century multilateralism must be networked - linking global institutions across sectors and geographies, from development banks to regional organizations and trade alliances.“To overcome today’s fragilities and challenges we need more international cooperation - not less; strengthened multilateral institutions - not a retreat from them; better global governance - not a chaotic free-for-all,” he said.Calling on nations to stand united and act in solidarity in the hour of the global crisis, Guterres said, “when countries go in their own direction, the virus goes in every direction.” He also urged countries to be guided by science and tethered to reality in combating this pandemic.The UN chief said that in order to truly reduce fragilities and risks, and to more effectively solve shared problems, “we need a corresponding New Global Deal at the international level.” He said this New Global Deal is about ensuring that the global political and economic systems deliver on critical global public goods, as he noted with concern that today that is simply not happening.“We have huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks. To close these gaps, we need to ensure that power, wealth and opportunities are broadly and fairly shared,” he said.He underlined that the New Global Deal must address historical injustices in global power structures.Guterres also strongly asserted that special focus has to be put on women and girls as the world strives to recover from the pandemic and build back better.He said women do most of the unpaid care work generated by the pandemic and women have fewer economic resources to fall back on, because their wages are lower, and they have less access to benefits.The UN chief warned that unless “we act now, gender equality could be set back by decades.” He called on nations to stamp out the horrifying increase in violence against women and girls during the pandemic, from domestic violence to sexual abuse, online harassment and femicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-slams-countries-for-making-covid-19-vaccination-side-deals-for-their-own-population/story-z0N5JD3053hvSx8fDulZfN.html
22-09-2020||World||No guarantee any Covid-19 vaccine in development will work, says WHO chief||World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said that the health organisation has no guarantee whether any vaccine in development for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will work.“We have no guarantee that any vaccine in development will work.The more candidates we test, the higher the chance we will have for a safe and efficacious vaccine,” the WHO chief said during a virtual press briefing.He said that almost 200 vaccine candidates are being developed to tackle the disease. “Almost 200 vaccine for Covid-19 are currently in clinical and preclinical testing. The history of vaccine development tells us some will fail and some will succeed,” Tedros added.The WHO, in coordination with global vaccine alliance group Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), has created a mechanism to enable equal distribution of any Covid vaccines among countries in the future .“The Covax facility enables governments to spread their reach of vaccine development and ensure their population can have early access to effective vaccines. Even more importantly, the Covax facility is the mechanism that will enable a globally coordinated roll out for the greatest possible impact,” the health organisation chief said. ‘Race for vaccine a collaboration, not a contest’Reminding the countries that the race to find a cure for Covid-19 is a collaboration and not a competition, Ghebreyesus said, “The Covax facility will help bring the pandemic under control, save lives and escalate the economic recovery, and ensure that the race for Covid-19 vaccine is a collaboration, not a contest.”‘Not charity’As the countries move ahead in their quest to find a vaccine for coronavirus, the WHO chief urged nations to work together, pointing out that it was in every country’s best interest to find vaccine for Covid-19.“This is not charity. It is in every country’s best interest. We sink or we swim together. The fastest route to end the pandemic and accelerating the global economic recovery is to ensure some people are vaccinate in all countries, not all people in some countries,” the chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-guarantee-any-covid-19-vaccine-in-development-will-work-says-who-chief/story-1vXtwsHNzKmYLpBF2DWckK.html
22-09-2020||World||US, China clash over Covid, trade, human rights at UNGA||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday asked the United Nations to hold China “accountable” for the Covid-19 pandemic, describing it as the “China virus”, and China hit back urging nations to reject any attempt to politicise the health crisis or stigmatise it and said the world must fight it together.“The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions,” Trump said in a pre-recorded address to the UN General Assembly, as the world body is marking 75 years of its founding.The US president accused China of unleashing “this plague” on the world and then concealing early evidence that the deadly pathogen can be transmitted human-to-human and by asymptomatic people.“In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world,” Trump said.“China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes.”Trump’s attack on China at the UN followed a narrative that he has often used domestically to fend off criticism of his own handling of the worst public health crisis the country has faced in 100 years, with the toll infections crossing 200,000 on Tuesday.The pandemic, which has killed 965,000 and infected more than 31 millions worldwide, has overshadowed the UN meetings this year. Leaders are participating virtually, through pre-recorded speeches, with introductions from their respective representatives. In an unmistakable reference to the US-China trade war, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier talked about the need to prevent a “new cold war”.  Nevertheless, the US and China brought their battle to the General Assembly undeterred. After slamming China over the Covid-19 pandemic, the US president attacked China over environment and trade.Also read | Hold China accountable for unleashing Covid-19 plague onto world: Trump at UNGA“Every year China dumps millions and millions of tonnes of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries’ waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world,” he said, adding, “China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has, and it’s rising fast.”President Trump went on to accuse China of “trade abuses” and claimed credit for standing up to it, triggering a trade war that soon engulfed the whole world. While he won some minor concessions from China in an interim deal, the larger issues that he had cited as his reasons remain unresolved.The American leader told the United Nations that if it intended to be effective, it “must focus on the real problems of the world”: terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labour, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.China first hit back against Trump briefly in remarks by its ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun. He said, while introducing President Xi Jinping, that China rejects “baseless accusation” and opposes “political virus”.President Xi followed up with a direct rebuke of Trump’s pre-recorded speech with his own.Also read | Don’t want to fight hot or cold war with any country: What Xi Jinping said at UNGA“Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get through this together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization,” Xi said, adding, “Any attempt of politicising the issue or stigmatisation must be rejected.” The Chinese president called for the world to combat the health crisis unitedly. “We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,” Xi said in his pre-recorded speech.Xi went on to propose four measures for the world to combat the crisis: put people and life first, enhance solidarity, adopt comprehensive and long-term control measures, and, finally, show concern for and accommodate the need of developing countries, especially African countries, according Xinhua news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-clash-over-covid-trade-human-rights-at-unga/story-IyXfQyRNoMilYKv3aKxSxK.html

We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy-- the China virus, which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries,” he said.He further said, “As we pursue a bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world-- China. In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China & infect the world.”He also slammed the Chinese government and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for falsely declaring that there is no evidence of human to human transmission of coronavirus.“Chinese government and WHO, which is virtually controlled by China, falsely declared that there was no evidence of human to human transmission. Later they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease. UN must hold China accountable for their actions,” he said.On the US’ contribution amid the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, “In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilisation since the Second World War. We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe.”Speaking on the environment, the US President said, “Every year China dumps millions and millions of tonnes of plastic and trash into the oceans over other country’s waters destroying vast swathes of coral reef and emitting more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world.”“China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the US has, and it’s rising fast. By contrast, after I withdrew from the one sided Paris Climate accord, last year America reduces carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement. Those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s ramping pollution, are not interested in the environment,” he said.Trump urged the United Nations to be an effective organisation by focusing on the real problems of the world including terrorism, oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human sex trafficking, religious persecution and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/75-years-after-world-war-ii-world-is-again-engaged-in-a-great-global-struggle-donald-trump-at-unga/story-1DJFmU0pz0IsXDDl1lDcAM.html

We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,” Xi said in a pre-recorded video statement to the annual gathering of world leaders, conducted virtually this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China hit boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing’s bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington’s traditional leadership.The coronavirus emerged in China late last year and Washington accuses Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the outbreak. China denies the U.S. assertions.In what appeared to be a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump, though both leaders’ speeches were pre-recorded, Xi called for a global response to the virus and giving the World Health Organization a leading role.Trump has announced plans for the United States to leave the Geneva-based WHO, accusing the agency of being a puppet of China, a claim the WHO denied.“Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get through this together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization,” Xi said. “Any attempt of politicizing the issue or stigmatization must be rejected.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 193-member General Assembly earlier on Tuesday that everything must be done to avoid a new Cold War, warning that “we are moving in a very dangerous direction.”“Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture,” he said. “A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geo-strategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-un-china-s-xi-jinping-says-no-intention-to-fight-a-cold-war-or-hot-one-with-any-country/story-V7B7OzhcdqTFrIV3v4KVGP.html

He urged the United Nations to hold it accountable for “unleashing this plague onto the world.”Addressing the UN’s first virtual meeting of world leaders, Trump accused the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) of making a false declaration that there was no evidence of human to human transmission of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the deadly infection.

22-09-2020||World||Sign-up delays for global Covid-19 vaccine plan are procedural: WHO||More countries will sign up to a global vaccination plan and some of the delays were due to procedural issues rather than doubts about the scheme, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Tuesday. The Geneva-based body has said that 156 nations have joined the so-called COVAX plan to deliver some 2 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of next year but big countries such as China, Russia and the United States are missing.About 64 wealthy nations have signed up and more are expected despite missing an official deadline. However, some of those supporting the plan such as France are reluctant to use it to secure vaccines and have instead struck separate supply deals. “What we’ve announced is the beginning. It’s going to continue,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, calling the number of sign-ups to date “brilliant”. “We all need to be in this together in order to finish this pandemic.”She declined to comment on specific countries and said discussions were ongoing.Asked to elaborate on delays to joining, Harris said some were due to paperwork and the need for parliamentary approval. Other countries, however, appear to have no intention of signing up.A Russian government source told Reuters there was no need for his country to take part in the programme since it was developing and producing its own vaccine.“Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that our vaccine will in future be offered to participants of COVAX,” the source said.The Russian health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.“China will continue to work with WHO, Gavi and relevant countries on vaccine development,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing on Tuesday.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, asked whether he knew why China had not yet joined the COVAX scheme, told Reuters he hoped China and the other 37 countries that have not signed up would still do so.“They may have their own reasons to take some time until they decide,” Tedros said in Oslo after receiving an award for fostering international cooperation from a Norwegian association.“I am not really sure what is preventing them from joining. But we hope they will join,” he added via video link.In Geneva, at the briefing, Harris said the WHO would make public a WHO internal app giving information on the pandemic which would include comprehensive global and regional overviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sign-up-delays-for-global-covid-19-vaccine-plan-are-procedural-who/story-tpM2R5vUy9rSBkgm4K0pwO.html
22-09-2020||World||Chinese court sends Xi critic and former tycoon to 18 years in jail||A court in China on Tuesday sentenced a former real estate tycoon and vocal critic of President Xi Jinping to 18 years in prison for corruption. “Former property mogul Ren Zhiqiang was sentenced to 18 years and fined 4.2 million yuan ($620,000) for corruption, bribery, embezzlement of public funds, and abuse of power as state-owned company personnel,” state media quoted a Beijing court as ruling on Tuesday.Ren, 69, reportedly confessed “voluntarily” to all charges and will not appeal against the decision.The former chairperson of Huayuan Properties, a real estate development company, was detained in March after writing an essay criticising China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Ren did not name Xi in the essay but it was widely believed the critique was about the powerful Chinese leader; Ren even used the word “clown” in his essay. In July, Ren was expelled from the Communist Party of China for “seriously” violating the “party’s political, organisational, integrity, work and life disciplines”.Ren had a massive following on China’s social media and was known as “cannon” for his outspoken and controversial views.In early 2016, Ren was banned from Chinese social media after he criticised a much-publicised Xi speech on how the media should serve the CPC.According to Chinese state media, Ren also suggested controversial ideas like the “…poor young migrant workers who cannot afford apartments in cities should return to the countryside.”According to report and translation of his March essay, Ren is said to have written: He did not directly refer to Mr Xi in his essay, but according to a report in the China Digital Times, said: “I too am curiously and conscientiously studying [Xi’s teleconferenced February 23] speech, but what I saw in it was the complete opposite of the ‘importance’ reported by all types of media and online.”“I saw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his “new clothes,” but a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing being emperor.” “I was unable to cheer for the February 23 speech, because in it I saw a bigger crisis, one that ferments even faster in [the context of] that speech and the cheers it won. When shameless and ignorant people attempt to resign themselves to the stupidity of the great leader, society becomes a mob that is hard to develop and sustain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-sends-xi-critic-and-former-tycoon-to-18-years-in-jail/story-WFxFi44qiURo25uCm06LsM.html
22-09-2020||World||World powers take the stage, virtually, at UN debate||The UN’s first virtual meeting of world leaders started Tuesday with pre-recorded speeches from some of the planet’s biggest powers, kept at home by the coronavirus pandemic that will likely be a dominant theme at their video gathering this year.Among those speaking Tuesday are US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose countries have reported the highest and second-highest coronavirus death tolls, respectively. Also on deck are President Xi Jinping of China, where the virus originated, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which has raised international eyebrows with its rapid vaccine development.After Monday’s introductory session marking the UN’s 75th anniversary, the meeting’s central event — speeches from each of its 193 member nations — start Tuesday. They traditionally serve as a platform for countries to tout accomplishments, seek support, stoke rivalries and express views on global priorities.This year, the platform is online, and there is a pressing new priority in the pandemic that has killed over 960,000 people worldwide.“When we met in New York a year ago, no one could have imagined that 2020 would arrange such a powerful crash test for our world,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remarked in his video speech for Monday’s anniversary commemoration.By custom, Brazil speaks first and the US second as the host country in the annual meeting’s “general debate,” which is generally less a dialogue than a series of declarations.The coronavirus has inflicted heavy tolls on both countries, close to 200,000 people in the US and over 136,000 in Brazil, according to statistics collected by Johns Hopkins University.Both Bolsonaro and Trump have been at odds, at least at times, with governors and health experts over the pandemic and have emphasized the economic consequences of shutdowns.Both also are contending with plenty of other issues that command world attention, including Bolsonaro’s plans to develop the Amazon and Trump’s 2018 decision to pull the US out of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Washington took a further step this weekend with a unilateral, and disputed, declaration that all U.N. penalties eased under the 2015 nuclear deal had been restored, setting up a likely showdown at the assembly — where Iran’s speech is also scheduled Tuesday.So is Turkey’s, a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the UN has “flunked during the pandemic.” The virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, late last year. After building field hospitals and imposing a draconian 76-day lockdown to battle the virus there, China has said of late that it is seeing relatively few cases, mostly among people arriving from other countries. China, the world’s most populous nation, has reported over 4,700 deaths.Russia, where the death toll is over 19,000, last month became the first country to approve a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus. Russian President Vladimir Putin trumpeted the development, saying one of his adult daughters had already been inoculated. But international health experts have expressed caution about the vaccine’s effectiveness and safety because of the small study sample and other limitations.A record number of heads of states and governments are due to speak at the virtual meeting, rather than sending ministers or diplomats. That’s a good thing, “but the idea that prime ministers and presidents are going to be sitting at home with a bucket of popcorn watching each other’s televised speeches is a bit silly,” said Richard Gowan, who oversees UN issues for Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.Still, German UN Ambassador Christoph Heusgen sees the assembly as a chance for a global meeting of minds when it’s needed more than ever.“Even in a digital format, UNGA-75 is an opportunity — especially in the face of international conflicts and dramatic challenges such as climate change or COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-powers-take-the-stage-virtually-at-un-debate/story-7QFpgmIqBgnqHxUDGAq5WK.html
22-09-2020||World||UK PM launches new Covid restrictions that may last six months||Rattled by a surge of new Covid-19 cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday outlined more restrictions short of a full lockdown that would perhaps last for six months, insisting that his government is “acting on the principle of a stitch in time saves nine.”Presenting new data in the House of Commons, Johnson said that in the last fortnight, hospital admissions in England had more than doubled, adding that new cases are growing fastest among those aged 20-29. The cumulative figure of cases in the UK on Tuesday crossed 4 lakhs, with nearly 42,000 deaths based on incidence in hospitals and care homes.The government, Johnson said, would use the military, if need be, to enforce the new restrictions and fines of up to 10,000 pounds on those breaching self-isolation. It also had the “right to deploy greater firepower” if things did not improve.“Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act. And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter,” he said.The curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres, which has further unnerved the industry struggling to balance the books in recent months. New fines of up to 10,000 pounds and compulsory wearing of masks are among the new steps.Another key advice was to ‘work from home’, a reversal of the recent ‘back to work’ advice when new cases were in the hundreds. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.The new advice to last “perhaps six months” also means Johnson has dropped his earlier optimism of a return to normal by Christmas. He went on to caution people against complacency, highlighting the range of new fines to those who breach self-isolation or restrictions.On Monday evening, the Joint Biosecurity Centre of the British government raised the national Covid-19 alert level from three to four, which means the epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is “high or rising exponentially”.The alert level was reduced from level four to three on June 19. The centre has five alert levels; the highest refers to a stage of outbreak in which there is a risk of health services being overwhelmed.Johnson said: “We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave, with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing”.“So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-launches-new-covid-restrictions-that-may-last-six-months/story-i1kuL0BHx8ElDncbFpl14L.html
22-09-2020||World||Global MPs’ group seeks UN probe into Xinjiang-style forced labour in Tibet||A global group of parliamentarians on Tuesday asked the United Nations to install a special rapporteur to investigate reports of ethnic persecution by China after evidence emerged of forced labour in Tibet.Releasing a report on Xinjiang-style forced labour in Tibet by academic Adrian Zenz, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China said governments should impose targeted sanctions on those responsible.The report from the Jamestown Foundation said Tibet has since last year introduced policies promoting “the systematic, centralised, and large-scale training and transfer of ‘rural surplus labourers’” to other parts of Tibet and other regions. More than half a million labourers went through the programme in the first seven months of this year, according to the report. The 58 MPs from 16 parliaments said in a statement that governments should urgently revise their risk advice to their companies currently sourcing from areas affected by Tibetan and other Chinese forced labour schemes “to keep goods and services purchased in our respective jurisdictions from being tainted by Tibetan forced labour.”The 17 British MPs among signatories include former leader of the Conservative party, Iain Duncan-Smith, and senior leader David Davis. Other signatories include those from the US, Australia, Canada, European Union, Italy, Germany, France, New Zealand and Switzerland.Zenz’s report raises concerns about a large-scale mandatory ‘vocational training’ programme, enlisting over 500,000 labourers in the region, together with accounts of enforced indoctrination, intrusive surveillance, military-style enforcement, and harsh punishments for those who fail to meet labour transfer quotas, the MPs noted. “The programme appears disturbingly reminiscent of coercive vocational training and mass labour transfers imposed by the Chinese authorities in the Uighur region,” they said.“We stand united in unequivocal condemnation of these practices and call upon the Chinese government to halt these atrocities immediately”, the statement added.They said the report is the latest in a mounting body of evidence documenting “egregious human rights abuses in Tibet” where the situation surrounding religious freedoms, political persecution and cultural assimilation of the indigenous Tibetan people has been deteriorating for decades.“Following on from the global outcry in the wake of revelations of ‘vocational training’ programmes in the Uighur region, this report shows that the current leadership of the People’s Republic of China remains undeterred in its refusal to respect basic human rights standards, and unswayed by criticism from the international community, including from the United Nations, in which China claims a leading role”, the statement said.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-mps-group-seeks-un-probe-into-xinjiang-style-forced-labour-in-tibet/story-ynxO1YjAWeTnIUIdJYtFgN.html

22-09-2020||World||Nepal halts distribution of new text book with revised map incorporating Indian areas: Report||Nepal has stopped the distribution of a new text book that includes the country’s revised political map showing three strategically-important Indian areas as part of its territory, saying there were a number of factual errors in it, according to a media report on Tuesday. India has already termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal after its Parliament unanimously approved the new political map of the country featuring Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belongs to it. A Cabinet meeting on Tuesday instructed the ministry of Education not to distribute and print any more copies of the text book meant for class IXth to XIIth as there were some reservations from the ministry of Land Management and Cooperatives and the ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Kathmandu Post reported. “The ministry of Education does not have the authority to change Nepal’s geographical area and there are faults in the book,” said spokesperson for the ministry of Land Reform and Cooperatives Janak Raj Joshi. There are errors in the book prepared by the ministry of Education on a subject it has no expertise, he said, adding that the higher authorities have been asked to take corrective measures. The concerned body of the Nepal government is yet to officially declare the revised geographical area of the country. “The Department of Survey, which is the official agency that declares the total area of the country, however, hasn’t made any decision on the area,” Joshi said. Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel on September 15 released the 110-page book titled, Self Study Material on Nepal’s Territory and Border which dwells around historical facts about the country’s territory and its border dispute mainly with India. The book states Nepal’s new area to be 147,641.28 square kilometers including the 460.28 sq km area of the Kalapani area which was included in Nepal’s political map on May 20 by the Cabinet. Minister for Education Pokharel has written a six-page preface for the book in which he has mentioned about Nepal’s border disputes and other related issues. He said that he had launched a campaign to protect the Nepalese territory, including the areas of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. However, Pokharel told The Kathmandu Post that the distribution of the book has been halted for now. After Nepal’s Parliament approved the revised political map comprising Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura areas, the Cabinet had endorsed the new map and decided to use it in government offices and print school text books with the new map. Nepal in May released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the three strategically important areas in Uttarakhand, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019. Following the endorsement of the new map by the Nepal Cabinet, then government spokesperson and Finance Minister Yuvaraj Khatiwada told the media that the government had decided to update the schedule of the Constitution and school curriculum incorporating the new political map. India in its response said that it had already made its position clear on it. “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” the ministry of External Affairs had said. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-halts-distribution-of-new-text-book-with-revised-map-incorporating-indian-areas-report/story-sCeF9eGFp4YniwydPGF9tJ.html

Some 14,000 disinfected polling stations were set up across the country, where people voted after having their hands sanitised and temperatures checked at a safe distance from each other.By April, South Korea had begun to successfully deal with the pandemic without major disruptions through an extensive testing and contact tracing campaign. This was reflected in the voter turnout, which at 66.2% was the highest since 1992. Even around 2,800 Covid-19 patients were allowed to vote by mail or at special booths as 30 million people overall cast their ballots.Also Read: Seoul schools resume in-person classes as South Korea coronavirus cases dipSouth Korea’s National Election Commission (NEC) officials shared the success story at a webinar that the Association of World Election Bodies (A-WEB) held on Monday. The Election Commission of India (ECI) presided over the event.The South Korean officials explained how they implemented a three-phase voting protocol for Covid-19 patients under quarantine and ensured home voting for those, who had tested positive for the disease in the run-up to the polls.The webinar was held ahead of the elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly due in November when around 70 million voters are expected to vote. The Bihar polls will be the first major election since the pandemic hit India. There have been polls to Rajya Sabha and legislative council seats, but they involved a limited number of voters. The ECI is planning to allow physical rallies, but with a limited public presence. Online filing of nomination forms is also expected along with limited door-to-door campaigning and a reduced number of people at polling booths and counting halls.Also Read: Taiwan president says has no plans to talk to Japan’s new PMChief election commissioner Sunil Arora, election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar, and ECI secretary-general Umesh Sinha spoke at the webinar, where a presentation was also made about the preparedness for the Bihar polls. “The measures taken to ensure the safety of the voters during the Rajya Sabha elections were also highlighted. There is a global consensus that the safety of the voter has to be ensured. Voters should feel safe while voting. This is the basic tenet of democracy,” said a person who attended the webinar.Officials emphasised the importance of communication as the participants from 45 countries and several international election bodies shared relevant learning outcomes and likely solutions for electoral processes amid the pandemic.According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, at least 69 countries and territories across the globe have postponed national and sub-national elections due to the pandemic until August 11. At least 53 countries and territories have decided to hold national or sub-national elections as originally planned despite concerns related to Covid-19. Officials from Taiwan’s Central Election Commission, which has held polls as scheduled, said they formulated the preventive measures during by-elections in February.Taiwanese authorities released videos to create awareness about the virus, its prevention and also set up a webpage to ensure transparency about the polling process.Bangladeshi officials, who have conducted three parliamentary by-elections with a 65% voter turnout, shared alternative mechanisms of campaigning. Bangladesh Election Commission encouraged candidates to use social media, television, radio, newspapers, banners for canvassing instead of physical campaigning.Indonesia, which is likely to hold local body elections on December 9 with an electorate of 270 million, has made additional budgetary allocations for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/home-voting-ppe-suits-how-south-korea-taiwan-held-polls-during-pandemic/story-hXH5w95bg6PD0fb7e4EAvK.html
22-09-2020||World||UK’s National Trust acknowledges colonial links to its properties||Large country houses in UK built with money looted or fortunes earned in colonial India are the focus of a new report by the National Trust, which owns and manages hundreds of historic houses, forts, castles and sylvan public spaces. At least 50 such properties in England and Wales are linked to the East India Company, whose employees earned fortunes in India and returned home to build large houses and live in splendour. Such returning wealthy individuals were called ‘nabobs’, who also wielded political power in Westminster in the 18th and 19th centuries.The trust has identified 93 properties linked to slavery and colonialism during the British Empire. The research is part of historical reviews initiated by several government departments and organisations in the wake of the Black Lives Matter campaign.The National Trust’s properties are a popular tourist attraction, with tens of thousands of domestic and international visitors flocking its castles, forts, archaeological and industrial monuments and parks, but this is the first time it has acknowledged their links to slavery and colonialism.Among the India-linked properties are two associated with Robert Clive, the first governor of Bengal presidency: his house in Claremont, Sussex, purchased from wealth he made in India and the Powis Castle in Wales, which has a large collection of Indian items.Writes Lucy Porten of the National Trust: “At Claremont, purchased with the wealth he (Clive) had made in India, he built a new house, intended to be his main residence and to display the treasures he had amassed. In the early 1770s, Clive had begun acquiring Old Master pictures, which were intended for the Great Room at Claremont”. “At the time of his death, the house, unfinished and unfurnished, was a repository for his various collections, including that of ‘Indian Curiosities’ (still unpacked at that point). Robert’s son, Edward (1754–1839), would become 1st Earl of Powis, following his marriage to Lady Henrietta Herbert (1758–1830) in 1784, and Governor of Madras in 1798”. “Their amalgamated collections, containing some 1,000 objects from about 1600 to the 1830s, are now displayed at Powis Castle and include ivories, textiles, statues of Hindu gods, ornamental silver and gold, weapons and ceremonial armour from India and East Asia.”Other India-linked properties include Lord Curzon’s Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire; former governor of Madras Ronald d’Arcy Fife’s Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire; the home of Francis Syke (one of the ‘nabobs’), Basildon Park, Berkshire; and Rudyard Kipling’s home Bateman’s in east Sussex. The trust said the research is part of its commitment to ensuring links to colonialism and historic slavery are properly represented, shared and interpreted as part of a broader narrative at relevant places it owns and manages. Tarnya Cooper, the trust’s curatorial and collections director, said: “The buildings in the care of the National Trust reflect many different periods and a range of British and global histories- social, industrial, political and cultural.” “A significant number of those in our care have links to the colonisation of different parts of the world, and some to historic slavery. Colonialism and slavery were central to the national economy from the 17th to the 19th centuries”. One of the largest landowners in Britain, the National Trust was founded in 1895. It acquired its holdings by various means, including gifts from former owners. Engaged in heritage conservation, its work is underpinned by the National Trust Act of 1907.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-country-houses-properties-linked-to-colonial-india-under-new-scrutiny/story-2tvOAb06FXp9U0cxoqII5N.html
22-09-2020||World||China sharply expands mass labor program in Tibet||China is pushing growing numbers of Tibetan rural laborers off the land and into recently built military-style training centers where they are turned into factory workers, mirroring a program in the western Xinjiang region that rights groups have branded coercive labor.Beijing has set quotas for the mass transfer of rural laborers within Tibet and to other parts of China, according to over a hundred state media reports, policy documents from government bureaus in Tibet and procurement requests released between 2016-2020 and reviewed by Reuters. The quota effort marks a rapid expansion of an initiative designed to provide loyal workers for Chinese industry.A notice posted to the website of Tibet’s regional government website last month said over half a million people were trained as part of the project in the first seven months of 2020 - around 15% of the region’s population. Of this total, almost 50,000 have been transferred into jobs within Tibet, and several thousand have been sent to other parts of China. Many end up in low paid work, including textile manufacturing, construction and agriculture.“This is now, in my opinion, the strongest, most clear and targeted attack on traditional Tibetan livelihoods that we have seen almost since the Cultural Revolution” of 1966 to 1976, said Adrian Zenz, an independent Tibet and Xinjiang researcher, who compiled the core findings about the program. These are detailed in a report released this week by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based institute that focuses on policy issues of strategic importance to the U.S. “It’s a coercive lifestyle change from nomadism and farming to wage labor.”Reuters corroborated Zenz’s findings and found additional policy documents, company reports, procurement filings and state media reports that describe the program.In a statement to Reuters, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly denied the involvement of forced labor, and said China is a country with rule of law and that workers are voluntary and properly compensated.“What these people with ulterior motives are calling ‘forced labor’ simply does not exist. We hope the international community will distinguish right from wrong, respect facts, and not be fooled by lies,” it said.Moving surplus rural labor into industry is a key part of China’s drive to boost the economy and reduce poverty. But in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet, with large ethnic populations and a history of unrest, rights groups say the programs include an outsized emphasis on ideological training. And the government quotas and military-style management, they say, suggest the transfers have coercive elements.China seized control of Tibet after Chinese troops entered the region in 1950, in what Beijing calls a “peaceful liberation.” Tibet has since become one of the most restricted and sensitive areas in the country.The Tibetan program is expanding as international pressure is growing over similar projects in Xinjiang, some of which have been linked to mass detention centers. A United Nations report has estimated that around one million people in Xinjiang, mostly ethnic Uighurs, were detained in camps and subjected to ideological education. China initially denied the existence of the camps, but has since said they are vocational and education centers, and that all the people have “graduated.”Reuters was unable to ascertain the conditions of the transferred Tibetan workers. Foreign journalists are not permitted to enter the region, and other foreign citizens are only permitted on government-approved tours.In recent years, Xinjiang and Tibet have been the target of harsh policies in pursuit of what Chinese authorities call “stability maintenance.” These policies are broadly aimed at quelling dissent, unrest or separatism and include restricting the travel of ethnic citizens to other parts of China and abroad, and tightening control over religious activities.In August, President Xi Jinping said China will again step up efforts against separatism in Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up around 90% of the population, according to census data. Critics, spearheaded by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, accuse the Chinese authorities of carrying out “cultural genocide” in the region. The 85-year-old Nobel Laureate has been based in Dharamsala, India, since he fled China in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese authorities.Eliminate ‘lazy people’While there has been some evidence of military-style training and labor transfers in Tibet in the past, this new, enlarged program represents the first on a mass scale and the first to openly set quotas for transfers outside the region.A key element, described in multiple regional policy documents, involves sending officials into villages and townships to gather data on rural laborers and conduct education activities, aimed at building loyalty.State media described one such operation in villages near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Officials carried out over a thousand anti-separatism education sessions, according to the state media report, “allowing the people of all ethnic groups to feel the care and concern of the Party Central Committee,” referring to China’s ruling Communist Party.The report said the sessions included songs, dances and sketches in “easy to understand language.” Such “education” work took place prior to the rollout of the wider transfers this year.The model is similar to Xinjiang, and researchers say a key link between the two is the former Tibet Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who took over the same post in Xinjiang in 2016 and spearheaded the development of Xinjiang’s camp system. The Xinjiang government, where Chen remains Party boss, did not respond to a request for comment.“In Tibet, he was doing a slightly lower level, under the radar, version of what was implemented in Xinjiang,” said Allen Carlson, Associate Professor in Cornell University’s Government Department.Around 70% of Tibet’s population is classified as rural, according to 2018 figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics. This includes a large proportion of subsistence farmers, posing a challenge for China’s poverty alleviation program, which measures its success on levels of basic income. China has pledged to eradicate rural poverty in the country by the end of 2020.“In order to cope with the increasing downward economic pressure on the employment income of rural workers, we will now increase the intensity of precision skills training ... and carry out organized and large-scale transfer of employment across provinces, regions and cities,” said a working plan released by Tibet’s Human Resources and Social Security Department in July. The plan included 2020 quotas for the program in different areas.Some of the policy documents and state media reports reviewed by Reuters make reference to unspecified punishments for officials who fail to meet their quotas. One prefecture level implementation plan called for “strict reward and punishment measures” for officials.As in Xinjiang, private intermediaries, such as agents and companies, that organize transfers can receive subsidies set at 500 yuan ($74) for each laborer moved out of the region and 300 yuan ($44) for those placed within Tibet, according to regional and prefecture level notices.Officials have previously said that labor transfer programs in other parts of China are voluntary, and many of the Tibetan government documents also mention mechanisms to ensure laborers’ rights, but they don’t provide details. Advocates, rights groups and researchers say it’s unlikely laborers are able to decline work placements, though they acknowledge that some may be voluntary.“These recent announcements dramatically and dangerously expand these programs, including ‘thought training’ with the government’s coordination, and represent a dangerous escalation,” said Matteo Mecacci, president of U.S. based advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet.The government documents reviewed by Reuters put a strong emphasis on ideological education to correct the “thinking concepts” of laborers. “There is the assertion that minorities are low in discipline, that their minds must be changed, that they must be convinced to participate,” said Zenz, the Tibet-Xinjiang researcher based in Minnesota.One policy document, posted on the website of the Nagqu City government in Tibet’s east in December 2018, reveals early goals for the plan and sheds light on the approach. It describes how officials visited villages to collect data on 57,800 laborers. Their aim was to tackle “can’t do, don’t want to do and don’t dare to do” attitudes toward work, the document says. It calls for unspecified measures to “effectively eliminate ‘lazy people.’“A report released in January by the Tibetan arm of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a high-profile advisory body to the government, describes internal discussions on strategies to tackle the “mental poverty” of rural laborers, including sending teams of officials into villages to carry out education and “guide the masses to create a happy life with their hardworking hands.”Military drills and uniformsRural workers who are moved into vocational training centers receive ideological education - what China calls “military-style” training - according to multiple Tibetan regional and district-level policy documents describing the program in late 2019 and 2020. The training emphasises strict discipline, and participants are required to perform military drills and dress in uniforms.It is not clear what proportion of participants in the labor transfer program undergo such military-style training. But policy documents from Ngari, Xigatze and Shannan, three districts which account for around a third of Tibet’s population, call for the “vigorous promotion of military-style training.” Region-wide policy notices also make reference to this training method.Small-scale versions of similar military-style training initiatives have existed in the region for over a decade, but construction of new facilities increased sharply in 2016, and recent policy documents call for more investment in such sites. A review of satellite imagery and documents relating to over a dozen facilities in different districts in Tibet shows that some are built near to or within existing vocational centers.The policy documents describe a teaching program that combines skills education, legal education and “gratitude education,” designed to boost loyalty to the Party.James Leibold, professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who specializes in Tibet and Xinjiang, says there are different levels of military-style training, with some less restrictive than others, but that there is a focus on conformity.“Tibetans are seen as lazy, backward, slow or dirty, and so what they want to do is to get them marching to the same beat... That’s a big part of this type of military-style education.”In eastern Tibet’s Chamdo district, where some of the earliest military-style training programs emerged, state media images from 2016 show laborers lining up in drill formation in military fatigues. In images published by state media in July this year, waitresses in military clothing are seen training at a vocational facility in the same district. Pictures posted online from the “Chamdo Golden Sunshine Vocational Training School” show rows of basic white shed-like accommodation with blue roofs. In one image, banners hanging on the wall behind a row of graduates say the labor transfer project is overseen by the local Human Resources and Social Security Department.The vocational skills learned by trainees include textiles, construction, agriculture and ethnic handicrafts. One vocational center describes elements of training including “Mandarin language, legal training and political education.” A separate regional policy document says the goal is to “gradually realize the transition from ‘I must work’ to ‘I want to work.’“Regional and prefecture level policy documents place an emphasis on training batches of workers for specific companies or projects. Rights groups say this on-demand approach increases the likelihood that the programs are coercive.Supply ChainWorkers transferred under the programs can be difficult to trace, particularly those sent to other parts of China. In similar mass transfers of Uighur people from Xinjiang, workers were discovered in the supply chains of 83 global brands, according to a report released by the The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).Researchers and rights groups say transfers from these regions pose a challenge because without access they can’t assess whether the practice constitutes forced labor, and transferred workers often work alongside non-transferred counterparts.Tibetan state media reports in July say that in 2020 some of the workers transferred outside of Tibet were sent to construction projects in Qinghai and Sichuan. Others transferred within Tibet were trained in textiles, security and agricultural production work.Regional Tibetan government policy notices and prefecture implementation plans provide local government offices with quotas for 2020, including for Tibetan workers sent to other parts of China. Larger districts are expected to supply more workers to other areas of the country - 1,000 from the Tibetan capital Lhasa, 1,400 from Xigaze, and 800 from Shannan.Reuters reviewed policy notices put out by Tibet and a dozen other provinces that have accepted Tibetan laborers. These documents reveal that workers are often moved in groups and stay in collective accommodation.Local government documents inside Tibet and in three other provinces say workers remain in centralised accommodation after they are transferred, separated from other workers and under supervision. One state media document, describing a transfer within the region, referred to it as a “point to point ‘nanny’ service.”The Tibetan Human Resources and Social Security Department noted in July that people are grouped into teams of 10 to 30. They travel with team leaders and are managed by “employment liaison services.” The department said the groups are tightly managed, especially when moving outside Tibet, where the liaison officers are responsible for carrying out “further education activities and reducing homesickness complexes.” It said the government is responsible for caring for “left-behind women, children and the elderly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sharply-expands-mass-labor-program-in-tibet/story-PCvwK4pT7fkWH8obZzcUIO.html

22-09-2020||World||World sees record weekly number of Covid-19 cases, deaths down: WHO||The coronavirus pandemic appears to be accelerating worldwide, with new cases soaring last week to a new seven-day high of almost two million, even as new deaths decreased, WHO statistics showed.In a fresh global update, the World Health Organization said late Monday that during the week ending on September 20, 1,998,897 new cases of the novel coronavirus were registered around the world.That marks a six-percent increase over a week earlier and “the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic,” the UN health agency said.Since the novel coronavirus first surfaced in China late last year, it has infected more than 31 million people around the globe and has killed nearly 962,000, according to an AFP tally from official sources on Monday.Nearly all regions of the world saw new cases rise last week, WHO said, with Europe and the Americas seeing new cases swell by 11 and 10 percent respectively.Only Africa, which has remained relatively unscathed by the pandemic, dodged the upward trend, reporting a 12-percent drop in fresh cases from a week earlier.Even as cases shot up across much of the world, the number of new deaths is going down, the WHO statistics showed.- Declining deaths -Last week, some 37,700 new deaths linked to the virus were recorded worldwide, marking a decline of 10 percent compared to the previous week.The decline was driven by the Americas, long the hardest-hit region, where new deaths were 22 percent lower than a week earlier, and by Africa where new deaths dropped 16 percent.The Americas meanwhile still accounts for half of all reported cases and 55 percent of deaths in the world. The clear drop in new deaths in the region were driven mainly by decreases in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Bolivia.The United States, which is the world’s worst-hit country, and Brazil, the second-worst hit, continued to report the highest number of deaths, each reporting over 5,000 new deaths in the past week.Europe, some of which is experiencing a second wave of infections, meanwhile saw its new death count shoot up to over 4,000 for the seven-day period, a 27-percent-hike compared to a week earlier.In Europe, France, Russia, Spain and Britain reported the highest number of new cases in the past week, while Hungary and Denmark reported the highest relative increase in deaths.

22-09-2020||World||Russia to register second Covid-19 vaccine by October 15||Russia expects to register a second potential vaccine against Covid-19 by Oct. 15, the TASS news agency cited Russian consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor as saying on Tuesday.The vaccine has been developed by Siberia’s Vector Institute, which completed early-stage human trials of the vaccine last week.Russia registered its first vaccine candidate, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, in August. Late-stage trials, involving at least 40,000 people, are ongoing. Russia approves first Covid-19 prescription drug for sale in pharmaciesRussia has approved R-Pharm’s Coronavir treatment for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections and the antiviral drug could be rolled out to pharmacies in the country as soon as next week, the company said on Friday.Coronavir’s approval as a prescription drug follows the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May. Both are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for viral treatments.R-Pharm’s announcement is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race against the virus. It is already exporting its Covid-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine. R-Pharm said it received approval for Coronavir after Phase III clinical trials involving 168 patients with Covid-19. The drug was first approved for in-hospital use to treat Covid-19 in July, a government register showed. Coronavir’s trial was comparatively small. The European health regulator on Friday endorsed the use of the steroid dexamethasone in the treatment of Covid-19 patients after a study by UK researchers on several thousand patients.R-Pharm has started talks with pharmacies about orders, the company’s spokeswoman said, with Coronavir supplies expected to be rolled out in the near future, possibly as soon as next week. Coronavir is made at R-Pharm’s facility in Yaroslavl, about 300 km (186 miles) northeast of Moscow. Avifavir has been available in hospitals since June but has yet to be supplied to pharmacies.

22-09-2020||World||As rich nations struggle, Africa’s coronavirus response is praised||At a lecture to peers this month, John Nkengasong showed images that once dogged Africa, with a magazine cover declaring it “The Hopeless Continent.” Then he quoted Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah: “It is clear that we must find an African solution to our problems, and that this can only be found in African unity.”The coronavirus pandemic has fractured global relationships. But as director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nkengasong has helped to steer Africa’s 54 countries into an alliance praised as responding better than some richer countries, including the United States.A former US CDC official, he modeled Africa’s version after his ex-employer. Nkengasong is pained to see the US agency struggle. In an interview with The Associated Press, he didn’t name U.S President Donald Trump but cited “factors we all know.”While the US nears 200,000 Covid-19 deaths and the world approaches 1 million, Africa’s surge has been leveling off. Its 1.4 million confirmed cases are far from the horrors predicted. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 34,000 deaths are confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.“Africa is doing a lot of things right the rest of the world isn’t,” said Gayle Smith, a former administrator with the US Agency for International Development. She’s watched in astonishment as Washington looks inward instead of leading the world. But Africa “is a great story and one that needs to be told.”Nkengasong, whom the Gates Foundation honors Tuesday with its Global Goalkeeper Award as a “relentless proponent of global collaboration,” is the continent’s most visible narrator. The Cameroon-born virologist insists that Africa can stand up to Covid-19 if given a fighting chance.Early modeling assumed “a large number of Africans would just die,” Nkengasong said. The Africa CDC decided not to issue projections. “When I looked at the data and the assumptions, I wasn’t convinced,” he said.Health experts point to Africa’s youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 hasn’t taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.“Be patient,” Nkengasong said. “There’s a lot we still don’t know.”He warns against complacency, saying a single case can spark a new surge.As Africa’s top public health official, leading an agency launched only three years ago, he plunged into the race for medical supplies and now a vaccine. At first, it was a shock.“The collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have shoved Africa out of the diagnostics market,” Nkengasong wrote in the journal Nature in April. “If Africa loses, the world loses.”Supplies slowly improved, and African countries have conducted 13 million tests, enough to cover 1% of the continent’s population. But the ideal is 13 million tests per month, Nkengasong said.He and other African leaders are haunted by the memories of 12 million Africans dying during the decade it took for affordable HIV drugs to reach the continent. That must not happen again, he said.This week, more world leaders than ever are gathering online for the biggest global endeavor since Covid-19 appeared, the United Nations General Assembly. If Nkengasong could address them, he would say this: “We should be very careful that history doesn’t record us on the wrong side of it.”African leaders are expected to say much the same. “The Covid-19 pandemic has shown we have no option but to depend on each other,” Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, told the gathering on Monday.Nkengasong urges African countries not to wait for help and rejects the image of the continent holding a begging bowl. The money is there, he said.Acting on that idea, Africa’s public and private sectors created an online purchasing platform to focus their negotiating power, launched by the African Union to buy directly from manufacturers. Governments can browse and buy rapid testing kits, N95 masks and ventilators, some now manufactured in Africa in another campaign endorsed by heads of state.Impressed, Caribbean countries have signed on.“It’s the only part of the world I’m aware of that actually built a supply chain,” said Smith, the former USAID chief.When the pandemic began, just two African countries could test for the coronavirus. Now all can. Nkengasong was struck by how much information “doesn’t get translated” to member states, so the Africa CDC holds online training on everything from safely handling bodies to genomic surveillance.“I look at Africa and I look at the US, and I’m more optimistic about Africa, to be honest, because of the leadership there and doing their best despite limited resources,” said Sema Sgaier, director of the Surgo Foundation, which produced a Covid-19 vulnerability index for each region. She spoke even as Africa’s cases were surging weeks ago.With Covid-19 vaccines the next urgent issue, African countries held a conference to insist on equitable access and explore manufacturing to end their almost complete reliance on the outside world. They began securing the late-stage clinical trials that long have been held outside the continent, aiming to land 10 as soon as possible.Nkengasong said Africa needs at least 1.5 billion vaccine doses, enough to cover 60% of the population for “herd immunity” with the two likely required doses. That will cost about $10 billion.The World Health Organization says Africa should receive at least 220 million doses through an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine known as COVAX.That’s welcome but not enough, Nkengasong said.His next hurdle is how to deliver doses throughout the vast continent with the world’s worst infrastructure. Less than half of Africa’s countries have access to modern health care facilities, he said.Covid-19’s effects are “devastating” for Africa, from education to economies to the fight against other diseases. Nkengasong plans a major conference next year to press countries to significantly increase health spending ahead of the next pandemic.“If we do not,” he said, “something is terribly wrong with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-rich-nations-struggle-africa-s-coronavirus-response-is-praised/story-4g2vLyRA1MY1eCyOAtOERK.html

China’s foreign ministry has called them “separatists.”Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was asked at her weekly news conference if she could ensure that the 12 would be afforded human rights safeguards such as presumption of innocence, fair trial and legal representation.“We do not have the legal basis to do the things that you want us to do,” she said.Mainland authorities have said the legitimate rights of the 12 were being protected according to the law.China’s legal system is controlled by and loyal to the ruling Communist Party, meaning courts do not usually challenge party or government accusations.Lam said the 12 would have to face the law in mainland China before they could return to Hong Kong to face justice for any crimes committed at home.All 12 were suspected of crimes in Hong Kong related to anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged, released on bail and not allowed to leave the city. They are being detained in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen.Their fate is being closely watched in Hong Kong amid apprehension about Beijing’s greater control over the city especially since it imposed a national security law in June.Beijing and Hong Kong government say the law is aimed at tackling subversion, separatism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say it undermines the special status the city was guaranteed when Britain handed it over to China under “one country, two systems” formula in 1997.Supporters of the law say it will bring stability and safeguard prosperity after a year of unrest.

It had planned to start free inoculation on Tuesday for some 19 million eligible people.The head of South Korea’s disease prevention agency said on Tuesday that some doses of the vaccine, which need to be refrigerated, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported to a medical facility.It was not immediately known how many doses were affected, and authorities are looking into the entire batch of five million doses that were scheduled for distribution on Tuesday.“I want to make it clear that the problem is not with the manufacturer’s vaccine production, rather it is an issue raised about the refrigerated temperature maintenance in the distribution process,” Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters.So far 118,000 have been inoculated with flu shots and no adverse affects were reported from the vaccination, said Jeong.Some Asian countries have rolled out early and more aggressive influenza vaccination programmes this year to reduce the potential of people contracting the flu and Covid-19 simultaneously, which would cripple the load on healthcare.KDCA reported 61 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Monday, taking the national tally to 23,106 infections with 388 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-suspends-flu-shots-in-setback-for-winter-covid-19-preparations/story-v8E0kgvY7jSN8sz4uBJ0WL.html

He will also order all pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues across England to start closing at 10 p.m. from Thursday.“One of the things we are going to emphasise is that if it is possible for people to work from home, we are going to encourage them to do so,” Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove told Sky News TV. “There is going to be a shift in emphasis.”“They are reluctant steps that we’re taking, but they’re absolutely necessary because as we were reminded yesterday and as you’ve been reporting the rate of infection is increasing, the number of people going to hospital is increasing, therefore we need to act,” Gove said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/work-from-home-johnson-starts-to-shut-down-the-uk-again-as-covid-19-spreads/story-tv6yOnlwSLz8IevkHg0hMP.html
22-09-2020||World||FinCEN leaks push US lawmakers to press for strict laws to stop money-laundering||Advocates of legislation to beef up the US fight against money laundering made a fresh push on Monday to get Congress to act, after new revelations that some leading global banks have been processing payments linked to alleged illicit funds.A broad, bipartisan group of US lawmakers already support the proposed law, which would rework how financial firms keep an eye out for illegal activity. Banks, law enforcement groups and human rights advocates support it as well.But the legislation has stalled in Congress amid other priorities.A series of articles called the “FinCEN Files,” launched on Sunday by Buzzfeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), detailed how several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds for decades despite red flags. The series sent bank stocks tumbling on Monday and prompted new calls for legislative reform. “The Buzzfeed story makes clear we need to strengthen, reform and update our nation’s anti-money laundering laws,” Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. “This action is long overdue.”Policymakers, regulators and banks have long acknowledged fundamental flaws in the anti-money laundering system, which relies on banks to file suspicious activity reports, or SARs, when they notice something unusual in a transaction. Those SARs are sent to the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN.However, the rules around what is deemed “suspicious” can be vague, which leads some banks to send too many reports and others to send too few. And the enforcement group is understaffed to handle the millions of SARs that need to be analyzed to determine whether a crime has been committed.The proposed legislation would make it easier for banks to share information to identify bad actors, let them use technology to help detect suspicious activity more efficiently without breaching privacy laws and require companies to disclose who actually owns them.The House of Representatives already approved one such bill, another version of which enjoys broad support in the Senate.Proponents hope the FinCEN Files will spur Congress to pass something before the end of the year.“This story is a major boost in ensuring that people understand how critical it is that we get to the bottom of who’s behind these anonymous shell companies and who’s laundering money through our financial system,” said Clark Gascoigne, the interim executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition, a liberal tax activist group.Widespread criticism of anti-money laundering rules first kicked off in 2016, after another set of leaked documents known as the Panama Papers came to light.Since then, bank regulators have tried to streamline their own systems and penalized banks that were not doing enough to comply with existing rules. Banks have said they spent billions of dollars improving technology and scouring customer lists to remove potential risks.In recent months, regulators also issued industry guidance about monitoring. For example, a group of regulators told banks in August that they would typically face penalties if they are found to have pervasive issues monitoring money laundering, rather than for isolated or technical errors.The guidance came after industry complaints that existing rules create a heavy workload and expense without much to show for it. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents larger banks, found that only 4% of SARs filed in 2017 merited follow-up from law enforcement.“There has long been a shared view ... that the (anti-money laundering) framework needs to be modernized,” said Mike Lee, BPI’s chief lobbyist.

Ajay Jain Bhutoria, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council and National Finance Committee member of the Biden campaign, said: “By leveraging technology and the reach of our partners, we educate South Asian Americans about how to register, sign up for election reminders, request mail-in ballots, learn about early voting options and go Vote for Biden-Haaris”. “’Chale Chalo Biden ko vote do’ (Let’s go vote for Biden) musical video was viral, superhit with the community and this new series of graphics ‘Jaago America, Jaago, Bhul Na Jaana Biden-Haaris ko Vote Dena’ (Wake up America, wake up, don’t forget to vote for Biden-Harris) is a step forward in this series of outreach in 14 plus languages,” he said. He said that people connect with music, food, language, and culture. Bhutoria said there is huge enthusiasm in the Indian-American community to elect Biden as the next president and Kamala Harris as the first Indian-origin vice president. Earlier this year, California-based Bhutoria launched an outreach to the Indian community in 14 Indian Languages. “’America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho, Joe Biden Jaisa Ho’ (How should be America’s leader, just like Joe Biden). This was translated into 14 Indian languages and the graphics went viral on social media,” he said. The Democratic Party, he said, has been working with various grassroot organisations to get Indo-Americans and the greater South Asian community registered to vote, phone bank, and text bank in 14 distinct South Asian languages. The digital graphics in multiple languages are to inspire the South Asian voters, he added. US President Donald Trump, 74, is seeking re-election against Biden, 77, who scripted history by selecting Senator Kamala Harris, 55, as his running mate for November 3 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-release-digital-ads-in-14-indian-languages-to-woo-south-asian-voters-in-us/story-rAd3uThJLH1QXE6Yls6eYK.html
22-09-2020||World||Pakistan looks to ally China for support at FATF plenary||Pakistan is again looking to China, Malaysia and Turkey to help it get off lightly for failing to fully implement an action plan to tackle terror funding when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) assesses its case in October, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday. Ahead of FATF’s working group and plenary meetings between October 18 and 23, the Asia-Pacific Group (APG), a regional affiliate of the multilateral watchdog, reviewed Pakistan’s actions to counter-terror financing and money laundering at a virtual meeting on September 15 and 16. Also read: Ahead of crucial FATF meet, Pakistan continues to treat 21 dreaded terrorists as VIPsAt the virtual meeting, China expectedly backed Pakistan’s actions to counter-terror financing, despite the fact that it is yet to fully deliver on 13 of the 27 points in the action plan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. When Yao Jing, China’s outgoing ambassador to Pakistan, made a farewell call on the de facto finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh in Islamabad on September 17 – a day after the APG meeting – he was quoted in an official statement as expressing “his confidence that FATF’s October review will go well for Pakistan”. ALSO WATCH | Like China, talk to Pakistan: J&K ex-CM’s advice on border skirmishes “Pakistan will again be looking at China, Malaysia and Turkey to back it at the FATF plenary meeting as the support of only three members is enough to thwart any planned action,” said one of the people cited above. Malaysia was appointed co-chair of APG in July, while Australia is the permanent co-chair and host country for the regional body. While relations between India and Malaysia had soured under former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, the new government formed after his resignation has been working quietly to improve ties with New Delhi, the people noted. Ahead of the FATF plenary meeting, Pakistan will have to submit a progress report by September 30. But on July 28, Pakistan’s Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) director-general Lubna Farooq told a parliamentary standing committee on finance and revenue that the country had complied with only 14 of the 27 points in the action plan while stakeholders “were working on the remaining 13 action points”. The people further noted that Pakistan had resorted to its usual tactic of some high-profile actions in the run-up to the FATF plenary to create the impression that it was delivering on its counter-terror financing commitments. For instance, an anti-terror court in Lahore indicted four leaders of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), including Hafiz Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rahman Makki, in four more cases last week. A joint session of Pakistan’s Parliament also passed three bills aimed at implementing commitments made to FATF last week, while it tightened curbs on eight Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leaders, including Hafiz Saeed, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar and Dawood Ibrahim by taking steps in August to enforce United Nations’ (UN) sanctions against them. As things stand now, the people said, Pakistan is unlikely to be moved from FATF’s “jurisdictions under increased monitoring” or the so-called “grey list” to the “high-risk jurisdiction subject to a call of action” or “black list”, despite mounting frustration among the watchdog’s members over its repeated failure to deliver on the action plan, the people said. This frustration was reflected in the statement issued after FATF’s plenary in February: “All deadlines in [Pakistan’s] action plan have expired. While noting recent and notable improvements, the FATF again expresses concerns given Pakistan’s failure to complete its action plan in line with the agreed timelines and in light of the [terror financing] risks emanating from the jurisdiction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-looks-to-ally-china-for-support-at-fatf-plenary/story-bo9Te1RfOiHNNEm2z80ItI.html
22-09-2020||World||Pak globally-recognised epicenter of terrorism: India at UN||In a scathing attack on Pakistan, India has said that if there is an “unfinished agenda” at the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism and the country, a globally-recognised epicenter of the menace, which harbours and trains terrorists and hails them as martyrs. Exercising India’s right to reply on Monday, First Secretary in the country’s Permanent Mission to the UN Vidisha Maitra said: “Pakistan is a country which is globally recognised as the epicenter of terrorism, which by its own admission harbours and trains terrorists, and hails them as martyrs and consistently persecutes its ethnic and religious minorities”. She was referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks in the country’s Parliament where he had termed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden as a “martyr”. “We reject the malicious reference made to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. If there is an item that is unfinished on the agenda of the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism,” Maitra said. As the UN member states marked 75 years of the United Nations in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his address to the high-level meeting on the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the world organisation. Qureshi said Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine were the UN’s “most glaring and long-standing disputes” and the people of Jammu and Kashmir still await the fulfillment of the commitment made to them by the UN to grant them their “right to self-determination.” With Pakistan yet again raising the Kashmir issue at a UN platform, Maitra said India had hoped that during this solemn commemoration of a shared global milestone, the General Assembly would be “spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods that have now become a trademark of Pakistan’s interventions on such platforms”. “However, for a nation that is bereft of milestones, one can only expect a stonewalled and stymied approach to reason, diplomacy and dialogue. “What we heard today is the never-ending fabricated narrative presented by the Pakistani representative about the internal affairs of India,” she said. Strongly rejecting the malicious reference made to Jammu and Kashmir, Maitra said Pakistan “will do well to turn its attention inwards to immediately addressing these pressing concerns instead of diverting attention from them by misusing the UN platforms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-globally-recognised-epicenter-of-terrorism-india-at-un/story-vmx6loo10Xgt8Ye4ezwMZL.html

India has sought a permanent seat in a reformed and expanded UN Security Council.The prime minister was participating in a virtual high-level meeting of the UN general assembly to mark the 75th anniversary of the global body. He is scheduled to deliver his speech at the High-Level General Debate of the assembly on Saturday, as the opening speaker of the day.“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” Modi said in a short address in English. “Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stake holders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.”He recounted that India was a founding signatory of the UN that was born out of the “horrors” of World War II and shared India’s own “philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’”, which states the whole world is one family.“Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations,” Modi said. “We pay tribute to all those who have advanced the cause of peace and development under the UN flag, including in UN peacekeeping missions, where India had been a leading contributor.”But, he added, “while much has been achieved, the original mission remains incomplete”, which was to be reflected in the declaration of the General Assembly, to be adopted at the end of the one-day commemorative meeting.It would argue that more is needed to be done towards preventing conflict, ensuring development, addressing climate change, reducing inequality and leveraging digital technologies.It would also acknowledge “need for reform of the United Nations itself”, Modi added.India and many other countries have called for reforming the UN, arguing it must reflect the changing world order and accommodate the aspirations of emerging powers. Several countries including India have sought permanent membership in the Security Council, the world’s most exclusive club of nations, as part of a larger overhaul. The United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia — four of the five permanent members of the Security Council — have endorsed India, but there has been no real progress in the process, called the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN), which has been on for a long time.India has “accorded the highest priority to permanent membership”, the ministry of external affairs said on Monday in a parliamentary reply. And it has pursed it on both bilateral and multilateral platforms, especially in concert with other aspirants such as G-4 partners Japan, Germany and Brazil and the trilateral IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa).IBSA foreign ministers met last week virtually for their annual meeting around the UN general assembly sessions, and expressed “frustration with the slow pace of progress” on Security Council reforms in the IGN process which, they complained, “lacked transparency in its working methods”.“We insist that the time has come to move towards a result-oriented process, with provision for substantive negotiations based on a single comprehensive text, in a formal setting,” they said in a joint statement, underscoring the need for some form of a document that can be negotiated, modified or rejected.India will begin a two-year term on the Security Council coming January as a non-permanent member, for the eighth time. It hopes to use the opportunity to further burnish its credentials for a seat as a permanent member. Its previous non-permanent terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-facing-crisis-of-confidence-says-modi-in-pitch-for-reform/story-0Q5uE0zOEfKmtCDiSDGmMJ.html
22-09-2020||World||Trump aims to use UN address to send strong message to China||President Donald Trump, who prefers speaking to boisterous crowds, is set to give a pre-recorded address to the U.N. General Assembly as he grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, chilly relations between the US and China and ongoing threats from North Korea and Iran — all during a heated campaign for re-election.Trump told reporters Monday that he’d have a “strong message” for China, where the first cases of Covid-19 were reported, but he didn’t elaborate ahead of the Tuesday address. Earlier in his administration, Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida club, but now the two leaders are exchanging angry words over trade.The administration has been slamming the Chinese Communist Party for its handling of Covid-19, election meddling, espionage in the United States and influence peddling across the world.Trump is not popular at the United Nations and his speech this year comes at a time when UN members are pushing back against Washington. On Monday, Trump declared that all UN sanctions against Iran have been reimposed, a move that most of the rest of the world rejects as illegal.Trump’s statement came shortly after he signed an executive order spelling out how the US will enforce the “snapback” of sanctions. “My actions today send a clear message to the Iranian regime and those in the international community who refuse to stand up to Iran,” he said.The US said it was reimposing sanctions on Iran for being in non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers. But Trump in 2018 pulled out of the deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief.Few UN member states believe the US has the legal standing to restore the sanctions because Trump withdrew from the agreement. The US argues it retains the right to do so as an original participant in the deal and a member of the council.The White House has not previewed his UN speech, but Trump was expected to highlight agreements the US brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The historic agreements come as relations between the Jewish state and Arab nations are thawing as a pushback against Iran.The president likely will take credit for brokering economic cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo and for pressuring NATO nations to meet their pledge to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on their own defenses to lessen the burden on the alliance.He might also have words for North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. In 2017, Trump told the UN he was bringing a “message of peace,” but then said that if the US was forced to defend itself against Kim, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” He called Kim “rocket man,” but has since met with him three times, although North Korea has not made a move to give up its nuclear weapons.Trump’s has tussled with multilateral organizations throughout his presidency, although his aides say he is not against all multilateral groups, only the ones that aren’t effective. After Covid-19 took hold, Trump yanked support from the UN’s World Health Organization, saying it was too beholden to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-aims-to-use-un-address-to-send-strong-message-to-china/story-vccEExpTIrwM5XUgyUynUK.html
22-09-2020||World||Biden, Trump campaign in US Midwest as Supreme Court fight looms||Donald Trump and his rival for the White House, Joe Biden, were campaigning on Monday in two US battleground states that could decide the November election as they sparred over the president’s plan to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat.A Republican seeking re-election on Nov. 3, Trump will hold campaign events in Ohio, a state some Democrats once saw as a lock for Trump, while Biden, the Democratic former vice president, makes his second trip of the month to Wisconsin.Each is reckoning with a presidential contest that was upended by Friday’s death of the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Trump’s intention to appoint a replacement before the election, which would cement a 6-3 conservative majority, has angered Democrats and shifted the campaign’s focus away from the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Biden on Sunday said the winner of the election should pick the person who fills Ginsburg’s seat. He called Trump’s planned appointment an “exercise of raw political power” after Republican senators refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016, citing that year’s presidential election.In a Fox News interview on Monday, Trump said he will name his choice to replace Ginsburg by Friday or Saturday, after mourners pay their respects.Ginsburg’s body will lay in repose at the court on Wednesday and Thursday before she lies in state at the US Capitol on Friday.Ohio and Wisconsin are hotly contested because their population can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.In his last visit to Wisconsin, Biden went to Kenosha and spoke with Jacob Blake, the Black man whose shooting by police prompted widespread unrest.This time, Biden will visit largely white Manitowoc County, which supported the former vice president and President Barack Obama when they ran on the Democratic ticket in 2008. The county backed Trump in 2016, helping deliver the state to a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 1984.Trump’s campaign has also prioritized the state after winning it in 2016 by less than 1% of the vote. Trump visited Wisconsin last week, announcing a new round of coronavirus pandemic assistance to farmers of about $13 billion.Opinion polls show Biden leading by several points in Wisconsin, mirroring his overall lead nationwide.Biden has built a formidable financial advantage for the campaign’s final stretch after a massive fundraising haul in August. The campaign and its party allies will report having $466 million in cash at the end of August, while Trump’s war chest stood at $325 million, according to officials from both sides.Early voting, both in-person and by mail, has already begun in a handful of states.The use of absentee ballots is expected to skyrocket this fall amid the pandemic. Trump has repeatedly asserted without evidence that voting by mail is subject to fraud, while Democrats raised alarm when Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump ally, implemented cost-cutting measures amid delivery delays. DeJoy has since said he will pause some of the changes.A federal judge in New York on Monday ordered the US Postal Service to expedite all mail ballots and ensure that postal workers are able to work overtime to ensure votes are processed. Last week, another judge issued an injunction freezing operational changes DeJoy had made. In Ohio, Trump is expected to speak about “fighting for the American worker,” with a focus on the economic themes that dominated his re-election pitch prior to Ginsburg’s death, before attending a rally.Earlier in the race, many Democrats had privately written Ohio off, seeing it as firmly in Trump’s grasp. But polls show a tight contest, and Biden’s campaign is now pursuing wins in an expanded set of states.On Monday, Biden’s campaign said it would add Georgia and Iowa to a list of 10 other states where it is running paid advertisements. Meanwhile, campaign finance filings on Sunday showed the national Republican Party transferred $1.3 million in August to the coffers of the state party in Texas, a longtime Republican stronghold that Democrats also hope to make competitive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-trump-campaign-in-us-midwest-as-supreme-court-fight-looms/story-CT7Mmmd2euWRUbY6dx1NiJ.html
22-09-2020||World||Beijing unlikely to approve ByteDance’s TikTok deal with Oracle: Report||A deal China’s ByteDance has struck with Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc over the future of its video-streaming app TikTok is unlikely to receive Chinese government approval, state-backed newspaper Global Times said in an editorial.ByteDance has said it will create a US subsidiary, TikTok Global, that will be part-owned by Oracle and Walmart - which in turn said TikTok Global’s board would comprise mainly Americans - to pacify the administration of US President Donald Trump which had planned to ban TikTok on security grounds.“It is clear that these articles (terms) extensively show Washington’s bullying style and hooligan logic. They hurt China’s national security, interests and dignity,” said the English version of the editorial published late on Monday and which was also carried in the newspaper’s Chinese edition.The unidentified author objected to a requirement that four of the five board seats of TikTok Global be occupied by Americans and only one reserved for a Chinese national, as well as the inclusion of a U.S-approved “national security director”.It also denounced a requirement that ByteDance reveal TikTok’s source code to Oracle as part of the latter’s stake purchase, as well as the separate management of TikTok from Chinese equivalent Douyin.“As TikTok and Douyin should have the same source code, this means the US can get to know the operations of Douyin,” the editorial continued.“If the reorganization of TikTok under US manipulation becomes a model, it means once any successful Chinese company expands its business to the US and becomes competitive, it will be targeted by the US and turned into a US-controlled company via trickery and coercion, which eventually serves only US interests,” the author wrote.The Global Times is a tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government unlike its parent publication.Over the weekend, ByteDance and Oracle announced they had reached a deal that would satisfy Trump’s call for TikTok to be sold to an American buyer or face shutdown in the United States.However, both sides have framed the deal differently in public statements.ByteDance has said TikTok Global will be its subsidiary of which it will own 80%.Oracle has said ByteDance’s ownership would be distributed to ByteDance’s investors, many of which are US-based and that the Beijing-based firm itself would have no stake in TikTok Global.The deal requires approval from regulators in both Beijing and Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-unlikely-to-approve-bytedance-s-tiktok-deal-with-oracle-report/story-uxzK0SSC4hqyrEToWcDPaL.html
22-09-2020||World||Barbara Lagoa, Amy C Barrett frontrunners to fill Ginsburg’s seat at US Supreme Court||President Donald Trump raced on Monday to cement a conservative majority on the US Supreme Court before the Nov. 3 election, telling reporters he planned by Saturday to reveal his pick to succeed liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Democrats’ hope of keeping the seat empty faded when two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Cory Gardner, signaled their support for moving forward quickly.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he was zeroing in on one or two candidates among five who are under consideration. He called on the Senate, controlled by his fellow Republicans, to vote on confirmation before the election in which he is seeking a second term.“I’d much rather have a vote before the election,” he said. “We have plenty of time to do it.”Two federal appeals court judges appointed by Trump are clear front-runners: Amy Coney Barrett of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals and Barbara Lagoa of the Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump met with Barrett at the White House on Monday, according to a source familiar with the situation.Ginsburg died on Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer at age 87.Trump’s announcement would come before Ginsburg is due to be buried privately at Arlington National Cemetery next week.Officials have arranged for a public viewing of her body outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday and inside the US Capitol on Friday.Ginsburg’s death gives Trump and his party an opportunity to establish a 6-3 conservative majority on a court whose decisions influence many spheres of American life including abortion, healthcare, gun rights, voting access, presidential powers and the death penalty.With Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the Senate, it would require at least four of them to break ranks to stop the nomination from going through. Two Republican senators - Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski - said over the weekend that the chamber should not move forward with a Trump nominee before the election.Democrats had hoped to get similar support from Gardner, who faces a tough re-election race in Colorado, and Grassley. But both men said on Monday they would vote to confirm a qualified Trump pick.Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump and is seen by Democrats as a potential holdout, avoided questions about the Supreme Court seat on Monday.“Before I have any comment, I’m going to meet with my colleagues, which I’ll be doing tomorrow,” Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, told reporters.Democrats have accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of hypocrisy for being eager to bring a Trump nominee to a confirmation vote. In 2016, he refused even to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill a vacancy on the court left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, saying it would be inappropriate to do so during an election year. McConnell, who has prioritized confirming Trump’s judicial appointments, said he would usher through a vote this year, although he did not say exactly when. “The Senate has more than sufficient time to process a nomination. History and precedent make that perfectly clear,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. A new Congress will not be sworn in until Jan. 3. Democrats are hoping to win control of the Senate in the election.Trump has already named two conservative justices to the high court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.‘Ginsburg’s dying wish’Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said any vote should take place next year. “That was Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish. And it may be the Senate’s only, last hope,” Schumer said. Trump said without evidence that he did not believe the National Public Radio report that Ginsburg had told her granddaughter she did not want the Senate to consider a successor until next year, when either Trump will begin a second term or Democratic rival Joe Biden, who leads in opinion polls, will take office. “It was just too convenient,” Trump said.Speaking of the possible candidates, Trump said: “They’re all outstanding but I have one or two that I have in mind.” He called Barrett “very respected.”He said he might meet with Lagoa in Miami later this week, adding: “I don’t know her but I hear she’s outstanding.” Obstacles loom for either candidate in the bitterly divided Senate. Barrett could face opposition from Collins and Murkowski over concerns that she would roll back abortion rights, said a source familiar with the confirmation process who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lagoa, a Cuban American from the battleground state of Florida, is not as well known, which could slow down the confirmation process.White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, are leading the selection process, the source said. Outside of White House officials, Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, is playing a central advisory role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barbara-lagoa-amy-c-barrett-frontrunners-to-fill-ginsburg-s-seat-at-us-supreme-court/story-HgNaktaau9LbgPSkXeh8FO.html

The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, has lived in exile since 1959.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-police-officer-charged-with-spying-for-china/story-AmTLUriL4m37DGv8SnssHN.html

He was addressing the High-Level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to mark 75 years of the global body.‘The declaration acknowledges the need for reform in the United Nation itself. You cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” the Prime Minister said.Marking 75 years of the @UN. https://t.co/2j7HPYjEGAPM Modi also said that the UN needs to address the crisis of confidence it currently faces. ‘Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities,” he said.Speaking about organisations like the UN Security Council, he said the UN needs to adapt in order to address contemporary challenges which a structure set up in 1945 may not be able to do.PM Modi while supporting the reforms undertaken by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “We support ongoing reforms by the Secretary-General…We reiterate our call for reforms of three of the principal organs of the UN. We commit to instil new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalise the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council.”PM Modi highlighted that India’s own philosophies align with the goals of the United Nations. He said work still needs to be done towards reducing inequality, mitigating conflicts and addressing the threat of climate change.He also highlighted that India is one of the largest contributors to the UN Peacekeeping Missions. India has assigned over 200,000 troops in 50 of the 71 peacekeeping missions in the last 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-needs-to-address-crisis-of-confidence-pm-modi-calls-for-reformed-multilateralism/story-veW6LZ9FSwjPtnnZZiVMdJ.html
22-09-2020||World||Former Wisconsin police chief to review Jacob Blake’s shooting||Wisconsin’s attorney general announced Monday that he has selected a former Madison police chief to serve as an independent consultant for prosecutors weighing whether to file charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake, a Black man who was left paralyzed from the waist down.The shooting of Blake on Aug. 23 by a white Kenosha police officer made Wisconsin the epicenter of the nation’s ongoing debate over police violence and racial injustice. It came three months after the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.Noble Wray, the expert who will review the file, is Black. Following his retirement as Madison’s chief in 2013, Wray has become a national leader in working on police reform, fighting racism and educating about implicit bias. Wray was chief for nine years and worked 30 years as a police officer, experience that Attorney General Josh Kaul and Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Gravely said would be crucial when reviewing the file.Gravely said he requested the consultant but that he asked the Department of Justice to choose.Kaul said his department’s investigation of the shooting is in its final stages. When it’s done, he will turn it over to Wray for review and an analysis. It will then be up to Gravely about whether to file charges. Gravely said Monday that he had not made any decision about filing charges yet.Gravely said Wray would bring “diverse” and “abundant” perspectives to the case.Wray said he will provide insight and perspective to the case but not prejudge it. Wray said he will complete his review as quickly as possible, but he has not been given a timeline once he receives the investigative file.“I have not prejudged the case,” Wray said.Blake was shot in the back seven times after walking away from the officer and two others who were trying to arrest him. The officer, Rusten Sheskey, shot Blake after Blake opened an SUV’s driver-side door and leaned into the vehicle. Three of Blake’s children were in the back seat. The shooting was captured on video and circulated quickly online, fueling protests hours later.The state Justice Department has said a knife was recovered from Blake’s vehicle, but it has not said whether he was holding it when officers tried to arrest him.Blake’s attorney, Ben Crump, has said that Blake was only trying to break up a domestic dispute and did nothing to provoke police. Crump has called for the arrest of Sheskey, the officer who shot Blake, and for the two other officers involved in the shooting to be fired.Sheskey and the other officers who were at the scene — Vincent Arenas and Brittany Meronek — were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. None of them have been charged.The Kenosha police union has said that officers were dispatched on Aug. 23 because of a complaint that Blake was attempting to steal the caller’s keys and vehicle. Union attorney Brendan Matthews said officers were aware that Blake had an open warrant for felony sexual assault before they arrived.Blake pleaded not guilty on Sept. 4 to charges accusing him of sexually assaulting a woman in May. A trial date was set for Nov. 9.Kenosha is a city of about 100,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan midway between Milwaukee and Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-wisconsin-police-chief-to-review-jacob-blake-s-shooting/story-0Ep52ZlvIxBwk4VN3wJdMP.html
22-09-2020||World||Chinese airforce uses Hollywood film clips in propaganda video||A PR video for China’s airforce was slammed on social media after users questioned why the world’s second largest military power spliced clips from Hollywood blockbusters Transformers and The Rock into its own propaganda material.The video, with 4.72 million views on Weibo and crafted by the Propaganda and Culture Centre of the PLA’s Air Force, parades its medium and long-range H-6 bomber.With a soaring score and high-altitude action shots, the video shows Chinese airmen launching an attack on an island base, resembling US facilities in Diego Garcia and Guam, then returning from the successful sortie.But social media users in China were quick to spot some glaring plot holes. The missile sequences were plucked from three Hollywood movies, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Rock and Hurt Locker. “It turned out that our dream of great power was pieced together by editing American film clips,” said one user.“We promote the domestic military aircraft using US Hollywood movie clips, why bother?” added another, while a third said, “It’s our nation’s promotional video, why don’t we use our own images?”China’s foreign ministry ramped up its rhetoric over the self-ruled island of Taiwan on Monday, describing any support for its independence as “doomed to fail”, and threatened retaliation against US diplomatic visits to the island.Meanwhile, Taiwan said it scrambled fighters and deployed anti-missile systems on Monday after Chinese military jets entered its air defence zone for the fourth time in five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-airforce-uses-hollywood-film-clips-in-propaganda-video/story-wocx6pLKEd4BMKQqng7ThO.html
22-09-2020||World||UK raises Covid-19 alert to second highest level||The Joint Biosecurity Centre of the British government on Monday raised the national Covid-19 alert level from three to four – the second highest – after new cases doubling every week prompted experts to envisage a scenario of 50,000 daily cases by mid-October.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to make a statement in parliament on Tuesday to announce new measures to deal with the virus, seeking to strike a balance between ensuring public health and preventing further blows to Britain’s battered economy.Before the statement, Johnson is expected to hold a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee. A range of options have been discussed over the weekend with experts and ministers, with consensus reportedly veering towards more curbs instead of another national lockdown.The alert level was reduced from level four to three on June 19, when new cases on successive days and weeks were recorded in the hundreds. They rose in the thousands in September, with 4,368 recorded on Monday evening.The centre has five alert levels; the highest refers to a stage of outbreak in which there is a risk of health services being overwhelmed. The new current level four means the epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is “high or rising exponentially”.The new level was agreed by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who said in a statement: “After a period of lower Covid cases and deaths, the number of cases are now rising rapidly and probably exponentially in significant parts of all four nations”.“If we are to avoid significant excess deaths and exceptional pressure in the National Health Service and other health services over the autumn and winter, everyone has to follow the social distancing guidance, wear face coverings correctly and wash their hands regularly”.“We know this will be a concerning news for many people. Please follow the rules, look after each other and together we will get through this”, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-raises-covid-19-alert-to-second-highest-level/story-6TtMmSjEH65IAw8JehkiGP.html
22-09-2020||World||Leaders observe 75 years of UN at virtual event||World leaders came together, virtually, on Monday to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, as the deadly coronavirus pandemic challenges the effectiveness and solidarity of the 193-member world body.As Covid-19, which emerged in China late last year, began to spread around the world, forcing millions of people to shelter at home and dealing a devastating economic blow, countries turned inward and diplomats say the United Nations struggled to assert itself.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told Reuters that the pandemic has exposed the world’s fragilities. He told world leaders on Monday that they need to work together at a time when there is a surplus of multilateral challenges and deficit of solutions. The 15-member Security Council took months to back a call by Guterres for a global ceasefire - to allow countries to focus on fighting Covid-19 - due to bickering between the world’s biggest powers: China and the United States.The 193-member UN General Assembly only adopted an omnibus resolution on a “comprehensive and coordinated response” to the pandemic earlier this month, and it was not by consensus. The US and Israel voted no.A $10.3 billion UN appeal to fund fighting the pandemic in vulnerable and low-income countries is only a quarter funded. Guterres now has taken a lead in pushing to make sure any vaccine for the coronavirus is made available to everyone globally. A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the General Assembly should have acted months ago, but “we were all hampered by, and hit, by the Covid-19”. After New York was hit hard by the coronavirus, UN member states had to decide how to work virtually, which they did for several months before resuming some in-person meetings. “We all suffered from the fact that we couldn’t meet... A lot of attention was paid to process more than substance unfortunately,” said the European diplomat. “I wouldn’t put the blame on the UN, it’s the member states that have to be more positive.” Monday’s event comes ahead of the annual meeting of world leaders at the UN, which starts on Tuesday with no presidents or PMs physically present in New York. All statements have been pre-recorded and will be broadcast in the General Assembly hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-observe-75-years-of-un-at-virtual-event/story-OHmwdP7Jbh6n7M2GL5otiK.html
22-09-2020||World||Trump to name RBG’s replacement by Saturday, Biden slams his haste||President Donald Trump said on Monday he will announce his US Supreme Court pick by the end of the week, moving quickly to fill the seat of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg and cement a 6-3 conservative majority ahead of his November 3 re-election bid.A day earlier, his Democratic challenger Joe Biden slammed Trump’s haste, and urged Republicans to oppose a confirmation vote before the election.It takes four GOP senators breaking ranks to keep Trump’s nominee off the court.“Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience,” said Biden, speaking in Philadelphia on Sunday. “Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have engulfed our country.”Jamming the nomination through, Biden said, would amount to an “abuse of power”.The sudden vacancy is reshaping the presidential race, which to this point has been largely a referendum on how Trump had managed the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking on Fox News on Monday, Trump said he would put forward his nominee on Friday or Saturday and called upon the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on confirmation ahead of the election. “We have the presidency and the Senate and we have plenty of time,” Trump said, dismissing demands for making the nomination after the election. “I think that would be good for the Republican Party and I think it would be good for everybody to get it over with.”Trump said he had a list of five finalists, “probably four”. He has mentioned two women as possible candidates: federal appellate judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa. He appointed both to their current posts.Ginsburg died on Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer at age 87. She is to lie in repose for public viewing at the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday. She will be buried next week in Arlington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-name-rbg-s-replacement-by-saturday-biden-slams-his-haste/story-ODU2YRFEALSo12V7WeCMKP.html
