Continent must guess||Raino Bolz quickly diversified when his tourism business in South Africa’s winelands crashed to a halt in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. He sold a minibus — useless without tourists to ferry around — and bought a herd of pregnant cows.He’ll have to wait for the cows to have calves and for the calves to be old enough to sell before he can make money from them. That probably won’t be until early next year, but it’s his insurance policy.Bolz hopes to see a return of some tourists in November, the start of South Africa’s tourism season. If foreign visitors — 80% of his income — don’t arrive for end-of-year vacations, he’ll need the profit from his cattle to stay afloat.Africa will lose between $53 billion and $120 billion in contributions to its GDP in 2020 because of the crash in tourism, the World Travel and Tourism Council estimates. Kenya expects at least a 60% drop in tourism revenue this year. South Africa a 75% drop. In South Africa, 1.2 million tourism-related jobs are already impacted, according to its Tourism Business Council. That’s not far off 10% of total jobs in Africa’s most developed economy and the total damage isn’t yet clear.“Devastation,” council CEO Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa said.South Africa’s borders, including virtually all international flights, have been closed for nearly six months and there are no signs of them reopening.The Covid-19 restrictions have shuttered what was once the lucrative centerpiece of African tourism, the safari.For nearly 40 years, Desert and Delta has sold luxury safaris in the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta in northern Botswana and their clients have always been a particular kind of tourist. From North America or Western Europe, wealthy, retired and almost always over 60 years old, said James Wilson, Desert and Delta’s marketing director. His fear — it’s felt across the safari lands of southern and East Africa — is that those retirees will be the last to come back because of their age and vulnerability to Covid-19.Jillian Blackbeard sees a silver lining. She’s the CEO of a regional tourism association that represents safari operators in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.It’ll take southern Africa’s safari tourism three years to recover, Blackbeard said. But the virus could also kick-start a long overdue change. She said they’ve relied too much on that specific kind of client, white, elderly, North American or European. She’s pressing for the whole region to use the moment to diversify. To attract their own African tourists, who have been ignored. To look to Asia and its multi-generational travelers. And to appeal to Black Americans.“For a long, long time, the African-American diaspora has never traveled to southern Africa,” she said. “It wasn’t that they didn’t want to come. It was because when you see a brochure it was always these white elderly people. Covid has allowed us to reach into that and say, ‘OK, how do we make our industry more resilient by diversifying our market?’”No one is untouched. Sun International, a major player with a portfolio of casinos, resorts and high-end hotels in South Africa and several other African countries, has so far kept its 8,500 employees, although on reduced salaries. It can’t last. Sun International is now “having to consider quite severe restructures,” said Graham Wood, chief operating officer for hospitality.One of Sun International’s landmark properties, the 5-star Table Bay Hotel on the Cape Town waterfront, has been closed for half the year in the absence of foreign visitors. Many hotels around it remain shut, too.Wood does expect a bounce in domestic tourism at the end of the year from South Africans who aren’t going overseas. And domestic tourism got a boost last month when South Africa eased restrictions to allow interstate leisure travel for the first time since late March. But the international tourist season this year is “not going to materialize,” Wood said.That’ll be ruinous for Bolz in nearby Stellenbosch, whose attempts to lure locals have yielded just “a drop in a bucket,” he said. “It’s not going to sustain us.”His adventure tourism company combines hiking and cycling with wine-tasting tours in the mountain vineyards of Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, and epitomizes so many African tourism enterprises desperately missing their international visitors. He’s clinging to the theory that his foreign customers are innately adventurous and will come back sometime during the season. He’ll only really know early next year.And he’ll only know then if he can re-employ all his tour guides, experts in wine and the ecosystems of the Stellenbosch mountains. One is working at a laundry, two are helping out at a charity running soup kitchens to feed people permanently laid off because of the pandemic.Looking at the prospects for tourism, Bolz said: “We can only do proper business once international borders open again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-tourists-return-to-africa-continent-must-guess/story-znHysVYBn109D972YlNyMP.html
08-09-2020||World||Benjamin Netanyahu slams Israeli police amid report about cover-up||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the country’s law enforcement system on Tuesday, continuing a crusade to discredit those who have pressed corruption cases against him ahead of the resumption of his trial early next year.Netanyahu’s latest tirade came in response to a report by Channel 12 TV alleging that police covered up a conflict of interest involving one of its senior investigators who was looking into alleged crimes committed by Netanyahu and his wife Sara.Speaking at an event meant to be focused on Israel’s struggling battle against the coronavirus, Netanyahu was asked about the report and devoted a chunk of his time accusing the police of conspiring to oust him.“The entire chain of command is involved: senior investigators, the chief of police, the state attorney, and everything is sanctioned and authorized by the attorney general,” Netanyahu said. “This was not an investigation. This is a corrupt political conspiracy to topple a prime minister.”To highlight his point about police wrongdoing, Netanyahu addressed another media report claiming the former state prosecutor did not pursue an investigation into a case of alleged police misconduct. The case surrounded the fatal shooting of a Bedouin Arab man in 2017 out of fears it would tarnish the image of law enforcement amid its investigations into Netanyahu. Police shot the man, claiming he had intentionally rammed his car into police who were carrying out a demolition in his village. His family disputes the police claims.On Tuesday, Netanyahu apologized for the killing and for the man being wrongly labeled a terrorist, which he said is what he was told by police at the time.Since he was indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes, Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to disparage the police and prosecutors, accusing them of being biased against him and seeking to force him out of office. Legal officials and experts say Netanyahu’s attacks on an independent and reputable system have done lasting damage to Israel’s democracy.The charges revolve around a series of scandals that accuse Netanyahu of trading favors with wealthy associates in exchange for gifts and palatable media coverage of himself and his family.Netanyahu’s trial is set to resume in January, with evidentiary hearings to take place three times a week and sure to keep Netanyahu’s alleged crimes firmly in the public conversation at a time when he faces widespread discontent over his handling of the coronavirus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-slams-israeli-police-amid-report-about-cover-up/story-9iCIlwZeKX0k3mODpM0EOL.html
08-09-2020||World||Computer glitches disrupt classes as schools return online||As millions of American youngsters start the school year with online classes at home because of the coronavirus, they are running into technical glitches and other headaches that have thrust many a harried parent into the role of teacher’s aide and tech support person.A ransomware attack forced schools in Hartford, Connecticut, to postpone the start of online and in-person classes this week. Seattle’s system crashed last week, and a Zoom outage caused it to shut down for more than two hours in August. An online learning program used in Alabama and other places recently crashed. North Carolina’s platform went down on the first day of classes last month.Erik Rasmussen, a Falls Church, Virginia, resident who has three children taking online classes, said he regularly copes with computer glitches and short attention spans. The divorced dad has his children half the time.“You put your kids in front of the computer, and then I go to do my work, but kids are kids -- they’re going to turn off the video function and start playing a game,” he said.Summer break gave school districts time to iron out kinks that cropped up when the virus forced them to switch to online classes in the spring. But the new school year already has been plagued by some of the same problems.Florida’s largest school district, in Miami-Dade County, had assured parents that it had consolidated different programs into one platform that would be easier to navigate. But software glitches and cyberattacks disrupted the first week of the new school year that started Aug. 31.A high school student was arrested and accused of orchestrating a series of network outages. School administrators believe other people may be doing the same.Christy Rodriguez, 36, said her third- and fourth-grade boys’ classes struggled with connection problems during the first week of school.“Four full days were lost,” she said. “Either somebody is not able to go on, or the screen goes blank, or the teacher can’t hear the kids, so the teacher then just logs off and then sends a message to the parents.”Rodriguez said she has been forced to work until late at night because her children need help fixing connection problems.“The teachers are frustrated. The kids are frustrated. I hope that they soon open up schools,” she said.Another parent, Alessandra Martinez, said her 7-year-old son has struggled with logins, passwords and connection problems. He had a meltdown on Friday when he was moved to a smaller breakout group but didn’t see the teacher and didn’t know what he was supposed to be doing.“At their age, everything is amplified, and it feels like a big deal,” Martinez said.Martinez said she was against the school district using a product commonly employed by parents who homeschool.“This is a homeschooling program, but for parents who are working from home and have multiple children, it is a bit overwhelming,” she said. “We have this set up as a one-size-fits-all, and it doesn’t work for everybody.”Some school districts have opted for a mix on online and in-person instruction. The school year started on Aug. 13 in Shelby County, Alabama, where about one-quarter of the students have been doing virtual learning, while about three-quarters have been doing in-person instruction for two days and remote learning for three days.Students will be able to do five-day-a-week in-person instruction starting on Sept. 14 if their parents choose. Parents can opt for fully virtual learning instead.“It was our intention all along that we wanted to have a cautious start,” said Shelby County schools spokeswoman Cindy Warner. “Along the way, we’ve monitored our data and looked at the state and county data to make sure that the number of cases have remained low.”In Hartford, where the first day of school was supposed to be Tuesday, a new start date has not been announced. The ransomware attack crippled critical systems, including one used to supply transportation routes to a school bus company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/computer-glitches-disrupt-classes-as-schools-return-online/story-vJlEQ6HJXB2Y9TuIdF9tPO.html

And I understand why she will never be president,” Trump told reporters on Monday in a briefing that he opened with an attack on the Indian-origin California senator.Harris had said she would not trust any vaccine announced by Trump without credible and reliable information. Calling her the “most liberal person in Congress”, Trump demanded that she should “apologise for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric”.He said she is “not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy”. Trump insisted that a vaccine may be ready “even before a very special date”, referring to November 3, the Election Day. “So now they’re saying, ‘Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let’s disparage the vaccine’,” he said, adding, “That’s so bad for this country.”The president denied he was himself politicising the vaccine search by talking about a breakthrough as early as October. “No, I’m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives,” he said, adding, “the faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I’m saying it in terms of this is what we need.”When asked if she would take the vaccine if it was announced before the election, Harris had said in an interview to CNN, “I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump, and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about.”Trump has repeatedly claimed a vaccine will have been found by the end of the year for Covid-19 that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans and infected more tan 6.4 million, and sent the economy into a tail spin, with millions of people left jobless by shuttered businesses.Questions have been raised about Trump’s handling of the epidemic — with most Americans rating it poorly in polls — seriously imperiling his re-election bid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-harris-for-doubting-vaccine-says-she-ll-never-be-president/story-izGoO38OfyfoDeyGZei6II.html
08-09-2020||World||California’s climate crisis is deepening as 500,000 go dark||In a matter of weeks, California has been hit with two record-breaking heat waves, hundreds of blazes, freak lightning storms and dangerously poor air quality, and now unusually strong winds are threatening to knock down power lines and ignite more wildfires.That’s prompting the state’s largest utility to impose power cuts for more than 500,000 people, and with dangerous conditions stretching across the West, Portland General Electric Co. has also switched off power to some Oregon customers.The shutoffs that PG&E Corp. began late Monday are the latest blow for the disaster-weary California, where climate change is making weather ever more extreme. Temperatures have soared to records from Napa to Los Angeles. Wildfires have torched more than 2 million acres, the most in records stretching back three decades. Hundreds of thousands of people may go dark for days while trapped indoors due to wildfire smoke and Covid-19 outbreaks.Officials are responding with equally extreme measures. In August, California carried out its first rotating blackouts since the 2001 energy crisis, drawing the ire of millions who went powerless amid extreme temperatures. The Trump administration declared a power emergency, allowing power plants to run at full bore, regardless of environmental limits. The shutoffs that began late Monday are a fairly new and controversial practice, and their use last year triggered investigations while utilities defended them as necessary in the face of increasingly wild weather.Now, as a second round of ferocious temperatures abates, so-called Diablo winds sweeping in have set the conditions for even more fires. PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy last year after its equipment sparked deadly wildfires, warned the precautionary shutoffs could impact portions of 22 counties from late Monday through Wednesday, including in the Sierra foothills and North Bay.“Unfortunately, the continued hot and dry weather is going to continue to dry out vegetation across California -- and make that vegetation even more susceptible to new admissions and large fires,” Scott Strenfel, a PG&E meteorologist, said during a public briefing late Monday.PG&E, which emerged from Chapter 11 in July after agreeing to pay $25.5 billion to settle wildfire lawsuits, said preemptive shutoffs that started late Monday could leave about 172,000 homes and businesses in the dark. That could impact up to 516,000 people, based on the size of the average California household.Shutoffs were expected to affect about 104,000 customers starting from 9 p.m. local time Monday, with the remainder going down in two phases Tuesday. Some customers may not have power restored until 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to an announcement Tuesday morning.PG&E also plans to turn off about 100 transmission lines and 145 distribution lines, it said during the briefing.In Oregon, high winds have knocked out electricity to about 80,000 Portland General customers, and for the first time the company intentionally cut power to about 5,000 homes and businesses near Mt. Hood.The U.S. Forest Service said in a statement Monday that most of California “remains under the threat of unprecedented and dangerous fire conditions.” It has temporarily closed eight national forests, including Sierra National Forest.“Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough resources to fully fight and contain every fire,” Randy Moore, regional forester for the forest service’s Pacific Southwest Region, said in the statement.California narrowly escaped rotating blackouts Saturday and Sunday, as temperatures soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in much of the state, squeezing the power grid to its brink. The fires only made things worse, taking down power plants and transmission lines, cutting power to 70,000 homes and businesses.While temperatures were lower Monday in some areas, officials said they were still concerned about getting through the afternoon, in part because of the fires. But in a tweet Monday night, the grid operator said it wouldn’t order power outages.The heat is poised to ebb only slightly Tuesday. Sacramento is forecast to hit 97. Oakland will be 91. And Los Angeles will be 87.The latest blazes are already wreaking havoc on the grid. The Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which has scorched more than 78,000 acres, knocked out transmission from a hydro plant on Saturday.September and October typically mark the peak of California’s fire season, when plants have been sapped of moisture by the state’s dry summer. Rains most often return in October or November.Last year, when California’s utilities first began carrying out widespread blackouts like this, some homes and businesses were left in the dark for days. That drew outrage from state and local officials, triggered investigations and prompted PG&E to reassess the scope of future shutoffs. The company has taken steps to limit the size and duration of outages, including putting wires underground in some locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-s-climate-crisis-is-deepening-as-500-000-go-dark/story-S9nvAgN50SNIIw3vscqyCI.html

Take me to jail,” the report said.Pages was taken into custody for questioning. He told detectives that after the argument, his mother held up a pink knife and threatened him. That’s when he pulled out a handgun and shot her multiple times, the police report said.He told investigators he tried to shoot himself but realized he was out of bullets. He called 911 instead.Pages was being held without bond. Jail records did not list an attorney for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-tells-police-he-lost-it-and-fatally-shot-his-mother/story-8ypivZe1JwO3tlyC0crH3K.html
08-09-2020||World||Coronavirus lockdown plunges South Africa deeper into recession||South Africa’s economy has sunk deeper into recession, with its gross domestic product for the second quarter of 2020 plummeting by 51%, largely as a result of Covid-19 and the country’s strict lockdown, according to statistics released Tuesday.South Africa imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in April and May in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed more than 15,000 lives and infected 639,362 people in the country.The halt to most economic activity during the shutdown caused heavy declines in South Africa’s manufacturing, transport and retail sectors, according to the country’s statistics body StatsSA. South Africa has one of the largest and most developed economies in sub-Saharan Africa.The country’s ban on trade in liquor and cigarettes also had an adverse impact on the economy during the period from April to June, with consumer spending on these items falling by 92%, according to StatsSA. South Africa’s manufacturing output shrank by 74.9% as factories stopped production, it said.“Air travel came to a complete halt, contributing to the fall in economic activity in the transport and communication sector,” said the report. “The retail ban on alcohol sales and closure of tourist accommodation facilities were notable drags on trade activity.”Some economists have warned that even though the Covid-19 outbreak was to blame for most of the decline, it simply exacerbated the economic crisis that South Africa was already experiencing.South Africa’s unemployment rate is now at a record high of 30.1 %.Since June the country has eased lockdown restrictions and gradually reopened the economy that is expected to decline by 7.2% this year, according to government projections.Miyelani Mkhabela, CEO and chief economist at Antswisa Transaction Advisory Services, said he expects the country’s economic decline to be higher than the predicted 7.2% predicted earlier this year.He predicted a contraction of more than 12% by the end of 2020.He called on the government to make immediate interventions to kick-start economic recovery by solving the country’s electricity crisis, which has now seen the return of scheduled power blackouts.The country’s state-owned power utility, Eskom, has been beset with management problems and corruption allegations for years, and now struggles to supply enough power, plunging households and industry into rotating power cuts.“If you look at the numbers, mining and manufacturing have suffered immensely and those are important sectors for us, which only work well when there is sufficient, affordable electricity,” said Mkhabela. “Energy is the lifeblood of every economy, so it needs to be high among the government’s priorities.”He added that widespread allegations of corruption and on-going revelations in an official investigation into graft are not helping the international perception of South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-lockdown-plunges-south-africa-deeper-into-recession/story-Gj9bsRkviVyZBVx8LqdFxK.html
08-09-2020||World||EU, UK blame each other over deadlocked post-Brexit talks||The UK and the European Union blamed each other Tuesday in their increasingly acrimonious post-Brexit trade discussions that could just be weeks from collapse.While the UK urged the EU to show “more realism” in the discussions, the 27-nation bloc noted that it was a “world power.”The latest round of discussions kicked off in London on Tuesday amid an air of pessimism because of concerns that the British government is set to violate international law by reneging on commitments made before the country’s departure from the bloc on Jan. 31.The news that the head of the British government’s legal department has quit — reportedly over plans to bypass commitments made with regard to the Irish border — and an intervention from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s predecessor only added to the sense the talks are going nowhere.Though the UK left the bloc on Jan. 31, it is in a transition period that effectively sees it abide by EU rules until the end of this year.David Frost, the British government’s chief negotiator, said the two sides “can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground” in the deadlocked talks and that the EU needs to show “more realism” about the UK’s status as an independent country.European Council President Charles Michel retorted that the bloc is in no mood to budge on its demands.“We are sending a message, not only to our citizens but also to the rest of the world — Europe is a world power and we are ready to defend our interests,” he said in a speech Tuesday at the Brussels Economic Forum.The trade discussions have made very little progress over the summer, with the two sides seemingly wide apart on several issues, notably on business regulations, the extent to which the UK can support certain industries and over the EU fishing fleet’s access to British waters.The EU has been particularly insistent on level playing field issues in order to ensure that British-based businesses don’t have an unfair advantage as a result of laxer social, environmental or subsidy rules in the UK“If foreign companies want access to our market, we expect them to be on the same footing as our European companies,” Michel said.Relations have got further strained this week following reports that Britain’s Conservative government was attempting to unilaterally ride roughshod over its divorce agreement. EU officials said any attempt to override the international treaty could jeopardize peace in Northern Ireland as well as undermine the chances of any trade deal. Under the terms of Britain’s departure, the government has committed itself to ensuring an open border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and EU member Ireland.The British government said the publication of planned legislation on Wednesday is intended to tie up some “loose ends” where there was a need for “legal certainty.” It said the Internal Market Bill will ensure goods from Northern Ireland, which is part of the EU, will continue to have unfettered access to the UK market, while making clear EU state aid rules, which will continue to apply in Northern Ireland, won’t apply in the rest of the UKThough the government insists it’s not planning to tear up its commitments, it appears that concerns over its intentions lay behind the resignation Tuesday of Jonathan Jones, one of the top officials in its legal department.A spokesman for the Attorney General’s office confirmed the resignation, but wouldn’t comment on the reason behind it. The Financial Times reported that Jones quit because of a dispute over suggestions the government would challenge parts of the withdrawal agreement.And Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, raised concerns that any attempt to bypass commitments could damage the UK’s international standing.“The UK government signed the withdrawal agreement with the Northern Ireland protocol. This Parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation,” she said in the House of Commons. “The government is now changing the operation of that agreement. Given that, how can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?”Johnson has said Britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insists that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the UK” He said in a statement that any agreement must be sealed by an EU summit scheduled for Oct. 15.British businesses are worried about a collapse in the talks that could see tariffs and other impediments slapped on trade with the EU at the start of next year. Most economists think that the costs of a “no-deal” outcome would fall disproportionately on the UK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-blame-each-other-over-deadlocked-post-brexit-talks/story-UCtdYr3tNe4g9frb8EIpiL.html

They left China after diplomatic negotiations gave them a window to leave China.With their departure, it will be for the first time that Australia will not have an accredited journalist in China since the 1970s.In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China strongly condemned the Chinese government’s “…unprecedented harassment and intimidation of two Australian journalists by preventing them from leaving the country, leading both to flee China after a diplomatic standoff ended in a lifting of the bans.”Calling it “appalling intimidatory tactics”, the FCCC said that such actions threaten and seek to curtain the work of foreign journalists based in China who now face the threat of arbitrary detention.“This, combined with the expulsions of 17 foreign correspondents in the first half of this year alone, is a disappointing loss for global audiences seeking to understand more about China,” the FCCC statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detains-australian-journalist-intimidates-two-more-to-flee/story-8Ghyphh8kA9Oz9BiclAbwI.html

They are 186 meters (610 feet) long and 6 meters (20 feet) deep. Sharks can swim under the nets and around their ends.No details were immediately available about the shark.A Senate inquiry in 2017 found that Queensland shark nets create more harm than good. The Senate committee said nets give beachgoers a false sense of security while entangling and killing protected marine species including whales and turtles.Australia’s last fatal shark attack was north of the Gold Coast near Fraser Island on July 4. A 36-year-old spear fisherman died hours after he was bitten on a leg.A 60-year-old surfer was killed by a 3-meter (10-foot) great white shark at an unprotected beach south of the Gold Coast near Kingscliff on June 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shark-kills-surfer-on-australia-s-gold-coast-tourist-strip/story-dsBhF6KzOpNxIMx5SK3eCK.html
08-09-2020||World||Canada poll body prepares for possible snap elections||Canada’s polling agency has released the “approach” it will adopt to conduct safe elections during the Covid-19 pandemic as it appears likely that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may trigger early polls in the near future to try and convert his Liberal Party’s minority government into one with a majority.Elections Canada is addressing a potential scenario of such polls taking place in the autumn, as it looked “to a possible fall election.” Trudeau will face a vote of confidence in the House of Commons by the end of this month and a defeat, if it happens, will necessitate snap polls. As he prepares to present a platform in Parliament that will be transformative in terms of social policies, there is speculation that he himself might prefer early elections, using the legislative promises as a manifesto.Andrew McDougall, a political scientist with the University of Toronto – Scarborough, said it was “possible” that elections could occur in the fall, that is between late October and November, though there was a “greater chance” they will take place in spring, around March or April.Trudeau returned to power just last October after federal elections, though short of a majority. McDougall said Trudeau could set the stage with the Throne Speech in September, equivalent of India’s Presidential address laying out the government’s agenda. He said, “He wants to go big and wants to introduce some major initiatives. That could be a strategy - he’s trying to reset the agenda.”Elections Canada is well aware of the possibility of snap polls and has “changes and measures already in the works” including implementing physical distancing at polling stations and procuring masks and single-use pencils for marking ballots, increasing the polling period from one day to two and expanding the mail-in ballot process. “Given the current minority Government, an election could take place at any time,” it said in a statement.Early elections could see Trudeau facing a fine balance between risk and reward. McDougall said he will benefit from the public perception of handling the coronavirus crisis efficiently while suffering from criticism over handing out a nearly billion dollar contract, since cancelled, to a charity with links to himself and his family. In addition, there may be little appetite among Canadians for early elections especially during a pandemic.The Opposition could also ensure fresh elections ousting the Trudeau Government in the vote of confidence, but that could bring about its own challenges as, McDougall said, it may not want to be “blamed for bringing about political instability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-poll-body-prepares-for-possible-snap-elections/story-kCxzx3ltkKc0upapJLzLBP.html

08-09-2020||World||‘India fired first’: China repeats after New Delhi says PLA fired near Pangong Tso||China on Tuesday said it has made “stern representations” to the Indian government after Indian troops allegedly crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and fired warning shots at Chinese border personnel on Monday.“Through diplomatic and military channels we have made stern representations asking the Indian side to stop it’s dangerous actions, immediately withdraw the people who crossed the line and discipline the frontline troops and those who fired the warning shots and make sure similar incidents won’t happen again,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.The Indian army has already dismissed the allegations, first made by the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western theatre command (WAC), early on Tuesday morning.ALSO READ | China’s PLA fired shots to intimidate Indian soldiers, says ArmyThe WAC statement said Chinese troops had to take “countermeasures” after Indian border troops fired warning shots on Monday near the Shenpao mountain region near the south bank of Pangong Tso .In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Indian Army said its troops exercised “great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner” despite the grave provocation by Chinese troops who fired shots to intimidate Indian troops.“It is the People’s Liberation Army that has been blatantly violating agreements and carrying out aggressive manoeuvres, while engagement at military, diplomatic and political levels is in progress,” the Indian army statement said.“At no stage, has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,” the statement said.In Beijing, the foreign ministry, however, continued to blame the Indian side for the new round of escalation in the ongoing border tension at Pangong Lake near the LAC.Zhao alleged that it was the Indian army, which fired first.“I also want to stress that in this incident, the Indian side fired shots to the Chinese border troops first,” Zhao said.“This the first time since 1975 that the tranquility is interrupted by the shots. And the Chinese side always stresses that both sides should peacefully settle our differences through dialogue and consultation. Confrontation won’t benefit either,” the foreign ministry spokesperson added.When asked to elaborate on what “countermeasures” the Chinese troops took, Zhao said: “Currently, I have no further information for you”.Responding to a question on whether the two sides could go back to the status quo of April, he said Beijing hoped that disengagement of troops could be achieved soon.“You have a good wish and we all hope our troops can get back to their camping area and there won’t be any more confrontation in the border areas. You know that the place has very bad natural conditions and it is above the height of 4000 metres. In winter, it is not good for humans to live,” he said.“So, we hope through diplomatic and military channels and through consultations on the ground, we can achieve disengagement as soon as possible and reach a consensus,” Zhao said.In a statement issued in Mandarin, and tweeted by state media, WAC spokesperson Colonel Zhang Shuili early on Tuesday said Chinese border defence troops were forced to take countermeasures to stabilise the situation after Indian soldiers troops “outrageously fired warning shots to PLA border patrol soldiers who were about to negotiate”.“During the operation, the Indian army blatantly shot and threatened the patrol personnel of the Chinese border defence forces who had made representations before, and the Chinese border defence forces were forced to take countermeasures to stabilise the situation on the ground,” Zhang said in the statement.“The Indian side’s move seriously violated related agreements reached by both sides, stirred up tensions in the region, and would easily cause misunderstandings and misjudgments, which is a serious military provocation and is very vile in nature,” the spokesperson said.Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter standoff in multiple places in eastern Ladakh.Tensions flared up again in the region after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake last week when the two sides were engaged in diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row.ALSO READ | PLA move in Ladakh is part of Beijing plan to destabilize IndiaThe tension between the two sides escalated after violent clashes in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.The rise in the border tension comes days ahead of an expected meeting between external affairs minister, S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow on September 10,On Monday, Jaishankar, said the failure to observe several understandings on border management dating back to 1993 raises “very important questions” about the status of ties with China.“If peace and tranquillity on the border is not a given, then it cannot be that the rest of the relationship continues on the same basis, because clearly peace and tranquillity is the basis for the relationship,” he said while participating in an online interaction organised by The Indian Express newspaper to mark the release of his book ‘The India Way’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-fired-first-china-repeats-after-new-delhi-says-pla-fired-near-pangong-tso/story-ChXrvNGFpWI5HtkpYJFYOP.html

08-09-2020||World||Belarusian protest leader ripped up passport to thwart deportation - Interfax Ukraine||Prominent Belarusian opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova ripped up her passport to thwart an attempt to deport her to neighbouring Ukraine, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported on Tuesday.Deputy Ukrainian Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said on Facebook that Kolesnikova, who had been missing for the past 24 hours, had successfully prevented “a forcible expulsion from her native country”.The fate of Kolesnikova, a key figure in weeks of mass protests over the disputed re-election of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, had been a mystery since supporters said she was snatched in the street by masked men in the capital Minsk on Monday.“Maria Kolesnikova was not able to be deported from Belarus as this brave woman took steps to prevent her(self) from (being) moving across the border. She remained on the territory of the republic of Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko is personally responsible for her life and health,” Gerashchenko said.Interfax Ukraine quoted a source as saying that Kolesnikova had torn up her passport so that Ukrainian border officials would be unable to let her cross.Kolesnikova’s current whereabouts were unclear. Two other opposition figures who had gone missing around the same time as her did, however, enter Ukraine in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Ukrainian border service said. “Kolesnikova has now been detained, I can’t say concretely where she is, but she has been detained,” Anton Bychkovsky, a representative of the Belarusian border service, told Reuters by phone. “She was detained in connection with the circumstances under which they (the group) left the territory of Belarus,” he said.Several prominent opposition leaders have been arrested or forced to flee Belarus since last month’s election after Lukashenko launched a crackdown by the security forces to maintain his 26-year grip on power in the former Soviet republic.Kolesnikova, a member of the opposition coordination council, was the last of three female politicians left in Belarus who joined forces before the Aug. 9 election to try to challenge him.A vocal critic of Lukashenko, she has played an important role in weeks of mass demonstrations and strikes by protesters who accuse Lukashenko of rigging his re-election.Lukashenko, who enjoys Russia’s support, denies that allegation and has accused foreign powers of trying to topple him in a revolution. He has responded with a crackdown which some those detained say includes torture and beatings.Kolesnikova, in an interview with Reuters last month, called on the West not to recognise him as president and said his rule was crumbling.

China’s trade surplus with the US in August was $34.2 billion, the highest since November 2018.Still, tensions are rising on the tech front as the Trump administration moves to prevent China from accessing US user data on popular apps such as WeChat and TikTok. The US is also moving to shut out Huawei Technologies Co. from access to US technologies and equipment.Trump has sought to make China an election-year issue, portraying Biden as a lackey of Beijing and blaming the country for the US coronavirus outbreak. Polls show widespread public disapproval of the president’s handling of the pandemic.Trump didn’t say when he would implement the policies but framed the moves as part of a second-term agenda.“If Biden wins, China wins because China will own this country,” Trump said. “It’s the most important election in our history, right now, most important election in our history. Under my administration we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all.”Biden has turned the argument against the president, accusing Trump of being soft on China to secure a so-called “phase-one” trade deal in January and only toughening his posture after his administration lost control of the coronavirus outbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vows-to-sharply-scale-back-us-china-economic-ties/story-wwRephzq4Ws0PQHiLbPbbK.html

Global airline traffic was still down almost 80% in July compared to the same month a year earlier.“It suggests there’s some semblance of normality beginning to return to some segments of the aviation market,” Pearce said in an interview. He pointed to a partial recovery in short and medium-haul flights after pandemic travel restrictions were eased.The data rebound also reflects new internet habits formed under lockdown, said Alexander Grous, an expert on airline strategy and economics at the London School of Economics, who has previously written research on behalf of Inmarsat.“Lots of users are basically two to three times more likely now to connect and stay connected on board than they were at the beginning of the year, before Covid,” Grous said by phone.The potential for an airline data boom may reassure the institutions that bought Inmarsat last December in the UK’s second-biggest take-private deal of 2019.The $3.4 billion acquisition by Apax Partners, Warburg Pincus, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan was partly a bet on surging airline connectivity.Inmarsat’s European Aviation Network has been ramping up capacity since its launch in July 2019. The company partners with terrestrial mobile networks like Deutsche Telekom AG and can deliver up to 100 megabits per second to a plane.The in-flight broadband business was “going gangbusters” when the buyout deal was struck, said Pearce. A few months later, Covid-19 left many airlines fighting for survival.Last month, rival satellite operator Intelsat SA bid $400 million for Gogo Inc.’s inflight Wi-Fi business, in another long-term bet on in-flight internet. Gogo has no satellites of its own and buys capacity from satellite operators to connect its onboard modems and antennas.More deals may be in the offing.The Intelsat-Gogo deal is “a logical move,” said Pearce. “There may well be assets that come up that make sense for us to agglomerate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-flight-wi-fi-boom-shows-travel-is-changing-in-covid-19-era/story-rBKafPMMbRoXyzqvwggMMN.html

But the mother of a 7-year-old girl with respiratory problems has found herself among parents ready to challenge Spanish authorities on a blanket order to return to school.They are wary of safety measures they see as ill-funded as a new wave of coronavirus infections sweeps the country. They fear sick students could infect relatives who are at higher risk of falling ill from Covid-19. And they claim that they have invested in computers and better network connections to prepare for online lessons, even preparing to homeschool their children if necessary.Many of the defiant parents, including López, are also ready to stand up to the country’s rigid, one-size-fits-all rule of mandatory in-school education, even if that means facing charges for truancy, which in Spain can be punished with three to six months in prison.Her daughter was born with a condition that makes her prone to suffer episodes of bronchial spasms, which can cause difficulty breathing. With Covid-19 affecting the respiratory system, López doesn’t want to take any risks.“We feel helpless and a little offended. It’s like they force us to commit an illegal act because they don’t give us a choice,” said López, who lives in Madrid.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“It’s a matter of statistics,” she added. “The more cases there are, the more likely you are to catch it.” More than half a million people have contracted the virus in Spain and at least 29,500 have died with it, although the official record leaves out many who perished in March and April without being previously tested.With an average of 229 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks, Spain currently has the highest rate of contagion in western Europe. Within the region, it leads what many experts are already calling a second wave of the pandemic, although the Spanish government insists that it now identifies most of the infections because it’s testing more and better.Officials also say that more than half of those infected now show no symptoms, which explains why hospitals that struggled at the peak of the epidemic in spring are seeing fewer Covid-19 patients this time.As cases continue to go up and fuel debate in parents’ group messaging chats, Spanish authorities last week issued revised guidelines for the reopening. They included mandatory masks for students 6 and older, daily body temperature checks, hand-washing at least five times per day and frequent ventilation of classrooms.The Ministry of Health has also recommended setting up so-called “bubble-classrooms” where a reduced number of students interact only among themselves, and “Covid coordinators” in every school who can react quickly if an outbreak is identified.But many parents say funding is insufficient to hire more teachers and that some schools just don’t have additional space. They also see an inconsistency in authorities allowing up to 25 children in classrooms while banning large meetings of people or imposing curbs on nightlife in response to surging contagion. In Madrid, those restrictions have been expanded even to private homes, where no gatherings of more than 10 relatives or friends are allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-covid-19-parents-in-spain-rise-against-back-to-school-order/story-idjdNNVjRQ4MUIJPIBkcSP.html

08-09-2020||World||Trump again raises idea of separating US and Chinese economies||With the US election approaching, President Donald Trump on Monday again raised the idea of separating the US and Chinese economies, also known as decoupling, suggesting the United States would not lose money if the world’s two biggest economies no longer did business. “So when you mention the word decouple, it’s an interesting word,” Trump told a Labor Day news conference at the White House in which he vowed to bring jobs back to America from China.“We lose billions of dollars and if we didn’t do business with them we wouldn’t lose billions of dollars. It’s called decoupling, so you’ll start thinking about it,” Trump said.Trump, who long touted friendly ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he sought to make good on promises to rebalance a massive trade deficit, has made getting tough on China a key part of his campaign for re-election on November 3. He has accused his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, who leads in most opinion polls, of being soft toward Beijing.Also read: Donald Trump hints at vaccine ‘surprise’ as Joe Biden demands transparency“If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country,” he said.Biden for his part has criticized Trump’s Phase 1 trade deal with China, saying it is “unenforceable,” and “full of vague, weak, and recycled commitments from Beijing.”Trump vowed that in future his administration would prohibit federal contracts with companies that outsource to China and hold Beijing accountable for allowing the coronavirus, which began in China, to spread around the world.“We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and will end our reliance on China once and for all.Whether it’s decoupling, or putting in massive tariffs like I’ve been doing already, we will end our reliance in China, because we can’t rely on China,” Trump said. “We will bring jobs back from China to the United States and we will impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries,” he added.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in June that a decoupling of the US and Chinese economies would result if US companies were not allowed to compete on a fair and level basis in China’s economy.Other officials and analysts have said that the two countries’ economies are so intertwined as to make such a move impractical, but Washington would continue to pressure Beijing to level the playing field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-again-raises-idea-of-separating-us-and-chinese-economies/story-Y64FSCSTTPdj56AkiBftSP.html

A Greek government official told Reuters last week that Greece is in talks with France and other countries over the acquisition of fighter jets. Greece has also been trying for more than a decade to consolidate and privatise its loss-making defence companies.Mitsotakis will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Corsica on Thursday, before a Southern European leaders summit (MED7) on the French island of Corsica. The two leaders are expected to discuss the European Union’s strained relationship with Turkey, Macron’s office said.Petas said that cooperation in the defence sector between the two countries will also be on the agenda. Turkey and Greece have long disagreed over the extent of their continental shelves. Tensions rose last month after Ankara sent an exploration vessel into disputed waters, accompanied by warships, days after Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt.Ankara has since been extending the vessel’s work in the wider region, issuing advisories which Athens calls illegal. The Greek conservative leader discussed the latest twists in the row with European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, during a phone call on Monday.Michel will visit Athens on September 15, Petsas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-to-bolster-defence-sector-as-tensions-with-nato-ally-turkey-rise/story-w0FKxDOGQ5I2jcuYpqUczL.html
08-09-2020||World||Scorched earth: Record 2 million acres burned due to California wildfires||Wildfires have burned a record 2 million acres in California this year, and the danger for more destruction is so high the US Forest Service announced Monday it was closing all eight national forests in the southern half of the state.After a typically dry summer, California is parched heading into fall and what normally is the most dangerous time for wildfires. Two of the three largest fires in state history are burning in the San Francisco Bay Area. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling those fires and dozens of others more around California.A three-day heat wave brought triple-digit temperatures to much of the state during Labor Day weekend. But right behind it was a weather system with dry winds that could fan fires. The state’s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, was preparing to cut power to 158,000 customers in 21 counties in the northern half of the state to reduce the possibility its lines and other equipment could spark new fires.Randy Moore, regional forester for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region that covers California, announced the national forest closures and said the decision would be re-evaluated daily. Campgrounds at all national forests in the state also were closed.“The wildfire situation throughout California is dangerous and must be taken seriously.” Moore said. “Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough resources to fully fight and contain every fire.”Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said it’s “unnerving” to have reached a record for acreage burned when September and October usually are the worst for fires because vegetation has dried out and high winds are more common. The previous high was 1.96 million acres burned in 2018. Cal Fire began tracking the numbers in 1987.While the two mammoth Bay Area fires were largely contained after burning for three weeks, firefighters struggled to corral several other major blazes ahead of the expected winds. Evacuation orders were expanded to more mountain communities Monday as the largest blaze, the Creek Fire, churned through the Sierra National Forest in Central California.It was one of many recent major fires that has displayed terrifyingly swift movement. The fire moved 15 miles (24 kilometers) in a single day and burned 56 square miles (145.04 square kilometers).Debra Rios wasn’t home when the order came to evacuate her hometown of Auberry, just northeast of Fresno. Sheriff’s deputies went to her ranch property to pick up her 92-year-old mother, Shirley MacLean. They reunited at an evacuation center.“I hope like heck the fire doesn’t reach my little ranch,” Rios said. “It’s not looking good right now. It’s an awfully big fire.”Mountain roads saw a steady stream of cars and trucks leaving the community of about 2,300 on Monday afternoon.Firefighters working in steep terrain saved the tiny town of Shaver Lake from flames that roared down hillsides toward a marina. About 30 houses were destroyed in the remote hamlet of Big Creek, resident Toby Wait said.“About half the private homes in town burned down,” he said. “Words cannot even begin to describe the devastation of this community.”A school, church, library, historic general store and a major hydroelectric plant were spared in the community of about 200 residents, Wait told the Fresno Bee.Sheriff’s deputies went door to door to make sure residents were complying with orders to leave. Officials hoped to keep the fire from pushing west toward Yosemite National Park.The Creek Fire had charred more than 114 square miles (295 square kilometers) of timber after breaking out Friday. The nearly 1,000 firefighters on the scene had yet to get any containment. The cause had not been determined.On Saturday, National Guard rescuers in two military helicopters airlifted 214 people to safety after flames trapped them in a wooded camping area near Mammoth Pool Reservoir. Two people were seriously injured and were among 12 hospitalized.Chief Warrant Officer Joseph Rosamond, the pilot of a Chinook helicopter, said visibility was poor and winds increasingly strong during the three flights he made into the fire zone. His crew relied on night-vision goggles to search for a landing spot near a boat launch where flames came within 50 feet (15.24 meters) of the aircraft.The injured, along with women and children, took priority on the first airlift, which filled both helicopters to capacity, he said.“We started getting information about how many people were out there, how many people to expect, and that number kept growing. So we knew that it was a dire situation,” Rosamond said.Rosamond called the conditions “extreme” and said it was one of the most difficult flying missions in his 25 years as a military pilot.Record-breaking temperatures were driving the highest power use of the year, and transmission losses because of wildfires have cut into supplies. Throughout the holiday weekend, the California Independent System Operator that manages the state’s power grid warned of outages if residents didn’t reduce their electricity usage. But none had occurred by late Monday afternoon.Pacific Gas & Electric warned it might cut power starting late Monday because of the increased fire danger. Some of the state’s largest and deadliest fires in recent years have been sparked by downed power lines and other utility equipment.PG&E received criticism for its handling of planned outages last year. The utility said it has learned from past problems, “and this year will be making events smaller in size, shorter in length and smarter for customers.”In Southern California, crews scrambled to douse several fires that roared to life in searing temperatures, including one that closed mountain roads in Angeles National Forest and forced the evacuation of the historic Mount Wilson Observatory.Cal Fire said a blaze in San Bernardino County called the El Dorado Fire started Saturday morning and was caused by a smoke-generating pyrotechnic device used by a couple to reveal their baby’s gender. In eastern San Diego County, a fire destroyed at least 10 structures after burning 16 square miles (41.44 square kilometers) and prompting evacuations near the remote community of Alpine in the Cleveland National Forest.California has seen 900 wildfires since Aug. 15, many of them started by an intense series of thousands of lightning strikes in mid-August. There have been eight fire deaths and more than 3,300 structures destroyed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scorched-earth-record-2-million-acres-burned-due-to-california-wildfires/story-dGcg98KAuqEQKKG7grajQK.html
08-09-2020||World||European Union hobbled over Navalny sanctions response||European countries have threatened sanctions on Russia over the alleged nerve agent attack on opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but a concerted decision will be tough to reach given the interests at stake.Western governments are united -- at least in outrage -- over the latest in a long line of assassination attempts against critics of President Vladimir Putin.And the Navalny case also raises particular concerns as German doctors say it involved the use of the Novichok nerve agent.The EU last week condemned the use of a chemical weapon as “a serious breach of international law” and warned Moscow it may respond with “appropriate actions, including through restrictive measures”.A diplomat explained that “restrictive measures” is code for sanctions against individuals who would then be banned from travelling to the EU and would have any assets they hold in the bloc frozen.There is already a precedent for such measures: in 2019, the EU added four members of Russia’s GRU military intelligence service to its sanctions list.This followed the attack on Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who were poisoned in March 2018 in the English town of Salisbury with Novichok -- like Navalny now.But the Skripal case was different in one crucial respect: The attack took place on the soil of an EU and NATO member, whereas Navalny was poisoned in Russia.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said an “international response” is needed but has refused to speculate on what form it might take.Steven Blockmans, an expert on EU external relations law at the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies, said another key difference was that after Salisbury, British authorities soon found GRU agents had been in the UK.“In the Navalny case the forensic evidence of an involvement of Russian intelligence services is not there. The smoking gun is still missing,” he told AFP.If Russian intelligence was involved in the poisoning, that could lead to individual sanctions, Blockmans said -- but given it happened in Russia, this will be difficult to prove.Sanctions against individuals have to be legally watertight, since they can be challenged in court, and “conjecture” is not enough to justify them, Blockmans said.The mere fact that Novichok was used is not enough, even though the poison was developed by the Soviet military and is not freely available.The EU and NATO have both called for an independent international investigation into the Navalny case.“The ball has been hit back to Moscow, saying ‘show us an independent investigation, otherwise we’ll take your inaction as an admission of guilt’,” said Olivier Dorgans, a sanctions expert with the Hughes Hubbard & Reed law firm.Another possibility could be broader economic sanctions, which can be more political and require less legal justification.After the shooting down of flight MH17 in the Ukrainian conflict in 2014, the EU imposed a whole series of such measures against Russia, directed against state banks, the import and export of armaments, and the oil and gas industry. An EU diplomat noted that the bloc’s statement last week “did not explicitly mention economic sanctions but nor did it explicitly rule them out.”But Blockmans said this was unlikely, since they would need unanimous approval by all 27 member states, and some are already chafing at the impact existing measures are having on their own companies who want to do business with Moscow.“In this case, I would assume there would not be any political support from countries like Italy or Hungary because of closer economic and political relations with Russia. Cyprus might be an outlier as well,” he said.The Navalny case has also brought calls for an end to the Nord Stream 2 project, a 10 billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pipeline which is set to double Russian natural gas shipments to Germany.The project has been delayed for months after Washington moved to impose sanctions on companies involved, over fears of growing Russian influence.Germany is now facing calls to abandon it altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-hobbled-over-navalny-sanctions-response/story-er3p81eCfFONOgOyOkC7aI.html

The total infections rose 21,432, with 341 deaths.The daily tally has steadily dropped since it reached a peak of 441 last month after the government imposed unprecedented social distancing rules to blunt a second wave of outbreaks from churches and political rallies.Efforts to blunt the latest epidemic has been complicated by the strike launched on August 21 by some 16,000 intern and resident doctors against the government’s medical reform proposals.Also read: China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine candidate appears safe, slightly weaker in elderlyThe trainee doctors restarted work after agreeing to end the walkout on Monday, though many medical students continued to resist final licensing exams as part of the protest.The intern and resident doctors are the backbone of healthcare services in emergency rooms and intensive care units, and hospitals increasingly grappled with delays and disruptions amid constant growths in Covid-19 patients.Authorities are weighing whether to extend the social distancing curbs ahead of Chuseok, one of the country’s biggest holidays this month, which would see tens of millions of people travel nationwide.President Moon Jae-in said the daily numbers are expected to drop below 100 by the holiday, though health officials have urged against visits and gatherings.“Despite moderate declines in daily cases, cluster infections have increased fivefold compared to last month, and continued to emerge from various groups, including religious, medical and sport facilities as well as offices and social gatherings,” Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/striking-trainee-doctors-return-to-work-as-south-korea-fights-2nd-covid-wave/story-CVzPhAVICTVOrNzPZ3VD4L.html

08-09-2020||World||China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine candidate appears safe, slightly weaker in elderly||Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd said on Monday its coronavirus vaccine candidate appeared to be safe for older people, according to preliminary results from an early to mid-stage trial, while the immune responses triggered by the vaccine were slightly weaker than younger adults.Health officials have been concerned about whether experimental vaccines could safely protect the elderly, whose immune systems usually react less robustly to vaccines, against the virus that has led to nearly 890,000 deaths worldwide.Sinovac’s candidate CoronaVac did not cause severe side effects in a combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials launched in May involving 421 participants aged at least 60, Liu Peicheng, Sinovac’s media representative, told Reuters. The complete results have not been published and were not made available to Reuters.Four of the world’s eight vaccines that are in the third phase of trials are from China.For three groups of participants who respectively took two shots of low, medium and high-dose CoronaVac, over 90% of them experienced significant increase in antibody levels, while the levels were slightly lower than those seen in younger subjects but in line with expectation, Liu said in a statement.CoronaVac, being tested in Brazil and Indonesia in the final-stage human trials to evaluate whether it is effective and safe enough to obtain regulatory approvals for mass use, has already been given to tens of thousands of people, including about 90% of Sinovac employees and their families, as part of China’s emergency inoculation scheme to protect people facing high infection risk.The potential vaccine could remain stable for up to three years in storage, Liu said, which might offer Sinovac some advantage in vaccine distribution to regions where cold-chain storage is not an option.Such estimation is extrapolated from the fact that vaccines readings stayed within acceptable ranges for 42 days at 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), 28 days at 37C (98.6 F), and five months for 2-8C (35.6-46.4 F), Liu said, without disclosing complete data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-appears-safe-slightly-weaker-in-elderly/story-fhBycQKyz3XAKUmeTDRNFK.html
08-09-2020||World||Donald Trump hints at vaccine ‘surprise’ as Joe Biden demands transparency||President Donald Trump hinted Monday that the US could approve a coronanvirus vaccine in October, ahead of the November election, as Joe Biden demanded transparency from the government as it studies the shots.“This could’ve taken two or three years, and instead it’s going to be -- going to be done in a very short period of time,” Trump said during a news conference in which he criticized Biden for his skepticism that the FDA is operating free of political pressure.“Could even have it during the month of October,” Trump added, calling Biden’s doubts “political lies.”Many public health officials and scientists have expressed concerns that the Food and Drug Administration is under pressure from the White House to approve a vaccine before Trump faces re-election on Nov. 3. Americans may be unwilling to receive a shot if they believe it was rushed to market based on the campaign timetable.“The vaccine will be very safe and very effective,” the president said Monday. “And it’ll be delivered very soon. Now, you could -- you could have a very big surprise coming up.”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Before Trump’s news conference, Biden said he would heed the advice of scientists about whether to get a coronavirus vaccine if one were to become available before November’s presidential election.“I’d want to see what the scientists said,” he told reporters Monday outside a supporter’s home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Asked if he would trust Anthony Fauci and the Food and Drug Administration, Biden redirected, saying he’d “want full transparency on a vaccine.”Biden has previously expressed concern about President Donald Trump and political appointees pushing for the premature approval of a vaccine in hopes of boosting his re-election chances. “He’s undermining public confidence,” Biden said of Trump.Trump fired back during news conference on Monday.Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, “should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they’re talking right now, talking about endangering lives, and it undermines science.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Biden said he worries Trump’s behavior will damage public confidence if there’s an effective vaccine.“One of the problems with the way he’s playing with politics is he’s said so many things that aren’t true I’m worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it,” he said.Biden also said he’d want an effective vaccine no matter the electoral consequences.“If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I’d do it,” he said. “If it cost me the election I’d do it.

08-09-2020||World||Hundreds gather near Portland for pro-Trump rally||Hundreds of people gathered Monday afternoon in a small town south of Portland for a pro-President Donald Trump vehicle rally — just over a week after a member of a far-right group was fatally shot after a Trump caravan went through Oregon’s largest city.Later, pro-Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed at Oregon’s Capitol. Police in Salem arrested people, but it wasn’t immediately known how many.Vehicles waving flags for Trump, the QAnon conspiracy theory and in support of police gathered about noon at Clackamas Community College in Oregon City.The rally’s organizers said they would drive to toward the state capital, Salem, and most left the caravan before that. A smaller group of members of the right-wing group the Proud Boys went on to Salem, where a crowd of several dozen pro-Trump supporters had gathered.At one point Monday afternoon, the right-wing crowd rushed a smaller group of Black Lives Matters counter-demonstrators, firing paint-gun pellets at them. There were skirmishes, and the Black Lives Matter group dispersed. Shortly after, Salem Police arrived on the scene.Organizers of the earlier vehicle rally said they did not plan to enter Multnomah County, where Portland is located. Oregon City is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Portland.On Aug. 29, Aaron “Jay” Danielson, a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, was killed in Portland after a pro-Trump caravan went downtown. Trump supporters fired paint ball canisters at counter-demonstrators, who tried to block their way.Danielson’s suspected killer, Michael Forest Reinoehl, was fatally shot by police Thursday. Reinoehl was a supporter of antifa — shorthand for anti-fascists and an umbrella description for far-left-leaning militant groups.Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and have continued for more than 100 days.A fire started outside a police precinct on Portland’s north side resulted in about 15 arrests during protests Sunday night into Monday morning, police said.Demonstrators protesting police brutality began marching about 9 p.m. Sunday and stopped at the North Precinct Community Policing Center, the site of several volatile protests in recent months.Officials warned demonstrators against entering the precinct property, saying they would be trespassing and subject to arrest.Shortly after arriving, the crowd began chanting, among other things, “burn it down,” police said. Some in the group lit a mattress on fire.Most of those arrested were from Portland. Others were from San Francisco; Sacramento, California; Mesa, Arizona; and two from Vancouver, Washington.Charges included interfering with an officer, resisting arrest, reckless burning and possession of a destructive device.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-gather-near-portland-for-pro-trump-rally/story-FAt5CmYtyeitXawAfOFnuO.html
08-09-2020||World||Trump says Harris will never be prez, slams Democrats’ ‘anti-vaccine rhetoric’||US president Donald Trump has slammed the “rhetoric” against the coronavirus vaccine by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Senator Kamala Harris, who he said would “never” be the president. Trump was apparently responding to a CNN interview by Harris on Sunday, in which the vice-presidential nominee said she would not trust the president unless there was a credible source of information that talks about the vaccine’s efficacy and reliability. “She (Harris) is talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement,” Trump said at a Labor Day press conference at the White House on Monday.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine may be ready by October, says Donald Trump “I don’t want the achievement for myself. I want something (that’s) going to make people better, that people aren’t going to get sick with,” he said. “That includes therapeutics, where we’re doing equally as well.” The president asserted that a coronavirus vaccine would be available in a record time, maybe by the end of the year and even before the November 3 presidential election. This, he said, had unnerved his political opponents. Biden and Harris “should immediately apologise for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives,” Trump said. “Numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good. So now they’ll say, ‘wow Trump’s pulled this off. OK, let’s disparage the vaccine’. That’s so bad for this country. That’s so bad for the world to even say that. That’s what they’re saying,” he said.Also read: Biden and Trump go on the offensive as US campaign enters final stretch In response to a question, Trump said: “I watched Kamala’s whole numbers drop from 15 to almost zero (during the Democratic primary) and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa (primary elections) because people didn’t like it. And I understand why she will never be president,” Trump said. “Although I have to be careful because Obama used to say that about Michelle.... But you have to look at her (Harris) a little bit more closely because obviously Joe is not doing well. So, you’re gonna have to look at her a little bit too closely,” he said. Trump asserted that the vaccine -- which could have normally taken two-three years -- would be in the market before the end of the year. “(We) could even have it during the month of October. Contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-kamala-harris-will-never-be-president-slams-democrats-anti-covid-vaccine-rhetoric/story-r9kIfNpOnI7gX6BUxHOpBM.html
08-09-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine may be ready by October, says Donald Trump||The prospect of a vaccine to shield Americans from coronavirus infection emerged Monday as a point of contention in the White House race as president Donald Trump accused Democrats of “disparaging” for political gain a vaccine he repeatedly has said could be available before the election.“It’s so dangerous for our country, what they say, but the vaccine will be very safe and very effective,” the president pledged at a White House news conference.Trump leveled the accusation a day after Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate, said she “would not trust his word” on getting the vaccine. “I would trust the word of public health experts and scientists, but not Donald Trump,” Harris said.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden amplified Harris’ comments Monday after he was asked if he would get a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Biden said he’d take a vaccine “tomorrow”want to see what the scientists have to say, too.Biden said Trump has said “so many things that aren’t true, I’m worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. So he’s undermining public confidence.”Still, the former vice president said, “If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I’d do it, if it would cost me the election I’d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.”The back-and-forth over a coronavirus vaccine played out as three of the candidates fanned out across the country on Labor Day, the traditional start of the two-month sprint to the election. Harris and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin and Biden went to Pennsylvania. Trump added the news conference to a schedule that originally was blank.Harris, a California Democrat, said in a CNN interview broadcast Sunday that she would not trust a coronavirus vaccine if one were ready at the end of the year because “there’s very little that we can trust that ... comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth.” She argued that scientists would be “muzzled” because Trump is focused on getting reelected.Trump dismissed her comments as “reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric” designed to detract from the effort to quickly ready a vaccine for a disease that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans and infected more than 6 million others, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.“She’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement,” Trump said, answering reporters’ questions as he stood at a lectern placed at the front door of the White House on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the mansion.“They’ll say anything,” he said.Trump insisted he hasn’t said a vaccine could be ready before November, although he said so repeatedly and as recently as Friday.The president then proceeded to say what he had just denied ever saying.“What I said is by the end of the year, but I think it could even be sooner that that,” he said about a vaccine. “It could be during the month of October, actually could be before November.”Under a program Trump calls “Operation Warp Speed,” the goal is to have 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine in stock by January. He has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on what amounts to a huge gamble since vaccine development usually takes years.Concerns exist about political influence over development of a vaccine, and whether one produced under this process will be safe and effective.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CNN last week that it is unlikely but “not impossible” that a vaccine could win approval in October, instead of November or December.Fauci added that he’s “pretty sure” a vaccine would not be approved for Americans unless it was both safe and effective.Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has said the agency would not cut corners as it evaluates vaccines, but would aim to expedite its work. He told the Financial Times last week that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, meanwhile, has given assurances that Trump “will not in any way sacrifice safety” when it comes to a vaccine. And executives of five top pharmaceutical companies pledged that no COVID-19 vaccines or treatments will be approved, even for emergency use, without proof they are safe and effective.Some concerns were sparked by a letter dated Aug. 27 in which Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked governors to help government contractor McKesson Corp. make sure vaccine distribution facilities are up and running by Nov. 1.Redfield did not say a vaccine would be ready by then.Three COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing final-stage, or Phase 3, clinical trials in the U.S. Each study is enrolling about 30,000 people who will get two shots, three weeks apart, and then will be monitored for coronavirus infections and side effects for anywhere from a week to two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-may-be-ready-by-october-says-donald-trump/story-JaXo4Bibr5zrfMrFrnNL4N.html

08-09-2020||World||Iran constructing new building near nuke site: Report||Iran said Tuesday it is building a sophisticated new building near its underground Natanz nuclear site, state TV reported.The report quoted Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the country’s nuclear department, as saying the new structure is being built in the wake of a July explosion that damaged a building that housed centrifuge machines.“Regarding the evil action and sabotage that was carried out, it has been decided to establish a more modern, vaster and inclusive (building) to be constructed in the heart of the mountains around Natanz,” Salehi was quoted as saying.Last month, Iran said it found those who were involved in the alleged sabotage but said details will be released later.Natanz hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. In its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium.Salehi said construction of the new building “has already begun.”Iran has said its nuclear site had not been operating at full capacity due to restrictions imposed by Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran began experimenting with advanced centrifuge models after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the deal two years ago.Iran has long maintained its atomic program is for peaceful purposes.The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran enriches uranium to about 4.5% purity — above the terms of the nuclear deal but far below weapons-grade levels of 90%. Workers there also have conducted tests on advanced centrifuges, according to the IAEA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-constructing-new-building-near-nuke-site-report/story-e5gIRYe6AU5FZE5UxdWYSP.html
