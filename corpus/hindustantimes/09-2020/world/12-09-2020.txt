Also read: Donald Trump looks west, eyeing new paths to White HouseTrump, who has admitted playing down the severity of the virus since it emerged early this presidential election year, said on Thursday he believed the United States was “rounding the corner” on the crisis.“I have to disagree with that, because, if you look at the thing that you just mentioned, the statistics ... they are disturbing,” Fauci said on MSNBC.Fauci said he hoped the country did not see a spike in cases after the Labor Day weekend as it did after other long holiday weekends since May. It was important to get those infection rates down before the autumn and winter seasons when people will be spending more time indoors. “You don’t want to start off already with a baseline that’s so high,” Fauci said.Asked about the outdoor campaign rallies Trump has resumed before his Nov. 3 matchup against Democrat Joe Biden, Fauci said they are “absolutely” risky.Also read: Will take Covid-19 vaccine on your show: Ivanka accepts TV host’s challenge“Just because you’re outdoors does not mean that you’re protected, particularly if you’re in a crowd and you’re not wearing masks,” he said.Fauci, who has contradicted Trump’s statements about the virus, denies the administration is pressuring him to keep quiet.“Anybody that tries to tell me what to say publicly, if they know anything about me, realizes that’s a fool’s errand,” Fauci said. “No one is ever going to pressure me or muzzle me to say anything publicly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-disagrees-with-trump-on-coronavirus-cites-disturbing-us-statistics/story-zxr2kgJUixPHi552C2xCDK.html
12-09-2020||World||Donald Trump looks west, eyeing new paths to White House||Pushing for new roads to reelection, President Donald Trump is going on the offense this weekend in Nevada, which hasn’t supported a Republican presidential candidate since 2004.Trump is confronting local authorities by holding public events Saturday and Sunday after state officials blocked his initial plans for rallies in Reno and Las Vegas because they would have violated coronavirus health guidelines. It’s the kind of political fight that Trump’s team relishes and underscores the growing importance of Nevada in Trump’s quest for 270 electoral votes as the race against Democrat Joe Biden looks tight in a number of pivotal states.Trump narrowly lost Nevada in 2016 to Hillary Clinton, and the state has trended further toward the Democrats in the past decade. But Trump’s campaign has invested heavily in the state, relying on its ground game to turn out voters. Democrats, by contrast, have largely relied on virtual campaign efforts during the pandemic, save for the casino workers’ Culinary Union, which has sent workers door to door.“The Democrats are scared. They know President Trump has the momentum,” said the state GOP chairman, Michael McDonald.Both candidates have spent about $4.5 million in Nevada, while Trump has made $5.5 million in future reservations in the state and Biden has allocated $2.5 million, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.The Trump team originally planned rallies at airport hangars in Reno and Las Vegas, but those were scuttled by state officials due to concerns the campaign would not abide by Covid-19 restrictions. State Republicans blamed Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak for trying to hurt the president’s reelection chances. Sisolak has limited in-person gatherings indoors and outdoors to 50 people since May, a recommendation based on White House reopening guidelines.Instead, Trump scheduled an event in Minden, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Reno, on Saturday night. He planned to host a “Latinos for Trump” roundtable Sunday morning in Las Vegas, followed by an evening rally at a manufacturing facility in neighboring Henderson.Privately, the Trump campaign welcomed the fight, believing it highlighted a reelection theme: Trump’s insistence that the nation has turned the corner on the pandemic, while Democrats, including Biden and governors, are hurting the nation’s economy and psyche with stringent restrictions. The pandemic, which has killed more than 190,000 Americans, still claims 1,000 lives a day.“The fact that Donald Trump is even considering holding these unsafe events in the midst of a global pandemic is just the latest example of his poor judgment and complete disregard for Nevadans’ public health and safety,” said Madison Mundy of the state Democratic Party.The White House announced Saturday that Trump will visit California on Monday to receive a briefing on the devastating wildfires racing through the region. He has largely been silent on the blazes, which Oregon’s emergency management director said was a possible “mass fatality event.”Some Democrats fear a possible Trump momentum gain in Nevada, with the president showing increasing support from Latinos and noncollege educated white voters, two important constituencies in the state.The tightening race in a number of the most contested states has led to a renewed effort for Trump to expand his electoral map.The campaign has lavished attention on three Great Lakes states that flipped his way narrowly in 2016. Several polls earlier this summer suggested Trump may be in trouble, but a handful in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin following the nominating conventions showed a close race.Polling in North Carolina and Florida also shows a competitive race, and there is increasing concern within the Trump campaign about Arizona. Once considered fairly safely in Trump’s column, Arizona has been ravaged by the coronavirus and the Trump team has grown worried about a slip in support among the state’s older residents.The president on Monday planned to return to Arizona, which he has visited multiple times since he resumed traveling during the pandemic.If Arizona slips away, Trump campaign officials privately acknowledge that it would complicate his path to 270 electoral votes. If he loses Arizona, winning Wisconsin — the most likely Midwest state for Trump to retain — would not be enough even if he keeps Florida and North Carolina. It would require him to win somewhere else, which has led to a renewed focus on Minnesota, New Hampshire and the at-large congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine.Nevada has become a particular focus, in part because Las Vegas is an appetizing location for Trump to raise money. He scheduled at least one high-dollar fundraiser there over the weekend — as well as one in Washington before he flies west — as he looks to assuage growing concerns that he could fall short of cash. Couples were asked for $150,000 for the Las Vegas fundraiser.The Republican National Committee said the $18 million expected to be raised over the weekend, including from an appearance Saturday at his hotel in Washington, would be shared by Trump’s campaign, the committee and several state GOP committees.Trump and Republicans raised $210 million in August, a robust sum but far behind the record $364.5 million taken in by Biden and his party that month. Though the Trump campaign has insisted that it has more resources on hand than it did at this time in 2016, whispers about a financial disadvantage led Trump himself this past week to suggest he may put some of his own fortune into the race.Nevada’s financial health is dependent on the national economy doing well because the state draws so much revenue from tourism. When the pandemic hit, Nevada’s casinos and all gambling shuttered for about 11 weeks, and the state is trimming about one-quarter of its budget at a time of sky-high unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-looks-west-eyeing-new-paths-to-white-house/story-xjR6dHuDgLcFXQ3239cvbK.html
12-09-2020||World||Iran executes man whose case drew international attention||Iranian state TV on Saturday reported that the country’s authorities executed a wrestler for allegedly murdering a man, after President Donald Trump asked for the 27-year-old condemned man’s life to be spared.State TV quoted the chief justice of Fars province, Kazem Mousavi, as saying: “The retaliation sentence against Navid Afkari, the killer of Hassan Torkaman, was carried out this morning in Adelabad prison in Shiraz.”Afkari’s case had drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrayed him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran’s Shiite theocracy in 2018. Authorities accused Afkari of stabbing a water supply company employee in the southern city of Shiraz amid the unrest.Iran broadcast the wrestler’s televised confession last week. The segment resembled hundreds of other suspected coerced confessions aired over the last decade in the Islamic Republic.The International Olympic Committee in a statement Saturday said it was shocked and saddened by the news of the wrestler’s execution, and that the committee’s president, Thomas Bach, “had made direct personal appeals to the Supreme Leader and to the President of Iran this week and asked for mercy for Navid Afkari.”The case revived a demand inside the country for Iran to stop carrying out the death penalty. Even imprisoned Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, herself nearly a month into a hunger strike over conditions at Tehran’s Evin prison amid the coronavirus pandemic, passed word that she supported Afkari.Last week, Trump tweeted out his own concern about Afkari’s case.“To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him,” Trump wrote. “Thank you!”Iran responded to Trump’s tweet with a nearly 11-minute state TV package on Afkari. It included the weeping parents of the slain water company employee. The package included footage of Afkari on the back of a motorbike, saying he had stabbed the employee in the back, without explaining why he allegedly carried out the assault.The state TV segment showed blurred police documents and described the killing as a “personal dispute,” without elaborating. It said Afkari’s cellphone had been in the area and it showed surveillance footage of him walking down a street, talking on his phone.Last week, Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency dismissed Trump’s tweet in a feature story, saying that American sanctions have hurt Iranian hospitals amid the pandemic.“Trump is worried about the life of a murderer while he puts many Iranian patients’ lives in danger by imposing severe sanctions,” the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-executes-man-whose-case-drew-international-attention/story-bgRm4JbAwOH8cHbFnkFftM.html
12-09-2020||World||Antarctica is still free of Covid-19. Can it stay that way?||At this very moment a vast world exists that’s free of the coronavirus, where people can mingle without masks and watch the pandemic unfold from thousands of miles away.That world is Antarctica, the only continent without Covid-19. Now, as nearly 1,000 scientists and others who wintered over on the ice are seeing the sun for the first time in weeks or months, a global effort wants to make sure incoming colleagues don’t bring the virus with them.From the U.K.’s Rothera Research Station off the Antarctic peninsula that curls toward the tip of South America, field guide Rob Taylor described what it’s like in “our safe little bubble.”In pre-coronavirus days, long-term isolation, self-reliance and psychological strain were the norm for Antarctic teams while the rest of the world saw their life as fascinatingly extreme.How times have changed.“In general, the freedoms afforded to us are more extensive than those in the UK at the height of lockdown,” said Taylor, who arrived in October and has missed the pandemic entirely. “We can ski, socialize normally, run, use the gym, all within reason.”Like teams across Antarctica, including at the South Pole, Taylor and his 26 colleagues must be proficient in all sorts of tasks in a remote, communal environment with little room for error. They take turns cooking, make weather observations and “do a lot of sewing,” he said.Good internet connections mean they’ve watched closely as the pandemic circled the rest of the planet. Until this year, conversations with incoming colleagues focused on preparing the newcomers. Now the advice goes both ways.“I’m sure there’s a lot they can tell us that will help us adapt to the new way of things,” Taylor said. “We haven’t had any practice at social distancing yet!”At New Zealand’s Scott Base, rounds of mini-golf and a filmmaking competition with other Antarctic bases have been highlights of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, which ended for the Scott team when they spotted the sun last Friday. It had been away since April.“I think there’s a little bit of dissociation,” Rory O’Connor, a doctor and the team’s winter leader, said of watching the pandemic from afar. “You acknowledge it cerebrally, but I don’t think we have fully factored in the emotional turmoil it must be causing.”His family in the UK still wouldn’t trade places with him. “They can’t understand why I came down here,” he joked. “Months of darkness. Stuck inside with a small group of people. Where’s the joy in that?”O’Connor said they will be able to test for the virus once colleagues start arriving as soon as Monday, weeks late because a huge storm dumped 20-feet (6-meter) snowdrifts. Any virus case will spark a “red response level,” he said, with activities stripped down to providing heating, water, power and food.While Covid-19 has rattled some diplomatic ties, the 30 countries that make up the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs teamed up early to keep the virus out. Officials cited unique teamwork among the United States, China, Russia and others.As a frightened world was locking down in March, the Antarctic programs agreed the pandemic could become a major disaster. With the world’s strongest winds and coldest temperatures, the continent roughly the size of the United States and Mexico is already dangerous for workers at 40 year-round bases.“A highly infectious novel virus with significant mortality and morbidity in the extreme and austere environment of Antarctica with limited sophistication of medical care and public health responses is High Risk with potential catastrophic consequences,” according to a COMNAP document seen by The Associated Press.Since Antarctica can only be reached through a few air gateways or via ship, “the attempt to prevent the virus from reaching the continent should be undertaken IMMEDIATELY,” it said.No more contact with tourists, COMNAP warned. “No cruise ships should be disembarking.” And for Antarctic teams located near each other, “mutual visits and social events between stations/facilities should be ceased.”Antarctic workers have long been trained in hand-washing and “sneeze etiquette,” but COMNAP slipped in that reminder, adding, “Don’t touch your face.”In those hurried weeks of final flights, the US “thankfully” augmented medical and other supplies for winter and beyond, said Stephanie Short, head of logistics for the US Antarctic program.“We re-planned an entire research season in a matter of weeks, facing the highest level of uncertainty I’ve seen in my 25-year government career,” she said.Antarctic bases soon slipped into months of isolation known as winter. Now, with the glimmer of spring, the next big test has begun.Everyone is sending fewer people to the ice for the summer, COMNAP executive secretary Michelle Finnemore said.In the gateway city of Christchurch, New Zealand, Operation Deep Freeze is preparing to airlift some 120 people to the largest US station, McMurdo. To limit contact between Antarctic workers and flight crew, the plane contains a separate toilet mounted on a pallet.The Americans’ bubble began before leaving the US in early August and continues until they reach the ice. They’ve been isolated in hotel rooms well beyond New Zealand’s 14-day quarantine. Bad weather has delayed their departure for weeks. It’s now planned for Monday.“We’re trying to do a really good job keeping up their spirits,” said Anthony German, the US Antarctic program’s chief liaison there.The US is sending a third of its usual summer staff. Research will be affected, though investment in robotics and instrumentation that can transmit data from the field will help greatly, said Alexandra Isern, head of Antarctic sciences for the US program with the National Science Foundation.The Covid-19 disruptions are causing some sadness, she said. “In some cases, we’re going to have to have contingents digging instruments out of the snow to make sure we can still find it.”Like other countries, New Zealand will prioritize long-term data sets, some begun in the 1950s, which measure climate, ozone levels, seismic activity and more, said Sarah Williamson, chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand. It’s sending 100 people to the ice instead of 350, she said.Some programs are deferring Antarctic operations to next year or even 2022, said Nish Devanunthan, South Africa’s director of Antarctic support.“I think the biggest concern for every country is to be the one that is fingered for bringing the virus,” he said. “Everyone is safeguarding against that.”Precautions extend to the gateway cities — Cape Town, Christchurch, Hobart in Australia, Punta Arenas in Chile and Ushuaia in Argentina. Each has quarantine and testing protocols for workers boarding planes or ships heading south.Antarctica always has its challenges, Devanunthan said, but when it comes to Covid-19 and the international community as a whole, “I would say this is on the top of the list.”A few weeks ago at McMurdo Station, workers carried out a drill to simulate what the rest of the world knows too well: mask-wearing and social distancing. “It will be difficult not to run up and hug friends” once they arrive, station manager Erin Heard said.He and the others will start wearing masks two days before the newcomers fly in, he said, “to help us get muscle memory.” For the masks, the team plundered McMurdo’s craft room, stocked with fabric, and found designs online.As colleagues arrive, Heard will leave Antarctica. He once might have planned to thaw out on a beach. Now he’s weighing the new normal.“Do I ask a friend to pick me up? I don’t know if I’m comfortable doing that,” he said as he imagined stepping off the plane. “It will be super weird, to be honest, to be coming from what feels like another planet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antarctica-is-still-free-of-covid-19-can-it-stay-that-way/story-TykiAzBxuGwDg7PZOlB7UN.html
12-09-2020||World||Oxford, AstraZeneca to resume coronavirus vaccine trial: Why it matters||Oxford University — one of the leading Covid-19 vaccine developers in the global race — resumed its trial for testing the drug it is developing with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca on Saturday. The resumption in proving the drug’s efficacy comes two days after it had to stop the trial after a UK volunteer reportedly fell ill.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the restart, saying in a tweet that it was “good news for everyone” that the trial is “back up and running.”The pausing of trial triggered concerns across the globe as several countries have pinned their hopes to defeat the pandemic by developing vaccines which can prove to be a cure for the outbreak which has infected 28,551,911 people and claimed 916,715 lives so far, according to John Hopkins university. Why it matters?The vaccine being developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca is widely perceived to be one of the strongest contenders among the dozens of coronavirus vaccines in various stages of testing around the world. It is also one of the nine candidates around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials.Additionally experts believe Oxford prioritised safety protocol by pausing the trial in case of reported side-effects, showcasing responsible decision-making in such critical times. Dr. Charlotte Summers, a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the pause was a sign that the Oxford team was putting safety issues first, but that it led to “much unhelpful speculation.”“To tackle the global Covid-19 pandemic, we need to develop vaccines and therapies that people feel comfortable using, therefore it is vital to maintain public trust that we stick to the evidence and do not draw conclusions before information is available,” Summers was quoted as saying by news agency Associated Press. Is a pause in developing vaccines normal?Pauses in drug trials are commonplace and indicate careful progression by assessing possible side-effects of a drug-in-making. Global organization WHO and scientists have asked to keep expectations to a minimum, stating that vaccine trials are rarely straightforward and can take a tediously long time to be developed. The Oxford-AstraZeneca study had been previously stopped in July for several days after a participant developed neurological symptoms that turned out to be an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis that researchers said was unrelated to the vaccine.In case of this trial, the university maintains that in large trials such as this “it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety.”How many people are included in testing this Covid-19 vaccine?Globally some 18,000 people have received its vaccine so far in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. Around 30,000 volunteers are being recruited in the US.By when is Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine expected?After the pause, AstraZeneca had said it remained hopeful that the vaccine could still be available “by the end of this year, early next year”, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-to-resume-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-why-it-matters/story-Xs8qlLLyiCZjfe9jxAuEoM.html
12-09-2020||World||Liberia declares rape a national emergency||Liberian President George Weah has declared rape a national emergency and has ordered new measures to tackle the problem after a recent spike of cases in the poor West African state.The moves comes after thousands of Liberians protested rising incidents of rape in the capital Monrovia last month, in a bid to draw attention to the country’s alarming rate of sexual assault.Late on Friday, Weah said he would install a special prosecutor for rape in Liberia, as well as set up a national sex offender registry, a statement from his office said.The government will also establish a so-called “national security task force” on sexual- and gender-based violence.The high rates of rape in impoverished Liberia, forced to contend both with war and the Ebola virus in recent years, has been a longstanding concern.A UN report in 2016 recorded 803 rape cases the previous year in the country of 4.5 million, and found that only two percent of sexual violence cases led to a conviction, for example.It was the resulting sense of impunity and the legacy of the 14-year civil war between 1989 and 2003, when rape was commonplace, that had created the current problem, it said.Incidents of rape appear to have risen sharply this year, however.Margaret Taylor, the director of Liberia’s Women Empowerment Network, told AFP last month that her NGO had recorded 600 cases of rape between June and August, for example.That was up from between 80 and a hundred cases in May, she said.Weah’s announcement of a national rape emergency follows a conference in the capital Monrovia on tackling sexual violence on Wednesday. Addressing the meeting, the footballer-turned-president said Liberia was “witnessing what is actually an epidemic of rape within the pandemic, affecting mostly children and young girls across the country.”Weah’s office said in the statement on Friday that further anti-rape measures will be announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liberia-declares-rape-a-national-emergency/story-jaSLBb6zmy6SRb309tVDUP.html
12-09-2020||World||UK: Indian-origin man guilty of estranged partner’s murder||A 23-year-old man who arrived from India as a partner for a woman in the east Midlands town of Leicester and later fell out with her and stabbed her to death in March, has been found guilty, awaiting sentence in the Leicester Crown Court on September 16.The Leicestershire police said on Friday that Jigukumar Sorthi had stopped a policeman in the street and made comments implicating himself in the March attack on his estranged partner, Bhavini Pravin, 21, in the latter’s home.At around 12.30pm on March 2, the police said Sorthi went to her address to speak to Pravin. They talked for a few minutes before Sorthi stabbed her multiple times and soon left the property. A post-mortem examination concluded Pravin died of multiple stab wounds.Detective inspector Kenny Henry said, “This was a vicious attack on a defenceless young woman. Bhavini Pravin was 21 years old with her whole life ahead of her; instead it has been cruelly taken away by an act so brutal it doesn’t bear thinking about.”Her father, Pravin Babu, released a statement on behalf of the family after Sorthi’s conviction, “Our daughter was only 21 years old when she was murdered… When our Bhavini was born, we felt that all of our prayers had been answered. She was the ‘Laxmi’ of our family.“Growing up, she gave us so much joy and purpose. She was our inspiration to better ourselves and to build a future. Soon after, our two sons, Krutesh and Yagnesh, were born. Even from a young age, Bhavini doted on her little brothers. We decided to move to England so that we could give our children a better future.“As parents, our aspirations were that our daughter would get a good education, pursue her childhood career choice of nursing, marry the man of her dreams, have a family and live happily ever after.“When Jigu (Sorthi) became engaged to our daughter, we trusted him to cherish, love and look after her forever. She was so precious to us. We showed Jigu nothing but love and acceptance. We brought him to England to give him a better life. We supported him, housed him. And how did Jigu return our kindness - he repaid us by killing our beloved Bhavini.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-indian-origin-man-guilty-of-estranged-partner-s-murder/story-DmR99hfhDwUZ1MuCkwOlvL.html
12-09-2020||World||Seize the opportunity, says UK on Afghan-Taliban peace talks||The Boris Johnson government on Saturday called on Afghan and Taliban participants in the peace talks in Doha to seize the opportunity to end decades of conflict in Afghanistan, hoping for a quick ceasefire in the war-ravaged country.Describing the UK’s military and diplomatic efforts as “critical” in supporting Afghanistan over the past 19 years, officials said British aid expertise had helped millions of children go to school and provided life-saving food to those in need.UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said, “Today is a moment that I hope leads to real, positive change in Afghanistan. All sides need to seize this opportunity to work towards an inclusive and sustainable peace. A comprehensive ceasefire should be agreed quickly for the sake of the Afghan people who have suffered for too long.”The UK, as the third-largest troop contributor to the Nato mission, has most recently supported the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces with training, mentoring and financial assistance.Over the last three years, the UK has pledged up to £750 million in humanitarian and development support, besides a recent aid package to tackle the combined threat from the pandemic and famine in developing countries.Part of this funding will help Afghans - who have faced shortages because of conflict, drought and the economic impact of the coronavirus - have enough money to be able to buy food for their families, officials said.Britain’s contribution to the international mission in Afghanistan began in 2001 to prevent terrorist groups using Afghanistan as a safe haven to launch terror attacks. The UK’s combat mission ended in 2014.Since then, the UK has been working in partnership with Nato allies to support Afghanistan’s security, development and governance, which officials said has been crucial to tackle threats to the UK, including from organised crime, drugs and international terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seize-the-opportunity-says-uk-on-afghan-taliban-peace-talks/story-r4SS1iAspqnodXfLgJLpyK.html
12-09-2020||World||Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine AstraZeneca trial resumes after UK green light||Pharma giant AstraZeneca on Saturday said it had resumed a Covid-19 vaccine trial after getting the all-clear from British regulators, following a pause caused by a UK volunteer falling ill.“Clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, have resumed in the UK following confirmation by the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to do so,” the company said in a statement.ALSO WATCH | Delhi airport first in India to get Covid test lab; how it’ll work: ExplainedAstraZeneca announced on Wednesday it had “voluntarily paused” its trial of the vaccine developed alongside Oxford University after the volunteer developed an unexplained illness.An independent committee was drafted in to review safety, in what the company and the World Health Organization described as a routine step. The committee “has concluded its investigations and recommended to the MHRA that trials in the UK are safe to resume”, AstraZeneca said.AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is one of nine around the world currently in late-stage Phase 3 human trials.In the United States, the company began enrolling 30,000 volunteers across dozens of sites on August 31, and the inoculation is being tested on smaller groups in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. The AZD1222 vaccine uses a weakened version of a common cold-causing adenovirus engineered to code for the spike protein that the Covid-19 coronavirus uses to invade cells.After vaccination, this protein is produced inside the human body, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if the person is later infected.“AstraZeneca is committed to the safety of trial participants and the highest standards of conduct in clinical trials,” Saturday’s statement read.“The company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-resumes-covid-19-vaccine-trial-after-uk-green-light/story-no6Y9g18CWsQalOSLY0nMI.html
12-09-2020||World||Expect US election to have consequences for troops overseas||President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden both say they want to pull U.S. forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan. But their approaches differ, and the outcome of the November 3 election will have long-term consequences not only for US troops, but for the wider region.During his election campaign four years ago, Trump pledged to bring all troops home from “endless wars,” at times triggering pushback from military commanders, defense leaders and even Republican lawmakers worried about abruptly abandoning partners on the ground. In recent months he has only increased the pressure, working to fulfill that promise and get forces home before Election Day.More broadly, Trump’s ‘America First’ mantra has buoyed voters weary of war and frustrated with the billions of dollars spent on national defense at the expense of domestic needs. But it has also alienated longtime European partners whose forces have fought alongside the United States, and has bruised America’s reputation as a loyal ally.Biden has been more adamant about restoring US relations with allies and NATO, and his stance on these wars is more measured. He says troops must be withdrawn responsibly and that a residual force presence will be needed in Afghanistan to ensure terrorist groups can’t rebuild and attack America again. That approach, however, angers progressives and others who believe the US has spent too much time, money and blood on battlefields far from home.“We’re getting out of the endless wars,” Trump told White House reporters recently. He said the “top people in the Pentagon” probably don’t love him because “they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.”He continued: “Let’s bring our soldiers back home. Some people don’t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.”Biden, the former vice president, has sounded less absolute about troop withdrawal. In response to a candidate questionnaire from the Center for Foreign Relations, he said some troops could stay in Afghanistan to focus on the counterterrorism mission.“Americans are rightly weary of our longest war; I am, too. But we must end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back,” he said.While both talk about troops withdrawals, each has, in some ways, tried and failed.Trump came into office condemning the wars and declaring he would bring all troops home. When he took over, the number of forces in Afghanistan had been capped at about 8,400 for some time by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. But within a year that total climbed to about 15,000, as Trump approved commanders’ requests for additional troops to reverse setbacks in the training of Afghan forces, fight an increasingly dangerous Islamic State group and put enough pressure on the Taliban to force it to the peace table.Biden was part of the Obama administration’s failed effort to negotiate an agreement with Iraqi leaders in 2011, and as a result the US pulled all American forces out of that country. That withdrawal was short-lived. Just three years later, as IS militants took over large swaths of Iraq, the US again deployed troops into Iraq and neighboring Syria to defeat IS.With an eye toward the election, Trump has accelerated his push to bring troops home. Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US military commander for the Middle East, said in recent days that by November, the number of troops in Afghanistan could drop to 4,500, and the number in Iraq could dip from about 5,000 to 3,000.John Glaser, foreign policy director at the Cato Institute, is skeptical of both candidates. He said Biden, if elected, will struggle with pressure to pull troops out, but will be drawn to getting things back to normal, “which means being there for allies, reupping our commitment to NATO.”Glaser said he believes Trump really wants to pull troops out, but is driven by his electoral self-interest. “He wants to get out but he doesn’t know how to do so in a way that doesn’t feel like tucking tail and running.”He added that if Trump is reelected, “I’m a little nervous that he will lose a little electoral incentive. If there aren’t votes to be against I frankly don’t know what he will do. He could slip into another conflict, given his belligerence on any given issue.”McKenzie and other military leaders, however, have consistently argued that conditions on the ground and the activities of the enemy must dictate troop levels. They suggest that the US must keep troops in the region to ensure enemies don’t regain a foothold.Michele Flournoy, a former top Pentagon leader who is often mentioned as a potential defense chief in a Biden administration, warned against any “precipitous” withdrawal from Afghanistan that could jeopardize peace. In remarks to the Aspen Security forum, she said that while the US doesn’t want to be in Afghanistan forever, a counterterrorism force should remain until a peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government is solidified.Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, said Trump will provide more money for the military while the Democrats probably will try to cut the defense budget. But he also echoed troop withdrawal concerns, reflecting a broader reluctance on the committee to abandon Afghanistan while the Taliban continue to launch attacks and a stubborn IS insurgency threatens to take hold.“Everybody wants to be able to bring troops home from Afghanistan and elsewhere. I think the differences are largely about whether you only do it when certain conditions are met or whether you withdraw anyway and hope for the best,” said Thornberry. “Really what I’m thinking of is the way President Obama withdrew from Iraq. ... We withdrew and kind of said ‘Good luck.’ Obviously, things did not go so well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expect-us-election-to-have-consequences-for-troops-overseas/story-LKOO14o7GsGeFSm7Iipp3K.html
12-09-2020||World||US signs defence cooperation deal with Maldives amid China’s growing presence in Indian Ocean||The US has signed a framework for defence cooperation with the Maldives to deepen engagement in support of maintaining peace and security in the strategic Indian Ocean, the Pentagon has announced, as the Trump administration looks for strengthening alliances in the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s growing presence in the region.The framework for defence and security relationship was signed in Philadelphia on September 10 between Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia Reed Werner and Maldivian Minister of Defence Mariya Didi. .“The framework sets forth both countries’ intent to deepen engagement and cooperation in support of maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean, and marks an important step forward in the defence partnership,” the Pentagon said.The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region of Earth’s seas, comprising the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean.During discussions after signing the agreement, Mariya said the framework will strengthen defence and security cooperation between the two countries, Maldivian portal Sun Online reported.Mariya said that peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean region is tied to the best interests of both countries.She stressed the importance of bilateral dialogue and engagement, against a backdrop of growing transnational threats such as piracy, violent extremism, terrorism, and illicit trade, which she said remained relevant, even amidst the coronavirus pandemic.According to a statement released by the Defence Ministry, the framework outlines a number of bilateral activities, including senior-level dialogues, discussions, engagements, and opportunities in areas such as maritime domain awareness, natural disasters, and humanitarian relief operations, the report said.Mariya said that the Maldivian government sees the framework as an “important milestone” in defence and security cooperation between the Maldives and the US.Werner and Didi also discussed US support for the island nation in its response to Covid-19 and areas for future cooperation, and agreed to work toward scheduling the first Defense and Security Dialogue, the Pentagon said.Both sides reiterated their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that promotes the security and prosperity of all nations in the region, the Pentagon said. The Central Indo-Pacific includes the numerous seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans. The resource-rich Indo-Pacific region is where China has been trying to spread its influence. The US has also been pushing for a broader role by India in the strategically important region. China is eyeing to expand its influence in the Indian Ocean region. China has already taken control of Pakistan’s strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and with Japan in the East China Sea. Both the areas are said to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have overlapping claims in the waterway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-signs-defence-cooperation-deal-with-maldives-amid-china-s-growing-presence-in-indian-ocean/story-ZCktvP7yDQRLLNWPMU06QJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Istanbul introduces limits to gatherings as coronavirus spreads||The governor of Istanbul has banned boating companies from hosting weddings and similar gatherings as part of new measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 in Turkey’s most populous city.The governor’s office also reintroduced a ban on concerts and festivals in open spaces. A statement from the office late Friday said the restrictions were needed because people were not adequately heeding precautions like physical distancing and confirmed virus cases have increased.The bans were to go into effect on Saturday but were postponed until Monday.Coronavirus infections and deaths began increasing in Turkey after the government loosened restrictions on public activity in June, returning to levels last seen in mid-May.On Friday, the Health Ministry announced 56 more deaths and 1,671 new cases, bringing the country’s total death toll in the pandemic to 6,951 and cases to nearly 290,000.Officials have cited engagement parties and weddings as a key source for new infections and introduced restrictions on social gatherings. Some turned to holding celebrations on party boats that cruise Istanbul’s scenic Bosporus strait, which bisects the city of about 16 million.On Saturday, Turkish soccer team Besiktas announced that technical director Sergen Yalcin had tested positive for the coronavirus during a check ahead of the club’s next match.Besiktas is one of the top soccer teams in Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/istanbul-introduces-limits-to-gatherings-as-coronavirus-spreads/story-lvERK5KoPkyGboJKiCOyeJ.html
12-09-2020||World||US hospitals turn down remdesivir, limit use to sickest Covid-19 patients||US hospitals have turned down about a third of their allocated supplies of the Covid-19 drug remdesivir since July as need for the costly antiviral wanes, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed on Friday.Some hospitals said they are still buying the Gilead Sciences medicine to build inventory in case the pandemic accelerates over the winter. But they said current supplies are adequate, in part because they are limiting use to severely ill patients.The Food and Drug Administration has allowed more liberal remdesivir use, but 6 out of 8 major hospital systems contacted by Reuters said they were not using it for moderate cases.The slowdown suggests that a shortage of the drug is over and threatens Gilead’s efforts to expand use of remdesivir, which it sells under the brand name Veklury in some countries.An HHS spokesperson confirmed on Friday that between July 6 and September 8, state and territory public health systems accepted about 72% of the remdesivir they were offered. Hospitals in turn purchased only about two-thirds of what states and territories accepted, as previously detailed to Reuters by Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Gilead did not respond to a request for comment.A surplus of remdesivir - which costs $3,120 for a 6-vial intravenous course - marks a turnaround from earlier in the pandemic, when supplies of the drug had fallen short of demand in some regions.Government-led distribution of remdesivir will expire at the end of September. Hospitals said they have little information on availability after that. Remdesivir was first authorized by the FDA in May for emergency use in Covid-19 patients hospitalized and on oxygen support after data showed it helped shorten hospital recovery time.‘NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSED’The agency last month expanded use to hospitalized patients who do not require oxygen support, based on data published in the JAMA medical journal showing that the drug provided a modest benefit for those patients.The newer data has left many experts unconvinced.“I am not terribly impressed with the study,” said Dr. Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. He said he remains “skeptical” about using remdesivir in patients with moderate Covid-19, especially given the price.Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said his center has stayed focused on using remdesivir for the narrower population of seriously ill patients who need supplemental oxygen.“No one wants to be in a position of making treatment decisions based on drug availability,” he said.Houston Methodist Hospital is holding off on broader use of remdesivir, and instead is stockpiling it in case the pandemic flares up in winter - typically the peak season for respiratory illness.“At this point, we are buying far more than we are using because we are unsure about what will happen at the end of September,” said Katherine Perez, infectious disease pharmacist at Houston Methodist.There is no evidence that Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital for a day or two due to an underlying health issue, like diabetes or high blood pressure, would benefit from the drug, she added.Mark Sullivan, associate chief pharmacy officer at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University Hospitals & Clinics, said his institution also did not expand remdesivir use based on the newer JAMA data. “We have kept our treatment protocol the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hospitals-turn-down-remdesivir-limit-use-to-sickest-covid-19-patients/story-VnklaeD7sGaWk1drqGiQFL.html
12-09-2020||World||5 Indians who strayed across LAC were spies, says Chinese media ahead of their release||Five Indians who had strayed over the border in Arunachal Pradesh earlier this month and were detained by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were working for the Indian intelligence, a state media report said on Saturday, hours ahead of their release by the Chinese army.The five civilian porters from the Tagin tribe of Arunachal Pradesh went missing in early September.Union minister Kiren Rijiju and the Indian army have repeatedly said that the five were porters and worked for the armed forces to carry and transport goods for troops stationed in the Indian side of Line of Actual Control (LAC) or the McMahon Line in Upper Subansiri in Arunachal Pradesh, which separates it from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).On Saturday, Rijiju tweeted: “China’s PLA has handed over our five boys to our side here at Kibitu area. I appreciate Indian Army for the smooth return of our citizens. I thank Indian Army Chief, his office and the local Commanders for constantly following up the matter and regularly updating me on the matter.”The Hindustan Times has reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for details of the case.Ahead of their release, state-run nationalistic tabloid, Global Times claimed in a report that five were “spies” working for the Indian army.The five had disguised themselves as “hunters”, the report said, quoting an anonymous source, adding that they were “India’s intelligence staff”.“They recently trespassed the China-India border and entered the Shannan prefecture of Tibet,” the report said.“The Indian side often sends staff via this means to gather intelligence of China. This is how it encroaches China-controlled areas,” the report said, adding: “The Chinese side has detained, warned and educated the five persons, who will be released soon”.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet.“The Chinese side has detained, warned and educated the five persons, who will be released soon,” the report said.“China and India have a very long border and there are vast stretches that are unguarded. In recent years, India has taken an aggressive approach in China-India border areas, which poses a challenge for China to strengthen its border control,” it added. On September 7, when asked about the whereabouts of the five missing Indians, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: “China’s position on the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, or Zangnan--the southern part of China’s Xizang (Tibet), is consistent and clear. The Chinese government has never recognized the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally established on the Chinese territory. I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-indians-who-strayed-across-lac-were-spies-says-chinese-media-ahead-of-their-release/story-zG9nG4htXKdAyU4ZLE4qAJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Afghan peace talks open in Doha, 19 years after 9/11 triggered war||The opening ceremony for talks between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents began in Qatar’s capital Doha on Saturday, marking the start of negotiations aimed at ending two decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of combatants and civilians.The 19-year conflict is also the United States’ longest overseas military action, vexing three successive presidents.The ceremony began at 9 a.m. (0600 GMT) with a recitation from the Koran, followed by opening comments by Qatar’s foreign minister.Major players in the process, including Afghanistan’s peace council chairman Abdullah Abdullah and Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also scheduled to speak.Officials, diplomats and analysts say that although getting both sides to the negotiating table was an achievement, this does not mean the path to peace will be easy.“The negotiations will have to tackle a range of profound questions about the kind of country Afghans want,” Deborah Lyons, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, told the UN Security Council this month.The inauguration ceremony comes one day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.US forces intervened in Afghanistan on the orders of President George W. Bush a month after the attacks to hunt down their mastermind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who had been given sanctuary by the country’s radical Islamist Taliban rulers. They initially offered mainly air support to the Taliban’s local enemies.Although the Taliban regime was quickly toppled, they regrouped and have since waged an insurgency that has sucked in Afghanistan’s neighbours and troops from dozens of countries, including NATO forces.Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the United States and the Taliban in February in an attempt to find a political settlement to end the war.After months of delay, a dispute over the Taliban’s demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners was resolved this week.Ahead of the US presidential election in November, President Donald Trump is looking to show progress in his pledge to end the US involvement and pull out most of the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan.The United States has reduced its troop levels and by November is expected to have fewer than 5,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from about 13,000 when the US-Taliban deal was signed. More than 2,300 US troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 450 British soldiers.A European diplomat in Kabul said that a ceasefire - which the Taliban have so far rejected - should top the talk’s agenda.“The Taliban leaders will have to stop fighters from attacking Afghan forces and civilians, violence continues to degrade the atmosphere and potentially derail negotiations,” the diplomat said.How to include the Taliban, who reject the legitimacy of the Western-backed Afghan government, in any governing arrangement and how to safeguard the rights of women and minorities who suffered under Taliban rule are big challenges, experts said.Nevertheless many diplomats, victims of violence and members of civil society say negotiations are the only realistic way to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and hampered Afghanistan’s development, leaving millions in poverty.“Solutions will not be found on the battlefield, we know this,” Lyons said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-talks-open-in-doha-19-years-after-9-11-triggered-war/story-hXD4NmU0Nwc1XBWq5vK3EM.html
12-09-2020||World||Thousands left homeless by Greek refugee camp fire protest||Thousands of asylum-seekers have spent a fourth night sleeping in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos, after successive fires destroyed a notoriously overcrowded migrant and refugee camp during a coronavirus lockdown.Officials have said the Tuesday and Wednesday night blazes were deliberately set by some camp residents angered at quarantine and isolation orders imposed after 35 people in the Moria camp tested positive for Covid-19.With the camp gutted, Saturday morning found men, women and children sleeping under improvised shelters made of reed stalks, blankets and salvaged tents.Thousands gathered for a protest demanding to be allowed to leave the island, gathering on a road blocked by police buses. The demonstration was loud but peaceful, with mainly children and women at the front. Riot police observed nearby as protesters chanted slogans and held up improvised banners made of pieces of cardboard or sheets.“We need peace & freedom. Moria kills all lives,” read one.A few of the demonstrators wore masks in the tightly packed crowd of people who recently had lived in the camp, which had dozens of confirmed coronavirus cases before it burned down.Leaving the island would require a bending of European Union rules, under which asylum-seekers reaching Greece’s islands from Turkey must stay there until they are either granted refugee status or deported back to Turkey.The Moria camp was built to house around 2,750 people but was so overcrowded that this week’s fires left more than 12,000 in need of emergency shelter on Lesbos. The camp had long been held up by critics as a symbol of Europe’s failings in migration policy.Moria was put under a virus lockdown until mid-September after the first case confirmed there was identified in a Somali man who had been granted asylum and left for Athens but later returned to the camp.On Friday, 200,000 rapid-detection kits for the virus were flown to the island for an extensive testing drive that would include asylum-seekers and islanders.The World Health Organization said Greece had asked for the deployment of an emergency medical team. Two such teams, one from Belgium and one from Norway, were expected to arrive on Saturday and Monday.Authorities have said none of the camp’s residents — except for 406 unaccompanied teenagers and children — would be allowed to leave the island. The unaccompanied minors were flown to the Greek mainland on Wednesday, and several European countries have said they will take some of them in.Other countries have pledged assistance for a new camp to be built on Lesbos, a move neither local residents nor the former inhabitants of Moria want.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country has so far not offered to take in children from Moria, underlined his long-time hard line on migration in a video posted on Facebook Saturday.“Now, some migrants have set alight and destroyed the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos to create pressure so that they can get from Lesbos to the European mainland,” Kurz said. “And if we give way to this pressure, we risk making the same mistake as in 2015. We risk people getting up false hopes and setting off for Greece, the smuggling business flourishing and once again countless people drowning in the Mediterranean.”“What we want to and will do is help on the spot, so that humane supply and accommodation is ensured, so that people in the whole word can live in bearable conditions,” Kurz said.Soldiers have been setting up new tents to house about 3,000 people on a new nearby site, flown in by helicopter to avoid protests by local residents angered at the use of their island as a holding center for thousands of people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia arriving from nearby Turkey.Moria’s overcrowded squalor created tension both among the camp’s inhabitants and with locals, whose initially generally welcoming attitude during the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015 has waned over the years.Human Rights Watch said the Moria fires “highlight the failure of the European Union’s ‘hotspot approach’ ... which has led to the containment of thousands of people on the Greek islands.”“European leaders should share responsibility for the reception and support of asylum-seekers. Also, Greek authorities should ensure that respect for human rights is at the center of its response to this fire,” the rights group’s Eva Cosse said in a statement.Many of the asylum-seekers in Moria described life there as being worse than much of what they had endured on their long, often painful journeys toward what they hoped was a better life in Europe.“While in Africa, we walked from 7 p.m. till 5 a.m. in the morning to avoid the heat and the police. That was hard. But being here, stuck, I think is worse,” said Amados Iam, a 23-year-old from Mauritania. “I didn’t come all the way to stay here. (I) Want to leave Greece.”Iam arrived in Moria three months ago with his 19-year-old brother. Both have suffered severe stomach issues, and a doctor in the local hospital in Lesbos told them it was due to the poor living conditions, including bad quality water and food, in Moria, Iam said.The brothers left Mauritania in 2017, crossing north Africa on foot and then making their way by truck to Turkey. Drought had ruined their mother’s farm, so Iam couldn’t continue studying, and the brothers feared conscription or being killed by the various armed groups coming from Mali and roaming in the south and west of Mauritania, they said.All their paperwork had been completed but the brothers had heard nothing about the status of their asylum request, they said. Their intended destination was France or Belgium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-left-homeless-by-greek-refugee-camp-fire-protest/story-fTPFKFD4llTFu466DDUIPL.html
12-09-2020||World||Newsom calls for decarbonizing economy as fires ravage California||John Sykes built his life around his cabin in the dense woods of Northern California. He raised his two children there, expanded it and improved it over time and made it resilient to all kinds of disaster except fire.So when the winds started howling on Tuesday and the skies became so dark from smoke that he had to turn on his lights at midday, he didn’t hesitate to leave it all behind in an instant before any evacuation order.With the disaster two years ago in nearby Paradise, in which 85 people perished in the deadliest and most destructive fire in modern state history, still fresh on his mind, Sykes got his wife and a friend into his car and left with only a change of clothes each.“All I could do is look in the rear view mirror and see orange sky and a mushroom cloud and that told me it was hot and to keep going,” Sykes said on Friday. “It was a terrifying feeling.” Berry Creek was largely destroyed in what has become the deadliest fire of 2020, a year that has already shattered California records for the most area burned — more land than the state of Connecticut — and recorded the largest fire of all time in the state. Five of the top 10 biggest blazes in state history are still burning and fire season often gets worse in the fall.At least 10 people were killed, including Josiah Williams, 16, who couldn’t escape the flames.“He was alone, terrified and ran for his life,” his mother, Jessica Williams, told CBS13 Sacramento. “My son was a good, smart, caring young boy that died alone and it kills me thinking about what he was going through.” Neighbouring Oregon and Washington also have been besieged and air pollution is a major problem across the West. Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Friday said “dozens of people” are missing from the large wildfires that have burned across the state.California Governor Gavin Newsom toured the fire-ravaged region on Friday and strongly asserted that climate change was evident and pledged to redouble efforts to “decarbonise” the economy.“The debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes,” he said, citing the hottest August in state history, 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days, record-breaking temperatures, drought and millions of dead trees.The immediate good news, he said, was the weather was beginning to cooperate, with winds settling down and the possibility of modest rain.Bill Connelly, a Butte County supervisor, said about 90% of the homes had burned but most of the 6,000 people in that area got out.“It’s just as devastating as Paradise,” he said, referring to the town 10 miles (16 kilometers) away that had 26,000 residents when it was destroyed. “It would be worse than Paradise if there were that many people living there.” About 20 people were hospitalised with burns; others broke limbs in the panic to flee, Connelly said. Fire officials have estimated that more than 2,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed.Under heavy smoke, the search continued on Friday for 16 people missing in the rugged mountains 125 miles (200 kilometres) northeast of San Francisco.Berry Creek, which began as a stage coach stop during the California Gold Rush, was among the hardest hit communities.A bar, laundromat and two stores are gone. All that remained of a gas station were a pair of pumps and a sign listing prices. The school and volunteer fire station — with the engine still inside — were destroyed.“There was no fighting this fire,” Sykes said. “Those who tried to fight it are probably not here.” Most homes were reduced to smoldering piles of ash, twisted metal and blackened appliances, but others escaped unscathed. Chimneys poked from the rubble and burned out cars and pickup trucks dotted the landscape. Scorched utility poles and fallen wires lined the roads.Sykes, who became emotional several times describing his ordeal, said he has located all but two friends. Some dunked into ponds, others jumped into Lake Oroville, a massive reservoir, as hot debris rained down on them, he said.Sykes, a former logger and construction worker, had never evacuated his home during a fire before but said he was too old at 68 to stay put. Plus, he had to look after his wife Janet, the “love of my life,” and a close friend who has been ill and lived with them since her husband died six months ago.He didn’t want them to be trapped on the road leading out of town the way people had perished in Paradise.When they were 5 miles (8 kilometres) miles down the road heading to safety, a friend called to say that the home he left behind on Wood Smoke Way was burning.

12-09-2020||World||‘Alone, terrified and ran for his life’: Nine, including teen, dead in California fires; 19 missing||Smoke from massive wildfires that painted California skies orange was also helping crews corral the deadliest blaze of the year, but despite the progress there was concern that the death toll could mount as crews reach devastated areas.Nine people, including a 16-year-old boy, have been confirmed dead since lightning-caused fires that started weeks ago fused into a monster that largely destroyed Berry Creek, a tiny hamlet in the Sierra Nevada foothills northeast of San Francisco.Crews made progress Friday in chopping or bulldozing brush-free lines to control lne North Complex fire. In addition, gusting winds that whipped up the flames days earlier eased while smoke blocked out the sun and lowered previously scorching temperatures. Saturday’s high temperature was expected to top out at 80 degrees or less.Nearly 15,000 firefighters were battling 28 major wildfires across California, although 24 were sparked Thursday and quickly contained.The North Complex remained the deadliest this year, with nine confirmed deaths. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea had said 10 bodies were found but on Friday lowered the figure. Honea said remains found in a burned storage shed turned out to be from a resin model of a human skeleton that was used by an anthropology student.A search continued for 19 people who remained unaccounted for.More victims could be found when search-and-rescue teams join sheriff’s detectives in the rugged mountain area but firefighters said it was too dangerous to immediately begin work in some places.“Right now, the areas that we need to search are too hot,” Honea said.The sheriff said the victims included Josiah Williams, 16, of Berry Creek, who apparently died while trying to flee the flames in a vehicle.“He was alone, terrified and ran for his life,” his mother, Jessica Williams, told CBS13 Sacramento. “”My son was a good, smart, caring young boy that died alone and it kills me thinking about what he was going through.”The body of Millicent Catarancuic, 77, of Berry Creek was found by a car on Wednesday, and two other people who may have been associated with her were found in the same area, the sheriff said. He did not release their names.“We have information that those subjects were aware of the fire but chose not to immediately evacuate,” he said.Catarancuic’s nephew, Zygy Roe-Zurz, told the Reno Gazette Journal his family had been packed up and ready to leave before deciding to wait when it appeared the fire threat was easing. Then, it made an explosive run.“At the last minute they decided to stay,” Roe-Zurz said. “They decided they would wing it if they had to and that proved to be a really fatal mistake.”The couple lived in the home with his mother, Suzan Violet Zurz, a painter and former model, who remained missing, he said.This year already has seen shattered California records for the most area burned — more land than the state of Connecticut — and recorded the largest fire of all time in the state. Five of the top 10 biggest blazes in state history are still burning and fire season often gets worse in the fall. Some 4,000 homes and other buildings have been destroyed.In Berry Creek, most homes were reduced to smoldering piles of ash, twisted metal and blackened appliances, although some were unscathed. Chimneys poked from rubble and burned out cars and pickup trucks dotted the landscape. Scorched utility poles and fallen wires lined the roads.A bar, laundromat and two stores were gone.

12-09-2020||World||California governor pushing to speed up state’s effort to combat wildfires||California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing to speed up his state’s effort to fight climate change as wildfires rip through the region at a record pace and a 1,000-mile sheet of smoke drives air quality to dangerous levels.“This is a climate damn emergency. This is real,” Newsom said in a briefing Friday from a fire zone in Butte County, surrounded by charred trees shrouded in smoke.His comments came as air quality across the US West deteriorated in the wake of record-breaking wildfires that have consumed more than 3.1 million acres in California and 1.4 million acres in Washington and Oregon. Damage could top $50 billion, according to Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.And Oregon officials warn that the blazes may have claimed many lives, although they have not yet released a death count. In California, 20 people have died during the last month of relentless wildfires.“We are preparing for a mass fatality incident based on what we know and the number of structures that have been lost,” said Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. About 40,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and around 500,000 residents are under evacuation notice in the state.Newsom said the string of calamities striking the West Coast -- record heat waves, massive fires, smoke-filled skies blotting out the sun -- were exactly the kinds of problems long forecast by climate scientists, only they’re happening sooner than expected.He said he’d tasked the heads of the California Environmental Protection Agency and the natural resources agency with reviewing the state’s climate programs and finding a way to achieve 100% clean energy sooner than the current goal of 2045.“I think 2045’s too late,” Newsom said.The move, however, may garner pushback, as California’s aggressive push toward clean energy in recent years was partly to blame for blackouts during an August heatwave, the state’s first rolling outages in 20 years.The air quality index in Eugene, Oregon, neared the ceiling set by the US Environmental Protection Agency on Friday while Portland and Seattle had the worst air quality among major world cities, according to IQAir AirVisual pollution data.The gloom will last into the weekend before a Pacific storm bringing rain to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest and winds in Northern California may push the smoke eastward, according to the National Weather Service.While the weather system might move the smoke, there’s also the risk that winds could fan the fires further, especially over the Sierra Nevada mountains, said Hannah Chandler-Cooley, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento.Earlier this week, a wind storm prompted utilities in California and Oregon to proactively shut down power lines lest they be toppled by high winds and ignite new blazes. Utility PG&E Corp. said it found at least 52 instances of damage to its de-energized equipment from the wind storm.“The moisture is good for fire suppression, but the winds are not,” Chandler-Cooley said.​​There are no critical fire weather conditions present across the US and none forecast through the weekend, the US Storm Prediction Center said. However, low humidity in many areas of the West and high temperatures mean the risk of fire spreading will remain.The highest chances for rain will be in Oregon and Washington, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the US Weather Prediction Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-governor-pushing-to-speed-up-state-s-effort-to-combat-wildfires/story-z7SRh0vKrISi4gzwm7w09L.html

It will be about 195 million kilometers (118 million miles) from Earth when it arrives at Mars around February, having traveled 470 million kilometers (292 million miles) in all to get there.The administration, however, has yet to release information about a mysterious reusable experimental spacecraft that returned to Earth a week ago after a two-day flight.The spacecraft consists of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, and marks China’s most ambitious Mars mission yet as it seeks to join the United States in successfully landing a spacecraft on the planet. It was blasted into space aboard a Long March-5 on July 23 during a month when the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. also took advantage of a shortened distance between the planets to launch similar missions.China said the reusable spacecraft returned to its designated landing site last Sunday, calling the flight a breakthrough that will eventually provide convenient round-trip transport to space at a low cost. No other details on the mission or the configuration of the spacecraft have been released.That is also seen as an attempt to put China on the leading edge of space flight. The U.S. has for years been operating the secretive X-37B space plane that remains in orbit for months.China’s military-backed space program has developed rapidly since it became just the third country after Russia and the U.S. to put a man in space in 2003. Last year, China’s Chang’e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-mars-probe-stable-no-word-on-reusable-spacecraft/story-97K29WoQpOuTNO2wGR4heM.html
12-09-2020||World||Crackdown on journalists sparks criticism of Pakistan government||Pressure mounted on the Pakistani media on Friday after a journalist was reportedly arrested in Karachi for spreading hatred and maligning a state institution on social media. On the same day, sedition charges were filed against another journalist, in Jhelum.Bilal Farooqi, news editor at the English language daily The Express Tribune, was picked up by police from outside his home in Karachi on Friday, two days after a report was registered against him. He was released on Saturday morning on the personal bail of his lawyer Jibran Nasir. Bilal’s family confirmed that he has returned home.The journalist has been reporting on sectarian violence in the country.Tashfeen Farooqi, Bilal Farooqi’s wife, earlier told the media that her husband was taken away by the police from right outside their home. She reportedly said their landlord had asked Bilal to step out of the house with his identity card as the police were conducting a “survey” in the locality. “When he (Bilal) didn’t return, I went outside to find out what happened. Bilal wasn’t there. The landlord then told me the police took him away,” Tashfeen said, adding that according to the landlord, Bilal was driven away by two policemen accompanied by two men in plainclothes.Reports say that after a while, Tashfeen received a phone call from Bilal, who told her that he was being held at the Defence police station. Soon after, police officials visited Bilal’s residence and took possession of his mobile phone from his wife. Meanwhile, an FIR citing sedition charges against journalist Absar Alam was registered in Jhelum. Alam, a former chairman of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, was reportedly charged with using derogatory language against state institutions and personalities.Reacting to these two developments, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalist (PFUJ) said in a statement the government wants to suppress the media.PFUJ president Shehzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi said, “If both the fabricated and concocted cases are not withdrawn immediately, we will be left with the only option to call a strike and protest cross the country, which may harm the current government and tarnish the image of the country just because of ill-conceived ideas of the decision-makers.”Last week, Sajid Gondal, a joint director at the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, had gone missing and returned home five days later. Gondal is believed to have helped with a news story investigating the assets of Lt Gen (retd) Saleem Bajwa, the chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority and an information aide to Prime Minister Imran Khan.In July, Matiullah Jan, a journalist known for his criticism of the military establishment, was reportedly abducted from Islamabad in broad daylight. He returned home after several hours after the incident sparked a public outcry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crackdown-on-journalists-sparks-criticism-of-pakistan-government/story-dk47vacOKboJo5kfUUrhpI.html
12-09-2020||World||Changing Chinese positions on Ladakh||Although the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) under Commander-in-Chief Xi Jinping wants to expand the territorial map on the basis of Green Line defined by a 1959 map circulated by Prime Minister Chou En-Lai under leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese position on resolving the border issue with India has changed over the decades as per convenience of the ruler of Beijing.After Mao Zedong changed the facts on ground by building the Lhasa-Kashgar highway (number 219) through Aksai Chin in 1956, Prime Minister Chou En-Lai in 1960 offered his Indian counterpart Jawaharlal Nehru to resolve the border on “as it is where it is principle.” This meant that China was recognizing Indian sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh or North-East Frontier Agency as it was known then, while India would recognise Beijing’s claim to Aksai Chin south of Haji Langar pass. This was never accepted by India and was one of the most important reasons behind the Chinese aggression in 1962. Today, China is in adverse possession of more than 38,180 sq km of Indian land including 5180 sq km of Shaksgam valley gifted by Pakistan in 1963.ALSO WATCH | India, China formulate 5-point peace plan during Jaishankar & Wang Yi meet On February 14, 1979, then Vice Premier and later paramount leaders Deng Xiaoping met Foreign Minister (later Prime Minister) Atal Behari Vajpayee and offered a package deal for resolve the boundary issue. Deng said that Chinese were willing to make concessions on the eastern sector to India, while New Delhi should make similar concessions in the western sector. While the concessions were not specified, Deng said that the resolution of the border could be shelved to the next generation as long as both sides maintain a stable situation on the border. Deng reiterated this proposal in 1985 also.The Chinese position again took a radical turn after the 1986 Somdorong Chu incident in north Arunachal Pradesh. In 1987, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing told his Indian counterpart Secretary (East) A P Venkateswaran in New Delhi that China was looking for concessions both on eastern and western sectors in order to solve the boundary issue. Deng was the leader of China and Chairman of the all powerful Central Military Commission.Since then a plethora of agreements and protocols have been signed to maintain peace and tranquility on the 3488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. After the Special Representative dialogue was set up between India and China to resolve the boundary issue in 2005, 22 meetings have taken place between India’s National Security Advisor and Chinese State Councillor but the boundary issue has hardly moved towards resolution. China still calls Arunachal Pradesh South Tibet and India boundary in Ladakh claims all of Aksai Chin.While there is hope that the present stand-off between PLA and Indian Army may result in at least exchanging of maps in western sector so that each side knows the other’s positions and claims, the Chinese belligerence and deliberate provocation from Depsang to Pangong Tso this year does not augur well for peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/changing-chinese-positions-on-ladakh/story-TTgMelOWSwQfRvcWJUB0LJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Indian filmmaker Tamhane’s ‘The Disciple’ eyes success in Toronto||Mumbai-based film director Chaitanya Tamhane is currently in the first week of a mandatory quarantine in India after having retuned from Venice on Monday. That might be a small price to pay for being able to walk the red carpet at the Biennale as his 2020 feature film, The Disciple, premiered at the prestigious Italian film festival. In a year that’s been low-key for movies due to the coronavirus pandemic and related curbs, The Disciple is the only Indian selection at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Canada.In order to travel to Venice for the Biennale, Tamhane required “special exception” from the external affairs ministry. It was the first Indian film since Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding in 2001 to be selected in the competition category at Venice. With pandemic-related restrictions on non-essential travel to Canada in place, Tamhane will have to make do with only a ‘virtual visit’ to Toronto. He said in an interview, “It would have been great to present the film in person, but given this year and given the safety protocols that Toronto has in place, I totally want to respect that for my own safety and for the safety of others.”A contemplative exploration of the evolution of a Hindustani classical vocalist in Mumbai, The Disciple, which is in Marathi, is already being feted globally. The director said, “We’re so grateful and relieved that the film premiered at Venice and is now in Toronto. We’re just happy that even in this year, we could get a film out, and also, for us this is a great start. We couldn’t have asked for a better launch.”The film has also picked up the coveted FIPRESCI award, given by a jury from the International Federation of Film Critics, making it a rare occasion that an Indian film has become a prize-winner at a major festival in Europe.Tamhane took four years to complete the film, spending about half the time on research. “When I started out, I was fascinated with the anecdotes and the stories of eccentric geniuses and this idea of some secret knowledge and lost wisdom,” he said. The film’s cast comprises first-time actors, mostly trained classical exponents. It includes the exceptional performance of Aditya Modak, who plays the central role of Sharad Nerulkar, a young man torn between the ascetic sensibility required for his art and the pressures of reality and modernity. Casting non-professionals was a “very, very thorough” process for Tamhane. “You need to make sure they have screen presence and they have an intuition for acting because they ultimately they will be delivering scripted lines,” he said.The narrative of the meditative film is like a slow-burning flame spanning three time periods, as it tracks Nerulkar’s development over time. A striking feature of the movie is its incredible music, including the vocal art at its core, making it a work where sight and sound complement each other well.This is Tamhane’s first feature film since Court in 2014, and he was mentored by Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, winner of multiple Oscars for films such as Gravity and Roma. Cuaron is also the film’s executive producer, which for Tamhane was “almost too good to be true”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-filmmaker-tamhane-s-the-disciple-eyes-success-in-toronto/story-XwiYlINqkmx8dxQad7gSVL.html
12-09-2020||World||Taliban, Afghan government to restart peace talks: All you need to know||The Taliban and the Afghan government will resume talks on Saturday to bring stability in Afghanistan and try to end two decades of conflict in the country.The deal outlines a peace process which involves the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, reducing violence to ensure social stability in the nation, free close to 5,000 Taliban prisoners held by Afghan security forces and free 1,000 security personnel held by the Taliban.StakeholdersThe biggest stakeholders in these talks are the Afghan people. Their sentiments can be put into perspective in the words of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. “(Both sides must) deliver what the Afghan people are demanding -- a reconciled Afghanistan with a government that reflects a country that isn’t at war,” Pompeo said on Friday, according to Reuters.The Taliban and the Afghanistan government will surely differ on issues like women empowerment and education for all as the Taliban have made it clear that they would want a theocratic Islamic state which is contrary to what the Afghanistan constitution outlines.“The Taliban have always been clear about what they want and that is a pure Islamic government, which is incompatible with the current liberal democratic Islamic political order,” Nishank Motwani, deputy director at the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, told wire agency Agence France Presse.The 21-member team has women politician Raihana Azad and Fawzia Koofi, who recently survived an assassination attempt and along with Zalmay Khalilzad will negotiate how to protect minorities and women who are one of the prime stakeholders in this conversation.One of the unlikely stakeholders is US president Donald Trump under whose presidency the US has managed not to engage in war on foreign soil. Trump will look forward to keeping his election promise and ensure that US soldiers get to return home.ObjectivesThe talks will primarily aim to draw a timeline which will outline the withdrawal process of US troops, Nato soldiers and the private army men, according to the Council of Foreign Relations website.The discussions will also aim to ensure that the Afghanistan soil is not used for fostering terrorist groups. A UN report cited by the New York Times says that fighters from outfits like Al-Qaeda and terrorists from countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have found cover under the Taliban.Another primary objective will be to ensure that the ceasefire between Afghan forces and the Taliban terrorists continue. The intra-Afghan talks will also aim at making the Taliban recognise the achievements made by the democratic governments and to not bring back the reign of terror which was the norm when the nation was under the rule of the Taliban in the 1990s.Pompeo, US special representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, politicians from the Afghanistan government and Taliban forces will start talks aiming to restore peace and rule of law in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-delegation-and-afghan-government-to-start-peace-talks-all-you-need-to-know/story-Z6mEDU5qbjdQyk61U4ErAL.html
12-09-2020||World||About 8,800 unaccompanied children are expelled at US border||About 8,800 unaccompanied children have been quickly expelled from the United States along the Mexico border under a pandemic-related measure that effectively ended asylum, authorities said Friday.The Trump administration has expelled more than 159,000 people since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emergency order took effect in March, a figure that also includes more than 7,600 adults and children who crossed the border in families.The figures on children were reported for the first time in a declaration by Raul Ortiz, the Border Patrol’s deputy chief, as part of the administration’s appeal of an order to stop housing children in hotels.The administration “immediately” expelled most children and families to Mexico but more than 2,200 unaccompanied children and 600 people who came in families were held until flights could be arranged to return home, Ortiz said.The administration asked the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a ruling last week that found use of hotels skirted “fundamental humanitarian protections.”US District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles ruled that using hotels for long-term detention violated a two-decade-old settlement governing treatment of children in custody. She ordered border agencies to stop placing children in hotels by Tuesday.Justice Department attorneys argued that settlement doesn’t apply during the public health emergency and that hotels were appropriate.“While in these hotels, the government provides minors with supervision by specialists, recreation, amenities, and protective measures against Covid-19,” the attorneys wrote.Before the pandemic, unaccompanied children were sent to state-licensed shelters operated by the Department of Health and Human Services and often released to family members while seeking asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-8-800-unaccompanied-children-are-expelled-at-us-border/story-xr39CFIw2wS8qB01m6r0mJ.html

It takes place a day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.U.S. forces intervened in Afghanistan on the orders of President George W. Bush a month after the attacks to hunt down their mastermind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who had been given sanctuary by the country’s radical Islamist Taliban rulers. They initially offered mainly air support to the Taliban’s local enemies.Although the Taliban regime was quickly toppled, they regrouped and have since waged an insurgency that has sucked in Afghanistan’s neighbours and troops from dozens of countries, including NATO forces.Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the United States and the Taliban in February in an attempt to find a political settlement to end the war.After months of delay, a dispute over the Taliban’s demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners was resolved this week.Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, President Donald Trump is also looking to show progress in his pledge to end the U.S. involvement and pull out most of the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan.The United States has reduced its troop levels and by November is expected to have less than 5,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from about 13,000 when the U.S.-Taliban deal was signed. More than 2,300 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 450 British soldiers.A European diplomat in Kabul said that a ceasefire - which the Taliban have so far rejected - should top the talk’s agenda.“The Taliban leaders will have to stop fighters from attacking Afghan forces and civilians, violence continues to degrade the atmosphere and potentially derail negotiations,” the diplomat said.How to include the Taliban, who reject the legitimacy of the Western-backed Afghan government, in any governing arrangement and how to safeguard the rights of women and minorities who suffered under Taliban rule are big challenges, experts said.Nevertheless many diplomats, victims of violence and members of civil society say negotiations are the only realistic way to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and hampered Afghanistan’s development, leaving millions in poverty.“Solutions will not be found on the battlefield, we know this,” Lyons said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-peace-talks-to-open-in-doha-19-years-after-9-11-triggered-war/story-nkkgo7ekcy78qwnrE8D87O.html

A joint statement from eight of the 15 council nations said the clashes in western Rakhine and Chin states are taking “a heavy toll” on local communities and risk escalating, and stressed that a halt to fighting is “even more urgent in light of the increased number of Covid-19 cases in Rakhine State.” The government has been embroiled for more than a year in an intermittent conflict with the well-trained and well-armed Arakan Army representing members of the area’s Rakhine ethnic group. The guerrilla force is posing the strongest military challenge to the central government of the many ethnic minority groups who for decades have sought greater autonomy. Human rights advocates have accused Myanmar’s army of using undue force and targeting civilians in their operations fighting the guerrillas. The fighting is continuing as an upsurge in coronavirus cases that began in August in Rakhine has since spread to other parts of the country. Myanmar on Friday re-imposed its toughest measures so far to control the spread of Covid-19, banning travel out of the country’s biggest city, Yangon, and grounding all domestic flights until October 1. Addressing the situation in Rakhine more broadly, the eight countries called on Myanmar to accelerate its efforts to address the long-term causes of the crisis that led more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh over three years ago “because of violence perpetrated by the Myanmar military.” Myanmar has long claimed the Rohingya are “Bengali” migrants from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. The eight countries — United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Dominican Republic and Tunisia — encouraged Myanmar to set out “a transparent and credible plan” to implement recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission, and the Independent Commission of Enquiry. The Rakhine Commission, headed by the late former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, called on Myanmar before the August 2017 attacks began to grant citizenship and ensure other rights to the Rohingya, and urged the government to promote investment and community-directed growth to alleviate poverty in Rakhine. The Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by Myanmar’s government, concluded in January 2020 that there are reasons to believe security forces committed war crimes in counterinsurgency operations that forced Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh but said there is no evidence supporting genocide. The eight council nations noted that Myanmar is required, under a ruling that same month by the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ top court, to do all it can to prevent genocide against the Rohingya people. Calling themselves “committed supporters of Myanmar’s democratic transition,” the eight council members said they recognized efforts made by its government on democratization and called Nov. 8 elections “an important milestone in Myanmar’s transition, which the international community has supported with funding and technical expertise.” “We underline the importance of ensuring individuals of all communities, including Rohingya, are able to participate safely, fully, and equally in credible and inclusive elections,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-council-members-urge-halt-to-myanmar-arakan-army-fighting/story-vkyeHbjz0yfL8GQ7SXYv1J.html

France recorded close to 10,000 cases on Thursday, the most since the lockdown ended in May. Spain, which has the most cases in Europe, reported 4,708 new infections over 24 hours, the most since mid-April. Macron said his government has important decisions to make to contain the disease, which is circulating actively in major cities including Marseille and Lyon. The uptick led to Europe surpassing the US in daily cases and making it a global hot spot again.UK city tightens curbs Authorities in Birmingham announced new coronavirus restrictions on Friday as the UK’s viral reproduction rate, or ‘R’ number, exceeded 1.0 for the first time since March.From next Tuesday, more than 1.1 million people will be banned from mixing with any other household, after the rate of infection in Birmingham rose from 30 to 75 cases per 100,000 people over a week in August.US: North Korea issues shoot-to-kill ordersNorth Korea has issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the virus from entering the country from China, according to the commander of US forces in South Korea.The North has not confirmed a single case of the disease that has swept the world since first emerging in China.

12-09-2020||World||US marks 9/11 anniversary at tributes shadowed by virus||Americans commemorated 9/11 Friday as another national crisis reconfigured memorial ceremonies, dividing some victims’ families over coronavirus safety precautions, and a presidential campaign carved a path through the observances.In New York, victims’ relatives gathered Friday morning for split-screen remembrances at the World Trade Center’s Sept. 11 memorial plaza and on a nearby corner, set up by separate organizations.Standing on the plaza, with its serene waterfall pools and groves of trees, Jin Hee Cho said she couldn’t erase the memory of the death of her younger sister, Kyung, in the collapse of the trade center’s north tower.“It’s just hard to delete that in my mind. I understand there’s all this, and I understand now that we have even COVID,“ said Cho, 55. ”But I only feel the loss, the devastating loss of my flesh-and-blood sister.”Around the country, some communities canceled 9/11 ceremonies, while others went ahead, sometimes with modifications. The Pentagon’s observance was so restricted that not even victims’ families could attend, though small groups could visit its memorial later in the day.On an anniversary that fell less than two months before the presidential election, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden both headed for the Flight 93 National Memorial in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania — at different times of day. Biden also attended the ceremony at ground zero in New York, exchanging an elbow bump with Vice President Mike Pence before the observance began.In short, the 19th anniversary of the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil was a complicated occasion in a maelstrom of a year, as the U.S. grapples with a pandemic, searches its soul over racial injustice and prepares to choose a leader to chart a path forward.Still, families say it’s important for the nation to pause and remember the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people at the trade center, at the Pentagon outside Washington and in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 11, 2001 — shaping American policy, perceptions of safety and daily life in places from airports to office buildings.“People could say, ‘Oh, 19 years.’ But I’ll always be doing something this day. It’s history,” said Annemarie D’Emic, who lost her brother Charles Heeran, a stock trader. She went to the alternative ceremony in New York, which kept up the longstanding tradition of in-person readers.Speaking at the Pennsylvania memorial, Trump recalled how the plane’s crew and passengers tried to storm the cockpit as the hijackers as headed for Washington.“The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall, and fight back,” the Republican president said.Biden visited the memorial later Friday, laid a wreath and greeted relatives of one of the slain crew members, First Officer LeRoy Homer.At the Sept. 11 memorial in New York hours earlier, Biden offered condolences to victims’ relatives including Amanda Barreto, 27, who lost her aunt and godmother in the attacks. She said Biden “wanted to let me know to keep the faith” and told her he understood what it meant to lose a loved one. His first wife and their daughter died in a car crash, and his son Beau died of brain cancer.Biden didn’t speak at the ceremony, which has a longstanding custom of not allowing politicians to make remarks.Pence went on to the separate ceremony, organized by the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, where he read the Bible’s 23rd Psalm. His wife, Karen, read a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes.“For the families of the lost and friends they left behind, I pray these ancient words will comfort your heart and others,” said the vice president, drawing applause from the audience of roughly 200.Formed in honor of a firefighter killed on 9/11, the foundation felt in-person readers were crucial to the ceremony’s emotional impact and could recite names while keeping a safe distance. By contrast, recorded names emanated from speakers placed around the memorial plaza. Leaders said they wanted to keep readers and listeners from clustering at a stage.As in past years on the plaza, many readers at the alternative ceremony added poignant tributes to their loved ones’ character and heroism, urged the nation not to forget the attacks and recounted missed family milestones: “How I wish you could walk me down the aisle in just three weeks,” Kaitlyn Strada said of her father, Thomas, a bond broker.One reader thanked essential workers for helping New York City endure the pandemic, which has killed at least 24,000 people in the city and over 190,000 nationwide. Another reader, Catherine Hernandez, said she became a police officer to honor her family’s loss.Other victims’ relatives, however, weren’t bothered by the switch to a recording at the ground zero ceremony.“I think it should evolve. It can’t just stay the same forever,” said Frank Dominguez, who lost his brother, Police Officer Jerome Dominguez.The Sept. 11 memorial and the Tunnel to Towers foundation also tussled over the Tribute in Light, a pair of powerful beams that shine into the night sky near the trade center, evoking its fallen twin towers. The 9/11 memorial initially canceled the display, citing virus safety concerns for the installation crew. After the foundation vowed to put up the lights instead, the memorial changed course with help from its chair, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Tunnel to Towers, meanwhile, arranged to display single beams for the first time at the Shanksville memorial and the Pentagon.Over the years, the anniversary also has become a day for volunteering. Because of the pandemic, the 9/11 National Day of Service and Remembrance organization is encouraging people this year to make donations or take other actions from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-marks-9-11-anniversary-at-tributes-shadowed-by-virus/story-DNnLAnkqKV3ZAiVV3bDspJ.html
12-09-2020||World||Warring Afghans meet to find peace after decades of war||Afghanistan’s warring sides started negotiations for the first time, bringing together the Taliban and delegates appointed by the Afghan government Saturday for historic meetings aimed at ending decades of war.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the opening ceremony in Qatar, where the meetings are taking place and where the Taliban maintain a political office. The start of negotiations was the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity by the Trump administration ahead of the US presidential election in November.“Each of you carry a great responsibility,” Pompeo told the participants. “You have an opportunity to overcome your divisions.”While Saturday’s opening was about ceremony, the hard negotiations will be held behind closed doors. There the sides will be tackling tough issues. This includes the terms of a permanent cease-fire, the rights of women and minorities, and the disarming of tens of thousands of Taliban fighters and militias loyal to warlords, some of them aligned with the government.The Afghan sides are also expected to discuss constitutional changes and power sharing during the talks in Qatar’s capital of Doha.Even seemingly mundane issues like the flag and the name of the country - the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or as the Taliban’s administration was known when it ruled, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan —- could find their way onto the negotiation table and roil tempers.Among the government-appointed negotiators are four women, who vowed to preserve women’s rights in any power-sharing deal with the hard-line Taliban. This includes the right to work, education and participation in political life, all denied women when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan for five years.The Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a US-led coalition for harboring Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America.No women are on the Taliban’s negotiation team, led by their chief justice Abdul Hakim. The insurgent movement has said it accepted a woman’s right to work, go to school and participate in politics but would not accept a woman president or chief justice.Deeply conservative members of the government-named High Council for National Reconciliation, which is overseeing the talks, also hold that women can not serve in either post.At the opening ceremonies, there was some sign of Taliban changes in attitudes. Several Taliban jostled to to take photographs of leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar as he addressed the ceremony. Photography was banned during the Taliban rule as against Islam.Baradar said the Taliban envisioned an Islamic system that embraces all Afghans, without elaborating. He also urged patience as the negotiations proceeded, urging both sides to stick with the talks even in the face of problems.“The negotiation process may have problems, but the request is that the negotiations move forward with a lot of patience, with a lot of attention, and it should be continued with such kind of attention,” he said. “We want to give them (people of Afghanistan) this assurance that with full honesty we continue the Afghan peace negotiation, and we try for peace and tranquility, we will pave the ground in Afghanistan.”Abdullah Abdullah, who heads Kabul’s High Council for National Reconciliation, said in his remarks that the sides do not need to agree on every detail, but should announce a humanitarian cease-fire.Both sides will be “peace heroes” if negotiations bring about a lasting peace that protects Afghanistan’s independence and leads to a system based on Islamic principles that preserves the rights of all people, said Abdullaah..Pompeo warned that their decisions and conduct will affect both the size and conduct of U.S. assistance.He encouraged the negotiators to respect Afghanistan’s rich diversity, including women and ethnic and religious minorities. He said that while the choice of Afghanistan’s political system is theirs to make, the U.S. has found that democracy and rotation of political power works best.“I can only urge these actions. You will write the next chapter of Afghan history,” he said.Pompeo spoke the day after the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. He said the U.S. will never forget the 9/11, and that America welcomes the Taliban commitment not to host terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, which was responsible for the carnage.The intra-Afghan negotiations were laid out in a peace deal Washington signed with the Taliban on Feb. 29. At that time the deal was touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in 40 years of war.Yet Abdullah noted that since that agreement was reached, 1,200 people have been killed and more than 15,000 wounded in attacks across the country. The United Nations has urged a reduction of violence and criticized civilian casualties on both sides.The current talks had been originally expected to begin within weeks of the signed agreement between the Taliban and the US.But delays disrupted the timeline. The Afghan government balked at releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which was stipulated in the deal as a sign of good faith ahead of the negotiations. The Taliban were required to release 1,000 government and military personnel in their custody.Political turmoil in Kabul further delayed talks as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival in controversial presidential polls the year before, Abdullah Abdullah, squabbled over who won, with both declaring victory.The Taliban refusal to reduce the violence further hindered the start of talks.Still the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan does not hinge on the success of the talks.Washington’s withdrawal is contingent on the Taliban honoring commitments to fight terrorist groups, in particular the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, and ensure that Afghanistan cannot again be used to attack America or its allies.The U.S. has refused to give specific of the guarantees citing security reasons, but the withdrawal of U.S. troops has already begun. President Donald Trump has said that by November, about 4,000 soldiers will be in Afghanistan, down from 13,000 when the deal was signed in February.“Washington’s goals are very simple: It wants intra-Afghan talks happening as soon as possible, because these give the White House political cover for an imminent withdrawal,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Washington-based Wilson Center’s Asia program.“Trump likely wants a peace deal before the election, so that he can garner political benefits galore and pitch himself as a Nobel Peace Prize candidate. But presumably even he realizes it’s wildly unrealistic to expect a deal so soon. These types of negotiations tend to be measured in years, not weeks.”The talks in Doha follow the Trump administration-brokered recognition of Israel by two Gulf Arab nations - Bahrain on Friday and the United Arab Emirates in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warring-afghans-meet-to-find-peace-after-decades-of-war/story-XkcWK7v1cqiQkuQ6xeWkEJ.html
