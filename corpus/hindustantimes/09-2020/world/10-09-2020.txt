Facebook Campus makes it easy to find and start conversations within your college community,” the company said.The service, to be initially available at around 30 colleges and universities in the US, is a dedicated section within the Facebook app, with a campus profile that’s different from the main Facebook profile. Profiles can be created with college email and graduation year. Key features include campus-only news feed and campus directory. Students can also create real-time chat rooms for their dorm or clubs they’re part of within Campus. Facebook began life in 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg started a website called Facemash, aimed at university students, while he was a student at Harvard University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/back-to-roots-facebook-starts-app-within-app-called-campus/story-z2FpTWa3oez7nZ1uxx6afL.html
10-09-2020||World||US revoked over 1,000 Chinese visas over national security||The US revoked the visas of more than a thousand Chinese students and researchers for national security reasons, in the latest escalation of tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.The visas were revoked under a measure intended to limit China’s ability to use graduate students and researchers to steal US “technologies, intellectual property and information to develop advanced military capabilities,” a spokesman for the US embassy said in an emailed statement Thursday.The people who had their visas revoked “represent a small subset” of students and scholars going to the US, according to the statement, which said that the US continues to welcome “legitimate” students and researchers.The news was earlier reported by Reuters.The visas were canceled under a May presidential proclamation which targets Chinese citizens with ties to the People’s Liberation Army, the statement said. No information was provided about the individuals whose visas were canceled.People on Chinese social media speculated that the students were likely connected with or graduates of seven Chinese universities and their affiliated schools which are connected with national defense.The cancellations are likely to add to the uncertainty Chinese students face about studying or working in America. The Trump administration earlier vowed to deport all foreign national students if they didn’t take in-person classes during the pandemic, only to withdraw that rule days later, leaving students perplexed and worried about their legal status in the States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-revoked-over-1-000-chinese-visas-over-national-security/story-BmclFOmU76jqpI14CX9pDM.html
10-09-2020||World||US affiliate of BJP registers as foreign agent||The US affiliate of the Bharatiya Janata Party - Overseas Friends of BJP-USA (OFBJP-USA) - recently registered itself with the American government under a law that requires individuals and entities that engage in political activities on behalf of a foreign principal to file a public disclosure of their ties and activities.The OFBJP-USA identified BJP as its “foreign principal” in a registration form filed on August 27 with the US department of justice (DOJ) under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), 1938. It listed Vijay Chauthaiwale, in-charge of the BJP’s department of foreign affairs, as the party official it works with.For the mission and objective of the BJP as the foreign principal, the OFBJP, said in the registration form, “Advocating for welfare social policies, self-reliance, robust economic growth, foreign policy driven by a nationalist agenda, and strong national defence for India.”Adapa V Prasad, one of the three signatories of the registration form, denied that the registration was compelled by a US investigation of the organisation as had been contended by some. “OFBJP has voluntarily registered under FARA with DOJ, he said, adding, “OFBJP is not under any investigation.”A response was awaited from the US justice department to a request from Hindustan Times to confirm or deny that an investigation was underway.Prasad said the members of the organisation learned about FARA regulation “very recently and upon review of the regulation; we thought it best to register voluntarily”. He added, “We haven’t suspended any of our activities. We are fully functional.”The department of justice says, “FARA is an important tool to identify foreign influence in the United States and address threats to national security. The central purpose of FARA is to promote transparency with respect to foreign influence within the United States by ensuring that the US government and the public know the source of certain information from foreign agents intended to influence American public opinion, policy and laws, thereby facilitating informed evaluation of that information.”“Willful violation” of the law is punishable with up to five years in jail and or a maximum fine of $250,000, or both. The punishment for certain lesser violations is a jail term of no more than six months or a fine of $5,000, or both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-affiliate-of-bjp-registers-as-foreign-agent/story-vUFzyF4pYIFVEpy4I9o62L.html
10-09-2020||World||AstraZeneca vaccine trial pause a ‘wake-up call’, says WHO||AstraZeneca’s pause of an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus after the illness of a participant is a “wake-up call” but should not discourage researchers, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) chief scientist said on Thursday. “This is a wake-up call to recognise that there are ups and downs in clinical development and that we have to be prepared,” Soumya Swaminathan told a virtual briefing from Geneva. “We do not have to be discouraged. These things happen.”Governments are desperate for a vaccine to help end the Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil, and the WHO had flagged AstraZeneca’s, being developed with Oxford University, as the most promising.However, the drugmaker suspended late-stage trials this week after a participant in Britain suffered from neurological symptoms.“It’s a race against this virus, and it’s a race to save lives. It’s not a race between companies, and it’s not a race between countries,” added WHO’s head of emergencies Mike Ryan.More than 27.95 million people have been reported infected globally, according to a Reuters tally.WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said a combination of factors is helping reduce death rates in Europe, including finding cases earlier and better clinical care.“We are in a better position to prevent the virus from infecting vulnerable populations,” she said, cautioning, however, that the disease’s long-term effects were still not known.WHO General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who on Thursday upped his fundraising plea to $38 billion for the agency’s ACT Accelerator programme to fight Covid-19, declined to comment directly on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had downplayed the virus’s dangers while criticizing the WHO’s response.“What worries me the most is what I have been saying all along: a lack of solidarity,” Tedros said. “When we are divided, it is a good opportunity for the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-pause-a-wake-up-call-says-who/story-hvk0FgVpeT9nuYfeICamBO.html
10-09-2020||World||Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu pressed to sign conflict-of-interest deal||With Israel’s prime minister lashing out at him nearly every day, the country’s attorney general is pressing Benjamin Netanyahu to sign a conflict-of-interest agreement barring him from influencing key appointments that could affect his corruption trial.Charged in a series of scandals, Netanyahu has long accused police, prosecutors and the media of trying to oust him in a deep-state conspiracy. Netanyahu has stepped up those attacks in recent days, following a pair of TV reports alleging cover-ups by police and prosecutors, including a case of possible conflict of interest by a police investigator.“Is it possible the attorney general didn’t know about this behavior?” Netanyahu told his Likud Party on Wednesday, calling for an independent investigation. “Is it possible the attorney general didn’t approve this behavior?”In a speech last week, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said the trial should take place in the courtroom, not in the “public square,” and warned against attempts to “delegitimize” the legal system. He reiterated his position that Netanyahu can remain in office while on trial, but only if there is a conflict-of-interest agreement that “prevents him from any possibility of influencing his personal criminal issues by exercising his governmental powers.”The Justice Ministry said Thursday that Netanyahu’s legal team was discussing the matter with government lawyers. “In the end, an agreement is expected to be signed to prevent a conflict of interest,” it said.Netanyahu’s Likud Party declined comment.Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving wealthy associates and powerful media moguls.He denies wrongdoing and has repeatedly tried to use the platform of his office to challenge the allegations and turn public opinion against the country’s legal system.Critics accuse him of threatening Israel’s democratic institutions in a politically motivated campaign of self-preservation, even at a time when Israel is dealing with a raging coronavirus outbreak.Channel 12 TV reported this week that police covered up knowledge of an investigator’s romantic relationship with the sister of a key witness and defendant in one of the corruption cases.Netanyahu’s rival and coalition partner Benny Gantz has vowed to support law enforcement, calling Netanyahu’s repeated attacks a “danger to Israeli democracy.”“This is not legitimate criticism; rather, it is purely an attempt to dismantle and to crush,” Gantz said.Thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating weekly outside Netanyahu’s official residence throughout the summer, saying he should resign while on trial and accusing him of failing to address the economic crisis caused by the outbreak.The Likud and Gantz’s Blue and White formed their coalition in May after battling to a stalemate in three consecutive elections in under a year. Under the deal, Netanyahu and Gantz will rotate as prime minister, with Ganz’s official title now being the “alternate prime minister.”There is deep distrust between the sides, and protracted paralysis has prevented the government from making key appointments, such as that of a national police chief.Critics believe that Netanyahu is eager to appoint supporters to these positions in hopes of delaying or even halting his trial, which after beginning with procedural hearings this year is set to kick into high gear in January with its evidentiary stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-benjamin-netanyahu-pressed-to-sign-conflict-of-interest-deal/story-JbkYMn31Q3PT7c4Et4LblJ.html
10-09-2020||World||12 held in Pakistan after woman allegedly raped on highway||Police in Pakistan said 12 men have been detained for questioning after two armed men allegedly raped a woman at gun point in front of her children after her car broke down on a deserted highway. The alleged rape in Lahore-Sialkot motorway on Wednesday night led to outrage in the country, with people from all walks of life demanding the apprehension of the suspects.Inspector-General of Punjab Police Inam Ghani said on Thursday they have obtained “evidence” that will lead them to the culprits. “We have done great work so far in the motorway rape case. We have located the village from which the suspects were from,” Ghani told Geo Pakistan channel.The woman was allegedly assaulted while waiting for help with her car, which stalled as she crossed a toll plaza on the motorway.She got a call from a male relative in the nearby city of Gujranwala, who asked her to call the police helpline for help while he also left from home to reach her. When he reached the location, he reportedly found the woman terrified, with her cloths stained in blood.Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh initially blamed the woman for the incident, for driving on the motorway late at night. Musarrat Cheema, a spokesperson in the eastern Punjab province, said earlier that raids were being conducted to trace and arrest the culprits.Human rights minister Shireen Mazari said her ministry’s regional office has asked for an action report from the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-held-in-pakistan-after-woman-allegedly-raped-on-highway/story-n0vV55HX4inMA33PCS0SNJ.html
10-09-2020||World||China troops from unit involved in India border clash to take part in Russia drills||China is sending troops from a unit involved in border clashes with India for a multilateral military exercise in Russia later this month, from which New Delhi had withdrawn.Pakistan, Iran, Myanmar, Belarus and Armenia are among countries taking part in the Kavkaz-2020 (or Caucasus 2020) strategic military drills to be held in Russia’s Astrakhan region on September 21-26, China’s defence ministry said in a statement on Thursday.The western theatre command (WAC), the unit of People’s Liberation Army involved in the ongoing border friction with India, will be sending troops for the drills, which the ministry said “are not aimed at any third party and are not related to the regional situation,” possibly referring to the China-India tensions.Late last month, India opted out of Kavkaz-2020 due to Covid-19 and consequent difficulties.“There is a decision not to take part in contact exercises in view of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our troops,” officials had told Hindustan Times in New Delhi. The expected presence in the exercise of troops from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, states that aren’t recognised by India, in Kavkaz-2020 was also a factor in the decision, one of the officials who wished to remain anonymous had told HT. With China announcing it’s sending WAC soldiers to the drill, New Delhi has possibly avoided an awkward situation by already pulling out.“The Chinese forces will mainly consist of troops from the PLA Western Theatre Command, which will carry wheeled equipment and light arms and arrive in Russia via China’s latest transport aircraft,” the defence ministry statement added.They will join exercises including mobilised defensive elimination, joint live-fire strike, multidimensional assault elimination and battlefield situation control.The exercises have special meaning for China-Russia ties “at this important moment when the whole world is fighting the pandemic,” the ministry said.Chinese state media questioned India’s withdrawal and speculated about the real reason for doing so.One state media foreign analyst said the pandemic cannot be the real reason.“That theory, however, ignores the fact that India was able to move many times that number of troops around the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China all throughout the summer, so it’s unrealistic to imagine that it can’t fly a few hundred out to Russia for friendly drills,” Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst wrote for the CGTN, China’s official English news channel.For Beijing and Russia, which have a “comprehensive strategic partnership”, the upcoming drills will be another opportunity to strengthen ties.The two powers have cooperated closely on military matters and diplomacy, largely to counter US influence. China has frequently joined Russia’s large-scale drills, the Tsentr-2019 and Vostok-2018. In July 2019, their troops conducted the first joint strategic patrol in northeast Asia, with the Chinese side dispatching two H-6K bombers and the Russian side dispatching two Tu-95 bombers. “In November and December 2019, the two countries also conducted naval drills in South Africa and the Gulf of Oman with South Africa and Iran respectively. In June, PLA honour guards participated in Russia’s Victory Day military parade in Moscow’s Red Square,” Chinese state media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-troops-from-unit-involved-in-india-border-clash-to-take-part-in-russia-drills/story-f8rqut1Asq5CZJowORXmmN.html
10-09-2020||World||In a year of social distancing, Covid-19 pandemic alters 9/11, too||In a year when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged.The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the Sept. 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, while President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden plan to attend a truncated ceremony at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania.In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly canceled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar sparked a change of heart. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters.Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to “Never Forget” is fading.“It’s another smack in the face,” says Jim Riches, who lost his son Jimmy, a firefighter.The father is staying home on the anniversary for the first time this year because he doesn’t want to take chances with the coronavirus after a prior illness. But he feels others should have the option of reciting the names of the dead on the memorial plaza, instead of listening to a recording.Memorial leaders said they wanted to avoid close contact among readers, who are usually paired at the podium. But to Riches, a retired fire battalion chief and frequent critic of the memorial organization, the decision sounds like an excuse for sidelining the families’ role in commemorating 9/11.“I wish they wouldn’t forget, but they’re trying to,” he says.But Anthoula Katsimatides sees the differences this year as an effort to ensure victims’ relatives feel comfortable attending — including her mother, who hasn’t left home since March because health issues make her especially worried about the virus. But she is determined to go in honor of her son John, a bond trader, her daughter said.In a year when many events have been called off, “this wasn’t canceled. It’s just been changed in such a way where we still get to pay tribute to our loved ones in a respectful and safe way,” said Katsimatides, who’s on the memorial board. She says the change wasn’t motivated by anything except a public health emergency.“Who expected COVID-19? ... It was completely unforeseen. As was 9/11,” she said.This year’s plans have been a balancing act at the sites where hijacked planes piloted by al-Qaida terrorists crashed on Sept. 11, 2001: New York, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.The Flight 93 memorial near Shanksville is trimming its usual 90-minute ceremony, partly by eliminating musical interludes. Memorial spokeswoman Katherine Cordek said the names of the 40 people killed there would be read, but by one person instead of multiple family members.The Pentagon hasn’t yet detailed its plans for the anniversary.In New York — where the nation’s deadliest coronavirus spike early happened this spring but has since been fairly well contained — leaders of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum said their plan for a no-reading ceremony would honor both virus precautions and 9/11 families’ attachment to being at ground zero on the anniversary.But another 9/11-related organization, the Stephen Stiller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, quickly arranged its own simultaneous ceremony a few blocks away, saying victims’ relatives could recite names while keeping a safe distance.“We need to keep letting America know what happened 19 years ago. And they need to see that emotion of the day, not a recording,” says chairman Frank Siller. He says he may attend both observances to honor the brother he lost, firefighter Stephen.Meanwhile, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told current firefighters in a memo last month that the department “strongly recommends” members not participate in 9/11 observances. The department did hold a limited-attendance ceremony Wednesday to add names to a memorial wall recognizing members who died after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage.Tensions over anniversary plans flared anew when the memorial announced last month it was nixing the Tribute in Light, twin blue beams that shine into the night sky over lower Manhattan. While there’s no official gathering to view the lights, the memorial cited virus risks to the installation crew.The cancellation outraged some victims’ relatives, police and fire unions and politicians, who noted that construction sites around the city were deemed safe to reopen months ago. After the Tunnel to Towers foundation said it would organize the display on its own, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, the memorial’s billionaire chairman, stepped in to keep the memorial-sponsored lights on. (Tunnel to Towers is now stationing lights at the Flight 93 memorial and the Pentagon.)Memorial President Alice Greenwald later said the organization “should have approached this issue differently.”Still, the memorial’s moves fanned mistrust among some 9/11 victims’ relatives who wonder how long the name-reading and other observances will continue.Katismatides, the board member, foresees the ceremony returning to normal next year.Debra Epps has been to the ground zero ceremony every year. She said it means a lot to her to read names and add a few words in tribute to her brother Christopher, an accountant.Still, she thinks the memorial was right to forgo the live name-reading this year. The virus has her concerned enough that she’s not planning to attend.“It really is a hard decision to make, but I know that we’re still in this pandemic,” said Epps, who works in health care.“I will remember my brother, no matter what,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-year-of-social-distancing-covid-19-pandemic-alters-9-11-too/story-nsL1fAhcGUXM8O7j2Adk2L.html

The Lebanese army said the fire is at a warehouse where oil and tires are placed in the duty free zone at the port adding that fighting the blaze is ongoing and that army helicopters are taking part in the operation.Panicked residents — still struggling to get over last month’s catastrophic explosion — cracked open windows and called each other to warn them of the new fire. Local TV stations said the companies that have offices near the port have asked their employees to leave the area. Lebanese troops closed the major road that passes near the port referring traffic to other areas.The August 4 explosion killed more than 190 people, injured around 6,500 and damaged thousands of buildings in the Lebanese capital. The sight of another huge fire a month later created panic among residents traumatized by last month’s explosion.State-run National News Agency said the fire was at a warehouse where tires are placed. It added that firefighters are dealing with the blaze. Army helicopters were taking part in efforts to extinguish the fire.A video circulating on social media showed workers at the port running away in fear as soon as the fire broke out, a chilling reminder of last month’s blast that killed dozens of port employees and 10 fire fighters.Beirut Gov Marwan Abboud and authorities called on people to stay away from roads leading to the port to allow fire engines to move quickly.Police spokesman Col. Joseph Msalam said they have no information about what is happening at the port adding that the facility is currently under control of the army.Asked about reports that the fire was caused by burning tires and oil, he said: “I don’t know. It could be containers. I really don’t know what is there.” It was the second fire at the port this week. On Tuesday, a small fire erupted, also creating some panic, that was quickly extinguished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-fire-breaks-out-at-beirut-port-a-month-after-explosion/story-5LACtnz0YpAJlWn1qzC1LP.html
10-09-2020||World||ByteDance may miss US deadline for TikTok deal||ByteDance Ltd. is increasingly likely to miss a Trump administration deadline for the sale of its TikTok U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.ByteDance probably needs beyond the U.S. executive order ban on Sept. 20 to nail down an agreement with either party because of the regulatory review, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, one of the people said. The officials haven’t been willing to give specific guidance on what kind of deal would work, the person said.Microsoft and Oracle, which had submitted proposals before the Chinese regulations hit, both continue to be interested in buying the U.S. arm of the hit video app and have not been dissuaded by Beijing’s involvement, the people said. The bidders have asked ByteDance to get as much clarity as possible from Beijing on the new regulations, which prohibit the export of certain artificial intelligence technologies that TikTok uses, they said.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s signoff. It’s also possible that ByteDance pulls out of a sale altogether if it determines it can’t satisfy both governments, the bidders and its own shareholders.A company representative offered no immediate comment.ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has been caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. The serial entrepreneur has been reluctant to give up U.S. TikTok from the start because he sees the business as a viable long-term competitor to Facebook Inc. and Google. He came under pressure to cede control when the Trump administration said it would ban the app and his own venture investors pressed for a sale to salvage some value from the operation.The Trump administration is divided over whether to give ByteDance more time or simply proceed with the ban. Donald Trump himself has called the app a national security risk, passing an executive order to ban the service this month and approving a separate decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to force a sale by mid-November.ByteDance has sued in the U.S. to block the executive order ban, arguing that putting it out of business without adequate notice and a fair chance to respond deprives it of its due-process rights in violation of the Constitution. The Beijing-based company has also denied its app represents a security threat and said no data from American users is shared with China.In negotiations earlier this year, ByteDance had attempted to work out a U.S. sale that would allow it to retain a substantial interest in the American operations, but the Trump administration has pushed back on that idea. Zhang would still like a small slice of the operation, the people said. But Microsoft and its partner in the deal, Walmart Inc., want full ownership of the business, one person said, while Oracle’s stance isn’t clear.Analysts and bankers have estimated TikTok’s U.S. business is worth at least $20 billion, although the price would vary widely depending on what is included with the sale. The specific offers from Microsoft, which is teaming up with Walmart Inc., and Oracle, which has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital, could not be determined.China made its 11th-hour entry into the TikTok process the last weekend of August, just as ByteDance had two offers in hand and planned to review them in hopes of making a final decision by the close of Sunday, a different person said. Beijing’s move blindsided the company, this person said.Without any discussion or public announcement, China posted notification of new restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including speech recognition and techniques for personalizing content. The aim of the rules is not necessarily to block a sale of the U.S. operations, but to ensure Beijing is actively involved and to slow down the process, one person said. The review may well push finalization of any agreement beyond the U.S. elections in November, the person said.TikTok’s algorithms are not a big sticking point for the bidders, the second person said. Both Microsoft and Oracle have the technical chops to build their own algorithms and would get data to fine-tune them, the person said.ByteDance’s regulatory team and deal negotiators have discussed whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself.Zhang is still operating from a position of strength. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019.Investment bankers have begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S., and demand for initial public offerings from technology companies in the market is surging. Zhang stands to make billions no matter what happens with Trump and TikTok U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bytedance-may-miss-us-deadline-for-tiktok-deal/story-7mvTf04VtUzMCvpE7acy5K.html

Though such interruptions are common in vaccine studies, the drugmaker and its boss are facing questions about what exactly caused the issue and whether it could be related to the shot.“What we have here is a special set of circumstances where the whole world becomes involved in the conduct of a clinical trial,” Soriot said in his first public comments since the trial was halted. The decision on whether to resume the study is in the hands of a group of independent experts working to understand whether the patient’s illness was a coincidence or a result of the vaccine. “The reality is we all have to be very patient and see how it unfolds,” he said.Astra shares were little changed in London.It’s still not clear whether the patient has a condition called transverse myelitis, a suspected diagnosis, Soriot said.The CEO, speaking at a Tortoise Media event on Thursday, said he can’t evaluate the length of the trial pause. When tests are complete, the physicians will share the data with the safety committee, he said.US National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told a Senate committee on Wednesday the trial had been halted due to a “spinal cord problem”. AstraZeneca is one of several drug companies taking part in the US government’s Operation Warp Speed program to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astra-still-aiming-for-covid-vaccine-by-year-end-ceo-says/story-zILwQMP6rzP3j01gICqXRK.html
10-09-2020||World||China bars media coverage of Disney’s ‘Mulan’ after Xinjiang backlash - sources||Chinese authorities have told major media outlets not to cover Walt Disney Co’s release of “Mulan”, in an order issued after controversy erupted overseas over the film’s links with the Xinjiang region, four people familiar with matter told Reuters.Set to open in local theatres on Friday, Disney had high hopes for Mulan in China, but starving it of publicity in the country’s strictly censored media would be another blow to the $200 million production.Starring big-name Chinese actors - Jet Li, Gong Li, Donnie Yen and Liu Yifei - and based on a Chinese folk story, Mulan was tailored to appeal to audiences in China, the world’s second-largest movie market.But mixed reviews online and capacity limits in theatres due to coronavirus prevention measures were likely to weigh on its box office performance, even before major media outlets received a notice telling them to refrain from covering the movie.Three sources told Reuters media outlets had received the notice, two of whom said it was sent by the Cyberspace Administration of China. A fourth source at a major Chinese newspaper said he received a text message with a similar order from a senior colleague.No reason was given in the notice, but the sources said they believed it was because of the overseas backlash over the film’s links to Xinjiang.Neither the Cyberspace Administration or Disney immediately responded to requests for comment.Also Read: Human rights groups ask IOC to move Olympics from ChinaPartly shot in Xinjiang, Mulan’s credits included thanks to the authorities there, which prompted calls overseas for a boycott of the movie. China’s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.On Wednesday, the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, criticised the backlash against the movie in an editorial in its English edition, describing it as “another manifestation of the extreme ideologies regarding China among US public opinion.”Disney had worked to ensure Mulan tested well with Chinese audiences, and the company’s chief financial officer told investors on Wednesday that it was “very pleased” with the initial results of its release elsewhere.The movie was released on Disney’s streaming service in many markets, rather than in cinemas, due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Mulan is likely to be shown on more than 40% of China’s screens on Friday, according to data from Maoyan, a Tencent-backed ticketing platform. Chinese theatres are currently limiting capacity, typically at 50 percent.The film had sold 9.78 million yuan ($1.43 million) worth of tickets as of Thursday afternoon, accounting for 55% of all ticket sales sold across China for Friday’s shows.One analyst, who declined to be named because he said the situation is sensitive, predicted the film would earn a dismal 150 million yuan at mainland box offices, given early audience reviews.The film, which many have already seen online, has received a 4.7 score out of 10 on popular social media site Douban, where users leave reviews of films, books and music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bars-media-coverage-of-disney-s-mulan-after-xinjiang-backlash-sources/story-xYnys8xaAVO8nplOJgc0yM.html
10-09-2020||World||New York to mark 9/11 anniversary amid coronavirus pandemic||With crime on the rise, shops and apartments increasingly vacant and homeless people on the sidewalks, New York on Friday will mark the 19th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and a bitter fight with the White House.The city will hold its annual ceremony in memory of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the bloodiest terrorist attack in US history, punctuated by a minute’s silence at the exact moments that Al-Qaeda jihadists crashed two hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center towers.Instead of reading out the roll call of the dead, this year the families of victims have recorded themselves. But they will still be present at the “Ground Zero” memorial. The site museum will also open for the first time since the novel coronavirus brought the city to a standstill in March. Almost two decades after the attacks, September 11 remains synonymous with New York’s heroism and resilience. City leaders have emphasized the latter in the past months as the Covid-19 infection rate -- which killed 23,00 people here, the early epicenter of the disease in the United States -- has been lowered to under one percent.New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday reminded New Yorkers that their resilience is likely to be tested once again by the social and economic “after-effects” of the pandemic.Offices empty until 2021? Gale Brewer, president of borough of Manhattan, recognizes that the island renowned for its hustle and energy now faces an array of problems.Some of these stem directly from the coronavirus pandemic: almost all the white collar workers, such as bankers, traders and insurance employees, have been working from home since March. This has emptied Manhattan’s business hubs, leaving thousands of small stores and restaurants without customers.Boris Tulchinskiy, a 26-year-old software engineer, misses Manhattan but expects to “keep working from home” in neighboring New Jersey until July 2021.If the more than 60 million tourists who visit New York every year have gone, so too have New Yorkers, fleeing the city by the thousands. At least 35,000 people have moved out of Manhattan, judging by requests for absentee ballots for November’s presidential elections, Brewer said.Many businesses are now shuttered: between 2017 and 2020, the number of vacant commercial spaces has almost doubled, up by 78 percent, she said.Homeless people are now more visible due to the closure of numerous shelters for health reasons, and the transfer of almost 13,000 to live in less contagious conditions in Manhattan’s vacant hotels.The rise in homicides and shootings -- up 47 percent and 166 percent in August, compared with the previous year -- is one of the more striking aspects of the crisis hitting the city.Even if it is still far below the endemic levels of crime that plagued the city in the 1970s and 80s, New York, which prided itself on being one of the world’s safest cities, has now slipped back to 2012 crime levels, the New York Times reported.Trump wants to ‘kill New York’ “I can’t tell you how many phone calls I get from people especially in New York City, who are literally worried about the degradation of New York City,” governor Cuomo said Tuesday.Even as the city shows signs of revival -- which include museums reopening in late August and restaurants welcoming diners inside in late September -- its full recovery could take up to three years, Brewer said, citing the estimates of realtors.In the meantime, and less than two months from one of the most bitterly fought presidential contests in history, the crisis has become the focus of a dispute with Republican President Donald Trump.The native New Yorker, who made his name in real estate, insists that the rise in crime in the Democratic bastion is due to the incompetence of its leaders. On Tuesday he once again accused the mayor and the governor of “destroying” the city.New York officials in turn slammed Trump’s refusal to free up billions in emergency federal funds to help the city through the worst of the crisis.“Trump is actively trying to kill New York City. It is personal. I think it’s psychological,” Cuomo said. “He is trying to kill New York City.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-to-mark-9-11-anniversary-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story-x1VTIgFq6Wv92Lz2gDZWzK.html

State TV said Iranian submarines and drones were being deployed.Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, commander of the annual exercise dubbed Zolfaghar-99, said Wednesday the operation is aimed at “improving readiness in confronting foreign threats and any possible invasion.” Sayyari’s comments hinted at the threat of military conflict amid tensions between Iran and the US, which has sought to extend a years-long UN weapons embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October.Last month, US Central Command published a black-and-white video showing what appeared to be Iranian special forces fast-roping from a helicopter onto the oil tanker MT Wila, whose last position appeared to be off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates near the city of Khorfakkan. Iranian state television later acknowledged the brief seizure, referring to the operation as a routine inspection without elaborating.In July, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard fired a missile from a helicopter targeting a replica of a US aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz in an exercise aimed at threatening the USIn January, a US drone strike killed a top Iranian general at the Baghdad airport and Tehran responded by firing ballistic missiles at American forces in Iraq.Iran’s navy operates in the Gulf of Oman on the eastern side of the strait, through which 20 per cent of all oil shipping passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-military-begins-expansive-annual-exercise-amid-tensions-with-us/story-LeLlZTyRIxBSiDAXyhd3xK.html
10-09-2020||World||Pakistan main force behind drive to create ‘so-called Khalistan’: Canadian think tank||Pakistan is the main force nurturing the drive to create a ‘so-called Khalistan’ or independent homeland for Sikhs and the extremists backed by Islamabad pose serious threats to India and Canada, according to a report by a leading Canadian think tank. The report ‘Khalistan—A project of Pakistan’ from Macdonald-Laurier Institute notes that Pakistan is “really driving the Khalistan bus” at a time when the “Khalistan movement has been going nowhere in the Sikhs’ home state” of Punjab. Also Read: Govt attaches properties of US-based Sikhs for Justice leader and designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, first under amended UAPAThe report —authored by veteran journalist Terry Milewski, who has tracked pro-Khalistan groups in Canada for decades—says Pakistan’s support for pro-Khalistan group entails leveraging extremists based in Canada, including supporters with ties to terrorism, because of the lack of traction in Punjab. Though the Canadian government has already said it won’t recognise a so-called referendum on Khalistan scheduled for November by groups such as Sikhs For Justice, which was banned by India in 2019, the report warned the move “provides oxygen that fuels extremist ideologies, radicalises young Canadians, wreaks havoc on reconciliation, and usurps legislatures”, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute said. In their foreword to the report, former Canadian cabinet minister Ujjal Dossanjh and Shuvaloy Majumdar, a programme director at the think tank, said: “The Milewski report should be essential reading for any who wish to understand Pakistan’s influence in guiding the Khalistan proposition, its perversion of the Sikh faith, and its ongoing campaign of extremism and terrorism in two of the world’s important democracies.” Also Read: Pro-Khalistan group alleges India disrupted secessionist referendum, Canada rejects theoryThe Justin Trudeau government’s perceived softness towards pro-Khalistan groups in its first stint during 2015-19 was one of the key reasons for a downturn in India-Canada relations. The Liberal Party government in Canada cited freedom of expression as a major reason for allowing the activities of pro-Khalistan groups but this found few takers in New Delhi. The 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada originally cited “Sikh (Khalistani) extremist ideologies and movements” among the top five national security issues for the country, but this was later replaced in a revised version of the report by “extremists who support violent means to establish an independent state within India” following pressure from an international lobby campaign that advocates for an independent Khalistan, the report said. “The proposition of an independent Khalistan, in truth, is a backward idea from a backward time. It is a proposal without economic or democratic logic, unloved by the very Punjabis whose lives it would most directly affect. It is a fantasy rooted in religious bigotry and chauvinism, kept alive in Canada by thugs and political hustlers unbothered by the innocent lives that have been lost in its name,” Dossanjh and Majumdar said in their foreword. “It is a proposal hostile to Canada’s interest in seeing a united and prosperous India, and in that sense, threatens not just one country, but two. In the service of this cause, extremists animated by Pakistan seek to distort history and betray the vast majority of Sikhs who live in peace and freedom,” they added. Besides tracing the long-standing links between pro-Khalistan terror groups and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency and the way in which Khalistani terrorists were sheltered in Pakistan in the 1990s, the report notes the Canadian security establishment’s failure to prevent the bombing of Air India flight 182, which killed 329 people, a majority of them Canadian citizens. “No matter how low the support for Khalistan sinks in India—and it has sunk very low indeed—the cause still survives in Pakistan, where jihadist groups have made common cause with Sikh separatists against their shared enemy, India,” the report said. “An example is the leading Khalistani figure in Pakistan, Gopal Singh Chawla, who makes no bones about his friendly alliance with the Pakistani jihadist Hafiz Saeed, leader of the feared Lashkar-e-Taiba,” it added. A Canadian citizen, Satinderpal Singh Gill from Surrey, BC, lived for years in Pakistan as a senior official of the International Sikh Youth Federation, which has been banned as a terrorist organisation in India, Canada, the UK and the US, but not by Pakistan, the report noted. The report also highlighted the dichotomy between the harassment of the Sikh minority in Pakistan and the unstinted support offered by pro-Khalistan leaders such as Sikhs For Justice chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, one of the main movers behind the 2020 referendum. Though Panun claims to lead a movement for human rights, he sided with China in its border dispute with India and wrote to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, swearing that, “if India ever attacked Pakistan, the Pro-Khalistan Sikhs will extend full support to Pakistan”. The report also questioned the maps of the proposed Khalistan, noting that they don’t depict even “one inch [of] traditional Sikh lands in Pakistan—not to Lahore, where Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled over a Sikh empire two hundred years ago, or even to Nankana Sahib, sacred birthplace of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru”. “It appears, then, that Pakistan wants the Sikhs to be free, but not in Pakistan. The separatists, in turn, clearly know where their patron sets the limits. Even drawing a map which presumes upon Pakistan’s generosity is a step too far—one that could sever the lifeline which has sustained the dream of Khalistan for so long,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-main-force-behind-drive-to-create-so-called-khalistan-says-canadian-think-tank/story-9aLfR6qdxp2RkGedIzTuLM.html
10-09-2020||World||Kim Jong Un told Donald Trump about killing his uncle: Book||President Donald Trump’s comments about the threat from the novel coronavirus attracted widespread attention after excerpts from journalist Bob Woodward’s book “Rage” were released. The excerpts also provide new details about the president’s thoughts on North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, racial unrest and a mysterious new weapon that Trump claims other world powers don’t know about.Some of the other topics covered in the book, which was based on 18 interviews that Woodward conducted with Trump between December and July and with others (excerpts from the book were reported by The Washington Post, where Woodward is an editor, and Woodward wrote that Trump said he was impressed with Kim when he first met the North Korean leader in Singapore in 2018 and that Kim was “far beyond smart.” Trump also said that Kim “tells me everything” and even gave the president a graphic account of how Kim had his own uncle killed.As he engaged in nuclear arms talks with Kim, Trump dismissed intelligence officials’ assessments that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons. Trump told Woodward that the CIA has “no idea” how to handle Pyongyang.Trump also dismissed criticism about his three meetings with Kim, claiming the summits were no big deal. Critics said that by meeting Kim, Trump provided the North Korean leader with legitimacy on the world stage.“It takes me two days. I met. I gave up nothing,” said the president, who likened North Korea’s attachment to its nuclear arsenal to somebody who is in love with a house and “they just can’t sell it.” Kim welcomed Trump’s attention, calling the president “your excellency” in a letter. Kim wrote to Trump that he believed the “deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force.” In June, after federal agents forcibly removed protesters from Washington’s Lafayette Square to make way for Trump to stage a photo opportunity outside a church near the White House where he held up a bible, Trump called Woodward to boast about how he was for “law and order.” “We’re going to get ready to send in the military slash National Guard to some of these poor bastards that don’t know what they’re doing, these poor radical lefts,” Trump told Woodward, who recorded Trump.Later that month, Woodward asked the president if, as a white man, he had a responsibility to better “understand the anger and pain” felt by Black Americans.“No,” Trump replied. “I don’t feel that at all.” As Woodward pressed Trump about discrimination and inequalities suffered by Black people over the years, the president pointed to how the unemployment rate for Black Americans fell before the pandemic.When the two spoke again about race relations on June 22, Woodward asked Trump whether he thought there was systemic racism in America.“Well, I think there is everywhere,” Trump said. “I think probably less here than most places. Or less here than many places.” Asked by Woodward whether racism “is here” in the United States in a way that affects people’s lives, Trump replied: “I think it is. And it’s unfortunate. But I think it is.” In discussions with Woodward about rising tensions in 2017 between the US and North Korea, Trump said: “I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President Jinping) Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody — what we have is incredible.” Woodward writes that sources, who spoke to him on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the US military had a “secret new weapons system.” But the sources did not provide details and told Woodward, according to the book, that they were surprised Trump had disclosed it.Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Fox News’ “Special Report” on Wednesday that the president did not talk about any specific weapon system. “We’re always on the cutting edge and we’ve always got something out there that our adversaries don’t know about,” O’Brien said. Woodward’s book quotes Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, as saying, “The most dangerous people around the president are overconfident idiots.” The book also quotes Kushner as saying that he advised people to think about “Alice in Wonderland” when trying to understand the Trump presidency. The novel is about a girl who falls through a rabbit hole and Kushner, according to Woodward, singled out the Cheshire Cat, whom he said had endurance and persistence, not direction.Woodward’s book also discusses how some top-level administration officials contemplated quitting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-told-donald-trump-about-killing-his-uncle-book/story-xlrYZLV2TErYOG6baiFsVL.html
10-09-2020||World||Russian state hackers suspected in targeting Biden campaign firm: Report||Microsoft Corp recently alerted one of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s main election campaign advisory firms that it had been targeted by suspected Russian state-backed hackers, according to three people briefed on the matter.The hacking attempts targeted staff at Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said. A person familiar with SKDK’s response to the attempts said the hackers failed to gain access to the firm’s networks. “They are well-defended, so there has been no breach,” the person said.SKDK Vice Chair Hilary Rosen declined to comment. A Biden spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The hacking attempts on SKDK come as U.S. intelligence agencies have raised alarms about possible efforts by foreign governments to interfere in the November presidential election.Investigations by former special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate intelligence committee both concluded that affiliates of the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and Mueller has warned that Russia was meddling in the current campaign. One of the sources said it was not clear whether Biden’s campaign was the target or whether the Russians were attempting to gain access to information about other SKDK clients.SKDK managing director Anita Dunn was a White House communications director during the Barack Obama presidency and serves the Biden campaign as a senior advisor.The attempts to infiltrate SKDK were recently flagged to the campaign firm by Microsoft, which identified hackers tied to the Russian government as the likely culprits, according to the three sources briefed on the matter. The attacks included phishing, a hacking method which seeks to trick users into disclosing passwords, as well as other efforts to infiltrate SKDK’s network, the three sources said.A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.SKDK is closely associated with the Democratic Party, having worked on six presidential campaigns and numerous congressional races. In addition to its current work for Biden, the firm in 2018 worked on successful governor’s races in Kansas and Connecticut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exclusive-russian-state-hackers-suspected-in-targeting-biden-campaign-firm-sources/story-rOuTmifRfjWWx3B5kYqhkO.html

The wildfire, given the name ‘The North Complex Fire’, has also forced thousands of people to leave their homes.The deaths took place at two separate locations, taking the total number of fatalities due to the wildfire, which has been raging since August 17, to 11. Of the three people who lost their lives, one person was found in a car and apparently had been trying to escape the flames California Highway Patrol Officer Ben Draper told the Bay Area News Group.The North Complex Fire, which started as several separate blazes sparked by lightning, is one of more than two dozen burning in the California. including three of the five largest ever in the state. It has also threatened Paradise, a town devastated just two years ago by the deadliest blaze in state history that prompted a traffic jam as panicked residents tried to escape.Since the middle of August, fires in California have destroyed more than 3,600 structures, burned old growth redwoods, charred chaparral and forced evacuations in communities near the coast, in wine country and along the Sierra Nevada.The U.S. Forest Service, which had taken the unprecedented measure of closing eight national forests in Southern California earlier in the week, ordered all 18 of its forests in the state closed Wednesday for public safety.Also, a power shutoff, effected to prevent electric lines from sparking wildfires, which had caused the Paradise fire, prevented people from getting up-to-date information by internet, TV or their home phones. Residents leaving the town due to the wildfire also created a traffic jam leading out of town.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-dead-as-wildfire-devastates-northern-california/story-xnTSBbOJjxuOZwLYeiwSZL.html
10-09-2020||World||Donald Trump accepts downplaying Covid-19 threat to avoid global ‘frenzy’||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged that he had downplayed the Covid-19 outbreak, repeating and defending an assertion that he first made in American journalist Bob Woodward’s upcoming book Rage. Trump said he wanted to prevent the United States and the world from going into a “frenzy”.Speaking to reporters just hours after contents of the book were made public, on the basis of recordings from Trump’s on-record interviews with Woodward, the US president asserted he had shown leadership by trying to keep things calm and that his administration had done an “incredible job” with the coronavirus pandemic.Also in the book, President Trump talks about a previously undisclosed nuclear weapons system, castigates top generals, says he likes calling his predecessor by his first two names “Barack Hussein”, and gushes about his meetings and relationship with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for the November 3 US election, assailed Trump’s acknowledgement in Woodward’s book. “He knew and he purposefully downplayed it,” Biden said at an election event in Michigan, a battleground state. “Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to our country. For months.”Trump told Woodward that he knew exactly how serious the threat from the virus was, and he said in an interview back on February 7, “This is deadly stuff”. In public remarks though, Trump downplayed the crisis, portraying it as a passing threat in order to insulate his re-election chances.“The fact is, I’m a cheerleader for this country, I love our country, and I don’t want people to be frightened,” President Trump told reporters at a White House event when asked for a response to the book. “I don’t want to create panic... I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy.”Public health experts have advocated a more transparent approach, arguing Americans deserve to know the facts so as to be able to deal with them.The US president is battling mounting criticism of his administration’s response to the pandemic that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans, infected more than 6 million, crippled the economy rendering millions jobless, and left the US isolated in the global search for a resolution.Woodward’s book has cast new light on Trump’s response, or the lack of it, and his muddled approach to the worst health crisis confronting the country in more than 100 years.“This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” US national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump in an Oval Office meeting on January 28, Woodward writes in the book. “This is going to be the roughest thing you face.”Ten days later, on February 7, Trump called Woodward and said, in an on-record interview, “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu... This is deadly stuff,” he had said.But the US president conveyed an altogether different message to the American public then, as now. He said the threat to the US from the coronavirus will be over soon, magically.“I wanted to always play it down,” Trump told Woodward in an interview on March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-accepts-downplaying-covid-19-threat-to-avoid-global-frenzy/story-Lca3C1Wazfk8kVPvHaVfuI.html

He said the city’s coronavirus positivity rate, the proportion of daily tests with positive results, holding steady below 1% was another important factor.The city banned indoor dining in mid-March as the pandemic worsened. Hammered by the loss in business, restaurants looked to takeout and delivery orders to keep them afloat.In June, outdoor dining was approved, and restaurants got creative by putting tables on sidewalks, rooftops and even boats, festooning them with lights, umbrellas and festive decor. A plan to reopen indoor dining in July was delayed due to Covid-19 concerns.Restaurateurs expressed relief at Wednesday’s news. “I was kind of worried it was not going to happen,” said Giovanni Gelfini, the owner of Santa Panza, a restaurant in Brooklyn. “Twenty-five percent is not that much but it’s something where you can do some math and know, more or less, how many customers you can have every day.”At a news conference, Cuomo acknowledged the risk of future outbreaks but also stressed the economic pain the restrictions have caused. He said capacity could be lifted to 50% by Nov. 1.“A restaurant is not just the restaurant owner....There is a whole industry around restaurants,” Cuomo said.The state will expand its task force charged with enforcing restaurant compliance, and New York City will provide 400 additional inspectors to support that effort, he said.Restaurants will have to check the temperature of customers at the door and obtain contact information for contact tracing should there be an outbreak.Cuomo said the state would also establish a system encouraging customers to report restaurants not in compliance.“This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all New Yorkers,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

10-09-2020||World||JPMorgan finds some workers improperly pocketed Covid-19 relief funds||JPMorgan Chase & Co. found that some of its employees improperly applied for and received Covid-relief money that was intended for legitimate US businesses hurt by the pandemic, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The bank discovered the actions, all of which were tied to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, after noticing that suspicious amounts of money had been deposited into checking accounts owned by bank employees, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The findings prompted an unusual all-staff message from JPMorgan Tuesday that puzzled many across the industry for its candid admission of potentially illegal acts by some of its own while not describing what they had done.The Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program had been expanded significantly after the pandemic led to rolling shutdowns across the country, leaving many small enterprises in need of a cash lifeline. Unlike with the Paycheck Protection Program, banks didn’t issue or underwrite the disaster loans and grants. Instead, loans or grants came directly from the SBA.The findings of employee misconduct came in a broader sweep of individual accounts that received business aid, the person said, noting the bank fired people it believes improperly tapped the money. The SBA warned banks July 22 to be on the lookout for suspicious deposits or activity as part of the EIDL program.The agency’s inspector general has since flagged evidence of fraud in the program, saying it identified more than $250 million in aid given to potentially ineligible recipients as well as $45.6 million in possibly duplicate payments. A Bloomberg Businessweek analysis of SBA data last month identified $1.3 billion in suspicious payments.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.The nation’s largest bank sent a memo to roughly 256,000 employees Tuesday in which senior leaders said they were probing whether any staffers helped people misuse aid programs including “Paycheck Protection Program Loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs.” The firm had said it identified conduct by customers that didn’t meet its principles and “may even be illegal” and that some employees had fallen short on ethical standards, too.The firm’s leaders decided to send the memo to highlight the widespread abuse of relief programs they’d found, the person said, and the message asked employees to report any unethical activity they’d witnessed.While the bank has identified rampant misuse of the EIDL program, only a small percentage of it has been tied to bank employees, said the person. The bank hasn’t found evidence of wrongdoing by employees related to the PPP program, the person said.The Small Business Administration has been scrambling to clamp down on abuse of the loan program designed to mitigate business disaster, according to a watchdog report Wednesday. That assessment was based on internal emails obtained by the group, including one that noted “widespread presence of fraudulent applications.”Have a tip about how virus relief funds are used or misused?

10-09-2020||World||Palestinian FM urges Arab states to dismiss Israel-UAE deal||The Palestinian foreign minister has called on Arab states to dismiss a deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to normalise relations, describing the agreement scheduled to be finalised next week as “an earthquake”. The UAE and Israel announced the deal to establish full diplomatic relations on August 13. It reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch-enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians. Most of the Arab world has long rejected diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967. That steadfast support for the Palestinians, however, has begun to weaken in recent years, in large part because of shared enmity with Israel toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. The Palestinians have repeatedly voiced their rejection of the US-brokered Israel-UAE deal as trading away one of the few cards they have in moribund peace talks with Israel to establish their own independent state -- the Arab boycott of Israel. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki told the Arab League in Wednesday’s meeting that the Palestinian Authority called for an emergency meeting following the announcement of the UAE-Israeli deal. He said one Arab League member opposed a Palestinian request to add an item to the meeting agenda, an apparent reference to a Palestinian-introduced draft resolution on the deal. Al-Malki did not name the country. The meeting was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic. Al-Malki described the deal between the UAE and Israel as “an earthquake” that hit the Arab consensus over the Palestinian cause and he urged Arab foreign ministers to reject the deal, “otherwise our meeting will be considered a blessing or collusion with it, or a cover for it”. Hossam Zaki, the Arab League’s deputy secretary general, told a news conference in Cairo that the foreign ministers failed to reach a compromise on a resolution on the UAE-Israeli deal because of differences between the Palestinians and Emirates on the wording of the Palestinian-introduced draft. “A draft resolution needs more time and extensive consultations... we hope in the future to reach an agreed form,” he said. The UAE presented the agreement, which is scheduled to be signed on September 15, as taking Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank off the table. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the pause was “temporary”. Al-Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, rejected the argument, saying that Palestinians’ resistance to and rejection of Israel’s annexation policies were the cause of Israel’s suspension of its plans. He accused the US of pressuring other Arab countries to normalise ties with Israel, which he described as a “colonial and racist occupation”. He was apparently referring to Sudan, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited last month to push its transitional authorities to establish diplomatic ties with Israel.

10-09-2020||World||Official claims pressure to alter Homeland Security intel about Russia||A Department of Homeland Security official said in a whistleblower complaint released Wednesday that he was pressured by more senior officials to suppress facts in intelligence reports that President Donald Trump might find objectionable, including information about Russian interference in the election and the rising threat posed by white supremacists.The official, Brian Murphy, alleged that senior DHS officials also pressed him to alter reports so they would reflect administration policy goals and that he was demoted for refusing to go along with the changes and for filing confidential internal complaints about the conduct.Murphy, a former FBI agent and Marine Corps veteran, was demoted in August from his post as principal deputy under secretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. He is seeking to be reinstated in a complaint filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General.Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, released the complaint, which he said contained “grave and disturbing” allegations. He said Murphy has been asked to give a deposition to Congress as part of an investigation into intelligence collection by DHS related to its response to protests in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.“We will get to the bottom of this, expose any and all misconduct or corruption to the American people, and put a stop to the politicization of intelligence,” the California Democrat said.A Homeland Security spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, said the department generally does not comment on referrals to the inspector general but denied Murphy’s allegations. “DHS looks forward to the results of any resulting investigation and we expect it will conclude that no retaliatory action was taken against Mr. Murphy,” he said.The complaint came the same day that acting Secretary Chad Wolf, who has been nominated by Trump to lead the agency, gave a “state of the Homeland” speech in which he said DHS is working to thwart election interference from any foreign power and all threats regardless of ideology.“DHS stands in absolute opposition to any form of violent extremism whether by white supremacist extremists or anarchist extremists,” Wolf said. “We will continue our daily efforts to combat all forms of domestic terror.”Murphy said in his complaint that he was directed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy DHS secretary, to modify a section of a report to make the threat posed by white supremacists less severe. He was told to play up the threat posed by left-wing groups to echo administration talking points around civil unrest following the protests over the killing of George Floyd.Murphy said he refused to alter the report because doing so would “constitute an abuse of authority and improper administration of an intelligence program.” He was then taken off the project.He said he made a number of reports on Russian disinformation efforts to senior DHS and administration officials between March 2018 and March 2020. The details are classified and not included in the whistle-blower complaint.Then, in July, Wolf told him to hold back any reports on Russian election interference because they “made the president look bad,” according to the complaint. He also said Wolf told him to report on interference by China and Iran, instead of Russia, and those instructions came from White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien. Murphy said he objected and was excluded from future meetings on the subject.Trump has repeatedly resisted claims of Russian interference, including doubting findings by U.S. officials and lawmakers that Russia meddled in the 2016 campaign to help him and sow chaos in the electoral process. He has dismissed reports that Russia is continuing to interfere in the 2020 race, claiming that China is the more pernicious threat, even though a statement from intelligence officials last month said Moscow was directly trying to undermine Democrat Joe Biden.Murphy said that, after he was removed from working on a DHS intelligence report, a draft was leaked to the media in which Russia’s interference was placed on an equal footing as activities by Iran and China in a way that was “misleading and inconsistent with the actual intelligence,” the complaint said.Murphy came to DHS in March 2018 from the FBI, where his career included being assigned to the New York field office on Sept. 11, 2001. In his complaint, he alleged that efforts to manipulate the intelligence he oversaw started under former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.He said Nielsen and her deputies pressed him to vastly overstate the number of migrants apprehended at the southwest border who have confirmed links to any terrorist organization. That occurred as the Trump administration was rolling out tougher measures against illegal immigration. Murphy said he declined to confirm an inflated figure, saying to do so would be not only improper but illegal. The secretary nonetheless provided the incorrect figure to Congress.Cuccinelli, he said, pressed him to change reports on conditions in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras as the administration was seeking to halt a surge of people seeking asylum from Central America at the U.S.-Mexico border.“Mr. Cuccinelli expressed frustration with the intelligence reports, and he accused unknown ‘deep state intelligence analysts’ of compiling the intelligence information to undermine President Donald J. Trump’s policy objectives with respect to asylum,” he said in the complaint.Murphy said that over the summer he was instructed by Wolf and Cuccinelli to alter assessments on protests to make sure “they matched up” with Trump’s statements on the involvement of antifa and anarchists in the demonstrations in Portland and elsewhere. He said he told them he would only report accurate information.Shortly thereafter, Wolf reassigned him to the management division. That followed media reports that Murphy’s unit collected information on journalists covering the DHS response to the protests. Murphy said the reports were incorrect and Wolf agreed but said it would be “politically good” to move him while the acting secretary hoped to be nominated to the secretary post by Trump.The complaint, which also asks that officials who retaliated against Murphy be given written reprimands, was filed by Mark Zaid, a prominent attorney who also represented the whistle-blower who spurred the Trump impeachment inquiry.Zaid said in a statement that Murphy “followed proper, lawful whistleblower rules in reporting serious allegations of misconduct” and would cooperate with congressional investigations into the matter, especially in a classified setting.______Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/official-claims-pressure-to-alter-homeland-security-intel-about-russia/story-3mGqZwj8Hfpqp46OTFGScN.html
10-09-2020||World||California wildfire explodes, burning across 25 miles in day||A Northern California wildfire burning for more than three weeks roared to life after being stoked by high winds, spreading at a ferocious rate across an estimated 25 miles (40 kilometers) of mountainous terrain and parched foothills.As thick smoke choked the air Wednesday and cast an eerie orange hue across much of the region, a number of small communities near Oroville were ordered to evacuate. The fire even threatened the town of Paradise that was devastated just two years ago by the deadliest blaze in state history, causing a panic that led to a traffic jam as residents tried to escape.Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the fire had conservatively burned about 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers) in 24 hours.“The unbelievable rates of spread now being observed on these fires — it is historically unprecedented,” Swain tweeted.The North Complex fire was one of more than two dozen in the state, including three of five largest ever as wildfires burned across parts of the West amid gusty, dry conditions. Forecasters said some weather relief was in sight that could help firefighters overwhelmed by the blazes.In Washington, more acres burned in a single day than firefighters usually see all year. Fires also forced people to flee homes in Oregon and Idaho. A blast of polar air helped slow wildfires in Colorado and Montana.Since the middle of August, fires in California have killed eight people, destroyed more than 3,600 structures, burned old growth redwoods, charred chaparral and forced evacuations in communities near the coast, in wine country and along the Sierra Nevada.The U.S. Forest Service, which had taken the unprecedented measure of closing eight national forests in Southern California earlier in the week, ordered all 18 of its forests in the state closed Wednesday for public safety.The fire raging outside Oroville, 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, was burning in the Plumas National Forest after a series of wildfires sparked Aug. 17 by lightning had merged.The fire jumped the middle fork of the Feather River on Tuesday and, driven by 45 mph (72 km/h) winds, leapt into a canopy of pines and burned all the way to Lake Oroville — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) — said Jake Cagle, one of the fire chiefs involved.Firefighters were focused on saving lives and homes instead of trying to halt the fire’s advance, Cagle said.A massive cloud of smoke covered much of California, darkening morning skies and later casting a sunsetlike glow over the northern part of the state.In Paradise, where 85 people lost their lives and nearly 19,000 buildings were destroyed, the sky turned from black to cherry red and ash carried on strong winds rained down in a scene reminiscent from the fateful morning of Nov. 8, 2018, former Mayor Steve “Woody” Culleton said.“It was extremely frightening and ugly,” Culleton said. “Everybody has PTSD and what not, so it triggered everybody and caused terror and panic.”A power shutoff to prevent electric lines from sparking wildfires — the cause of the Paradise fire — prevented people from getting up-to-date information by internet, TV or their home phones, Culleton said. Many of the residents decided to leave and created a traffic jam leading out of town, another scary reminder of the bottleneck where several residents died two years ago.In Southern California, fires burned in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. People in foothill communities east of Los Angeles were warned to be ready to flee, but the region’s notorious Santa Ana winds were weaker than predicted.“We’re encouraged that the wind activity appears to be dying down,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “The rest of the week looks a little more favorable.”Three firefighters injured along the Central Coast on Tuesday when they were overrun trying to protect a mountaintop fire station above Big Sur were expected to make full recoveries and could be discharged by the end of the week, Los Padres National Forest spokesman Andrew Madsen said.The injured firefighters and 11 others had to deploy emergency fire shelters — a last ditch safety measure — when winds unexpectedly shifted, Madsen said.“It’s a really harrowing experience for those who go through a close encounter like that and we’re very grateful that the injuries are such that all three who were hospitalized are going to recover and return to work,” he said.That fire, which had doubled overnight Tuesday and burned terrain that hadn’t seen fire in 40 years, destroyed an office, two fire engines, barracks and all the firefighters’ personal belongings inside.California has set a record with nearly 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) burned already this year, and historically the worst of the wildfire season doesn’t begin until fall.Pacific Gas & Electric was deploying more than 3,000 employees Wednesday to inspect power lines before restoring energy to about 167,000 customers whose electricity was turned off to prevent fires from being started by wind-damaged wires. Some aerial inspections were paused because of smoke limiting visibility, said spokesman Jeff Smith.Only a very small number of customers had power turned off in Southern California.___Melley reported from Los Angeles.

10-09-2020||World||England tightens socialising rules as Covid-19 infections rise||Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions on social gatherings in England on Wednesday, saying there was a clear need to act after a spike in Covid-19 infections.Speaking at a televised news conference, flanked by his top medical advisers, Johnson said groups of more than six people would be banned from meeting, in what he called a “rule of six” that was easier to understand than previous guidance.“I wish that we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives,” he said, stressing that police and other agencies would be enforcing the rules more actively.“I will be absolutely clear. This is not, these measures are not, another national lockdown. The whole point is to avoid a second national lockdown,” he added.He also announced an ambitious “moonshot” plan, which he said was not guaranteed to succeed, in which mass testing that delivers fast results could be used to grant more freedom to those confirmed not to have the virus.“We’re hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring,” he said.The number of cases in Britain has begun to rise sharply again in recent days, prompting Johnson to deliver a news conference in his Downing Street office, just as he and other ministers did on a daily basis during the worst of the crisis.England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said Britain’s numbers were following a similar pattern to that seen in France four weeks ago, and risked continuing to rise sharply as they had done there.He cited Belgium as an example of a country that had seen a similar increase in cases but had managed to reverse the trend through decisive action.“This is a clear indication that if you act rapidly and decisively when these changes are happening, there is a reasonable chance, or a good chance, of bringing the rates back down under control,” Whitty said.He said the measures were likely to remain in place for more than a few weeks, and warned that difficult times lay ahead as winter conditions made it easier for the virus to spread.Although testing is more widespread and the number of people in hospital is well below the peak of the outbreak, ministers fear it is beginning to slip out of control, particularly among people in their late teens and their 20s.Prior to the rule of six, the limit on the number of people who could socialise together was 30.The United Kingdom reported 2,659 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 earlier on Wednesday, up from 2,460 on Tuesday. The figures were close to 3,000 on Sunday and Monday - a sharp rise from levels of around 1,000 per day in August, attributed to high transmission among young people.The new rules will not apply to workplaces or schools, and there will be exemptions for weddings, funerals and some organised team sports. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own lockdown policies.

10-09-2020||World||Summer to snow in 24 hours as Rockies ride weather roller-coaster||Summer came to an abrupt halt in parts of the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday as temperatures reaching into the 90s (Faherenheit) plunged by around 60 degrees F (over 15 degree Celsius) in less than 24 hours, with a powerful surge of cold air from Canada unleashing snow and damaging winds in several states.The roller coaster weather ripped up trees by their roots, piled up snow that shut down parts of the scenic road through Glacier National Park and knocked out power to tens of thousands. But the temperature drop gave some relief to crews fighting wildfires in Colorado and Montana that had ballooned in hot, windy weather and forced people to flee their homes.Snow fell in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming and forecasters predicted up to a foot (30cm) in the mountains and temperatures in the teens (-7 Celsius) overnight. “We went from record heat to snow within a matter of 24 hours,” said Evan Direnzo, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Colorado. “Any average person would see this a couple of times in their life.”In Utah, where temperatures dropped by 40 degrees F, wind gusts of nearly 100mph roared through the Salt Lake City area, downing trees and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. Since forecasters began keeping records about 150 years ago, a one-day change in temperature of 55 degrees F (nearly 13 degrees C) or more has occurred two dozen times in Denver, according to the NWS.Six inches (15cm) or more of snow could fall in the northern and central Rockies, with 1 to 2 feet (30-60cm) dropping in the highest peaks, the NWS said. It has issued scattered winter storm warnings and weather advisories from southern Montana to southern Colorado. Freeze and frost warnings also were posted for parts of Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota and Minnesota.The weather was gradually expected to warm up, with temperatures back in the 80s by the weekend in Denver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/summer-to-snow-in-24-hours-as-rockies-ride-weather-roller-coaster/story-wwrQkUwGfbCAK2wAtIJp8I.html
10-09-2020||World||Trump knew exactly how serious Covid-19 is, but downplayed it: Book||President Donald Trump knew way back in January exactly how serious the threat Covid-19 posed to the US was, but always wanted to “play it down”, according to a forthcoming book by legendary investigative journalist Bob Woodward.“This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump during an Oval Office meeting on January 28, Woodward writes in the book, Rage, according to The Washington Post, where Woodward works as an associate editor. “This is going to be the roughest thing you face,” O’Brien had added.Ten days later, Trump called Woodward and said in an on-record interview: “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.”“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu,” he said in the interview, which was released on Wednesday and aired by news channels. “This is deadly stuff.” Also read| Trump downplaying Covid-19 is historic national tragedy: Nancy PelosiBut the president conveyed an altogether different message to the American public then, as he does now. He had said that the threat to the US from the coronavirus was ephemeral and will somehow be over magically.“I wanted to always play it down,” the president told Woodward in another interview on March 19.Trump is battling continuing criticism of his handling of the pandemic, with allegations that he deliberately downplayed it and ignored advice of his health experts so as to not negatively impact his re-election chances. His administration’s response has polled poorly with Americans as well.But the president has fought back, claiming he did well by shutting down the country from travellers from China early, ramping up production of ventilators and protective gear for health care personnel. Woodward’s book is based on several on-record interviews with the president, and will join a growing collection of accounts scrutinising Trump’s character and performance in office in the weeks near the November 3 elections.It covers the president’s response to the anti-racism unrest, meetings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and many other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-knew-exactly-how-serious-covid-19-is-but-downplayed-it-book/story-zHbgCxCe8aqqP4SQN7masJ.html
10-09-2020||World||Over 300 civil society groups urge more scrutiny of China on human rights||More than 300 civil society groups including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the International Service for Human Rights are urging the United Nations to set up an international watchdog to address human rights violations by the Chinese government.In an open letter published Wednesday, the groups say they are seeking greater scrutiny of and response to violations in places like Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as beyond — such as through censorship, development that hurts the environment and the targeting of rights defenders.The call for the creation of an “independent international mechanism” to focus on China’s rights violations adds to recent international pressure on Beijing over its handling of issues like protests in Hong Kong and detention centers — what the government calls vocational or training centers — for Uighur Muslims and others in western Xinjiang region.“China has systematically persecuted rights defenders in reprisal for their cooperation with UN human rights operations – torture, enforced disappearance, imprisonment, and stripping licenses from lawyers,” said Renee Xia, director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, in a statement. “The UN system should no longer tolerate such treatment.”The move follows a call by independent experts who work with the United Nations for a special session of the Human Rights Council focusing on the array of issues around China’s rights record. Advocates insist that no country — no matter how large or powerful — should escape extra scrutiny of their rights records when warranted.The groups also want UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to “take responsibility for publicly addressing China’s sweeping rights violations,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement.The appeal comes ahead of the start of the 47-member-state Human Rights Council’s fall session on Monday. In its summer session, the council held an urgent debate on a rise of police violence against Black people and repression of protests in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-300-civil-society-groups-urge-more-scrutiny-of-china-on-human-rights/story-oQ54TntwfZyuVbk79xZnIN.html
10-09-2020||World||Japanese minister Kono says he’s expecting October polls||Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono said he expects a general election in October, contradicting comments from the man expected to become the next prime minister, who indicated the poll would come later.Kono, tipped as a future Japanese leader, made the comments Wednesday in an online forum hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Speculation over an early election was fueled by a leap in support for ailing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet in polls released in the past week, just as Yoshihide Suga emerged as the favorite to succeed him.Suga, widely expected to be selected as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party next week as Abe steps down for health reasons, said Tuesday the country was not in a situation for a general election, given the virus outbreak. The LDP is expected to use its majority in parliament to elect Suga, the right-hand man to Abe, as prime minister on Sept. 16.Election timing is the prerogative of the prime minister and none need be held for about another year. Polls have shown most people oppose the idea of a vote before the end of 2020.The LDP’s junior coalition partner, Komeito, has expressed caution over the idea of an early election. Party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said earlier this week that dealing with the coronavirus should be the priority, national broadcaster NHK reported.A newly unified opposition party is set to elect a leader Thursday in a bid to offer a more compelling alternative. But the LDP, which has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955, is virtually guaranteed to keep its majority in the next election due to a huge slate of incumbents, strong funding and a public support rate well ahead of the opposition’s.Japan’s second wave of virus cases has been tailing off in recent weeks, with about 500 new infections reported Sept. 9, about a third of levels seen a month earlier. The economic effects have been dire, with the country experiencing its worst contraction on record in the April-June quarter.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japanese-minister-kono-says-he-s-expecting-october-polls/story-DbMyIxgOm2JU2mA8VnGCDK.html
