The European Union failed for nearly a decade to broker a thaw in relations.The US effort focused on business and commerce, however, with Serbian negotiators insisting they would not go as far as recognizing Kosovo as a fully-fledged state. “It took decades because you didn’t have anybody trying to get it done,” Trump said of the deal. “There was a lot of fighting and now there’s a lot of love.” Vucic said Trump had done a “great job” and praised the US president’s commitment to the region, inviting him to visit Serbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-announces-historic-accord-between-former-foes-serbia-kosovo/story-VvU0iDnPR8V1hj73NBbMaM.html

But some countries that have secured their own supplies through bilateral deals, including the United States, have said they will not join COVAX.“Vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic,” Tedros told reporters at a WHO briefing in Geneva, without mentioning any specific countries.Tedros thanked Germany, Japan, Norway and the European Commission for joining COVAX during the last week.Also read: Trust in Covid-19 vaccines could turn on a knife edge A WHO spokeswoman said earlier on Friday that the organisation does not expect widespread vaccinations against COVID-19 to be available until mid-2021, citing the need for rigorous checks on their effectiveness and safety.The WHO’s chief scientist told the briefing that no vaccine should be approved for a worldwide rollout until it had undergone sufficient scrutiny.“No vaccine is going to be mass-deployed until regulators are confident, governments are confident, and the WHO is confident it has met the minimum standard of safety,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said.“These (vaccine candidates) need to go through the full Phase III trials,” she said, referring to testing that usually involves thousands of participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-nationalism-would-prolong-coronavirus-pandemic-says-who-chief-tedros/story-zAX3B4PzL4NczM1POJhIXM.html
04-09-2020||World||NATO agrees nerve agent used to try to kill Alexei Navalny||NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday condemned the “appalling assassination attempt” on Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny and called on Moscow to answer questions about the poisoning to international investigators.Navalny, a Kremlin critic and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to Moscow on Aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk. He has been in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany for treatment more than a week ago.German authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities previously identified the Soviet-era Novichok as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018.“There is proof beyond doubt that Mr. Navalny was poisoned using a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok group. The use of such a weapon is horrific,” Stoltenberg said after chairing a meeting of NATO ambassadors during which Germany briefed its allies on developments.“Any use of chemical weapons shows a total disrespect for human lives and is an unacceptable breach of international norms and rules. NATO allies agree that Russia now has serious questions it must answer,” he told reporters.Stoltenberg said Moscow must cooperate with the international chemical weapons organization in “an impartial, international investigation” and provide information about its Novichok program.After the March 2018 attack on the Skripals in the English city of Salisbury - territory of a member of the 30-nation alliance - NATO withdrew the accreditation of seven staff members at Russia’s mission to the military alliance and rejected the applications of three others. No such action was announced Friday.Russian authorities have appeared reluctant to investigate what caused Navalny’s condition, saying there had so far been no grounds for a criminal investigation. Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said Friday that a preliminary inquiry was ongoing but added that he saw no signs of a crime in what happened to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most determined critic.Putin’s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and said Thursday that Germany had not provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician’s condition.“We have nothing to hide,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday, asserting that German authorities had stonewalled Russian requests for information.Lavrov said the failure to provide information about Navalny’s poisoning could indicate a lack of evidence.“Our Western partners allow themselves to make arrogant demands in such a tone that suggests that they have nothing but pathos to put on the table,” he said.The Berlin prosecutor’s office said Friday that judicial authorities in the German capital are examining a request for information from Russian law enforcement and will decide whether to grant it, if necessary in consultation with German federal authorities. It didn’t specify how long a decision might take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-agrees-nerve-agent-used-to-try-to-kill-alexei-navalny/story-ttN8gE9iZJOd2u82MI8AbO.html

04-09-2020||World||Madrid struggles with Europe’s acutest 2nd wave of Covid-19||A mix of worry and resignation is discernible behind the masks of parents picking up school textbooks in a working class Spanish neighbourhood with a steady rise in new coronavirus infections.Authorities in Madrid, the European capital experiencing the worst second-wave outbreak, are introducing new curbs on social gatherings starting Monday. The restrictions coincide with the opening of most schools, which is perceived as a potential tipping point in the battle against the virus.The focus is especially on areas like San Diego, a culturally diverse neighbourhood of narrow streets and small apartments where many residents continued commuting to work over the summer, often to do manual labor and unstable jobs.“The south of Madrid is where the north’s cheap labor crams into small apartments,” said Simona Filip, 44, a migrant from Romania whose 6-year-old son is set to go back to school on Tuesday.Her son struggled with online learning ever since Spain went into lockdown in mid-March and a non-profit organization gave the family an electronic tablet for the boy to use.“The kid needs proper studies because I can’t help him and my husband needs to work,” Filip told The Associated Press this week. “We have no other choice but to hope that the school will keep him safe.”In the past two weeks, Spain has had a cumulative incidence of nearly 213 confirmed virus cases for every 100,000 residents, four times the European average. But in the southern Vallecas district with San Diego at its centre, that index closely watched by pandemic experts rose to 1,300 last week and remained on Friday above 1,000 cases.Jorge Nacarino, president of the local neighbours’ association, said that poverty and years of inadequate investments for the area are behind the spike. Tiny, cheap apartments built five to eight decades ago have not been replaced and now house extended families or groups of migrants who can’t afford real estate price hikes in other neighbourhoods.As happened during the first wave, social distancing is again difficult in the apartments, and many of those who had contact with people already infected with the coronavirus can’t afford to quarantine and miss work, Nacarino said.“We need a serious plan of public investment in the area, from health centres and sports facilities to social programs,” he said. “It’s been through decades of neglect that San Diego has fallen behind the development seen in surrounding areas.”With Spanish unemployment on the rise in the wake of virus-induced lockdowns, “narcoflats,” or vacant apartments taken over by gangs as drug distribution and consumption dens, are likely to spread, Nacarino said. So are gambling parlors, which are seen as a source of social problems in the area, with at least seven establishments operating along a short stretch of one of San Diego’s main streets.Since most of new recent infections have been tied to gatherings in private homes, the regional government on Friday extended to indoor meetings a ban on outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people. Attendance to funerals, burials, weddings or religious celebrations, as well as group visits to museums or guided tourism will also be restricted starting on Monday, authorities said.That comes on the heels of a crackdown on nightlife entertainment, early closure for the city’s parks to prevent youth from drinking alcohol and partying in large groups, and a ban on outdoor smoking, all of them measures announced in response to Madrid’s spiral of new cases since mid-July.The Spanish capital, home to 6.6 million and a magnet for workers from around the country, accounted last week for one-third of Spain’s new virus infections. At least 16% of beds in Madrid’s hospitals are currently occupied by patients with Covid-19, the highest rate of all Spanish regions.The situation “has nothing to do with what we went through a couple of months ago,” on Friday said the region’s health chief, Enrique Ruíz Escudero, referring to the peak of the pandemic in April, when makeshift hospitals had to be built and intensive-care-units expanded to cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients.“The pandemic in the Madrid community is stable and is controlled,” the official said at a press briefing, arguing that some of the effects of recent measures are starting to have an effect. “We are worried ... but we are not alarmed.”Madrid is also expanding the number of contact tracers, one of the weakest links in dealing with the new wave of outbreaks, and purchasing two million kits of rapid coronavirus tests.Spain, which is edging to a half-million confirmed cases since February, is leading the pandemic’s second wave in Europe. At least 29,234 people have died in Spain during the pandemic, although the real number is believed to be higher because many who died during the March and April peak of the outbreak were never tested.The northern region of Navarra was Spain’s first to launch a new school year on Friday, with masks mandatory for all students aged 6 or above and social distancing measures in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrid-struggles-with-europe-s-acutest-2nd-wave-of-covid-19/story-rIrkIOLSeLBJSaY5lnGJNO.html

Police were not looking for any more suspects and there were no community safety concerns.Police initially believed there were four people dead and one injured, but later updated that another person had died.Tudus told reporters that police were waiting for the homicide team to arrive to get a better understanding of what happened.Carol Gibson, who lives down the street from the crime scene, said she was startled awake by the incident.“The first shot woke me up, and then I heard about four or five more after that,″ Gibson said. “Then a woman screamed and there were two shots after that.”Gibson said she had known the family in the house for around 20 years.“They were a family that cared for each other quite a bit,” said Gibson. “If they weren’t playing baseball, hockey or shooting hoops on the driveway, they were out raking leaves and they did it as a family. A very caring family.″Rob Mitchell, another neighbour, described them as kind and outgoing.“They are very very involved with their kids and what they are doing in the community. It definitely doesn’t make any sense at all,” Mitchell told CBC news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-5-found-dead-after-shooting-in-ontario-home-say-police/story-NpZtJZLYsC8LmLsiGBdjpI.html

Bajwa, who is also chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority, had earlier said he would continue in that capacity but withdraw from the information portfolio.His resignation came after a story was published by an online investigative news platform that catalogued the retired general’s rise to riches along with that of his family members.According to a report published on ‘Fact Focus’, Asim Bajwa’s brothers, wife and two sons “own a business empire which set up 99 companies in four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 restaurants worth an estimated $39.9 million.” I strongly rebut the baseless allegations levelled against me and my family.Alhamdolillah another attempt to damage our reputation belied/exposed.I have and will always serve Pakistan with pride and dignity. pic.twitter.com/j185UoGhx1The report said that out of the 99 companies, 66 are main companies, 33 companies are branch companies of some of the main companies while five companies are dead.“The Bajwa family’s companies spent an estimated $52.2 million to develop their businesses and $14.5 million to purchase properties in the United States, while Asim Bajwa and his department were encouraging Pakistanis to invest within their relatively undeveloped country,” said the report.Bajwa announced in a TV program on Thursday that he would resign from his position as Special Assistant while at the same time he denied the allegations made in the news report. But on Friday, prime minister Imran Khan said in a statement that he is satisfied with the evidence and explanation presented by him. Bajwa had accused anti-Pakistan elements of being behind the report.In what is being described as a related development, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Joint Director Sajid Gondal went missing from Islamabad on Thursday night, his family confirmed on Friday.Human rights minister Shireen Mazari took notice of the incident and said in a tweet that the police have been directed to register a first information report (FIR).Local media has speculated, however, that Gondal may have supplied information on General Bajwa’s companies to the reporter who filed the story against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-top-aide-asim-bajwa-resigns-after-report-on-corruption-allegations-surfaces/story-khvS62ZCo9st27KDxAc4vJ.html
04-09-2020||World||US unemployment rate falls to 8.4% even as hiring slows||The US unemployment rate fell sharply in August to 8.4% from 10.2% even as hiring slowed, with employers adding the fewest jobs since the pandemic began.Employers added 1.4 million jobs, the Labor Department said Friday, down from 1.7 million in July. The US economy has recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic.Friday’s report from the Labor Department added to evidence that nearly six months after the coronavirus paralyzed the country, the economy is mounting only a fitful recovery. From small businesses to hotels, restaurants, airlines and entertainment venues, a wide spectrum of companies are struggling to survive the loss of customers with confirmed viral cases still high.After an epic collapse in the spring, when the economy shrank at a roughly 30% annual rate, growth has been rebounding as states have reopened at least parts of their economies. Yet the recovery remains far from complete.Many economists think significant hiring may be hard to sustain because employers are operating under a cloud of uncertainty about the virus. Daily confirmed case counts have fallen from 70,000 in June to about 40,000. The decline has leveled off in the past week and the viral caseload remains higher than it was in May and June.As a result activities like restaurant dining and air travel are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Most economists say a meaningful economic recovery will likely be impossible until the coronavirus is brought under control, most likely from the widespread use of a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-rate-falls-to-8-4-even-as-hiring-slows/story-RXp6ZDm6irs2VboARJMAVK.html

Vystrcil also met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.Wu said Taiwan is looking into starting direct flights between Taipei and Prague using its flagship airline, China Airlines.Vystrcil has faced strong anger from China, which issued multiple warnings over the week about the visit, as well as criticism from the pro-China Czech president.China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and objects to any official contacts between other countries and the island.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned on Monday that China will “definitely make them pay a heavy price” for the visit, which Beijing sees as support for Taiwanese independence.Throughout the visit, Vystrcil and others have emphasized the shared democratic values of Taiwan and the Czech Republic.Relations have soured between part of the Czech government and China in the past year.Prague canceled a sister cities agreement with Beijing last year after the Chinese side insisted on adding a clause to the deal stating that Prague supports the “one-China principle,” which says Taiwan is part of China.In reaction to Prague’s decision to sign a new sister cities’ agreement with Taipei, China canceled the tours of several Prague classical music ensembles and orchestras.Part of the dispute is over trade.“There were a lot of promises of China investment roughly around the year 2013, 2014. However, all those promises turned out to not be fulfilled,” Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prague-taipei-announce-new-areas-of-cooperation-as-controversial-czech-visit-ends/story-5hkanENihi7iZcYo8JhYGP.html
04-09-2020||World||Tying aid to foreign policy: New UK dept begins work||Declassified documents show that past British governments have been uneasy about admitting UK aid’s links with foreign policy objectives, but the Boris Johnson government has now institutionalised the link in a new department.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been merged with the Department for International Development (budget: £15 billion), inaugurated by foreign secretary Dominic Raab this week under the new name: Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office.The merger as part of Johnson’s post-Brexit idea of ‘Global Britain’ has attracted criticism, including from Labour, former prime minister David Cameron and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said abolishing the department was an “extraordinary mistake”.Raab marked the new department’s launch by announcing a £119 million aid package to tackle the threat of coronavirus and famines in countries such as Yemen, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Central African Republic, the Sahel, South Sudan and Sudan.The UK by law is committed to spend 0.7 per cent of its national income on aid. The amount has dwindled after the coronavirus pandemic severely impacted the economy, raising concerns among campaign groups and other stake-holders.According to Tim Durrant of think-tank Institute for Government, there is still a long way to go before it is known how the new department will manage both aid and diplomacy. While previously the two departments worked closely, they are very different organisations, he said.“Many in the development sector have expressed concern that the new department will not value development expertise as much as DfID did, and that this will lead to an exodus of talent. To stop that happening, ministers and senior officials will have to show that the expertise and experience of officials from both the predecessor departments is valued in the FCDO,” Durrant wrote.The top civil servant in the new department is Philip Barton, who was briefly the British high commissioner in India until recently. He said: “I look forward to bringing together our diplomats and development experts to deliver for the people of the UK and act as a force for good around the world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tying-aid-to-foreign-policy-new-uk-dept-begins-work/story-QsdMaWzndXl9poElVCtUxM.html
04-09-2020||World||Russia presses Germany for more detail on Navalny, urges ‘transparency’||The Kremlin said on Friday that it wanted dialogue with Germany over the case of opposition politician Alexei Navalny and that Russian doctors who treated him initially were much more transparent than the German doctors treating him now. Germany, where Navalny is in hospital, has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent and wants the perpetrators held to account. Russia has until now not opened a criminal investigation and said there is no evidence yet of a crime.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow wanted to find out from Germany what exact substance caused Navalny to fall ill in Siberia last month.“According to the version of our doctors it wasn’t a poisoning,” Peskov said. “The German specialists managed to establish some kind of poisonous substance. We’re counting on a dialogue with our German colleagues.”He added: “Investigative actions are being carried out by our specialists, and if there is confirmation of the presence of poisonous substances in the biological material of the patient (Navalny), then of course legal consequences will follow. We ask everyone to rely on the facts.”Navalny is the most popular and prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, and the German announcement this week that he was poisoned by a nerve agent has raised the possibility of further Western sanctions against Moscow.Separately, a Russian court said on Friday it had rejected a complaint filed by allies of Navalny accusing a top law enforcement body of inaction over what they said was his attempted murder. One of Navalny’s allies accused the Investigative Committee, which handles probes into major crimes, of inaction following a statement they filed to it on Aug. 20 demanding a criminal investigation be opened into Navalny’s attempted murder. The court said the Investigative Committee had passed on the statement by Navalny’s supporters to one of its regional branches in Siberia and asked for it to be reviewed. Kira Yarmysh, Navalny’s spokeswoman, said the court had said their statement had been treated as a “citizen’s appeal”, a legal nuance she said meant it could take up to 30 days for it be looked at. “Anything so they don’t have to start an investigation,” she wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-presses-germany-for-more-detail-on-navalny-urges-transparency/story-ufPWZb43yGOSALavDNb6EJ.html
04-09-2020||World||Russian vaccine trials show strong immune response: The Lancet||Results from two early-phase Russian non-randomised vaccine trials (Sputnik V) released on Friday show that two formulations of a two-part vaccine have a good safety profile with no serious adverse events over 42 days, and induce antibody responses within 21 days.The two-part vaccine includes two adenovirus vectors – recombinant human adenovirus type 26 (rAd26-S) and recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5-S) – which have been modified to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, medical journal The Lancet reported.SARS-CoV-2 causes Covid-19.These types of recombinant adenovirus vectors have been used for a long time, with safety confirmed in many clinical studies. Currently, several candidate Covid-19 vaccines using these vectors and targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been tested in clinical trials.These include an adenovirus type 5 vector-based vaccine (CanSino Biological/Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, China), an adenovirus type 26 vector-based vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, USA), and a vaccine containing a simian adenoviral vector (AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, UK).Also Read: Trust in Covid-19 vaccines could turn on a knife edgeIn July, results from the Oxford vaccine trial showed no early safety concerns, inducing strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system.The journal said secondary outcomes (planned outcome measures that are not as important as the primary outcome measure, but are still of interest in evaluating the effect of an intervention) from the trial suggest the vaccines also produce a T cell (antibody) response within 28 days.The paper reported the findings from two small phase 1/2 trials lasting 42 days – one studying a frozen formulation of the vaccine, and another involving a lyophilised (freeze-dried) formulation of the vaccine.The frozen formulation is envisaged for large-scale use using existing global supply chains for vaccines, while the freeze-dried formulation was developed for hard-to-reach regions as it is more stable and can be stored at 2-8 degrees centigrade.Also Read: Widespread Covid-19 vaccines not expected until mid-2021, says WHOExplaining why they used two adenovirus vectors, lead author Denis Logunov of the N F Gamaleya National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia, says: “When adenovirus vaccines enter people’s cells, they deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, which causes cells to produce the spike protein”.“This helps teach the immune system to recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To form a powerful immune response against SARS-CoV-2, it is important that a booster vaccination is provided”.“However, booster vaccinations that use the same adenovirus vector might not produce an effective response, because the immune system may recognise and attack the vector. This would block the vaccine from entering people’s cells and teaching the body to recognise and attack SARS-CoV-2. For our vaccine, we use two different adenovirus vectors in a bid to avoid the immune system becoming immune to the vector.”The trials took place in two hospitals in Russia, involving healthy adults aged 18-60 years, who self-isolated as soon as they were registered for the trial and remained in hospital for the first 28 days of the trial (from when they were first vaccinated).The authors noted that more research is needed to evaluate the vaccine in different populations, including older age groups, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and people in at-risk groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-vaccine-trials-show-strong-immune-response-the-lancet/story-vKpraD2DskoinjE0lSF9qI.html
04-09-2020||World||Palau invites US military to build bases as China seeks regional clout||The tiny Pacific nation of Palau has urged the United States military to build bases on its territory -- which lies in a region where Washington is pushing back against growing Chinese influence.US Defense Secretary Mark Esper visited the island nation last week and accused Beijing of “ongoing destabilising activities” in the Pacific.Palau President Tommy Remengesau later revealed he told Esper the US military was welcome to build facilities in his country, an archipelago about 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) east of the Philippines.“Palau’s request to the US military remains simple -- build joint-use facilities, then come and use them regularly,” he said in a letter to the US defence chief that his office released this week.The note, addressed to Esper and marked “by hand delivery, Koror. Palau,” said the nation of 22,000 was open to hosting land bases, port facilities and airfields for the US military.Remengesau also suggested a US Coast Guard presence in Palau to help patrol its vast marine reserve, which covers an area of ocean the size of Spain and is difficult for the tiny nation to monitor.While Palau is an independent nation, it has no military and the US is responsible for its defence under an agreement with Washington called the Compact of Free Association.Under the deal, the US military has access to the islands, although it currently has no troops permanently stationed there.“We should use the mechanisms of the Compact to establish a regular US military presence in Palau,” Remengesau said.“The US military’s right to establish defence sites in the Republic of Palau has been under-utilised for the entire duration of the Compact.”- ‘Predatory economics’ -He said bases in Palau would not only increase US military preparedness but also help the local economy, which is struggling as the Covid-19 pandemic has halted tourism, its main industry.Palau was the scene of bloody fighting between US and Japanese forces in World War II but Washington focused on bases in the Philippines and Guam after the war.A US military radar facility is planned for Palau but construction has been suspended because of the pandemic, with the island nation keen to retain its virus-free status.In addition to its close US ties, Palau is also one of Taiwan’s four remaining allies in the Pacific and only 15 worldwide.China, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, has set about trying to win over Taipei’s allies in the Pacific, persuading the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to switch sides last year.Palau has refused, prompting Beijing to effectively ban its tourists from visiting the country in 2018.“It would appear that President Remengesau sees this, in part, as a potential economic solution to counter Palau’s significant dependence on tourism -- including Chinese tourism” said Anna Powles, an expert in Pacific security at New Zealand’s Massey University.“Palau is also feeling the pressures of proximity with respect to China and Beijing’s efforts to persuade Palau to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China,” she told AFP.While not naming China directly, Remengesau told Esper “destabilising actors have already stepped forward to take advantage” of the virus-related economic crises that small island nations were experiencing.“Mr. Secretary, it has been a great relief to hear you, and other top US officials, recognise the complex reality of Indo-Pacific security -- which is as threatened by predatory economics as it is by military aggression,” he wrote.During Esper’s visit last week, which lasted barely three hours, Remengesau said China was offering cheap loans to island nations to win their loyalty.“That has an impact on how people view the relationship with those who help them,” he said.str-ns-arb/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palau-invites-us-military-to-build-bases-as-china-seeks-regional-clout/story-cEO0wecSAdp0aTUzluyavO.html
04-09-2020||World||August cost of gourmet UK: £522 million for 100 million meals||A scheme that ran through August to revive the UK’s hospitality industry hit by the Covid-19 pandemic cost the taxpayer over £522 million for 100 million meals that were 50 percent paid by the Boris Johnson government.Chancellor Rishi Sunak launched the ‘Eat out to Help Out scheme’ under which nearly 85,000 restaurants (including Indian) and other food-serving establishments offered 50 percent discount up to £10 per person Monday to Wednesday in August.Civil servants initially expressed doubts over the scheme’s value for money, but it has been widely hailed a success after attracting thousands of people who lined up outside restaurants across the UK after being hunkered down in homes for months, repositioning the ‘weekend atmosphere’ to Monday-to-Wednesday.Sunak said on Friday, “From the get-go, our mission has been to protect jobs and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before. Today’s figures continue to show ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ has been a success”.Also read: Widespread Covid-19 vaccines not expected until mid-2021, says WHO“I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery. The scheme is just one part of our Plan for Jobs and we will continue to protect, support and create jobs to ensure we come back stronger as a nation,” he added.The £522 million cost to the taxpayer is likely to increase with restaurants having until the end of September to claim back the 50 percent government-funded discount applied to bills. Buoyed by the spike in business, several restaurants have continued to offer the discount on their own.According to Sunak, the scheme’s popularity had helped protect the livelihoods of the 1.8 million people working in the hospitality sector and drive the nation’s economic recovery from Covid-19.According to industry data, restaurant bookings increased by an average of 53 percent on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays throughout the whole of August, compared to the same days in 2019. In July 2020, restaurant bookings were down 54 percent on an average from Mondays to Wednesdays compared to July 2019.On August 31 - the final day of the scheme - bookings were up 216 percent compared to the equivalent day in 2019.Kate Nicholls of trade association UK Hospitality said, “The ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme has been a great success for hospitality. Our members have reported very strong bookings throughout August at a time when the sector really needed a boost”.“It has helped provide a lift in consumer confidence which is going to be key for hospitality businesses as they look to reopen and help rebuild the economy.

But farmers in the northern state of Chihuahua want the water for their own crops.The water treaty has become a burning political issue in northern Mexico, with conspiracy theories and violent protests springing up.López Obrador has advocated paying the debt, noting that Mexico receives four times more water under the treaty from the Colorado River than it contributes in the Rio Grande area. He claims Mexico has enough water in dams to supply local farmers and repay the debt, which built up over a number of years.“I am asking people to help us and trust us,” López Obrador said. “If there is a problem of a lack of water, I will go to Chihuahua immediately and speak to the US president and seek, as I have done in other cases, understanding of our situation.” Given that conspiracy theories have sprung up in Chihuahua that the United States may have overstated it water payments, or paid with infrastructure improvements instead of water, López Obrador said he would be open to a review by outside experts.“On whether the accounting is bad and whether we are in agreement with the UN verifying whether things are being done correctly, of course we are willing to accept that, but we do not want these to be dilatory practices, legal maneuvers that would delay us fulfilling our commitement,” López Obrador said.The US Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, the bilateral body that oversees treaty issues, said it “has not received any proposals from our Mexican counterparts to have the UN come in to audit water deliveries.” Under the 1944 treaty, Mexico owes the United States almost 345,600 acre-feet (426 million cubic meters) this year that must be paid by October 24. Payment is made by releasing water from dams in Mexico. Mexico has fallen badly behind in payments from previous years and now has to quickly catch up on water transfers.In mid-July, the US Commissioner of the water commission, Jayne Harkins, said “they need to increase their water releases to the United States immediately,” adding “Mexico has failed to implement releases promised earlier and continuing to delay increases the risk of Mexico failing to meet its delivery obligation.” The issue is a difficult one for López Obrador, who said he fears the US government could impose tariffs on Mexican products or close borders in retaliation.“Imagine that, for failing to comply, they close the border on us,” the president said.A danger lies also in the series of angry protests the issue has sparked.In late July, demonstrators in Chihuahua burned several government vehicles, blocked railway tracks and set afire a government office and highway tollbooths to protest the release of water from local dams to pay the US.López Obrador has said the protests are being fanned by opposition politicians for their own motives.The expansion of water-hungry crops has meant that Mexico has used 71 per cent of the northward-flowing Conchos River, while under the treaty it should use only 62% per cent of the water, letting the rest of it flow into the Rio Bravo, also known as the Rio Grande, on the border.In the past, Mexico has delayed payments, hoping that periodic tropical storms from the Gulf would create occasional windfalls of water. But while Hanna made landfall in Texas in July, the storm’s rains did not reach far enough inland to fill dams in Chihuahua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-struggles-with-us-water-debt-suggests-audit-from-united-nations/story-wSgwCeaF7fvFtqHHIx8e4O.html
04-09-2020||World||Trust in Covid-19 vaccines could turn on a knife edge||Finding a vaccine against Covid-19 that works and can be distributed widely enough to help stop the pandemic is a global priority. Given the urgency, governments are doing all they can to fund research and incentivize firms to ramp up trials — pre-ordering doses, lowering regulatory barriers to market and granting manufacturers immunity from costly future injury-related lawsuits.But when does the scramble for supply start to look like corner-cutting?Even in a pandemic as deadly as this one, public trust in a vaccine is vulnerable. A July-August Ipsos worldwide poll for the World Economic Forum found that while three in four adults were interested in getting a Covid-19 vaccine if it was available, only 37% had a “strong” interest in doing so. That’s a far cry from the estimated herd immunity threshold of 55% to 82%. The top two reasons cited for not wanting to take a Covid-19 vaccine are a fear of side effects and doubts it will actually work — not extreme “anti-vaxx” sentiment.While an effective vaccine would be an unquestionable public good, you can see how fears of a rush job might take hold. Vladimir Putin’s shock approval last month of a vaccine before large-scale patient trials had been completed is a gamble that could actually set back Russia’s response to Covid-19, as my colleague Max Nisen has argued. In the U.S., Donald Trump wants a vaccine rolled out before Election Day, sparking worries that an eventual green light will be seen as a political decision rather than one based on comprehensive data. On top of that comes the practice of offering legal immunity to makers of vaccines and emergency treatments. While helpful in keeping companies from getting bogged down in court battles, it isn’t exactly conducive to building public trust.For example, the U.S.’s existing “PREP” pandemic legislation shields firms from almost all injury-related lawsuits unless the cause is deemed willful misconduct (a high bar). That’s an “extraordinarily broad” view, explains Wendy Parmet, professor of law at Northeastern University. While financial compensation is available, it is covered entirely by the taxpayer, capped at a lifetime maximum of $311,810 regardless of the injury and decided by a special panel with no opportunity for judicial review. It has served to pour fuel on anti-vaxxers’ outrage, rather than silence them.No wonder some patient advocates have been spooked by lobbying pressure in Europe — where the burden of liability is seen as less favorable for drugmakers — to adopt a system closer to the U.S. one, as reported by the Financial Times. While the European Commission insists it won’t compromise on safety, or change liability rules, it has suggested governments could take on “certain” legal claims.This has led to public anger in the past. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many European governments took on liability risk in exchange for fast-tracked vaccines, some of which ended up being recalled over links to narcolepsy. A withering Council of Europe report at the time warned such deals privatized vaccine profits and socialized the risk of injuries, calling for more balance in future.The race for a Covid-19 vaccine could therefore do with a few speed bumps in the name of trust. The need for large-scale patient trials hasn’t gone away, and more data and disclosure on the road to approvals for public use might help win over an important priority group — health-care workers. They aren’t immune to vaccine skepticism: In France, the birthplace of Louis Pasteur, a 2014 survey found one-quarter of doctors thought some recommended vaccines were useless, and one-fifth thought children were being given too many shots. Given they have the ear of their patients, this is an issue.It should also be possible to preserve an effective supply of vaccine doses without tipping the scales of liability completely away from manufacturers.One idea floated by a British Institute of International & Comparative Law research project is for a new Covid-19 compensation fund designed to deal both sympathetically and efficiently with injury claims without having to go through the courts. Instead of being funded entirely by the taxpayer, it could be part-financed by the private sector, thereby ensuring pharma firms have some skin in the game. This won’t cure vaccine hesitancy overnight, but it might allay some fears.There are limits to engaging with vaccine critics, of course, and no quarter should be given to hardened anti-vaxxers — vaccination has a 200-year history and played a critical role in eradicating the likes of smallpox and polio. But there’s still time to extend a hand to the hesitant.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

04-09-2020||World||UN experts raise concerns over Hong Kong’s national security law||Seven human rights experts affiliated with the UN raised concerns over Hong Kong’s national security law in a letter addressed to Chinese authorities, saying that the law infringed on certain fundamental rights.In a letter released Friday, the experts said that the national security law raised a “serious risk” that fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, may be infringed upon. It also highlighted the undermining of the independence judges and lawyers in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.“We underscore that general assertions of conduct that threatens ‘national security’ without proper definitions and limitations may severely curtail civic space, the right to participate in public affairs, the rights of minorities and the work of human rights defenders and other civil society actors and their right to associate,” the human rights experts said in the letter dated September 1.The group of experts are independent human rights monitors who work with the UN human rights office, including Fionnuala Ni Aolain, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.Hong Kong imposed a national security law — approved by Beijing — on June 30, following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year against a now-withdrawn extradition bill which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.The national security law makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has insisted that the law will help bring stability back to Hong Kong after months of unrest.Critics say the law effectively ends the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy after it was passed from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The law extends beyond Hong Kong, and targets anyone overseas who violates the legislation, although it is not clear how the law would be enforced. Suspects arrested in Hong Kong under the national security law could also be sent to mainland China to stand trial in exceptional circumstances.The sweeping legislation has drawn criticism for stipulating that the destruction of government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive, while damaging public transportation facilities constitutes an act of terrorism.In the 14-page letter, the experts called on China to address the concerns of the UN, including its plans to enforce “extra-territorial jurisdiction,” to ensure that it complies with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights treaty that China has signed.The document sent by the UN is known as an “other letter,” a communication with governments that examines draft or existing legislation, policy or practice that is deemed out-of-step and noncompliant with international human rights norms.The letter follows the first in-depth appraisal of the Hong Kong security law from the UN human rights system, though officials including UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, have previously expressed concerns about it.Unlike other types of communications from the UN human rights system with governments, which remain confidential for nearly two months to give them time to respond, “other letters” give governments only two days advance notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-raise-concerns-over-hong-kong-s-national-security-law/story-wQhXp8KFsB2Gd6zO2tPDoJ.html

That would be just ahead of the U.S. election on Nov. 3 in which the pandemic is likely to be a major factor among voters deciding whether President Donald Trump wins a second term.“We are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,” Harris told a U.N. briefing in Geneva.“This phase 3 must take longer because we need to see how truly protective the vaccine is and we also need to see how safe it is,” she added. This referred to the phase in vaccine research where large clinical trials among people are conducted. Harris did not refer to any specific vaccine candidate.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine frontrunners will soon see their moment of truthAll data from trials must be shared and compared, Harris said. “A lot of people have been vaccinated and what we don’t know is whether the vaccine works...at this stage we do not have the clear signal of whether or not it has the level of worthwhile efficacy and safety...,” she added.The WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance are leading a global vaccine allocation plan known as COVAX that aims to help buy and distribute shots fairly. The focus is on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country such as healthcare workers.COVAX aims to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021, but some countries that have secured their own supplies through bilateral deals, including the United States, have said they will not join.“Essentially, the door is open. We are open. What the COVAX is about is making sure everybody on the planet will get access to the vaccines,” Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/widespread-covid-19-vaccinations-not-expected-until-mid-2021-says-who/story-SwPCBsijF3VjePozsqokjI.html
04-09-2020||World||Will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuse in Tibet if elected: Joe Biden||Slamming China’s plan to further tighten control over Tibet, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if voted to power, his administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in the remote Himalayan region.Noting that the Chinese government recently announced plans to further tighten control over Tibet, thereby continuing to erode the human rights, religious freedoms, and dignity of the Tibetan people, the former US vice president said that these are only the latest efforts by Beijing to crush ethnic minorities that seek to preserve their distinct culture, language and beliefs.“My administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, and step up support for the Tibetan people, including by expanding Tibetan language services at Radio Free Asia and Voice of America to get information from the outside world into Tibet,” Biden said.Biden vowed that as president he will meet with the Dalai Lama, appoint a new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, and insist that the Chinese government restore access to Tibet for US citizens, including American diplomats and journalists.“Where (President Donald) Trump has turned a blind eye, a Biden-Harris administration will stand up for the people of Tibet,” Biden said.In his statement, Biden alleged that Trump has been weak on his China policy.“Once again, the silence from President Trump has been deafening, as he focuses instead on his empty trade deal with Beijing and protecting his ‘very good friendship’ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It’s disgraceful, though not surprising, that Trump is the first American president in three decades who has not met or spoken with His Holiness the Dalai Lama,” he said.“Trump hasn’t even fulfilled the statutory requirement to appoint a Special Coordinator to lead America’s efforts on this vital issue. It’s no wonder China’s leaders believe they have a free hand to deepen repression in Tibet, just as they have in Hong Kong and Xinjiang,” Biden said.A day earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called upon Beijing to enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives without preconditions, to reach a settlement that resolves their differences.“We’re also concerned about Chinese actions in Tibet, in light of the general secretary’s recent calls to ‘Sinicise’ Tibetan Buddhism and fight ‘splittism’ there,” Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday.Chinese President Xi last week said that efforts must be made to fully implement the party’s policies on governing Tibet for a new era. Xi, also the General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party, also spoke of “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism.Tibet remained deeply devoted to Buddhism where the Dalai Lama is revered as the spiritual head despite his self-exile to India since 1959 after China took control of the remote region in 1950. While Beijing views the Dalai Lama, 85, as a separatist who seeks to split Tibet from China, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate says he only seeks greater rights for Tibetans, including religious freedom and autonomy. China also opposes any foreign leader meeting with the Dalai Lama. Since 1959, Tibet has been witnessing periodic incidents of violence, unrest and protest against Beijing. China asserts that Tibet has been its part since the 13th century and will remain so forever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-sanction-chinese-officials-responsible-for-human-rights-abuse-in-tibet-if-elected-joe-biden/story-WV0qo0tyQyVkzd7Z51gR9N.html
04-09-2020||World||New Zealand records first Covid-19 death in over three months||New Zealand recorded its first Covid-19 death in more than three months on Friday when a man in his 50s succumbed to the virus.Health officials said the man was part of a second-wave cluster of infections that emerged in Auckland last month, ending a spell of 102 days free of community transmission in the South Pacific nation.The death at Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital on Friday afternoon takes New Zealand’s death toll from the virus to 23, with the most recent previous fatality on May 24.“I acknowledge the anxiety New Zealanders may be feeling about today’s news, both in the wider community and also for the family and whanau (relatives) grieving over this death,” health chief Ashley Bloomfield said in a statement.“Our thoughts are with his family and community at this time of loss and grief.”The man was reportedly the youngest to die from Covid-19 in New Zealand.Health authorities did not say whether he had a pre-existing medical condition.The Auckland cluster emerged in a family of four and has since grown to 152, including three new cases recorded on Friday.It has proved difficult to eliminate despite a two-and-a-half week lockdown in Auckland that ended on Sunday night.“We have always recognised that further deaths linked to Covid-19 were possible,” Bloomfield said.“Today’s news reinforces the importance of our shared vigilance against Covid-19, the very serious consequences the virus can carry with it.”‘Caution required’While Aucklanders were allowed out of their homes this week, the government limited non-school social gatherings in the city of 1.5 million to 10 people and made masks compulsory on public transport nationwide.Authorities said earlier on Friday, before the latest death was announced, that the restriction would remain in place until at least September 16.The source of the Auckland cluster remains unknown but genome testing indicates it is not linked to the virus strain that New Zealand experienced earlier this year, which was largely eliminated in a seven-week lockdown that began in late March.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said indications were that the Auckland cluster was contained but there was no room for complacency.“We’ve been prepared and, by going hard and early, particularly with Aucklanders pitching in, we look at this early stage to have contained our resurgence,” she told reporters.“But (there are) also areas which suggestion caution is very much required... every country has faced second outbreaks in this global pandemic, and some have turned into significant second waves.”New Zealand, with its low death rate of 23 in a population of five million, has been hailed as one of the countries most successful in handling the virus.Its response to the latest outbreak has included a blitz of around 600,000 tests in recent weeks, accompanied by extensive contact tracing and the pre-emptive quarantine of close contacts linked to confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-records-first-covid-19-death-in-over-three-months/story-czeih8KfW2bYQ2h3JZ8McL.html
04-09-2020||World||President Trump urges Iran to spare life of popular wrestler||President Donald Trump has urged Iran not to execute a popular wrestler who authorities say killed a man during 2018 anti-government rallies. Citing reports on the death sentence for 27-year-old Navid Afkari, Trump said in a Thursday tweet: “... To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him. Thank you!” Judiciary authorities in Iran say Afkari was sentenced to death for the death of Hassan Torkaman, a water supply company employee in the southern city of Shiraz, following an anti-government protest over economic problems. A provincial court in Shiraz sentenced Afkari to death and his brothers Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari to 54 and 27 years in prison, respectively. All three were construction workers. The July verdicts that were reported in August prompted an outcry both in Iran and internationally. Earlier this week, the Afkaris’ mother, Behieh Namjou, in a video that circulated on social media, claimed the three men confessed to the killing under torture. She pleaded to authorities for mercy for her children. The news website of Iran’s judiciary, Mizanonline, on Monday denied Afkari had been tortured and called the Greco-Roman wrestler a “murderer of an innocent citizen.” Hassan Younesi, Afkari’s lawyer, told the semiofficial ILNA news agency that there is no evidence showing Afkari had a role the victim’s death and has requested a retrial. In 2018, protests broke out in several Iranian cities over the country’s falling currency and economic woes that led to a violent encounter between police and protesters. It came after Trump in May that year pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that has sent the country’s economy into free fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-urges-iran-to-spare-life-of-popular-wrestler/story-uixCB2CxeXCLaaYl7A4lBL.html

It noted that following the Iowa caucuses earlier this year, Russian outlets claimed that the result was “fixed in favor of establishment candidates” and that voting system problems had resulted in “ballot manipulation.”The Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment. Russia has denied interfering in US elections.Adam Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the bulletin validated his concern that Russia is seeking to “sow distrust in our democratic process.”By attacking US mail-in ballot integrity, Schiff said, “Russia is echoing destructive and false narratives around vote by mail that President Trump and his enablers, including Attorney General (William) Barr, have been aggressively promoting.”Trump has repeatedly criticized mail-in voting, saying in one July 30 Tweet: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-homeland-security-warns-that-russia-is-trying-to-undermine-confidence-in-mail-in-voting/story-eok8reKvP3hNInszGaUELM.html

04-09-2020||World||Tracing apps may stem Covid-19 spread even when only a few use them: Study||Contact tracing apps can sharply reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus even when only a few people use them, a study published on Thursday by researchers at Google and Oxford University showed.An app used by 15% of the population together with a well-staffed contact-tracing workforce can lead to a 15% drop in infection rates and an 11% drop in Covid-19 deaths, according to statistical modeling by the Alphabet Inc unit and Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine.With a 15% uptake of contact tracing apps alone, the researchers calculated an 8% reduction in infections and 6% reduction in deaths.The findings were based on data from a digital tracing system similar to one jointly developed by Google and Apple Inc.The app made by the two tech giants tracks interactions through Bluetooth signals and anonymously notifies a person if someone they met contracts Covid-19. Six U.S. states and about two dozen countries have launched exposure notification apps based on the Apple-Google technology in recent weeks without major hitches. The researchers simulated the spread of Covid-19 based on interactions at homes, offices, schools and social gatherings in Washington State’s King, Pierce and Snohomish counties.“We see that all levels of exposure notification uptake levels in the UK and the U.S. have the potential to meaningfully reduce the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the population,” Christophe Fraser, the study’s co-lead author and group leader in Pathogen Dynamics at Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Medicine, said in a statement. The researchers noted that a contact tracing app is not a stand-alone intervention. They also said their model still represents a “dramatic simplification of the real world”, and does not take into account cross-county movement of people contributing to disease spread. The research has not been peer-reviewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tracing-apps-may-stem-covid-19-spread-even-when-only-a-few-use-them-study/story-gCI6kOe0S0Mv8nwdj1UC7O.html
04-09-2020||World||Rochester Mayor suspends seven Police officers involved in man’s suffocation death||Seven police officers involved in the suffocation death of Daniel Prude last spring in Rochester, New York, were suspended Thursday by the city’s mayor, who said she was misled for months about the circumstances of the fatal encounter.Prude, 41, who was Black, died when he was taken off life support March 30. That was seven days after officers who encountered him running naked through the street put a hood over his head to stop him from spitting, then held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing.Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren announced the suspensions at a news conference amid criticism that the city kept quiet about Prude’s death for months.Prude “was failed by the police department, our mental health care system, our society, and he was failed by me,” Warren said.The mayor said she only became aware that Prude’s death involved the use of force on Aug. 4, and that Police Chief La’Ron Singletary initially portrayed it as a drug overdose, which is “entirely different” than what she witnessed in body camera video. The mayor said she told the chief she was “deeply, personally and professionally disappointed” in his failure to accurately inform her what happened to Prude.Warren said the seven officers would still be paid because of contract rules and that she was taking the action against the advise of attorneys.“I understand that the union may sue the city for this. They shall feel free to do so,” she said.Warren did not announce any action against Singletary. Approached at a community event, Singletary declined to comment but said he would speak later.Messages left with the union representing Rochester police officers were not immediately returned Thursday.Prude’s death happened just as the coronavirus was raging out of control in New York and received no public attention at the time.His family held a news conference Wednesday and released police body camera video obtained through a public records request that captured his fatal interaction with the officers.The videos and other records detailed how police had gone looking for Prude after he bolted from his brother’s home early on March 23, hours after receiving a mental health evaluation at a hospital.When officers found Prude he was completely naked, on the street in a light snow. He lay on the ground as they handcuffed him, then grew agitated, shouting and writhing and demanding that the officers give him a gun.Officers put a hood over his head because he had been spitting and then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, police video shows.The hoods are intended to protect officers from a detainee’s saliva and have been scrutinized as a factor in the deaths of several prisoners in recent years.The videos show Prude, his voice muffled by the hood, begging the white officer pushing his head down to let him go. As the officer, Mark Vaughn, says, “Calm down” and “Stop spitting,” Prude’s shouts became anguished whimpers and grunts.“OK, stop. I need it. I need it,” Prude says.The officer lets Prude go after about two minutes when he stops moving and falls silent. Officers then notice water coming out of Prude’s mouth and call over waiting medics, who start CPR.A medical examiner concluded that Prude’s death was a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” The report lists excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, as contributing factors.In his final months, Prude, who was known to his Chicago-based family as “Rell,” had been having mental health problems and had been going back and forth between his Chicago home and his brother’s place in Rochester, relatives said.“My father should have been met with a mental health specialist. He should not have been killed in the street,” his 18-year-old daughter, Tashyra Prude, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “He did not deserve that. He was treated like an animal. And I want this to be a step toward justice for not only my father, but justice for people like Breonna Taylor, who were killed by the police.”New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office took over the investigation of the death in April. It is still not complete.“The Prude family and the greater Rochester community deserve answers, and we will continue to work around the clock to provide them,” James said in a statement Thursday.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement that he watched video of Prude’s fatal encounter with police Wednesday night.“What I saw was deeply disturbing and I demand answers,” he said, adding that he was confident James’ investigation would be thorough. “For the sake of Mr. Prude’s family and the greater Rochester community I am calling for this case to be concluded as expeditiously as possible.”Demonstrators came out on Thursday evening for a second straight night, about 200 of them gathering near the street corner where Prude was restrained by police. Some activists felt suspending the officers was not enough.“This is a cover up and honestly our mayor, our police chief, they should be bought up on criminal charges,” said Justin Morris.Earlier Thursday, Prude’s brother, Joe Prude, said all his younger brother wanted that morning was “somebody to grab him up and help him.”“No matter how you look at the situation, the man was absolutely in his birthday suit, handcuffed behind his back, on the ground already, in freezing weather,” Prude’s brother, Joe Prude, said. “How could you sit here and label that man a threat to you when he’s already cuffed up? How could you throw a bag over his head?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rochester-mayor-suspends-seven-police-officers-involved-in-man-s-suffocation-death/story-mMs89KiNNG2z3fhiGEoUPN.html
04-09-2020||World||New York pushes ahead with more reopenings as Covid-19 cases rise in US Midwest||Casinos statewide will welcome back visitors in New York and malls in New York City will reopen doors to shoppers as new coronavirus infections remain low in what was once the U.S. hot spot of the pandemic, even while cases mount in Midwestern states.Next Wednesday, New York City malls will be allowed to reopen at 50% capacity and casinos statewide can reopen at 25% capacity, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday.“Thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers, we are at a point in our fight against this virus where we can safely reopen malls in New York City as long as they adhere to strict health and safety protocols,” Cuomo said. “Masks, enhanced air ventilation systems, and social distancing will be mandatory.”The governor also waded into the hotly debated issue of indoor dining in New York City, saying during a conference call with reporters that the final decision rested with the state.New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson came out on Wednesday in favor of allowing indoor dining in the city, which is home to a thriving restaurant industry that was battered by the pandemic.“It’s time to allow indoor dining in New York City with reduced capacity and clear guidance to ensure social distancing and safety,” Johnson said in a statement.Cuomo said he would like to see restaurants reopen for indoor dining in the city but that compliance and enforcement remained a major hurdle in doing so.“We open restaurants, that’s going to complicate by the hundreds if not thousands the number of establishments that need to be monitored,” he said.Indoor dining is allowed in New York state with the exception of New York City, where more than 300 restaurateurs recently filed a class-action lawsuit seeking $2 billion in damages, according to media reports.On Wednesday, gyms in New York City opened for the first time in months. They must operate at 33% capacity, with floors rearranged so patrons can exercise more than 6 feet (1.8 m)apart.SHIFTING TRENDSNew York has seen by far the most deaths from COVID-19 of any U.S. state, more than 32,000, but its rate of new infections has dropped to among the lowest in the country.Nationally, new cases of coronavirus have fallen for six weeks in a row, but infections are surging in the Midwest. Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting the highest percentage of positive test results in the country - over 20% in each state.Iowa, with a population of more than 3.1 million people, saw over 8,300 new cases last week, up 116%. That compared with about 4,400 new cases in New York state, which has more than 19.4 million residents, according to a Reuters analysis.Cases also rose 27% last week in Minnesota and 34% in Indiana.Bars were ordered shut in certain Iowa counties last week. But in Michigan, a Midwestern state where infections have held steady at about 5,000 new cases a week, residents will be able to enjoy gyms, swimming pools and organized sports starting next Wednesday, albeit with safety measures in place.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told state officials across the country to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as early as October, according to documents made public by the agency on Wednesday.The vaccines would be given first to healthcare workers, national security personnel and nursing homes, the agency said in the documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-pushes-ahead-with-more-reopenings-as-covid-19-cases-rise-in-us-midwest/story-UKjMYElUvTw6SYNifSFCfO.html
04-09-2020||World||US to allow Air India to conduct ground handling at airports: Official||The United States has announced that it plans to restore Air India’s ability to self-conduct its ground handling operations at American airports. Issuing an order in this regard, US Department of Transportation reversed its previous order of July 2019 that had suspended the right of Air India to self-handle at US airports. The Department and other US government agencies have continued to work with the government of India towards satisfactory resolution of this matter. In that connection, recent positive developments have led the department to tentatively determine that the public interest now calls for removal of the permit condition we had imposed in order 2019-7-9, said the order issued by Joel Szabat, Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs.“We therefore have tentatively decided to amend Air India’s permit to remove that condition,” the Department of Transportation said. Stakeholders and public have 21 days to respond to this proposal, before it can be finalised and enforced. The order comes a day after the Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, had a conversation with the Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. “India and the US have partnered in Aviation sector during these difficult times,” the ambassador tweeted.The order also relieves Air India of any further reporting requirement regarding its ground handling arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-air-india-to-conduct-ground-handling-at-airports-official/story-QU716NtR6hPTayGuLHEFmK.html
04-09-2020||World||Brazil hits 4 million Covid cases while life gets back to normal||Brazil reached the mark of 4 million confirmed coronavirus cases, doubling the infection count in two months as large parts of the Latin American nation emerge from isolation.The country reported 43,773 new cases on Thursday, pushing the toll to 4,041,638. Deaths rose by 834 to 124,614, according to data from the Health Ministry. Globally, the nation lags only the U.S. in both cases and deaths from the disease, though India is fast closing in when it comes to infections. On a per capita basis, though, Brazil recently passed the U.S. and Chile for most deaths per million people and is primed to overtake Italy for the 5th spot globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Brazil has been adding about a million cases a month -- in mid-July, it had 2 million confirmed infections -- as the virus hits areas of the country that were spared earlier in the pandemic. But the pace of new infections appears to have slowed since mid-August. After four weeks with over new 300,000 cases, figures for the past two weeks have been closer to 265,000. The number of weekly deaths fell to below 6,500, the lowest since May.The rich Southeast region of the country, home to highly-populated states like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, continues to be the hardest hit region, with more than 1.4 million cases, followed by the Northeast with 1.1 million. The North of the country, largely blanketed by the Amazon rain forest and where hospital beds are scarce, has the highest mortality rate in the nation: 73.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the rate seen in the more developed South.Brazil’s response to the pandemic -- no national approach, a shortage of testing and a push to reopen before the disease receded -- turned the country into a global hotspot.President Jair Bolsonaro pushed the scientifically-unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as a solution to the outbreak and criticized severe lockdown measures implemented by governors. Contradicting policies made predicting when the infection rates would recede even more difficult than it already was in a country of 210 million people where some states are the size of France and where many live in poverty and can’t afford not to work.Researchers from the PUC University in Rio say the virus’s reproductive rate rose to 1.01 after more than a month of decline, though it varies wildly across the country. It’s below 1 in 20 states and the Federal District, and above 1.5 in Santa Catarina, which was largely spared early on in the pandemic but has seen cases spike to over 180,000 from 87,000 in the past month.The group forecasts cases will top 4.55 million by mid-September, with deaths reaching 136,000.The pandemic brought on the largest economic slump on record, a 11.4% decline in the second quarter from a year ago. But Bank of America said last week that its internal data indicates there was a strong rebound in Brazil’s economic activity. The bounce was so significant that BofA says growth as measured by the central bank’s economic activity index, or IBC-Br, may have returned to pre-Covid levels as social isolation measures wane and mobility indicators continue to rise.Over recent weeks, local media have repeatedly shown pictures of packed beaches and parks, and crowds gathered at recently reopened bars and restaurants. The state of Sao Paulo, which has been the epicenter in the country since the first reported case in late February, has seen isolation rates fall to around 40%, from as high as 60% back in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hits-4-million-covid-cases-while-life-gets-back-to-normal/story-F3oQnuSXg0LxehfAzklQVO.html
04-09-2020||World||UNICEF says drugmakers can produce unprecedented vaccine quantities for Covid-19||Unprecedented quantities of vaccines could be produced by 28 manufacturers in 10 countries over the next two years to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said on Thursday, as it announced it would help lead efforts to procure and distribute them.UNICEF’s role is part of a Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan - known as COVAX and co-led by the World Health Organization - that aims to buy and provide equitable access to the shots. So far, 76 wealthy nations committed to joining the COVAX effort.UNICEF said the 28 vaccine manufacturers had shared their annual productions plans for Covid-19 vaccines through 2023. A UNICEF market assessment “revealed that manufacturers are willing to collectively produce unprecedented quantities of vaccines over the coming 1-2 years.”But drugmakers have signaled the projections are “highly dependent on, among other things, whether clinical trials are successful, advance purchase agreements are put in place, funding is confirmed, and regulatory and registration pathways are streamlined.”Safe and effective vaccines are seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 864,000 lives globally.UNICEF’s new role with COVAX stems from its status as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world. The U.N. agency said it procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-says-drugmakers-can-produce-unprecedented-vaccine-quantities-for-covid-19/story-Bv1m8HR0S0N7Ftz67lf16O.html
04-09-2020||World||Over 250 arrested since Jacob Blake’s shooting in Wisconsin: Police||More than 250 people have been arrested since the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, with more than half from outside the county that the southeastern Wisconsin city is in, police reported Thursday.Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by a white police officer on Aug. 23, sparking three nights of unrest that resulted in roughly two dozen fires and damage to numerous downtown businesses. Two nights after the shooting, prosecutors say 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two demonstrators and wounded a third. His attorney claims it was self defense.Kenosha police updated arrest figures Thursday, saying of the 252 people arrested, 132 did not live in Kenosha County. Rittenhouse came from his home in Antioch, Illinois, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) from Kenosha, to join others who walked the streets with rifles saying they were there to protect businesses from damage.Four people arrested filed a federal civil rights lawsuit Wednesday, alleging that police were not arresting pro-police demonstrators like Rittenhouse who were breaking a curfew, while targeting others. The city’s attorney called the lawsuit baseless and said it should be dismissed.The city on Wednesday ended a curfew that had been in place since August 24, a sign of calming tensions in the city of about 100,000 midway between Milwaukee and Chicago. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday to thank law enforcement for their efforts and his Democratic rival Joe Biden was in Wisconsin on Thursday and met with members of Blake’s family and Kenosha community leaders.The police said damage to city property was about $2 million and damage to county property was about $385,000.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was investigating more than 23 fires, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-250-arrested-since-jacob-blake-s-shooting-in-wisconsin-police/story-gReB4cbwvKXcmLJCtn3HfN.html
04-09-2020||World||Too many children are going hungry amid Covid-19 pandemic||It’s hard to believe that America’s legislators, whatever their political leanings, would willingly allow millions of children to go hungry. Yet that is what’s happening during the Covid-19 crisis — and unless Congress acts quickly, the problem’s about to get worse.In one of the world’s wealthiest nations, food insecurity should not be an issue. Yet it is. Even in good times, the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) falls far short of reaching everyone in need. As of 2018, some 2.5 million children lived in households that reported being unable to give their kids enough to eat. Such deprivation has long-term consequences for health and broader well-being.Now, Covid-19 is testing the safety net like never before. As of late July, children faced food shortages in 19% of the households where they lived, according to the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. That’s about 16 million children going hungry, more than triple the peak of the 2008 recession. Black and Hispanic families have been among the hardest hit: Their rates of child food insufficiency were 31% and 27%, respectively.Congress is making things worse by allowing relief measures to lapse. Expanded unemployment benefits, which provided an added $600 a week through July 31, reduced food insufficiency by an estimated 30%. Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfers, which aimed to compensate families whose kids missed free or reduced-price lunches due to school closures in spring, had a similar effect through the summer. Without such supports, the number of kids going hungry is likely to double. It’s already on the rise.Extending unemployment benefits and school-lunch compensation would help maintain the status quo. Ultimately, though, what’s needed is an ambitious commitment to food security. Congress should redesign the supplemental nutrition program to ensure adequate food for all who need it, and automatically boost benefits during recessions. This would have the further benefit of providing an especially effective countercyclical stimulus: Research suggests that each dollar of food assistance can generate $1.50 or more in economic activity, because it’s so well targeted to people who will use it.At the very least, legislators should increase food assistance until the crisis recedes, as they did with good results during the last recession. The cost is relatively small. A 30% increase in the maximum benefit would raise it above the Department of Agriculture’s current and inadequate statutory benchmark, roughly aligning it with the agency’s Low-Cost Food Plan — and would probably cost less than $50 billion a year while in effect.This is a good use of taxpayers’ dollars. Congress should act without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-many-children-are-going-hungry-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-J9wxKCL89ohrY1YsyPEKKI.html
