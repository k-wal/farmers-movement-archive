A majority of Americans -- by 57 to 38 percent -- oppose the push for confirmation before the election, according to a new Washington Post/ABC poll.But leaders of the Republican majority in the Senate, which is tasked with confirming Supreme Court nominees, said they expect a vote either before the election or, at latest, during the ensuing “lame duck” session before the inauguration of the next president in January.“We will certainly do that this year,” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has said.Liberal groups push backIf Barrett is confirmed, the Supreme Court would have a 6-3 conservative majority as it faces issues as divisive as abortion, gun rights and healthcare. Barrett was first named to the bench in 2017. A deeply conservative Catholic and mother of seven -- she would be the high court’s sixth Catholic -- Barrett is considered antagonistic to abortion rights, a key issue for many Republicans.Liberal groups strongly oppose Trump’s push to rush through a conservative appointment.“We know whoever this president puts forward will be an offense to Justice Ginsburg’s legacy and her fight to ensure that women are treated fairly,” Planned Parenthood president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement, adding that a Trump appointee would likely target both abortion rights and the healthcare program known as Obamacare. “We will fight with everything we have to stop any Supreme Court confirmation before the inauguration,” she said.The American Civil Liberties Union also urged the Senate to postpone action until after the election.Democratic leaders have vowed to do everything possible to prevent a confirmation vote before the election, but the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate leaves them with few options.A full benchFor Trump, nominating a conservative justice at this point is a way to fire up his base heading into November’s election.Biden has strongly criticized the Republicans’ plans for a quick vote and appealed to senators not to act before the election. On Friday, the former vice president traveled from his home in Delaware to Washington for a solemn ceremony in the US Capitol paying tribute to Ginsburg.In a sign of the raw political feelings, Trump was booed by a crowd when he visited the Supreme Court on Thursday to pay respects to Ginsburg.Trump has twice refused this week to clearly guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, evoking outrage from Democrats and seemingly increasing odds of a tense legal standoff.Republican leaders have said that if the fate of a disputed election rests with the Supreme Court -- and Trump has warned without evidence that illegal mail-in ballots could “rig” the outcome -- a full bench of judges will be needed to prevent a deadlock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-name-amy-coney-barrett-to-us-supreme-court-report/story-ssEzM3yg8UrUTLUQgjE6ML.html
26-09-2020||World||US elections 2020: How Donald Trump, Joe Biden are preparing for first presidential debate||Ahead of the first debate-stage matchup between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, each campaign is promising a stark contrast in policy, personality and preparation.Trump has decided to skip any formal preparation. And while Biden’s team believes the significance of the debate may be exaggerated, the Democratic nominee has been aggressively preparing to take on the president.Biden’s campaign has been holding mock debate sessions featuring Bob Bauer, a senior Biden adviser and former White House general counsel, playing the role of Trump, according to a person with direct knowledge of the preparations granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Bauer has not actually donned a Trump costume in line with Trump stand-ins from previous years, but he is representing his style and expected strategy.“I’m sure the president will throw everything he can at (Biden). My guess is that they’re preparing for that -- bombarding him with insults and weird digressions,” said Jay Carney, a former aide to Biden and President Barack Obama.“I think it’s an important moment — I think it’s really important for President Trump, because the direction of this election has been pretty stable for a long time now, and he needs to shake it up as any candidate would who’s behind,” Carney added. “The question is, can that work?”Trump and Biden are scheduled to meet on the debate stage for the first time Tuesday night at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. The 90-minute event moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace is the first of three scheduled presidential debates. Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, will also debate in October.For some, the debates represent the most important moments in the 2020 campaign’s closing days, a rare opportunity for millions of voters to compare the candidates’ policies and personalities side-by-side on prime-time television. Trump has been trailing Biden in the polls for the entire year, a reality that gives the president an urgent incentive to change the direction of the contest on national television if he can.Others, including those close to Biden’s campaign, do not expect the debates to fundamentally change the race no matter what happens, given voters’ daily struggles with the pandemic and the economy. They also point to high-profile debates in past elections thought to be game-changing moments at the time but that ultimately had little lasting effect.Those with knowledge of Biden’s preparations suggest he will not take the fight to Trump if he can avoid it. But on Saturday, at least, he was on the attack when he discussed his strategy on MSNBC.“I’m prepared to go out and make my case as to why I think he’s failed and why I think the answers I have to proceed will help the American people, the American economy and make us safer internationally,” Biden said, arguing that Trump won’t persuade voters with broadsides because “the people know the president is a liar.”He said he doesn’t expect Trump to articulate a detailed vision for a second term.“He doesn’t know how to debate the facts, because he’s not that smart,” Biden continued. “He doesn’t know that many facts. He doesn’t know much about foreign policy. He doesn’t know much about domestic policy. He doesn’t know much about the detail.”While Biden has said he will try to be a fact checker of sorts on stage, the Democrat is being advised to avoid direct confrontations and instead redirect the conversation to more familiar campaign themes of unity and issues that matter most to voters: the economy, health care and the pandemic.“Arguing over facts, litigating whether what he’s saying is accurate, that is not winning to Biden,” said Jen Psaki, a former Obama aide who is close to Biden’s team. “This is an opportunity to speak directly to the American people. His objective should be to speak directly to them, but not be pulled in by Trump. That is hard.”Trump has not been doing any formal preparation, according to aides and allies who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.No set has been constructed and aides refused to say whether anyone is playing Biden. Trump, instead, has maintained that the best preparation is doing his day job — particularly his frequent and often contentious interactions with reporters. White House aides also scheduled an ABC town hall earlier this month to expose Trump to real voter questions for the first time in months in preparation for the second debate.Privately some aides and allies are worried that Trump’s lack of formal preparation will lead him to fall into the same hubris trap as other incumbents in their first general election debate. Obama, for example, famously struggled in his first matchup against Mitt Romney in 2012.But other Trump backers are confident that the president is ready to handle any tough questions or pushback from Biden.“The debates matter,” said Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president’s daughter-in-law. “Donald Trump certainly did a great job on the debates (in 2016) and I think this will be no different.”Lara Trump also seemed to simultaneously raise and lower expectations for Biden.“Joe Biden spent a lot of time in his basement to study up. He’s been in this game for 47 years. I assume he’ll do okay,” she said. “Quite frankly, the bar has been lowered so much for Joe Biden that if he stays awake for the whole thing it’s like maybe he won.”The mixed messages were in line with those of Trump’s allies who spent much of the year raising questions about Biden’s physical and mental strength, while in recent days trying to cast him as a strong and experienced debater facing a relative neophyte in Trump.A former reality show star, the president is keenly aware of the power and pitfalls of live television. Aides say he is acutely mindful of the power of “moments” to define how a debate is perceived and that he intends to make his share of them happen.It remains to be seen how aggressively Trump attacks Biden. He has warned apocalyptically about the consequences of a Biden victory and is never one to shy away from a fight. He is also an avowed “counterpuncher” and will surely respond to any attacks by Biden in kind.Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and onetime national Democratic chairman, said Biden must fashion a succinct, debate-stage version of his message since the spring: draw a straight line from Trump’s personal deficiencies to his handling of the pandemic, its economic fallout, the national reckoning on race and then explain why a Biden presidency would be different.“Trump’s just looking for a Hail Mary here,” McAuliffe said. “He knows he’s in trouble.”___Peoples reported from New York.

26-09-2020||World||Uptick: New York logs more than 1,000 daily Covid-19 cases||More than 1,000 New Yorkers tested positive for Covid-19 in a single day Friday, marking the first time since June 5 the state has seen a daily number that high.The number of positive tests reported daily in the state has been steadily inching up in recent weeks, a trend possibly related to increasing numbers of businesses reopening, college campuses reopening and children returning to school. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday there were 1,005 positive cases tallied on the previous day out of 99,953 tests, for a 1% positive rate.From late July through the start of September the state was seeing an average of around 660 people test positive per day. In the seven-day period that ended Friday, the state had averaged 817 positive tests per day.Cuomo didn’t comment on the 1,000-case threshold in his daily Covid-19 update, but reiterated his call for vigilance.“It’s vital that New Yorkers continue to practice the basic behaviors that drive our ability to fight Covid-19 as we move into the fall and flu season,” Cuomo said in a prepared release. “Wearing masks, socially distancing and washing hands make a critical difference, as does the deliberate enforcement of state guidance by local governments.”That number of daily positive tests in a state of more than 19 million people still puts New York in a much better position than many other states. And it is worlds better than the situation in the state in April, when the number of positive tests per day routinely topped 9,000, even though tests then were hard to get and people were being encouraged not to seek one unless they were gravely ill.The higher number of positive tests lately could be related to more people seeking tests — or being required to take them — with the start of the academic year.Still, the uptick has been a cause for concern. In New York City, health officials have sounded alarms about a rising number of cases in certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens where many private religious schools opened for in-person instruction in early September, warning that those communities could see severe restrictions on public gatherings reinstated if current trends continue.Public school students in New York City’s elementary, middle and high schools are set to resume in-person instruction next week Sept. 29 and Oct. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uptick-new-york-logs-more-than-1-000-daily-covid-19-cases/story-Z2vL9z5T1Fm0yCEH7JUt3L.html
26-09-2020||World||Paris cleaver attack suspect says wanted to target Charlie Hebdo||A Pakistan-born teenager has admitted to stabbing two people with a meat cleaver outside the former Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine, investigators said Saturday, with nine people now detained over what the government condemned as “Islamist terror”.The 18-year-old said he wanted to avenge the republication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed by the satirical weekly, which in January 2015 was targeted in a massacre carried out by Islamist gunmen.The attack on Friday came three weeks into a trial in Paris of suspected accomplices in the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman and a Jewish supermarket that left 17 people dead.While the man is believed to have carried out the stabbings alone, eight other people are now also under arrest following two more detentions Saturday.The two new individuals arrested were the suspect’s younger brother and another acquaintance, a judicial source said. The man, who said he was born in Pakistan and is 18, “takes responsibility for his action,” a source close to the investigation said.The man said during questioning he places his actions “in the context of the republication of cartoons” of the Prophet Mohammed in Charlie Hebdo on the eve of the trial opening.- Charlie Hebdo targeted -The people wounded were employees of prize-winning TV production agency Premieres Lignes, whose offices are in the same block in central Paris that used to house Charlie Hebdo.However it is not believed that the two, who had stepped out onto the street for a cigarette break, were specifically targeted.The man mistakenly believed Charlie Hebdo’s offices were still in that building and wanted to attack journalists from the magazine, a source close to the inquiry told AFP, confirming information first published in the Le Parisien newspaper.Charlie Hebdo moved offices after the 2015 attack and its current address is kept secret for security reasons.The two victims were badly wounded but their lives are not in danger.French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday the attack was “clearly an act of Islamist terrorism”. Anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation.Five of the individuals detained were in an apartment in Pantin in the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, the last presumed address of the suspected attacker.Police also late Friday released another man who was close to the scene of the attack but who was confirmed to have been a witness who had “chased the assailant”, a judicial source said.The young man, who arrived from Pakistan three years ago, was believed to have last lived in a small flat in a four-storey building in the district.“He was very polite. I often saw him sitting on the landing with his telephone. He helped me carry my groceries,” said one neighbour, who identified herself as Josiane.- ‘Could have done better’ -Prime Minister Jean Castex on Saturday hailed the “efficiency” of the security forces following the attack during a visit to police headquarters, and said the “enemies of the Republic will never win”.Twelve people, including some of France’s most celebrated cartoonists, were killed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo’s offices by Islamist gunmen on January 7, 2015.Charlie Hebdo angered many Muslims around the world by publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2006, and in a defiant gesture reprinted some of the caricatures ahead of the trial.In court are 14 alleged accomplices of brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, the perpetrators of the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo that was claimed by a branch of Al-Qaeda.A female police officer was killed a day later, followed the next day by the killing of four men in a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket by gunman Amedy Coulibaly.The trial has reopened one of the most painful chapters in France’s modern history, with harrowing testimony from survivors and relatives of those who died.The magazine received fresh threats from Al-Qaeda this month after it republished the controversial cartoons.More than 100 French news outlets on Wednesday called for continuing support for Charlie Hebdo against what they described as the “enemies of freedom”.President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government has in recent weeks begun using increasingly tough rhetoric on domestic security issues in what analysts see as a shift to the right.Darmanin admitted that the risk of an attack around the former offices had been “underestimated” and said he had asked for an explanation from the police.“There was an attack, when there was an attack, it is obvious that we could have done better”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-cleaver-attack-suspect-says-wanted-to-target-charlie-hebdo/story-YeonPJkvkB3cXPgCj6oFRI.html
26-09-2020||World||‘Common foe’: Boris Johnson urges world leaders to unite against Covid-19||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Saturday that the coronavirus pandemic has frayed the bonds between nations, and urged world leaders to unite against the “common foe” of Covid-19.Johnson, who made the remarks in a prerecorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said that, nine months into the pandemic, “the very notion of the international community looks tattered.”“Never again must we wage 193 separate campaigns against the same enemy,” he said.Johnson set out a plan for preventing another global pandemic, including a network of zoonotic research labs around the world to identify dangerous pathogens before they leap from animals to humans.Johnson — who contracted Covid-19 in the spring and spent three nights in intensive care -- also called for countries to share data to create a global early-warning system for disease outbreaks, and urged countries to stop slapping export controls on essential goods, as many have done during the pandemic.Johnson also committed 500 million pounds ($636 million) through the global COVAX vaccine-procurement pool to help 92 of the world’s poorest countries obtain a coronavirus vaccine, should one become available.He announced that the U.K. is boosting its funding for the World Health Organization by 30%, to 340 million pounds ($432 million) over the next four years.Johnson is seeking to counter the impression that Britain is retreating from the world stage or becoming more protectionist in the wake of its departure from the European Union. The UK left the bloc’s political institutions in January and will make an economic break when a transition period ends on Dec. 31.He has also struck a more measured tone than in last year’s speech to the UN gathering, a rambling address about the perils and promise of technology that mentioned “terrifying limbless chickens,” “pink-eyed Terminators from the future” and fridges that beep for more cheese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/common-foe-boris-johnson-urges-world-leaders-to-unite-against-covid-19/story-so6wJa6cEtyGOfKQLCxdVP.html
26-09-2020||World||US imposes curbs on exports to China’s top chipmaker SMIC||The United States government has imposed restrictions on exports to China’s biggest silicon chip maker after concluding there is an “unacceptable risk” that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.Suppliers of certain equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) will now have to apply for individual export licenses, according to a letter from the Commerce Department dated Friday and seen by Reuters.SMIC becomes the second leading Chinese technology company to face US trade curbs after telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, whose access to high-end chips has been curtailed by its addition to a so-called entity list.The Pentagon said earlier this month that it was weighing blacklisting SMIC, which the US authorities have identified as a threat due to an alleged “fusion” of civilian and military technologies.Asked for comment, SMIC said it had not received any official notice of the restrictions and said it has no ties with the Chinese military.“SMIC reiterates that it manufactures semiconductors and provides services solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses,” SMIC said. “The Company has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for any military end-users or end-uses.”The Commerce Department declined on Saturday to comment specifically on SMIC, but said its Bureau of Industry and Security was “constantly monitoring and assessing any potential threats to US national security and foreign policy interests”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-curbs-on-exports-to-china-s-top-chipmaker-smic/story-owx6NBLJEVPd43tk3WHHKM.html
26-09-2020||World||Where is the UN in joint fight against Covid-19 pandemic?: PM Modi at UNGA||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday fervently pressed the UN general assembly to speed up reforms of its processes and organs to reflect contemporary realities and reiterated India’s case for a permanent membership of the Security Council demanding to know how long it would be “kept out of the decision-making structures” of the world body.“The people of India have been waiting for a long time for the process for the reforms of the United Nations to get completed,” the Prime Minister said. “Today, people of India are concerned whether this reform-process will ever reach its logical conclusion,” he added.“For how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations?” he asked, a rhetorical question that conveyed India’s increasing frustration with the process, which does not even have a negotiating document to show for progress for the years of discussion.ALSO READ | For how long will India be kept out of UN’s decision-making structure?: PM Modi at UNGATo underscore the disconnect between the world body and contemporary realties, PM Modi pointed to the lack of UN leadership on the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst health crisis facing the world in more than 100 years. “Over the last 8 to 9 months, the whole world has been battling the pandemic of the Coronavirus,” he said.“Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?” the Prime Minister asked.The UN was criticized for “missing in action” in the early days of the pandemic and the Security Council, the world body’s top decision-making body, was seen to have finally taken cognizance of the pandemic only in July adopting a resolution calling for cessation of all hostilities, months after the deadly pathogen had infected people all over the world. “Reform in the responses, in the processes, and in the very character of the United Nations is the need of the hour,” PM Modi said.This was the second time in a week that the Prime Minister had expressed India’s frustration on UN reforms. He had slammed it as “crisis of confidence” in a speech at a one-day meeting of the world body on Monday to commemorate 75 years of its founding.Manjeev Puri, a former top Indian diplomat to the UN, said the Prime Minister’s message to the UN was very clear on Saturday: “If you don’t remain relevant, you will not be around to solve the problems you were created to solve.”While making the case for India, the Prime Minister underlined the responsible role it has played historically through contributions to UN’s peacekeeping efforts right down to the present time in helping the world combat the pandemic.“Even during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries,” he said.He added: “As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-the-un-in-joint-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic-pm-modi-at-unga/story-H3MdURufOiemeCZzMm2OAN.html

26-09-2020||World||China’s carbon target moves big economies into radical climate consensus||After a week of far-reaching climate promises measured over decades, four of the world’s six largest economies have now proposed ending dates for their carbon emissions.President Xi Jinping’s surprise announcement at the annual United Nations climate meeting this week committed China to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. That brings the third-biggest economy by nominal GDP into a loose but vitally important consensus with the second largest (EU), fourth largest (Japan), and fifth largest (California). The end of emissions has been set even if the target dates remain varied—and at least a generation into the future.Every new country that joins this carbon-neutral group puts more pressure on holdouts to align their policies with global goals. Two of the biggest economies remain outside of the consensus: India, at No. 6, and the national US economy that remains the largest by size and historical contribution to warming.“We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060,” Xi declared by video conference on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly, without providing details on what neutrality will mean in practice. But the mere fact of the pledge by China keeps alive the chance that the world may be able to hit the most ambitious target set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement: holding warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels. Current global average is around 1°C of warming.“If China’s emissions didn’t go to zero, then 1.5 would not have been an option,” said Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research. The fact remains that China, as the world’s biggest emitter and energy consumer currently, exerts enormous pull on the prospects for limiting future warming. And falling short of the 1.5°C target by just half a degree would cost the world $20 trillion by 2100, according to an analysis published in the journal Nature.For all of the economies now linked in aspirations to end emissions, reaching net zero will mean a fundamental rewiring that accelerates clean-energy investments and dials back fossil fuels. In China’s case, sweeping reforms will have to be carried out across dozens of regions run by local governments that may not share the zeal for reaching the 2060 goal. Beijing has long struggled with implementing grand plans from the center in a continent-sized country of 1.4 billion people. Local officials often have more to gain by appeasing interest groups than listening to the national leaders, especially when those policies could affect local industries such as coal mining.“Announcing a carbon neutrality target is just the first step on a long road,” wrote analysts from BloombergNEF, in a note detailing the “arduous” and “challenging” route ahead. To reach this goal, China requires new technologies such as carbon-free hydrogen, BNEF concluded, “and it will need to make its economy much more efficient.”Implementation of long-range goals is going to be a challenge everywhere. California became one of the earliest large economies to set a carbon neutrality goal, resolving two years ago to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Recent wildfires that have devastated much of the Western US injected a new level of urgency, and this week California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order banning the sale of new gasoline-fueled cars after 2035.That decision makes California the first US state to join the UK, France, Canada and several other nations in putting an end date on the sale of internal combustion engine cars. It also marks a big global shift since California consumes about 1% of global oil production—roughly 1 million barrels per day. Even after years of policy incentives to encourage the sale of zero-emission vehicles, however, less than 8% of cars registered in the state are electric.Just how California will bring about this 15-year shift away from gasoline cars and what opposition it might face from the federal government remains unspecified, but the state is large enough to be a significant trendsetter for the US as a whole.There are questions, too, for how the EU will fulfill its proposal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in March, then set out an even more ambitious goal earlier this month to cut its emissions 55% by 2030. The bloc is already behind on an earlier goal to cut emissions 40% compared to 1990 levels by the same end date, so this new benchmark represents a renewed commitment to making deep, drastic changes quickly.Over the summer, meanwhile, EU heads of state approved the world’s greenest stimulus plan to date, promising to pour more than 500 billion euros ($580 billion) into measures that will help fight global warming. The money will go toward everything from scaling up green hydrogen to making agriculture more sustainable.The scale of China’s undertaking will be immense, since the nation alone accounted for 28% of the global greenhouse gas total in 2019. Simply reducing the share of fossil fuels in its energy mix from 85% today to less than 25% would require $180 billion of investment each year through 2050, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Similar investments will be required in everything from electric vehicle production and infrastructure to cleaning up industrial processes such as cement- and steel-making, which require enormous amounts of energy that can only be supplied reliably by fossil fuels right now.The impact from China’s decisions will be huge. Even if the rest of the world’s nations proceed with their current climate policies, China going carbon neutral by 2060 will lower global-warming projections by as much as 0.3°C. That’s the biggest single reduction ever estimated as the result of a policy change, according to Climate Action Tracker.The possibility of monumental policy swings looms over the climate debate. While the U.S. has retrenched significantly on climate policy under President Donald Trump, cheap natural gas and cheaper renewable energy have largely kept the country’s emissions in check. Should Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden defeat Trump in November’s election, the global picture would again change dramatically.Yet even without federal engagement on climate, at the state level leaders like California’s Newsom have moved in the opposite direction to Trump. In states such as Washington and New York there are now net-zero goals, and major U.S.-based companies have also made commitments to zero-out emissions. Even America’s utility behemoths are pledging to go carbon neutral, most recently New Orleans-based Entergy Corp., which did so on Thursday.“It’s like personal actions but on steroids,” said Noah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “It’s very directionally helpful, but it’ll never be enough if you don’t have the policies to back it up.”Biden has vowed to restore a national level of policy action, proposing a carbon-free electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions no later than 2050. If Biden rejoins the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. is set to leave on Nov. 4, pressure will grow on other major emitters—most significantly India, the largest besides the U.S. with no stated net-zero target—to make similar commitments.The UN framework allows developing countries to lower their emissions much later than developed countries, which bear much more of the blame for current atmospheric carbon levels. Though India isn’t ready to set a net-zero emissions goal, it’s shown a willingness to participate in the global conversation on emissions.India “sees climate change as an area where, to put it simply, it can win points geopolitically,” said Thomas Spencer at the Energy and Resources Institute, a think tank in India. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has been setting records for low-cost solar installations and become a role model in deploying energy efficiency measures, although it still doesn’t have strong policies in place to electrify transport.The next major UN climate meeting, set to be held in Glasgow, has already been postponed until 2021. Global leaders have tried to maintain momentum, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Thursday for a virtual meeting this December to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. It would be the next big moment for countries to strengthen their commitments to reduce emissions.This week also saw European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen call for the creation of a “high ambition coalition” that would include the EU and China, similar to a group assembled in 2015 to help reach a deal in Paris.Most of these climate goals are audacious—and entirely voluntary. There’s no guarantee that the promised reductions will come to pass. Still, the non-binding resolution created by the Paris climate agreement has fundamentally changed the conversation on climate action.“That’s the beauty of the Paris Agreement,” said Spencer. “Part of its strength is its weakness as well. It appeals to so many different sectors, so many different levers of action and just sets the direction. It doesn’t actually say you have to do it.”Once that direction is set, it often means ratcheting ambition up, not down. The British government is behind on its short-term emissions targets, for instance, and it is now considering bringing forward its ban on the sale of gasoline and diesel cars to 2030.That means those who assume China’s 2060 target is too late to keep the hope for 1.5°C alive may be in for a surprise. Peters of the Center for International Climate Research suggested it might be only the start: “I don’t think this is the final offer from China, and then they walk away and don’t budge for 40 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-carbon-target-moves-big-economies-into-radical-climate-consensus/story-aVXvQCPNTQT6YNSIge5DSO.html
26-09-2020||World||France: 7 in custody after stabbing linked to Charlie Hebdo||Seven people were in custody Saturday after a stabbing outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, including the suspected assailant, authorities said.Counterterrorism authorities are investigating what authorities called an Islamic extremist attack linked to Charlie Hebdo, which lost 12 employees in an al-Qaida attack in 2015. The weekly, which routinely mocks religious and other prominent figures, recently republished caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that outraged many Muslims.The suspected assailant in Friday’s stabbing had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalisation, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.The suspect arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified, the minister said.Seven others were detained in the aftermath of Friday’s attack, but one has been released, according to judicial officials. Five of those in custody were detained in the Paris suburb of Pantin in a residence where the suspect is believed to have lived, a police official said.Two people were wounded in Friday’s attack, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered, and ordered special protection for all “symbolic sites,” noting in particular Jewish sites around the Yom Kippur holiday this weekend. A Jewish grocery store was targeted days after the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre, in what authorities say were coordinated attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-7-in-custody-after-stabbing-linked-to-charlie-hebdo/story-Q6M6pthGuFmTTUHJuEJc2H.html

Crude exports that the nation depends on for most of its foreign exchange are less than 10% of their level before the US withdrew from the multilateral agreement in May 2018.“If people want to curse anyone for problems and shortcomings in the country, it’s the White House,” Rouhani said.Relations between the US and Iran have been at their worst since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and over the past two years defined by a security crisis triggered by Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear accord and culminating in the assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-cost-iran-s-economy-150-billion-rouhani-says/story-qvmNnexmA4h5n1MPR23ACK.html

India is currently discussing Sri Lanka’s request for the $1.1 billion bilateral currency swap. India is also discussing the issue of deferring the debt repayments by Sri Lanka.During the summit, Modi and Rajapaksa also discussed trade ties between the two countries. PM Modi conveyed to his Sri Lankan counterpart that he hopes Colombo relaxes temporary restrictions on import of a few Indian products. India also proposed launching a bilateral air bubble with Sri Lanka for travel between both countries.Both nations also agreed to extend MoU on certain high impact community development projects over the course of the next five years.In his address, PM Narendra Modi highlighted that under India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, India prioritises its relationship with Sri Lanka. “The relations between India and Sri Lanka are thousands of years old. According to my government’s neighbourhood first policy and SAGAR doctrine, we give special priority to relations between the two countries,” he said.PM Modi also requested Rajapaksa to look into the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils and as a part of reconciliation efforts ensure the government works towards realising their expectations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-rajapaksa-meet-india-extends-15mn-to-promote-buddhist-ties-discusses-bilateral-currency-swap-and-trade/story-Krgl01ZucKQOSRSqjmqI2H.html
26-09-2020||World||Progress against coronavirus brings complacency in parts of Africa||With Zimbabwe’s coronavirus infections on the decline, schools are reopening, along with churches, bars, restaurants, airports and tourist attractions. Strict lockdowns designed to curb the disease are being replaced by a return to relatively normal life.The threat has eased so much that many people see no need to be cautious. With his face mask stuffed into his pocket, Omega Chibanda said he’s not worried about Covid-19.“We used to fear coronavirus, not anymore,” the 16-year-old said in the crowded Chitungwiza town on the outskirts of the capital, Harare. “That’s why I’m not even wearing a mask.”As the global death toll from Covid-19 approaches 1 million, Zimbabwe and several other African countries have not experienced the widespread surges and many deaths that were predicted. That has invited complacency.“It’s all relaxed now,” Chibanda said.Earlier this month, Zimbabwe went a week without recording any deaths from coronavirus, and new infections and deaths have declined, as in South Africa and Kenya.Africa’s surge has been leveling off, with its 1.4 million confirmed cases increasing relatively slowly. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 35,000 deaths have been confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.But the improving figures and the start of the searing heat of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer could undermine efforts to beat back the virus even further, said community health worker Rosemary Rambire.She leaves home early in the morning and returns in the evening after going door to door calling “the gospel is here” and gathering families for quick awareness sessions.“Our job is now harder to do because people are no longer afraid,” Rambire said. “Some even tell us that it has not killed anyone they know. Most of them say the sun kills Covid-19 so they have no reason to worry.”Some think they are immune once they eat garlic, ginger and onions, she said.In her 14 years on the job and through multiple disease outbreaks, Covid-19 has been the most difficult to get people to take preventive measures, she said.“It’s different from before, when we did campaigns on cholera (and) HIV. We could tell that people were afraid. They tried to follow preventive measures,” she said. “With Covid-19, they are not afraid.”Many people look at the infection and death figures in Zimbabwe, compare them with other countries “and conclude that it only affects other countries and not Zimbabwe,” Rambire added.In Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class center on the southern edge of Harare, people no longer wear masks at markets, funerals or other public events. Masks are now the exception in many of Harare’s poor residential areas.“We have lost both the initial Covid-19 fear factor and the motivation to comply with national guidelines,” said Aaron Sundsmo, of the charitable organization Mercy Corps. The group has now enlisted local soccer, music and film celebrities to renew awareness.The government will “not hesitate to do something really strict” to curb any creeping complacency, said Dr. Agnes Mahomva, the chief Covid-19 response coordinator in Zimbabwe.“The dire projections that ‘Africa, you are going to be toast,’ perhaps actually helped us. We tightened up,” she said.Continued vigilance should accompany Africa’s apparent success story, said Mervyn Joullie, deputy regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, which operates in 16 of Africa’s 54 countries.Limited testing in many African countries makes it difficult to assess “the reality of Covid-19 situation,” Joullie said.In West Africa’s Sahel region, for example, positive cases of Covid-19 have declined over the past several weeks amid low testing capacity, which could suggest “a significant presence of undetected cases,” Joullie said.Health experts point to Africa’s youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 has not taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.Many African countries have eased the lockdowns and curfews in recent weeks to boost economies battered by the virus outbreak and, in some cases, ease local political pressure.Balancing concerns about unemployment, security and access to food, as well as the complacency and the need to keep infections low could be Africa’s next big challenge, experts said.“We are at a crossroads as we relax some of the restrictions,” said Dr. Mahomva, Zimbabwe’s Covid-19 response coordinator. “It’s not over until it’s over.”But for Chibanda, the teenager in Chitungwiza, there is no such dilemma.“Coronavirus is not an issue anymore here,” he said, pointing to people walking on the street without masks. “Just look around.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progress-against-coronavirus-brings-complacency-in-parts-of-africa/story-StJcfwcpnbJC4jAwgaXjzM.html
26-09-2020||World||Lebanese prime minister-designate resigns amid impasse||Lebanon’s prime minister-designate resigned Saturday amid a political impasse over government formation, dealing a blow to French President Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to break a dangerous stalemate in the crisis-hit country.The announcement by Moustapha Adib nearly a month after he was appointed to the job came following a meeting with President Michel Aoun, after which he told reporters he was stepping down.The French leader has been pressing Lebanese politicians to form a Cabinet made up of independent specialists that can work on enacting urgent reforms to extract Lebanon from a devastating economic and financial crisis worsened by the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut port.But efforts by the French-supported Adib, have hit multiple snags, after the country’s main Shiite groups, Hezbollah and Amal, insisted on retaining hold of the key Finance Ministry. Their insistence emerged after the US administration slapped sanctions on two senior politicians close to Hezbollah, including the ex-finance minister.The two groups also insisted on naming the Shiite ministers in the new Cabinet and objected to the manner in which Adib was forming the government, without consulting with them.After a short meeting with Aoun on Saturday, Adib said he was stepping down because the kind of Cabinet that he wanted to form “was bound to fail” and he was keen on protecting national unity.Lebanon, a former French protectorate, is mired in the country’s worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history. It defaulted on paying back its debt for the first time ever in March, and the local currency has collapsed, leading to hyperinflation and soaring poverty and unemployment.The crisis has been worsened by the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut’s port caused by the detonation of thousands of tons of ammonium nitrates. It killed nearly 200 people, injured thousands and caused losses worth billions of dollars.The country is in desperate need of financial assistance but France and other international powers have refused to provide aid before serious reforms are made. The crisis is largely blamed on decades of systematic corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s ruling class.The French leader has described his initiative, which includes a road map and a timetable for reforms, as “the last chance for this system.”Adib’s resignation comes a few days after Aoun himself bluntly told reporters that Lebanon would be going to “hell” if a new government was not formed soon.In a televised address, he criticized his political allies, the Shiite groups Hezbollah and Amal, for insisting on holding on to the Finance Ministry portfolio in any new government, but also criticized Adib for attempting to form a government and impose names for Cabinet positions without consulting with the parliamentary blocs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-prime-minister-designate-resigns-amid-impasse/story-Wr3iKOIzMQHIKPv1U8HJdI.html
26-09-2020||World||Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine produces strong immune response in early trial||A single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, according to interim results published on Friday.The vaccine, called Ad26.COV2.S, was equally well-tolerated at two different doses, the results showed. A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, could simplify distribution of the vaccine. However, it is unclear whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk from the virus, will be protected to the same degree as younger people with the J&J vaccine.The trial in close to 1,000 healthy adults, which is backed by the U.S. government, began after the J&J vaccine was found in July to offer strong protection in a single dose to monkeys.Based on the current results, J&J on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial, which could pave the way for an application for regulatory approval. The company said it expects results of that so-called Phase 3 trial by the end of the year or early next year.The results, released on the medical website medRxiv, have not been peer-reviewed.Researchers, including those from J&J’s unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said 98% of participants with data available for the interim analysis had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination. However, immune response results were available from only a small number of people - 15 participants - over 65 years old, limiting the interpretation.In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong. The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed. For now, the results justify why more studies are needed in larger numbers to look for serious adverse effects, Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the J&J trial, told Reuters. “Overall, the vaccine is doing what you would expect it to do if you were to move it to Phase 3 trials,” Bloom said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-produces-strong-immune-response-in-early-trial/story-Uu7C21l4onORsRkQjCDpoO.html
26-09-2020||World||Paris stabbing suspect apparently from Pakistan, says minister||A young man stabbed two people Friday outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people were killed in 2015, and a terrorism investigation has been opened into the new attack, authorities said.The suspected assailant had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalization, France’s interior minister said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.Two people were wounded in Friday’s attack, and two suspects were arrested, although the links between the two suspects weren’t immediately clear. The main suspect, a young man with speckles of blood on his forehead and wearing orange gym shoes, was arrested on the steps of the Bastille Opera in eastern Paris, authorities said. The site is not far from where Friday’s attack took place, outside the building where the weekly Charlie Hebdo was located before the 2015 attack.The interior minister said the assailant arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified.“Manifestly it’s an act of Islamist terrorism,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in an interview with public broadcaster France-2. “Obviously, there is little doubt. It’s a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists, against this society.” France’s counterterrorism prosecutor said earlier that authorities suspect a terrorist motive because of the place and timing of the stabbings: in front of the building where Charlie Hebdo was based until the Islamic extremist attack on its cartoonists, and at a time when suspects in the 2015 attack are on trial across town.Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said that the chief suspect in Friday’s stabbings was arrested, along with another person. Ricard said the assailant did not know the people stabbed, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.An investigation was opened into “attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise,” according to the terrorism prosecutor’s office.French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the lives of the two wounded workers lives were not in danger. He offered the government’s solidarity with their families and colleagues.The prime minister noted the “symbolic site” of the attack, “at the very moment where the trial into the atrocious acts against Charlie Hebdo is under way.” He promised the government’s “unfailing attachment to freedom of the press, and its determination to fight terrorism.” People in the neighbourhood were stunned, saying on French TV that they were reliving the nightmare of the newsroom massacre.In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo strongly condemned the stabbings.“This tragic episode shows us once again that fanaticism, intolerance, the origins of which will be revealed by the investigation, are still present in French society....There is no question of ceding anything,” the newspaper said.The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told France’s BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company’s staff members were evacuated.Moreira said a man in the street “attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn’t enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left.” He said the company had not received any threats.His colleague, Luc Hermann, describing witnesses’ version of the attack, said the assailant first struck the woman in her face, then the man, before returning to attack the woman again.“The whole team ... took refuge on the roof of the building like our team did five years ago during the attack of Charlie Hebdo,” he said on France-2.He said it was “incomprehensible” that authorities had not taken special security precautions particularly at this time.A wrenching, two-month trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently unfolding at the main Paris courthouse. Murmurs broke at the terrorism trial of 14 people, including 3 fugitives, accused of helping the attackers in the January 2015 killings, as the news filtered through.The widows of the two brothers who forced their way into the newspaper’s offices and opened fire at a morning editorial meeting testified Friday.Caty Richard, a lawyer for the Charlie Hebdo journalists, heard about the knife attack in the midst of the trial.“My first thought was this will never end,” she said. “I am devastated, angry.” The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered. He said that 775 police protect its new location.But “there was an attack so we could have done better,” he said. The minister said he has ordered special protection for all “symbolic sites,” noting in particular Jewish sites ahead of the Yom Kippur holiday this weekend. A Jewish grocery store was targeted days after the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre in what authorities say were coordinated attacks.Charlie Hebdo recently reproduced caricatures of the Muslim prophet that stoked the ire of some Muslims when first produced.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paris-stabbing-suspect-apparently-from-pakistan-says-minister/story-M4K3klkE1gjihCIDWW3BFP.html
26-09-2020||World||Can Covid-19 affect the heart? Likely, says study||Nigerian-American basketball player Michael Ojo, who had recovered from Covid-19, collapsed during training and died of heart attack. Ojo was 27 years old and did not have any heart ailment earlier. Instances like these raise questions whether Covid-19 can affect the heart. Shedding some light on this topic, a paper by American cardiologist Eric Topol, published on sciencemag.org, claimed cardiac complications have occurred even in cases where Covid-19 symptoms were minimum or not present at all. "These complications, which at times are the only features of #COVID19 clinical presentation, have occurred even in cases with mild symptoms and in people who did not experience any symptoms" https://t.co/q42cY3ujV4a 🧵to explain 1/“The most recent coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has marked tropism for the heart and can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), necrosis of its cells, mimicking of a heart attack, arrhythmias, and acute or protracted heart failure (muscle dysfunction),” the paper said.“These complications, which at times are the only features of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) clinical presentation, have occurred even in cases with mild symptoms and in people who did not experience any symptoms. Recent findings of heart involvement in young athletes, including sudden death, have raised concerns about the current limits of our knowledge and potentially high risk and occult prevalence of Covid-19 heart manifestations,” it said.  The paper said in contrast to people without symptoms, there is a substantial proportion of people who suffer a longstanding, often debilitating illness, called long-Covid. Typical symptoms include fatigue, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythm. . “Once recognised a few months into the pandemic, the expectation was that cardiac involvement would chiefly occur in patients with severe Covid-19. Clearly, it is more common than anticipated, but the true incidence is unknown. It is vital to determine what drives this pathogenesis. Whether it represents an individual’s inflammatory response, an autoimmune phenomenon, or some other explanation needs to be clarified,” the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-covid-19-affect-the-heart-likely-says-study/story-A8FHB5NJPd0r0L8CPmhZrN.html
26-09-2020||World||China pushes emergency use of Covid-19 vaccine despite concerns||After the first shot, he had no reaction. But Kan Chai felt woozy following the second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in China.“When I was driving on the road, I suddenly felt a bit dizzy, as if I was driving drunk,” the popular writer and columnist recounted on a webinar earlier this month. “So I specially found a place to stop the car, rest a bit and then I felt better.” His is a rare account from the hundreds of thousands of people who have been given Chinese vaccines, before final regulatory approval for general use. It’s an unusual move that raises ethical and safety questions, as companies and governments worldwide race to develop a vaccine that will stop the spread of the new coronavirus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageChinese companies earlier drew attention for giving the vaccine to their top executives and leading researchers before human trials to test their safety and efficacy had even begun. In recent months, they have injected a far larger number under an emergency use designation approved in June, and that number appears poised to rise.A Chinese health official said Friday that China, which has largely eradicated the disease, needs to take steps to prevent it from coming back. But one outside expert questioned the need for emergency use when the virus is no longer spreading in the country where it was first detected.It’s unclear exactly who and how many people have been injected so far, but Chinese vaccine makes have offered some clues. State-owned Sinopharm subsidiary CNBG has given the vaccine to 350,000 people outside its clinical trials, which have about 40,000 people enrolled, a top CNBG executive said recently.Another company, SinoVac, has injected 90 per cent of its employees and family members, or about 3,000 people, most under the emergency-use provision, CEO Yin Weidong said. It has also provided tens of thousands of rounds of its CoronaVac to the Beijing city government.Another candidate being jointly developed by the military and Cansino, a biopharmaceutical company, has been approved for emergency use in military personnel.“The first people to have priority in emergency use are the vaccine researchers and the vaccine manufacturers because when the pandemic comes, if these people are infected then there’s no way to produce the vaccine,” Yin said.Now, large Chinese firms including telecom giant Huawei and broadcaster Phoenix TV have announced they’re working with Sinopharm to get the vaccine for their employees.Several people who say they work in “front-line” organisations have said on social media that their workplaces have offered vaccinations for about 1,000 yuan (USD 150). They declined to comment, saying they would need permission from their organisation.In an established but limited practice, experimental medications have been approved historically for use when they are still in the third and last phase of human trials. Chinese companies have four vaccines in phase 3 - two from Sinopharm and one each from SinoVac and Cansino.The Chinese government referenced the World Health Organisation’s emergency-use principles to create its own through a strict process, National Health Commission official Zheng Zhongwei said at a news conference Friday.He said there have been no serious side effects in the clinical trials.“We’ve made it very clear that the Covid-19 vaccine we put into emergency use are safe,” Zheng said. “Their safety can be ensured but their efficacy is yet to be determined.” Under the emergency rule, high-risk personnel such as medical and customs workers and those who have to work overseas are given priority access, he said. He declined to provide exact numbers.“In China’s case, the pressure in preventing imported infections and domestic resurgence is still huge,” Zheng said.But Diego Silva, a lecturer in Bioethics at the University of Sydneym, said that giving vaccines to hundreds of thousands outside of clinical trials doesn’t have “scientific merit” in China, where there are currently very few locally transmitted cases, and incoming arrivals are quarantined centrally.“If it’s in the US Where the virus is still raging that’s a bit different, but in a country like China it doesn’t seem to make sense to me,” he said. “Because there’s not enough of the virus in China locally to deduce anything, you’re introducing a whole host of others factors” by injecting people outside of trials.Zheng said that all those injected under emergency use are being closely tracked for any adverse health effects.Kan Chai, the columnist, wrote in an article posted online in September that despite initial hesitation, he decided to sign up after he heard a state-owned company was looking for volunteers.He didn’t say whether his was an emergency-use case, but the timing of his vaccination suggests it was. He took the first dose in late July, when the emergency inoculations were getting started and the trials were all but over.“I’m willing to be a little white mouse, and the biggest reason is because I have trust in our country’s vaccination technology,” he said.His real name is Li Yong, but his 1.65 million followers on the Twitter-like social platform Weibo know him better by his pen name, which means “10 years of chopping wood.” He declined an interview request.He described taking the vaccine in a public webinar hosted by 8am HealthInsight, a popular health media outlet. It’s unclear why he qualified to receive it.Scant information is publicly available about the program’s scope, size, and scientific merit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-despite-concerns/story-XjgYrmwBRvxR1o4qMkq5PL.html
26-09-2020||World||‘Fitting’ mask controversy: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau criticises police for discriminating against Sikh personnel||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticised the country’s premier law enforcement agency for a policy on wearing medical-grade respirator masks that appears to discriminate against Sikh personnel, who have been pulled off the frontlines amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) instituted a policy that mandates frontline officers wear “fitting” respirators that has apparently resulted in many Sikhs in the force being assigned desk jobs as their beards prevent wearing such masks. Hitting out at the policy during a media interaction, PM Trudeau said, “It is something that I certainly hope the RCMP rectifies quickly and it shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”He said he was “very disappointed” over the issue as “many other police forces and other organisations have figured out ways of upholding health and safety standards without needing to create discrimination against certain individuals because of their religion”.In March, the RCMP issued a directive regarding these masks, and, according to the agency Canadian Press, it noted that “one of the most common causes of a breached seal is facial hair”.The issue was flagged by the World Sikh Organisation (WSO), which said that due to this policy, nearly 30 Sikhs officers had been reassigned since March 31. It said it was contacted by some officers in April and they “reported that they had been re-assigned to administrative duties, which many find less than meaningful”.The RCMP has argued that it has to operate under federal regulations unlike police forces in cities like Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal, where similar norms have not been implemented. It said it doesn’t have the authority to change the rules regarding personal protective equipment (PPE), as per a CBC News report.In a statement, WSO president Tejinder Singh Sidhu said, “The RCMP are the only police force in Canada that refuse to accommodate bearded Sikh officers. Sikh RCMP officers have patiently waited for almost six months to be returned to active duty. However, there has been no desire on the RCMP’s part to address this situation. There is no reason that the RCMP should require a higher standard of PPE protection than any other police force in Canada or even medical frontline workers. Sikh officers continue to serve in every other police force in Canada.”The stand appears to also have the support of Bill Blair, Canada’s public safety and emergency preparedness minister. CBC News quoted an emailed response from his office, which stated it is “essential for the RCMP to provide necessary PPE in a timely manner for Sikh officers. We have raised this matter with the RCMP, and expect that this be rectified as quickly as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fitting-mask-controversy-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-criticises-police-for-discriminating-against-sikh-personnel/story-WtIloraNnBo6lLEjpLbNHI.html
26-09-2020||World||Canadian man charged with faking his past as Islamic State terrorist||A Pakistani-origin man, who gained international notoriety on the basis of his claims of having been a hardened fighter for the Islamic State terror group, may have fabricated his entire account. Shehroze Chaudhry, a 25-year-old from the town of Burlington in the Canadian province of Ontario, has been charged by law enforcement “in connection with a hoax regarding terrorist activity”.Chaudhry gained prominence under the pseudonym Abu Huzayfah and was featured on The New York Times podcast Caliphate and in a documentary from Canada’s national broadcaster CBC.In a statement issued on Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) O Division Integrated National Security Enforcement Team or OINSET said he had been arrested and charged after a “lengthy investigation”. The charge, it said, stemmed from “numerous media interviews where the accused” claimed to have “travelled to Syria in 2016 to join the terrorist group ISIS and committed acts of terrorism”. His interviews were widely published on various media platforms “raising public safety concerns amongst Canadians”. He has been charged with “hoax terrorist activity”, and is scheduled to make a court appearance on November 16 in Brampton, Ontario.In a statement, Superintendent Christopher deGale, the officer in charge of the RCMP’s OINSET, said, “Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise. As a result, the RCMP takes these allegations very seriously, particularly when individuals, by their actions, cause the police to enter into investigations in which human and financial resources are invested and diverted from other ongoing priorities.”OINSET is committed to investigating cases of “foreign travellers”, individuals who either leave Canada to participate in terrorism abroad or return to the country after having done so.According to the outlet Global News, Chaudhry’s social media profiles indicate he had left Canada for Pakistan in 2013 and studied at the University of Lahore’s Department of Environmental Science throughout 2014. It also reported that in August 2017, he told the outlet he had used his Pakistani passport instead of the Canadian one to travel to Syria and join IS, and then returned to Pakistan via Turkey after getting “disillusioned”. Thereafter he moved back to Canada.It also quoted the Caliphate podcast, in which he is alleged to have “described conducting public executions”. In one segment, he is alleged to have said, “I had to stab him multiple times. And then we put him up on a cross. And I had to leave the dagger in his heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-man-charged-with-faking-his-past-as-islamic-state-terrorist/story-WBAkmivIYHlZrEnShhLVeM.html
26-09-2020||World||UNGA: India questions Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s claim to be protector of Muslims||India on Friday slammed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s verbal attack on India at the UN General Assembly as a “new low” for the world body on its 75th anniversary, and questioned his claim to be a champion of Muslims when he is unable to protect them in his own country.An Indian diplomat, who delivered India’s response to the Pakistan PM’s diatribe, also sought to remind Khan of the “genocide” perpetrated by his country on Muslims of erstwhile East Pakistan before it became Bangladesh, without naming them.India sought to target the Pakistan PM’s attempt to position himself as a champion of Muslims to align himself with leading Islamic countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.“This august forum witnessed today a new low on its 75th anniversary,” said Mijito Vinito, a diplomat at the Indian permanent mission to the UN, reading a statement under the UNGA debates’ “right of reply” rule, which gives member countries an opportunity to respond if criticised.“For someone who professes to be a champion of Islam, this is also a country that has encouraged the killing of fellow Muslims merely because they belonged to a different sect, or to a different region in Pakistan, and through sponsoring terrorist attacks against its neighbours,” the India diplomat said.Vinito was referring to the killing of Muslims of the Shia and Sufi sects in Pakistan by terrorists sheltered and supported by the state, the large number of people killed and missing in Balochistan, a restive province of Pakistan, and those killed in cross-border attacks in Kashmir.The Indian diplomat went on to cite the most glaring instance yet of a Muslim-majority country turning upon its own people. “This is the country that brought genocide to South Asia 39 years back when it killed its own people,” Vinito said, addressing Khan’s use of the word “genocide” in his speech as he had attacked India without apparent evidence.He added, “This is also the country that is shameless enough not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetrated even after so many years.”The “genocide” the Indian diplomat referred to was the killing of between 300,000 and 3,000,000 people in current-day Bangladesh, mostly Muslims, by the Pakistan Army in 1971 to quell an independence movement that succeeded eventually with the help of the Indian Army.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the UNGA at 6.30pm India time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unga-india-questions-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-s-claim-to-be-protector-of-muslims/story-oABRr4VrGmA0VGhM39IaVL.html
26-09-2020||World||Terrorism, clandestine nuclear trade Pakistan’s ‘only crowning glory’ for 70 years: India at UN||The “only crowning glory” that Pakistan has to show to the world for the last seven decades is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade, India said in a scathing response on Friday, slamming Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “incessant rant” and “venom” in the UN General Assembly.“This august forum witnessed a new low on its 75th anniversary. The leader of Pakistan today called for those who incite hate and violence to be outlawed. But as he went on, we were left wondering, was he referring to himself?” First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Mijito Vinito said, making India’s Right of Reply.Also read: ‘Lies, misinformation, warmongering’: India responds to Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s UN addressThe strong rebuttal came after Khan spoke about India’s internal affairs, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, during his pre-recorded video statement at the high-level General Debate. Vinito, who was sitting at India’s seat in the UN General Assembly hall for the General Debate, walked out when Khan started his usual “diatribe” about India.“This hall heard the incessant rant of someone who had nothing to show for himself, who had no achievements to speak of and no reasonable suggestion to offer to the world. Instead, we saw lies, misinformation, war mongering and malice spread through this Assembly,” the young Indian diplomat said.Slamming Pakistan for its record as a nation, Vinito said, “The only crowning glory that this country has to show to the world for the last 70 years is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade.” Alluding to the “stellar record” of Pakistan, he said this is the country that has the “dubious distinction” of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations, a reference to terror masterminds such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) head Masood Azhar.“This is the same country that provides pensions for dreaded and listed terrorists out of State funds. The leader whom we heard today is the same person who referred to terrorist Osama Bin Laden as a ‘martyr’“ in the Pakistani Parliament in July, Vinito said.He added that it is Pakistan that brought genocide to South Asia 39 years ago when it killed its own people and it is also the country that is “shameless enough” not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetrated even after so many years.Also read: Indian diplomat walks out after Imran Khan raises Kashmir issue at UNIndia asserted in its Right of Reply that Khan, “who spewed venom today”, admitted in 2019 in public in the US that his country still has about 30,000-40,000 terrorists, who have been trained by Pakistan and have fought in Afghanistan and in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.“This is the country that has systematically cleansed its minorities, including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and others, through the abuse of its blasphemy laws and through forced religious conversions,” Vinito said, adding that “for someone who professes to be a champion of Islam, this is also a country that has encouraged killing of fellow Muslims merely because they belonged to a different sect or to a different region in Pakistan and through sponsoring terrorist attacks against its neighbours”.Pakistan has consistently used UN platforms, including the high-level General Assembly sessions, to rake up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, but has repeatedly found no resonance with the international community for its “diatribe”.India strongly asserted that Jammu and Kashmir is its “integral and inalienable part” and the rules and legislations brought in the Union Territory are strictly its internal affairs.“The only dispute left in Kashmir relates to that part of Kashmir that is still under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to vacate all those areas that it is in illegal occupation of,” Vinito said, adding that what should instead be on the agenda of the UN is Pakistan’s “deep state and its unrelenting political and financial support to terrorist organisations and mercenaries, which are a threat to global peace and security”.“The only way for Pakistan to become a normal country is to abjure its moral, financial and material support to terrorism, turn its attention to the problems faced by its own population, including its minorities, and stop misusing UN platforms to further its nefarious agenda,” India said.The words used in the General Assembly by Khan “demean” the very essence of the United Nations, Vinito said, adding that “for a nation that is deeply buried in medievalism, it is understandable that the tenets of a modern civilised society such as peace, dialogue and diplomacy are farfetched”.Pakistan’s delegate then made a response to India’s Right of Reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorism-clandestine-nuclear-trade-pakistan-s-only-crowning-glory-for-70-years-india-at-un/story-GjXtmu2tqlR91V8LPM3lGL.html
26-09-2020||World||Japan’s new PM Yoshihide Suga says stable Japan-China ties key to region||New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in talks Friday to work closely together by holding high-level meetings including summits, but did not discuss the possibility of a visit by Xi to Japan.“I told (Xi) that the stability of Japan-China relations is crucial, not only for the two countries but also for the region and for international society,” Suga told reporters after their phone conversation.His talks with Xi late Friday were his first since taking office just over a week ago, replacing Shinzo Abe, who resigned due to poor health.A planned visit by Xi to Japan last April was indefinitely postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The plan had triggered protests even within Japan’s governing party because of China’s tightening of controls over Hong Kong and its assertive actions in regional seas.“We did not discuss (Xi’s) possible visit to Japan,” Suga said.However, the leaders agreed to hold summits and other high-level meetings to cooperate in bilateral, regional and international issues, he said.Relations between the two Asian rivals have improved recently as China faces heightened tensions with the United States.But Japan sees China’s military development and increasingly assertive stance in the East and South China Seas as a major security threat. Chinese coast guard vessels routinely violate territorial waters around the Japanese-controlled southern islands of Senkaku, which China calls Diaoyu and also claims.China’s official Xinhua News Agency said that Xi noted the improvement in relations and said that China stands ready to work with the Suga government to deepen cooperation in mutually beneficial areas such as trade and to handle sensitive issues, including historical ones.Japan’s military invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s remains a sore spot between the two.Earlier Friday, Suga also held talks by phone with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed his intention to work together to achieve a “free and open Indo-Pacific” aimed at checking China’s maritime assertiveness.On Thursday, Suga held talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and urged him to take actions to mend bilateral relations badly damaged by war compensation issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-new-pm-yoshihide-suga-says-stable-japan-china-ties-key-to-region/story-Rijjebg5f5ugWb5dhhKIZN.html
26-09-2020||World||40 years after Oktoberfest attack, survivor’s wounds still healing||That evening on September 26, 1980, Robert Platzer, then 12, was having a great night out. He had been on fairground rides, eaten bags of sweets and even bought a helium balloon -- all that a child dreams of at the Munich Oktoberfest.He was just at the exit of the popular beer festival with his parents and four siblings when he saw a man with his arms in the rubbish bin, towards which his family was headed. But at that moment, the bomb went off.“There was a huge flame, I was thrown back several metres,” Robert Hoeckmayr, who has since taken his wife’s family name, told AFP in an interview.A bomb in the trashcan had exploded just steps away from the merry-go-round and the beer tents.Thirteen people -- including the bomber Gundolf Koehler -- were killed and more than 200 injured. Four decades on, prosecutors in July finally classed it a political attack -- the deadliest far-right assault in post-war Germany.Investigators initially assumed the 21-year-old Koehler was a depressed geology student, who had acted because of relationship problems and exam stress, downplaying his known links to the extremist scene.But further revelations about the extent of Koehler’s involvement with the far-right and speculation he may not have acted alone prompted prosecutors to reopen the investigation in 2014.After interviewing over a thousand witnesses and combing through 300,000 documents, investigators believe Koehler aimed for the attack to be blamed on the far left. His goal had been to influence that year’s general election and usher in a conservative candidate as chancellor.- Survivors need help -The 40th anniversary of the attack on Saturday comes as far-right violence is once again on the rise in Germany, with a deadly attack targeting a synagogue in Halle in 2019 and another that left nine people of migrant origin dead in Hanau in February.Hoeckmayr did not want to be drawn into discussing the political extremism that has sparked the violence. For him, more must be done to help survivors.“I don’t care from which side the attack comes from, the survivors need to be better taken care of,” he said.Hoeckmayr’s experience underlines how the devastation wrought goes on far beyond that fateful day.His eight-year-old sister Ilona was killed on the spot. His little brother, six, died on the way to the hospital in the ambulance. His parents were severely wounded.His sister Elisabeth survived but died of a drug overdose at 24. His brother threw himself under a train in 2008, at age 42.“They could not stand the pain. I am the sole survivor in this family,” said Hoeckmayr, now 52 and a Munich city official.He has had 41 operations to remove metal shards lodged all over his body.“They didn’t manage to remove all of them,” said the tall man with greying hair.But what was even more difficult to heal was the feeling of being “abandoned” by the German state after the attack. “We were never offered psychological help. Several months after the attack, the doctors declared that I was healthy, just because I could walk,” he said. It was thanks to his wife and three children that he was able to pick up the pieces.“They gave me the energy to live.”Beyond the lack of psychological support, he is also angry about the low level of financial aid provided to people wounded in the attack.But that may soon change, with the city of Munich, the Bavarian state and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to stump up 1.2 million euros ($1.4 million) for victims of the attack.For Hoeckmayr, “40 years later is too late”.“It’s not just about money but about helping people who have experienced terrible things to return to society,” said Hoeckmayr, who refuses to be labelled a victim, saying he is a survivor.He will participate in a ceremony on Saturday when Munich inaugurates a new information site that tells the story of the attack.Underlining its importance, he said: “Here too, many people know that something happened on September 26, 1980, but they don’t know what it is.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-years-after-oktoberfest-attack-survivor-s-wounds-still-healing/story-RckloMUL9VjlcHr6R4o6XP.html
26-09-2020||World||China reports asymptomatic Covid-19 cases after 35 days||the 32 million mark, China detected its first local asymptomatic infections in more than a month after two port workers who unloaded frozen seafood tested positive, adding to alarm that contaminated imports could be transmitting the coronavirus.The two cases, found in Shandong province’s Qingdao city during testing of port workers, were the first symptom-free cases that China has reported since August 20. China hasn’t reported any local symptomatic infections since August 15 either.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The new cases will intensify concern in China over whether imported products are infectious. Traces of the virus have been found on frozen, imported seafood and meat, as well as in the containers in which they were shipped.Also, China said it plans to produce 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine per year by 2021, and claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) had backed its emergency use of experimental vaccines on high-risk groups in late June. The National Health commission (NHC) said China’s annual production capacity of vaccines is expected to reach 610 million doses by the end of this year.China had informed the WHO about inoculating high-risk groups on June 29, Zheng Zhongwei, director-general of the NHC’s development centre for medical science and technology, told reporters on Friday.China approved the plan on June 24 and authorised emergency use of the vaccines on July 22. “After the approval, on June 29, we made a communication with representatives of the WHO Office in China, and obtained support and understanding from WHO,” Zheng said.‘London at tipping point’Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday said London is at a “very worrying tipping point” as officials revealed that the capital city is being placed on the UK-wide “watch list”. Khan said, “London is at a very worrying tipping point right now. We’re seeing a sharp rise in 111 calls (for medical care), hospital admissions and patients in ICU. The near-collapse of test and trace and the resurgence of the virus means new measures to slow its spread were absolutely necessary.”Meanwhile, Novavax has begun a late-stage trial of its potential vaccine in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-after-35-days/story-dQ9wl2RD4aCjASNJaeztlM.html
26-09-2020||World||Two million virus deaths ‘likely’ without collective action: WHO||Two million Covid-19 fatalities are “very likely” without relentless global action to combat the disease, the World Health Organization said Friday.As the one million death toll looms in a pandemic that has surged around the planet, the WHO said the prospect of another million deaths was not unimaginable, if countries and individuals do not come together to tackle the crisis.“One million is a terrible number and we need to reflect on that before we start considering a second million,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual news conference, when asked if it was unthinkable that two million people could die in the pandemic.But he added: “Are we prepared collectively to do what it takes to avoid that number?“If we don’t take those actions... yes, we will be looking at that number and sadly much higher.“Unless we do it all, the numbers you speak about are not only imaginable but unfortunately, and sadly, very likely.”The novel coronavirus has killed at least 984,068 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Friday.Nearly 32.3 million cases of the virus have been registered.Ryan reflected on the challenges ahead in funding, producing and distributing any eventual vaccines against Covid-19.“If we look at losing a million people in nine months and then we just look at the realities of getting a vaccine out there in the next nine months, it’s a big task for for everyone involved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-million-virus-deaths-likely-without-collective-action-who/story-rtGt8mACkcbygqF8MnqFwL.html
26-09-2020||World||New York City to let restaurants keep sidewalk dining all year||New York City’s “Open Restaurants” program, which allows outdoor dining for restaurants, will be extended to year round, the mayor’s office announced.The program, which started in June and had been set to expire Oct. 31, will now let restaurants expand seating to adjacent properties with consent. It also allows restaurants to use propane and natural gas heaters on sidewalks with a permit. Electrical heaters can be used in dining areas on both sidewalks and roads.New York City currently prohibits all indoor dining, but will allow restaurants to open indoor dining rooms at 25% capacity, beginning September 30.The program is a bid to help restaurants that have suffered amid social distancing during the outbreak of Covid-19. The industry has struggled to adapt as diners stay home and lower capacity rules put a limit on sales. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday enacted a more sweeping measure, allowing all restaurants and other businesses to reopen.Across the country, local leaders are grappling with the issue of reopening restaurants, and it has at times proven divisive. States are balancing the need to protect an industry, which generates nearly $900 billion annually in the U.S., with the need for social distancing in order to prevent the pandemic’s spread.“We already have well over 10,000 restaurants participating, well over 100,000 jobs have been saved,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an interview on WNYC announcing the decision. “We hope it’s going to make it a lot easier for restaurants to survive.”One New York restaurateur dismissed the initiative as too little, too late, and coming at no small cost.“You have to figure a tank of propane a night per table. A tank costs about $40; it only heats smaller areas. That’s around $3,000 a week in propane right there,” said Jeff Katz, owner of Crown Shy restaurant in New York’s Financial District. “Good luck getting a heater now if you haven’t gotten one. Everything online is like, we’ll ship in February. This announcement comes really late.”(Updates with details on Florida in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-to-let-restaurants-keep-sidewalk-dining-all-year/story-BWHwdIkQgngAerlFhHzHnN.html
26-09-2020||World||Quad senior officials discuss efforts to ensure open, inclusive Indo-Pacific||Ahead of the second ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), senior officials of the four countries in the grouping held consultations on Friday on collective efforts to advance a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.The senior officials of the foreign ministries of India, Australia and Japan and the US state department held a video conference and discussed ways to enhance the resilience of supply chains amid the Covid-19 crisis and shared best practices on combating the Covid-19 pandemic.The foreign ministers of the Quad are expected to meet in Tokyo early in October against the backdrop of China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour across the region. The Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level with a meeting on the margin of the UN General Assembly last year.The upcoming ministerial meeting will be held at a time when all four members of the Quad have serious differences with China – India is engaged in a border standoff in Ladakh, the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war.During Friday’s video conference, the senior officials exchanged views on ongoing and proposed practical cooperation in connectivity and infrastructure development and security matters, including counter-terrorism, cyber and maritime security, to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.“The four democracies discussed ways to work together to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, promote transparency and counter disinformation, and protect the rules-based order the region has long enjoyed,” said a readout from the US state department.In an apparent reference to American efforts against Chinese telecom major Huawei, the US readout said the officials noted the importance of digital connectivity and secure networks and discussed ways to “promote the use of trusted vendors, particularly for fifth generation (5G) networks”. The officials also explored ways to enhance coordination on counter-terrorism, maritime and cyber security, regional connectivity, and quality infrastructure based upon international best practices, such as the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. They also highlighted the need to improve supply chains in sectors such as critical minerals, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, the US readout added.Both the Indian statement and the US readout reiterated the Quad’s firm support to the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Asean-led mechanisms in the regional architecture for the Indo-Pacific. The members of the Quad expressed their readiness to work with ASEAN and other countries to realise a common vision for the Indo-Pacific. The officials also explored ways to work together in the Mekong sub-region, in the South China Sea, and across the Indo-Pacific to support international law, pluralism, regional stability, and post-pandemic recovery efforts, the US readout said.China’s growing aggression and assertiveness has prompted the members of the Quad to step up efforts, both among themselves and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific, to forge new supply chains and to enhance maritime security cooperation.The foreign secretaries of India, Australia and France co-chaired the first senior officials’ trilateral dialogue on September 9 to enhance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen multilateralism. On September 1, India, Australia and Japan agreed to launch an initiative to ensure the resilience of supply chains in the Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-senior-officials-discuss-efforts-to-ensure-open-inclusive-indo-pacific/story-xizzagQbljI7bOUOEhNsCK.html
