The only section that benefits from this sabotage is Gurugram’s water mafia that operates many water tanker services, which residents are forced to hire in the absence of supply, said officials.There are nearly 50 censors installed so far, out of the sanctioned strength of 500, which detect such damages and are controlled from the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) in Sector 44 through an extensive GIS-based surveillance, said GMDA officials. They added that earlier the problem of water theft and damaging of pipelines was reported only from new developing sectors such as sectors 61 to 95 and the Dwarka Expressway area but the mafia have expanded and become active across the city.Pradeep Aggarwal, who oversees the Smart City project at GMDA, said, “We have received 1,500 complaints in the last five months. Before the lockdown, there used to be a maximum of two complaints everyday but since March, we have been getting between eight and 10 complaints daily.”Thefts have been reported from Sushant Lok 1 and 2, South City 1 and 2, DLF Phase 1 to 4, Sector 54, 57, Palam Vihar, Sector 22 and 23. GMDA officials said once a pipeline is damaged, it takes at least two days to repair and at least 10 officials are involved in the process of detecting the damage and resuming operations. Water mafia is a big threat to the supply infrastructure and GMDA has appointed teams of officials from different departments to rein them in. At least 10 officials are assigned to patrol, detect and fix the damage, Aggarwal said. Officials said they also loop in the police to take prompt action. “We have already set up an extensive GIS-based surveillance which consists of a network of CCTVs and sensors that transmit real-time visual feeds and data to a dashboard dedicated to water supply at the command centre. The surveillance system is based on Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping technology, a citywide network of fibre optic cables which is running parallel to its water pipelines and CCTVs,” he said.Dr Sultan Singh, head of GIS at GMDA, and a senior scientist at the Haryana Space Applications Centre (Harsac), said that they have created the One Map platform which is helping all divisions detect theft and that they are regularly monitoring those areas which are sensitive and require more water supplies. “We immediately send feed related to water theft to the teams concerned and prompt action is taken,” he said. Singh said all censors will be installed within a few months which will solve all issues related to water theft and damaging of water pipelines.SPS Rana, consultant to GMDA, said there are nearly 574 consumers connected to them which are sanctioned, out of which 146 have been given to the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG). “We have installed 22 electromagnetic flow meters so far and the process is ongoing until we bring the entire area under GMDA. We are receiving between eight-10 complaints related to water theft and damaging of water pipelines. We are working on all aspects and by the end of the year, the issues will be resolved as all teams are working towards solving the water crisis and ensuring proper supply,” he said. GMDA is the master water supplier to the city. Officials said the authority has sufficient capacity to supply the present demand of water which is about 410 million litres per day (MLD). Bulk water supply from treatment plants in Chandu Budhera and Basai is 450-480 MLD. They are also supplying water to MCG, which is making it available for residents in their own jurisdiction. Presently, colonies on the outskirts and new licensed colonies in areas like Gwal Pahari and Ghata are facing some technical problems and are depending on tanker supply. Officials said their aim is to eventually integrate them as well. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said they have identified areas where most of the water theft cases have been reported and teams are on the lookout. “Strict action will be taken against anyone found involved. We have identified more than 50 history sheeters involved in unauthorised water supply and digging bore wells near residential areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-gurugram-gmda-got-over-1-500-complaints-of-damage-to-water-pipelines-in-last-five-months/story-2eN1n0oGd1SXYbRDwqOTMN.html
02-09-2020||Gurugram||Despite MCG takeover, water supply remains a crisis in South City 1, 2||Despite the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) taking over South City 1-2 in April last year, water issues remain unabated for residents of the two colonies.The existing water supply remains insufficient as well as substandard, they alleged. To compensate for this, the residents say they have had to rely on private tankers which is expensive, almost 10 times the rate of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) that is ₹9.45 per kilolitre. There have been at least five incidents where residents from the two colonies complained to the police that the water mafia allegedly sabotaged their civic water supply to stay in the business. Wakim Aziz, a resident of South City-1’s Block M, said that they are completely dependent on water tankers and that the shortage seemed to be increasing ever day. “We have paid more than ₹8,000 a month to water tankers as the taps went dry and no one from MCG takes the responsibility or offered any solution,” he said. The residents alleged that before they even get to know that a water pipeline would be under repair, the water tankers would have start moving from colony to colony announcing that there will be no supply for next few days. Ritik Garg, another resident from Block M of South City -1, suspected an unholy nexus between authority officials and the “water mafia”. “The people managing these water tankers are mostly those with a criminal background and if we try to negotiate with them for a reasonable price, they leave immediately, leaving us no choice. They do not let any other tanker visit the colony either,” he said. The situation remains the same in South City -2 where residents say they are paying at least ₹500 each a day for water since March. In the summers, this goes up to ₹900 to ₹1,200.“It is becoming very difficult for residents to get water. We have protested, requested authorities to look into the matter, but nothing has helped. Those who operate water tankers in our area have control over the supply,” said Vishal Vaid, a resident of Block D. A senior citizen, resident of Block D of South City 1, requesting anonymity, said, “My wife and I were on our morning walk when we caught three youths damaging a water pipeline. When I questioned them, they told me to go ahead and inform the police and to make a video to share with them. They had no fear. When we returned home, we found out that the water pipeline was damaged and there was no supply in our block.” Gurugram police officials said that three crime teams have been formed to check the issue. City police commissioner KK Rao said that the teams will inspect the areas and compile data of the spots where the pipelines were damaged. “We have requested resident welfare associations to install cameras at crucial points and to deploy guards in those area to monitor the movement of people and to ensure no one tampers the pipeline,” he said. Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, said that the water is supplied by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to the developer and is routed through them in South city 2. “We inspect the area immediately after we receive any complaint. Also we inform police to investigate the reason behind the damage,” he said.

02-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Former top cops move Bombay HC to restrain media trial||Five former director generals of police (DGP) of Maharashtra, two former commissioners of Mumbai Police and a former anti-terrorism squad (ATS) chief have moved a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking a restraint on the media trial in the ongoing investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. The former cops, in the PIL, have claimed a certain section of electronic media is maligning the image of the Mumbai Police through media trial, and urged the HC to restrain them. Former DGPs PS Pasricha, K Subramaniam, D Shivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal, Satish Chandra Mathur; former commissioners of Mumbai Police Mahesh N Singh, Dhananjay N Jadhav; and former ATS chief KP Raghuvanshi have filed the PIL through advocate Sanjay Ashar of Crawford Bayley & Company. Senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe and advocate Chetan Kapadia will be representing the petitioners. The PIL filed on Monday states that a section of TV channels are making false propaganda through their biased reporting of the facts and are trying to influence the course of investigation. It further states, “This has created an air of suspicion in the minds of general public as to the facts of the case under investigation and also about the Mumbai Police, health services and other support services of the state.” It adds that the irresponsible coverage of the case is damaging the image of the Mumbai Police due to the round-the-clock malicious campaign started by anchors of certain channels. The PIL states, “The anchors of some TV channels have been virtually running a vituperative 24x7 campaign against Mumbai Police and its commissioner, DCP of the zone and other officers by attacking them by name in most unbecoming manner.” The PIL has said that the ‘media trial’ has resulted into a parallel investigation being undertaken by private individuals, rendering opinions, exposing material witnesses and divulging crucial pieces of evidence which, in turn, hampers the work of investigating agencies. In light of these facts, the top cops have sought an urgent hearing of the PIL and sought directions to the government and media regulators to lay down guidelines for the mode and manner of covering any pending investigation particularly that of Sushant Singh Rajput case. The PIL has made the Union of India, Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association, News Broadcasting Standards Authority and state government respondents and sought directions to issue guidelines to media houses to refrain from publishing and circulating any false, derogatory and scandalous comments, social media posts, news stories which would jeopardise the investigation and malign the reputation of the police force. The advocates for the petitioners informed that a praecipe for urgent hearing of the PIL was moved before the HC registry on Wednesday evening and hearing is likely to be allowed on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-former-top-cops-move-bombay-hc-to-restrain-media-trial/story-suQQW61m0rbis0QT8MoxSI.html
02-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Revenue dept reaches out to farmers to disburse ₹100 crore compensation for land||Gurugram: The Gurugram revenue department has started the process of disbursing compensation to farmers of 27 villages in Gurugram and Rewari districts whose land was acquired for construction and expansion of the 46-km Gurugram-Pataudi-Rewari expressway project, which is expected to be completed by December 2022. Also, due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation, the revenue department has adopted a novel strategy for a change and instead of calling the owners to the revenue office, they are going to villages and settling the claims there only and issuing cheques to farmers, said officials. The foundation stone of the highway project was laid digitally by Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari on July 14, 2020. The project was announced in 2017 but was delayed due to issues in land acquisition, which have now been cleared. Basti Ram, the district revenue officer, said that they have received ₹100 crore as the first tranche of compensation of a total of around ₹600 crore. “We are visiting the villages where land has been acquired, reaching out to owners and verifying claims. The payments would be made in the villages itself as we don’t want large crowds to gather at the revenue offices in view of the pandemic,” he said.Land for this road had been acquired from 27 villages of Gurugram and Rewari and these include Khandsa, Kadipur, Dhorka, Tajnagar, Jamalpur, Pataudi, Inchhapuri, Khetiawas and Khalilpur, among others.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that the contract for the project is in the process of being allotted and they have called for bids. “The first tranche of compensation has been transferred to the Haryana government and remaining will also be given gradually. The authority has, till now, received one bid for the project and it is being evaluated. The highway will reduce pressure on the existing Delhi-Jaipur highway as it will give an alternative to commuters travelling between Delhi, Gurugram and Rewari,” said PK Kaushik, project director, NHAI. According to the NHAI, the cost of the entire project is around ₹1,500 crore and the four lanes will start from Hero Honda Chowk. Besides, a toll plaza will be built near Pataudi. The road will intersect the KMP expressway and will be linked with the Rewari-Narnaul expressway. The highway will have two flyovers, one over-bridge and three interchange connections, allowing people to leave the road or take it with ease at different points, said officials. The project will also include the construction of a Pataudi bypass road, which will reduce congestion in Pataudi town, said officials. Local residents said the construction of this road will reduce travel time and traffic congestion of Delhi, Gurugram, Pataudi and Rewari and give commuters the option to avoid the national highway 48. BoxThe Gurugram Pataudi Rewari expressway will have a 7 kms long bypass at Pataudi.The highway is being developed at a cost of ₹1,500 crore.The deadline for the project is December 2022. Land from 27 villages at a cost of ₹598 crores has been acquired. NHAI has transferred the first tranche of ₹100 crore to be paid to the land owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-revenue-dept-reaches-out-to-farmers-to-disburse-100-crore-compensation-for-land/story-uku9a9F4ITg66II3K6b8yI.html
02-09-2020||City||3,381 undergo rapid antigen tests at Anand Vihar ISBT, 19 test +ve||New Delhi: As many as 3,381 people have undergone rapid antigen tests at a makeshift centre set up by the Delhi government on August 13 at east Delhi’s Anand Vihar ISBT to screen migrants heading back to the Capital as lockdown restrictions have eased, of which 19 have been diagnosed Covid-19 positive till Wednesday, government officials said.At meeting of the state disaster management authority on Wednesday, the Delhi government is learnt to have told lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal that more such testing centres would be set up at the other inter-state bus terminals, railway stations and near major construction sites in line with the Delhi high court’s directions issued on Monday.“All 19 people who tested Covid-19 positive in Anand Vihar had arrived from Uttar Pradesh. Two of them were women. All 19 were symptomatic and sent to Covid care centres,” said a senior official, citing records maintained by the Shahdara revenue district. Anand Vihar is in the jurisdiction of Shahdara district.The central government has allowed inter-state road transport under its Covid-19 unlock plan to further ease restrictions in September. But Delhi is yet to take a final call on allowing interstate buses to enter the city. However, the Anand Vihar ISBT, which is right next to the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, has witnessed large footfalls for the past one month now.Most migrants are coming back from various districts in Uttar Pradesh and step down from state buses at another bus terminal in Kaushambi on the Ghaziabad side, bang opposite the Anand Vihar ISBT. From there, they would walk a few hundred metres to Anand Vihar and then take local buses in Delhi to reach their destination within the city, said another district official who did not wish to be identified.The official cited above said heath officers deployed at the centre roughly test one out of three persons – which essentially means around 10,000 people have arrived in Delhi after August 13 via Anand Vihar in working hours. The centre operates from 7 am to 7 pm.Millions of migrant workers had left Delhi in the days following the lockdown imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19. The state government had set up thousands of centres to provide food and shelter to migrant workers who lost their livelihoods until arrangements were made to send them back on trains and buses. Thousands of them set off on arduous journeys back home, covering hundreds of miles, by foot.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The objective of the tests play a crucial role in this case. Since, the government is isolating positive cases, they should ideally test all individuals. RT-PCR should be a preferred mode in this case.”Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests are considered to be more accurate.T Jacob John, former professor of virology at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said using RT-PCR tests in these centres, where migrants are tested, would help the government in accurately detecting more Covid-19 positive cases but the process may have its own challenges.John said, “Conducting RT-PCR tests on all individuals arriving in the city would require the capacity of laboratories to be increased immensely. So, instead of that, the government can first reduce the numbers by a round of rapid antibody tests and relieve people who are found to have contracted the virus and recovered. The second round should be rapid antigen tests and those found positive should be isolated immediately. Both tests show results within 30 minutes and the kits are cheap. On the remaining population, RT-PCR tests can be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-381-undergo-rapid-antigen-tests-at-anand-vihar-isbt-19-test-ve/story-5zhpsd9FMrDBfArPoTW9HM.html
02-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees quietest Anant Chaturdashi since 2003||With muted celebrations of Ganeshotsav due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the city recorded noise levels below 100 decibels (dB) on Anant Chaturdashi. This is the first time since 2003, when anti-noise campaigners Awaaz Foundation began monitoring noise levels in Mumbai, that the levels have been so low. On Anant Chaturdashi, most areas in Mumbai recorded noise levels between 54.7dB and 76.8dB (equivalent to television or living room music), according to Awaaz Foundation. Prabhadevi, where firecrackers were heard, was loudest at 94.4dB (equivalent to a power mower). The lowest noise level – 54.7 dB – was recorded at Girgaum Chowpatty around 11pm. While some immersion sites saw crowds, there were no loudspeakers, dhol tashas or disc jockeys and few fireworks. “Unlike previous years, no complaints were received from citizens this year. Political mandals were absent and did not use loudspeakers,” read Awaaz’s report. Ambient noise ranges between 58-65dB in Mumbai, according to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, residential areas should have a maximum noise level of 55dB during the day and 45dB at night. Sumaira Abdulali, convenor, Awaaz Foundation, said, “The way we celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi this year is testimony of the change we, as a society, can be responsible for the betterment of our future generations.” The highest noise level was recorded in 2015 (123.7dB) followed by 2013 (123.2dB). The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), umbrella body of Ganpati mandals, attributed low noise levels to artificial immersion sites and the absence of pandals. “The number of artificial immersion sites was almost 200 across Mumbai which were even used by large Ganesh mandals. This is the first year when the vision of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was replicated by the city, and we hope to continue this in the coming years,” said Naresh Dahibavkar, president, BSGSS.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 28,293 idols (24,476 household and 3,817 sarvjanik) were immersed across the city on Tuesday. Of these, 13,742 idols had artificial immersions (11,691 household and 2,051 sarvjanik idols). Last year, over 38,000 idols were immersed in the city on Anant Chaturdashi. Around 31% dip was recorded in immersion of idols this year compared to 2019. BMC said the number dipped this year as many preferred to conduct immersion at their homes or inside buildings.BMC said a total of 1.35 lakh idols were immersed in 2020 compared to 1.96 lakh in 2019. However, use of artificial ponds doubled from 33,000 in 2019 to 70,000 this year. BMC attributed the rise to the 2-km limit imposed for immersion. “Apart from ensuring decongested crowds across natural immersion sites, we developed a system where citizens would give their idols to BMC workers, and only BMC workers would enter the immersion site (sea, lakes, ponds and rivers) for visarjan,” said Narendra Barde, joint municipal commissioner (zone II). Mumbai Police said no untoward incident was reported.

02-09-2020||City||Will follow Centre’s Metro SOP, impose more norms if needed: Delhi govt||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Wednesday said it would follow the Centre’s standard operating procedures (SOP) for the resumption of Metro services in the city, and would also put in place additional regulatory measures if required. On August 23, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he had urged the Centre to consider permitting the restart of Metro services in Delhi in phases and if needed, and conduct a trial run. “People of Delhi have been requesting us to start Metro services. We have taken this up with the Central government on several occasions. We have urged the Centre to explore the possibility of resuming Metro services in Delhi, while keeping it prohibited in other states as of now. Delhi is a special case because we have the Covid situation under control,” Kejriwal had said in his digital interaction with traders last month. In an interview to HT on July 18, Kejriwal called the Delhi Metro the “city’s lifeline” and said resuming its services was “very important”.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Wednesday said the government is preparing a plan to deploy civil defence volunteers at stations to help Metro and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel control crowds. These volunteers will be deployed outside the stations, to ensure passengers enter the designated gates in a staggered manner.“The SOP released by the ministry of housing and urban affairs is on expected lines. The Centre has also left it to Metro operators, which in Delhi’s case is the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), to decide whether all Metro stations should be opened at once or not. Accordingly, the Yellow Line will be opened first,” Gahlot said. The Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line runs from Samaypur Badli Station in north Delhi to HUDA City Centre Station in GurugramHe, however, added that some stations may need to stay shut once more lines open up. “If the driver sees there is no social distance at a station and the crowds are too large, it is likely the train might not stop, or the train doors won’t open. But, the Metro and CISF also are working to deploy more staffers to ensure commuters maintain distances while waiting for trains,” he said. The Delhi government said it will hold meetings with Metro officials in the next two days and keep the public apprised of any new rules. “The public will be informed at all times on the timings of Metro operations, the stations and lines that will be open and other details, from time-to-time,” a senior government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-follow-centre-s-metro-sop-impose-more-norms-if-needed-delhi-govt/story-qa69KxEGbY7Ok5PZSSXJqN.html
02-09-2020||Mumbai||Supported by IIT-Bombay, Patna, start-up’s line of prosthetics selected for scaling-up by government||A Vasai-based start-up, supported by the Indian Institutes of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and Patna, offering a line of affordable prosthetics, is one of the 15 start-ups chosen under the StartupToScaleup scheme supported by the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), Government of India (GOI). Through the programme, young healthcare and edtech start-ups get a chance to elevate their innovation to the international markets.Grippy—Robo Bionics’ product—is a line of inexpensive prosthetics that are easy to use and also addresses some of the difficulties that amputees face with body-powered as well as externally powered prosthetics.Llewellyn Dsa, co-founder of Robo Bionics, started developing the technology after he completed her M Tech on a Robotic Prosthetic Hand at IIT Patna. Inspired by a batchmate, who had no hands owing to a birth defect, he started the firm in 2016.“When my team and I started looking at the market for myoelectric (prosthetics that use electronic sensors to detect muscle and nerve activity) hands, we found that while they are available in the market, they have a lot of drawbacks. They are heavy, have a steep learning curve and function in a very robotic way. To solve this we, at Robo Bionics, researched the market, customer pain points and technology to bring out Grippy,” said Dsa.Grippy, while being affordable, offers features such as a sense of touch, grip control and adaptive shape control which is unique for every user. While a basic prosthetic of grippy is priced at ₹60,000, an advanced one can cost up to ₹75,000. A professional approved by the Rehabilitation Council of India makes the socket that connects the part between Grippy and the user’s hand. The cost for the socket could range from ₹25,000 to ₹50,000 depending on the complexity.Incubated at IIT-Patna, the startup is supported by the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE), IIT-B, as well as the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Government of India.“Our device is undergoing rigorous safety testing in a lab accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories in Pune. After that we will bring our Grippy, a high-quality prosthetic hand, made in India, to a limited set of users, as a pilot study under the supervision of clinicians and professionals,” said Dsa. The product, which is awaiting two patents, is expected to be launched in the market by April 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/supported-by-iit-bombay-patna-start-up-s-line-of-prosthetics-selected-for-scaling-up-by-government/story-u3CzoQgEkSaA52nlPvWbqL.html

In 2018, 26-year-old Parashuram Waghmore, allegedly confessed to the shooting, in which 16 people have so far been arrested by the special investigation team (SIT).The ‘Aataa Uthaav Kelaa Naahi Tar’ protest is the Maharashtra chapter of the nationwide ‘If We Do Not Rise’ campaign aimed at reasserting people’s right to freedom of expression and safeguarding constitutional values. The national campaign aims to highlight a multitude of issues plaguing the country such as lack of transparency in the election in funding with electoral bonds, dilution of Right to Information Act and rising violence against religious minorities, women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transexual, queer/questioning, intersex, and allied (LGBTQIA) community. It also raises questions on the Citizenship Amendment Act that led to protests across the country.In Maharashtra, organisations working for the improvement of working and living conditions of women, farmers, migrant labourers and members of the LGBTQIA community, will protest to highlight the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on marginalised groups. They will also raise issues about the poor healthcare system in the state as well as the rise in gender and caste-based atrocities during the lockdown.“The lockdown has exposed that women are among the worst affected by the pandemic, especially those from the Dalit, Adivasi and nomadic tribes. Many have not even received food and ration,” said Vimal Thorat from the All India Dalit Adhikar Manch.“If we do not rise now and question the policies of the establishment, the situation will only worsen. The issues we are raising about women, farmers, LGBTQIA members as well as unemployment are not in isolation but are connected,” said Smita Pansare, National Federation of Indian Women.The last few years have witnessed a frontal attack on the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution – the right to dress, speak, write, eat and choose one’s religion– which has impacted women and the LGBTQIA communities disproportionately. Regressive laws by the Centre like the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act have adversely impacted the rights of Transgender persons. There are very few provisions in place to protect the safety and rights of the entire LGBTQIA community, said the collective.As part of their protest, the collective will draft a charter of demands and submit the same to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Protests will include short videos on various social media platforms, e-posters, animation, memes, songs and performances on social media. Some will also take to streets to protest in small groups with social distancing norms in place.“We urge everyone to come forward and participate in the protest. The youth must question the government on why students are arrested baselessly when they ask questions,” said Sharddha RR, youth activist, Lokayat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/100-groups-in-maharashtra-to-hold-protests-to-mark-gauri-lankesh-s-3rd-death-anniversary/story-WD0iysDnOzRnrYvxGXf8DJ.html

02-09-2020||Noida||Noida police start door-to-door interactions with public to understand local issues||In order to better understand and resolve public concerns, Noida police said they are interacting with residents of the city at a local level.The initiative involves police personnel not only conducting meetings with residential bodies but also interacting with random groups of people.“Sometimes the public has misconceptions about the police and sometimes there are issues that are left unresolved because we are not familiar with them. A basic-level interaction would help in both cases. All circles are being encouraged to follow this model,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.According to assistant commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajneesh Verma, they have already covered 10 to 12 sectors under this.“Our personnel are speaking with people who have just about stepped out of their houses. During patrolling also, officers are interacting with people out on roads. Sometimes people have certain issues for which they cannot come down to the police station. Such an interaction will help us understand and address them,” said Verma.He said that they have already started making adjustments to patrolling routes and schedules based on feedback from the public so far.“We met people from Gijhore on Tuesday. There were mentions of empty plots being used for anti-social activities like alcohol consumption. We have instructed the locals to immediately reach out to us in such instances. When it comes to women safety issues as well, feedback are being taken from the public to identify hotspots. A few areas are being covered everyday so that people can report suspicious activities and action can be taken on them,” said the ACP.Police officials also said that they will continue meetings with residential bodies to address their concerns. However, while the public has welcomed the move, people said they are not hopeful about the implementation.“It’s not enough if just one officer is doing this. All police personnel need to understand the importance of sensitivity towards the public. The way local police personnel interact with the people is very uncomfortable at times. Also, they say that things like patrolling are happening, but the public hardly ever sees it being executed. No initiative is enough if it is there only in theory,” said KK Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (RWA).He said that street crime is rampant in the district. “Every day we have instances of chain snatching, robberies, burglaries, etc. Police data shows that crime has gone down but it’s still happening. In addition, there is often harassment of office bearers of RWAs by local police with issues going unresolved for months. We need better policing in the district,” said Jain.He said that even though the Noida police department claims to be better involved in public affairs, it is often difficult to reach out to officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-start-door-to-door-interactions-with-public-to-understand-local-issues/story-3CdfMg5xR6UKjbLPV8bgOL.html
02-09-2020||City||Domestic help held for theft at elderly woman’s home in GK-1||New Delhi: A 26-year-old man was arrested for allegedly stealing diamond and gold jewellery from an 80-year-old woman’s Greater Kailash - 1 house, where he began working as a domestic help just weeks before the crime, the police said on Wednesday. Three diamond rings have been recovered from the arrested domestic help, Mantu Yadav, while two other stolen diamond rings, one pearl ring and a gold chain are with his associate, who helped him get work at the elderly woman’s home, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. Thakur said a case was registered under Section 381 of Indian Penal Code at the Greater Kailash police station based on the woman’s complaint. The woman, who lives with her son, said she suspected the domestic help, who had been missing since the theft came to light. Thakur said the domestic help was hired in early August and had been avoiding sharing his personal details for police verification. Since the complainant needed a domestic help immediately, she employed him without completing the verification, he said. “A local enquiry led us to the suspect’s brother, who was asked to join the probe. He gave us his home town’s address and contact numbers of his family members. Due to the continuous pressure, the suspect returned to Delhi and joined the probe. We arrested him and recovered three stolen diamond rings,” the DCP added. The police are now on the hunt for Yadav’s associate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domestic-help-held-for-theft-at-elderly-woman-s-home-in-gk-1/story-u4ygd9R0ua8Yhcc05Dq85N.html
02-09-2020||Mumbai||BJP to issue no-confidence motion against Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar||In wake of the allegations against Mayor Kishori Pednekar of misusing her position to award contracts to her son’s firm, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is issuing a no-confidence motion against the mayor by September 7. Senior BJP leaders had a meeting with Opposition parties in the BMC. However, none of the political parties has so far committed to supporting the BJP but has suggested to bring it in the general body meeting.BJP leader Prabhakar Shinde said that the party is still discussing with the Opposition parties. “We are holding a discussion with all Opposition parties. A final decision on the motion to be tabled will be made soon,” he said. On August 20, party leaders of Maharashtra Navanirman Sena had alleged conflict of interest regarding a firm that was awarded a contract in June to supply manpower at the NSCI Covid facility in Worli without following the due process of tendering. The firm is registered in the name of Mayor’s son, Saiprasad Pednekar.Councillors of Congress and NCP are unhappy with Sena’s decision-making in the BMC. It is being said that Sena does not take Congress or NCP in confidence while making key discussions.A senior Congress leader in the BMC said, “Even though we are in alliance in the state, Sena has never considered us a partner in the civic body. We are discussing the no-confidence motion without party high command. A decision is yet to be made.”For BJP to get the no-confidence motion passed, they will have to achieve a simple majority among the councillors present during the voting. Currently, Shiv Sena has a strength of 97 councillors, BJP has 83, Congress has 29, NCP has eight, Samajwadi Party has six, MNS has one and AIMIM party has two corporators in the BMC.Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has linked eight companies with the firm associated with the mayor and demanded the state to probe into the matter. Somaiya said that there are eight companies whose registered address is same as Kish Corporate Services Private Limited; the firm is run by Mayor’s son Saiprasad Pednekar. Somaiya further alleged that the Mayor has been the additional director in this firm in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-to-issue-no-confidence-motion-against-mumbai-mayor-kishori-pednekar/story-YoiQSUcGlB9C6VamuZUIRM.html

According to police officials, the woman allegedly had an ongoing dispute with her husband. Things escalated and the woman allegedly poured kerosene on herself and self immolated, police said.“When a police team reached the spot, the woman was struggling for life but she later succumbed to her injuries. Her body was sent for an autopsy and the report is awaited,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.He said that the woman’s family has, however, alleged foul play.“We will investigate once the family files an official complaint. Prima facie it seems to be a case of suicide but the autopsy report will shed more light on the matter,” said Singh.In another incident, under the Phase 2 police jurisdiction, a 30-year-old man allegedly took his life at his rented accommodation. “The incident came to light in the morning after which his body was sent for an autopsy. Prima facie it seems that he was having a dispute with his wife because of which he took this step. No suicide note was recovered at the spot and this happened during the night,” said DCP, zone 2, Harish Chander.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/woman-sets-herself-on-fire-after-domestic-dispute-dies/story-5bTO7zhvIkkW1sYyMgLHQM.html
02-09-2020||Noida||Property of ₹33.20 crore belonging to criminal gangs attached since commissionerate system, say police||Aimed to break the economic backbone of different gangs operating in the district, the Gautam Budh Nagar police, after the introduction of the commissionerate system on January 14 this year, have so far attached properties worth over ₹33.20 crore till August 31. The crackdown is being carried out mainly under Section 14(1) of the Gangsters Act, which allows attachment of illegal properties in order to effectively curb operations of gangsters, mafias and criminals and their associates, police officials said.According to commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh, following the directions of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on crackdown on organised crime, the district police have demolished unaccounted property worth ₹33,20,1528 allegedly belonging to gangsters Sunder Bhati, Anil Dujana and their accomplices.“The most recent attachment is related to Sunder Bhati and his associate Satveer Bansal in Ghanghola village, where a 650 square meters piece of land, which was originally allotted to the panchayat of the area for a pond and was illegally captured after which the gangsters built a structure on it. The construction on the land was unauthorised and the claimant is already booked under the Gangster Act; we are legally empowered to attach the property. We have also ensured construction will not be resumed in the future,” he said.The commissioner further said that the police are preparing a list of other gangsters active in Gautam Budh Nagar and their unaccounted properties that need to be attached. “We are keeping a close tab on the activities of all gangsters, especially the associates of Sundar Bhati and Anil Dujana, especially Suraj Bhati, Satbir Bansal, Singhraj Bhati, Sumit Nagar, Arun Sharma and Sanjay Bhati. Recently, three trucks worth ₹36 lakh belonging to Sumit Bhati, two trucks and a scooter totalling ₹29.70 lakh of Satbir Bansal and a truck worth ₹12 lakh of Sinhraj were attached,” he said. Singh also said that the police have been keeping a constant watch on the gangsters – who are presently behind the bars. “We have inputs that these criminals are trying their best to trap petty criminals in the lure of the lucre for furnishing their bail bonds. They are also reportedly luring them to join their gangs. We are compiling details of criminals who have recently furnished their bail bonds and are out from jails. These men are under our radar,” said the district police chief. Giving details of properties attached from gangsters who were allegedly involved in the Shahberi twin building collapse incident, Singh said that as many as 19 criminals were involved in it. “We have attached the properties worth over ₹20 crore under Section 14(1) of the Gangsters Act,” he said. On the other hand, sources in the special task force (STF) said that despite being shifted to different jails to avert gang wars, the gangsters have allegedly yet not given up their business of manpower contract, extortion and contract killing. “They have become very smart now and have started exploiting religious sentiments of the common people. Sunder Bhati, who is presently lodged in Hamirpur jail, is said to get built a place of worship worth over ₹10 crore. His goons are also reportedly running hotels and lodges,” said a senior STF official, on grounds of anonymity. At present, Anil Dujana is lodged in Banda jail and his main rivals – Sundar Bhati and Singhraj Bhati – are lodged in Hamirpur jail. Bhati gang’s other members, Balram Thakur and Randeep Bhati, are in Unnao and Basti jails, respectively. Dujana gang’s Vikas Pandit and Yogesh are lodged in the Sitapur jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/property-of-33-20-crore-belonging-to-criminal-gangs-attached-since-commissionerate-system-say-police/story-ogc5iG4xvTZI72TdHBHdMP.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||Notices to two DU colleges for ‘caste discrimination’||The National Commission for Scheduled Castes has issued notices to Delhi University (DU) vice chancellor Yogesh Tyagi seeking a report in connection with the alleged discrimination against SC and ST ad-hoc teachers in two university colleges.According to the notices received by the university on Wednesday, the Social Democratic Teachers’ Front (SDTF) — a teachers’ body — had filed complaints of SC and ST ad-hoc teachers at Daulat Ram College and Dyal Singh College (evening) being discriminated against. “A complaint has been received regarding gross discrimination against a scheduled caste ad-hoc teacher in the department of psychology by the principal of Daulat Ram College. The commission has decided to investigate and inquire into the matter in pursuance of the power conferred upon it under article 338 of the Constitution of India,” the commission said in a notice.In another notice, the commission said, “A complaint has been received by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes regarding the joining of SC and ST candidates for the post of assistant professor (ad-hoc) in the department of English, Dyal Singh College (Evening), Delhi University...The commission has decided to investigate and inquire into the matter...”The commission has asked the university to submit an action taken report in both the cases within 15 days, failing which it will issue summons to the university officials, the notices added.Despite several attempts, DU V-C Tyagidid not respond to calls and texts sent for comment. A senior official, requesting anonymity, said, “The administration will ask for a report from both the colleges and action will be taken after examining the reports.”When contacted, Daulat Ram College principal Savita Roy said that the college did not discriminate against anyone on the basis of their caste or religion. “The concerned teacher was appointed on an ad-hoc basis in August 2019 in the department of psychology in our college. But after a few months, students started complaining about her teaching abilities and a written complaint was also received in October last year. In January, I decided not to renew her contract, but after a lot of protest by DU teachers’ association, we decided to give her another chance. But the complaints did not stop and even students stopped attending her online classes after the college was shut in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. We cannot let her continue in such circumstances,” she said, adding the college will submit its response with the university.Pawan Sharma, principal of Dyal Singh College (evening), said that the college’s governing body — the highest decision-making body — had not approved the joining of one SC and one ST ad-hoc teachers. “This is a year-old case now. The selection committee had selected the concerned candidates but the governing body did not approve their joining due to some reason. The college cannot take any decision without the approval of the governing body. We will submit our report with the university,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/notices-to-two-du-colleges-for-caste-discrimination/story-uCPAh84TVG3dRu9ltOAH9L.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Customers say cheers as Chandigarh bars open, but you can’t dance as yet||ChandigarhThere’s been an enthusiastic response to Chandigarh administration’s nod to reopening of bars from September 1, with most places packed to the 50% limit allowed for social distancing. However, those expecting to shake a leg and let down their hair will have to wait – as safe distances have to be maintained.Happy about the “decent response,” from patrons, Manish Goel, director of Social in Sector 7, which started services from Tuesday evening, says people have been observing safety rules. “Things are going better than we had expected. The public understands all the rules and is being very responsible about it.” Goel, who also runs Swagath restaurant in Sector 26 and Elante, where alcoholic beverages are also served, says, “At Swagath we get people who might have a beer with their meals as alcohol isn’t the main attraction for them, but from Tuesday the crowds at lunch are getting bigger.”Sunveer Sondhi, proprietor of Pyramid Bar in Elante and the head of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI’s), Chandigarh chapter, is also happy with the response. “We managed to open even on Tuesday, usually a slow day, yet the place was almost packed to the 50% limit. Our regulars are calling us and starting to reserve places as well.”  For minimum human contact, Sondhi adds that his bar has gone all digital from menus to payments. Staff, however, has been instructed to stop playing music to maintain social distancing should the customers get carried away and start dancing. Local resident Shrey Budhiraja, enjoying an evening out at a bar, says, “People were beginning to feel cooped up inside their homes. They will be happy to go out and have a good time.”Licence issues being sorted outSome bars, however, have delayed opening as owners scramble to get liquor licencing issues sorted out. Sandeep Sahni, Chandigarh Club president, confirms that their bar will open over the weekend while Ramandeep Marwah, general manager, JW Marriott, adds that all safety protocols will be in place when they open on Friday. Some microbreweries, however, expect delays. Debdip Chaterjee, manager of Great Bear microbrewery in Sector 26, says most of their staff members are from Odisha and have gone back to their home states. “It will be a challenge getting them back, but some local brewmakers will start brewing the next batch of beer soon.”Picture clearer over the weekendA number of bar owners, however, are not sure whether they will be able to drum up good business after opening up. Ankit Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association, says some owners face delays in getting liquor licences. “Those who do not have liquor in their inventory are also facing problems. The picture of the percentage of bars already open will become clearer over the weekend , he adds.Gupta’s own Himani’s Vertigo Lounge in Sector 35 will start alcoholic beverage services from Thursday.Manmohan Kohli, chairman of the Chandigarh Restaurants and Hotels Association, who is also the proprietor of Hotel Aroma in Sector 22, adds: “Many bar owners remain sceptical wondering if they will be able to net business after opening. A large chunk of people including professionals and tourists are still missing in the city, and they were some of our biggest clientele. So many owners are adopting a cautious approach before starting operations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/customers-say-cheers-as-chandigarh-bars-open-but-you-can-t-dance-as-yet/story-icneKaYMPiFP6ux1s0bHlJ.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||From Thursday, NDMC will start charging fee at all its parking spaces||After a hiatus of five months, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has directed its parking contractors to start charging fee from visitors at all of its parking lots, starting Thursday. Visitors will now have to pay the standard parking charges, as applicable before the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March.There are nearly 125 parking sites (multilevel and surface parking) managed solely or jointly by the NDMC. All of them were shut as part of the nationwide lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Later, in May, parking lots were opened but visitors were few and so from May to August, visitors were using these parking spaces for free. Officials said parking contractors had said that they were short of hands to manage parking spaces.They had also demanded a rebate in the annual fee that the concessionaire pays to the municipality, citing the complete shutdown for three months and the fewer number of visitors once lots were opened. The NDMC had agreed to the request but last month, the civic body asked its contractors to start charging for parking as the number of vehicles has started increasing once again.“Parking lots were closed from March 22 (the day of Janta Curfew). The NDMC requested the concessionaire to reopen the lots in end-May, after lockdown measures were relaxed. The concessionaire had some reservations, but they agreed to resume services. Last month, they were asked to start collecting the standard fee from visitors,” a senior NDMC official, privy to the development, said on condition of anonymity.Visitors will have to pay the standard charges of ₹20 per hour. However, those who wish to park vehicles in pockets of Connaught Place and Bengali Market during peak hours might have to pay an increased fee as part of dynamic pricing, as suggested in the Delhi Parking Policy, 2019.“Under such an arrangement, visitors will have to pay ₹50 per hour for parking in the Middle Circle of Connaught Place, in Bengali Market and on Janpath Road, near Allahabad Bank. This move was taken in October 2019 to reduce parking on busy roads,” a second senior NDMC official said, on condition of anonymity.The officials added that dynamic pricing will be implemented only if there is huge parking demand during peak hours in these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/from-thursday-ndmc-will-start-charging-fee-at-all-its-parking-spaces/story-jITmUeoSJY8sWGCJQvzQWM.html
02-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad civic agency to rope in ragpickers as ‘segregators’ to recycle solid waste||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has embarked upon a plan which will not only help get rid of about 70% of solid waste collected by it daily but will also gainfully employed about 10,000-12,000 ragpickers who are working across the city in an unorganised manner. The newly joined municipal commissioner on Wednesday held meetings with representatives of the rag pickers’ community and presented before them a plan which he said aims to uplift their socio-economic condition. The city generates about 1,600 metric tonnes of solid waste daily which is collected through door-to-door vehicles and also collected from different other sources. Under the new plan, municipal commissioner MS Tanwar has planned that the ragpickers will be roped in for daily segregation of solid waste and also be paid by the corporation for the same.“Under the plan, we have proposed that the ragpickers, which we now call as segregators, will be deployed at the solid waste collection centres and will be provided with gloves, tables, etc. They will be roped in to segregate the solid waste. The garbage collection points will be modified and will be enclosed. The segregators will be working in a more orderly and safe manner like workers do in a factory. We expect that the segregators will segregate items like plastic, metal, cardboard etc which will be put to gainful use by the corporation,” Tanwar, said. The civic agency has planned that the segregators will be provided uniforms as well as accounts for them will be opened wherein their earnings will be transferred directly by the corporation. “We expect that the segregation activity will help them earn at least three times the amount they get while segregating waste and in turn selling it to agents. Of the segregated items, we plan to develop small items. For instance, we have roped in artistes who will manufacture items like flower pots, chairs etc from recycled plastic waste. Likewise, all segregated waste will be put to meaningful uses and the leftover waste will be scientifically processed at sanitary landfills,” he added further. The officials said they expect that the leftover waste after segregation will be about 30% of the daily waste generation.At present, the civic agency is facing issues with solid waste disposal as the landfill site at Pratap Vihar was closed down last year on directions of the Uttar Pradesh solid waste monitoring committee. “A meeting was held with the garbage segregators on Wednesday and they were told by the corporation about the plan. The segregators will also be registered with the corporation and the registration process will start from next week. This way, they might also feel attached to an organisation and will also get a suitable amount for their work. Besides, the corporation will ensure that their accounts get opened and that they are provided better working conditions unlike what they get while working in an unorganised manner,” said Mithilesh Kumar, corporation’s city health officer.The Ghaziabad city, in the recently announced Swachh Survekshan rankings, slipped to the nineteenth spot from the earlier thirteenth spot after the results were announced on August 20 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-civic-agency-to-rope-in-ragpickers-as-segregators-to-recycle-solid-waste/story-qrFzmoih5fTLPkeuhqCDcK.html

He has been married three times. His first wife died in 2010, after which he had remarried in 2016.In his complaint to the police, he said his second wife deserted him in February this year after stealing some money. He had filed a police complaint but a police officer said no evidence emerged against his second wife.The man went on to marry a third time -- his domestic help’s widowed daughter -- a month ago.On Sunday afternoon, the man had returned from the market to find his wife tied up and bleeding from the head. “She told him someone had knocked on the door and when she opened it, an unidentified man hit her with a hammer. She said he tied her up and took Rs2.18 lakh in cash and some jewellery,” said DCP Alphonse.The woman was admitted to a hospital and police began probing the alleged robbery.“When we spoke to the injured woman, her story had a lot of loopholes. We questioned her further to realise she was lying. She eventually confessed that it was a fake robbery of which she was a part,” said the DCP.The woman allegedly said she had told her friend, Jitender, about cash and jewellery in the house and they decided to stage a robbery.“On Sunday, while her husband was away, she allowed Jitender into the house. He hit her head with a hammer, tied her up and took away the cash and jewellery,” another investigator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-s-wife-stages-robbery-with-friend-to-steal-husband-s-cash-gets-herself-attacked-with-a-hammer/story-C09fQ9MKIrPsQl0cSUDIJP.html

According to the victim’s family members, the boy, Dipanshu, had gone upstairs to sleep at night. In the morning, he mistakenly touched the wire from the terrace and was electrocuted, the family said. The family members heard the sparking sound and as soon as they reached the spot, they found the boy stuck with the live wire. “It again sparked and my son was thrown away. We immediately rushed him to a local government hospital from where he was referred to a higher centre. We then took him to a private hospital in Greater Noida where doctors declared him dead,” said Dharmendra, victim’s father who runs an automobile repair shop. Dharmendra alleged that the local people had informed the electricity department earlier to repair the loose wires but the problem was not fixed. “Ten days ago, a live wire fell on a motorcycle and damaged it completely in our neighbourhood. We had informed the power department but situation remains the same,” he said. VN Singh, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said that he has not received any information about the incident. “We are sending a team to get information about the incident. We will be able to comment only after getting the information,” he said. According to the victim’s family, it appears that the boy woke up in the morning and was climbing down when he mistakenly touched the wire which passes by the terrace. “We are very sad after the incident. We will soon file a police complaint in this regard,” Dharmendra said. Vinit Kumar, station house officer of Rabupura police station, said that the police have no information about the incident. “We have not received any complaint or call from the victim’s family or local people. We came to know that the family performed the last rites of the victim. We will investigate the matter once a complaint is filed,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ten-year-old-boy-electrocuted-to-death-after-he-came-in-touch-with-overhead-cables/story-sviMGJCFxF6HpERcnxNAdL.html

The nursing homeowners along with senior members of the Delhi Medical Council (DMC) and Delhi Medical Association (DMA) had met the chief minister on Wednesday and flagged the issue of renewal of licences,” the statement said.It further said, “In that meeting, the owners of nursing homes said that every year, they had to renew the licence to run these homes. This year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the nursing homes could not renew their licences in March and this was creating issues in their daily operations.”There are about 700 nursing homes in the city, most of which have around 20 beds, according to estimates by the DMA.President of DMC, Dr Arun Gupta, welcomed the move and said the government decision would “bring relief to nursing home owners”.Dr R K Gupta, former president of DMA, said, “The Delhi government has taken commendable measures during the time of Covid-19, and have honoured the private and government hospital and health care workers.

02-09-2020||City||In Noida, several high-rises running without STPs, releasing untreated sewage, finds UPPCB||Noida: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), which had last week inspected about 20 high-rise societies in the city, said it found only seven residential societies following environmental norms while the rest either did not have a sewage treatment plant (STP) installed or were not operating it.While most high-rise societies inspected -- from sectors 75, 76, 78 and 137 – have had residents since at least five years or more, millions of litres of untreated sewage has been flowing from these buildings and into flood drains, making it to Yamuna or Hindon rivers. Recently, HT had reported that residents of areas living near the Kondli drain had complained of stench emanating from the floodwater drain due to effluents being released into it by nearby high-rise societies, which carries sewerage from at least 30 smaller drains.According to rules laid down by Noida authority, all high-rises in the city must treat sewage generated within their premises through STPs. The treated water should be used for horticulture and washing purposes within the residential societies, and only leftover, treated wastewater should be released into drains. According to UPPCB officials, a total 21 high rises were inspected last week, of which six high rises did not have an STP and the STP of seven others was either not functioning or the plant was found to not have been treating effluents properly, and samples have to be collected from the 21st high-rise society again due to technical issues. Officials said they will soon initiate the procedure to issue notices and impose environment compensation from the non-complying high rises.“Action against the violators has been initiated as per environmental norms, and environmental compensation is supposed to be imposed. For a society which does not have an STP, the fine is minimum Rs. 5,000 per day from the date of its occupancy. For those which have an STP but did not follow norms, a notice will be issued and compensation will be imposed post assessment,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. He added that the penalty is imposed on non-complying high-rise societies irrespective of how much polluted effluents they had been releasing. “A number of high-rise societies switch off their STPs and swiftly discharge untreated sewer in drains in order to save on the expense of the treatment, as STPs are large machines and require investments for operations,” said Praveen Kumar. The pollution watchdog’s report finds that none of the two high rises inspected in Sector 76 had an STP. Of the five high rises inspected in Sector 78, only one was complying norms while others either did not have an STP or were not using it. Out of the five high-rises in Sector 75, only one was complying with norms, and five out of eight high rises in Sector 137 were complying with norms. “The UPPCB has sought from us details of those high-rises as in from when they got their occupancy certificates so that appropriate penalty could be imposed on them. According to our norms, all high rises are supposed to have independent STPs, though time-to-time we undertake inspections and find discrepancies, after which we take appropriate action,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty (health), Noida authority.The estimated sewage generation in Noida is around 210 million litres a day (MLD). According to officials, the city has the capacity to treat 230 MLD of sewage through its six STPs. However, untreated sewer from high-rises often reaches up to Yamuna and Hindon rivers through flood drains. According to environmentalists, untreated sewage making it to flood drains has an adverse effect on the local ecology. “The reason that the conditions of our rivers like Hindon and Yamuna is so bad is because millions of litres of untreated sewage flow through it. A recent UPPCB report even showed how even the groundwater of villages near Hindon river was contaminated. It affects the local ecology as well. The city authorities must make a system to ensure that none of the high-rise societies release excess water without treatment,” said Vikrant Tongad, Noida-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-noida-several-high-rises-running-without-stps-releasing-untreated-sewage-finds-uppcb/story-ganT6ZYN3DpEBBxiA9bwfI.html

Earlier, owners had to pay Rs 5 per yard for the property annually. The new rates have been approved by the local bodies department and these will be applicable from April 1, 2020. Residents can avail 10% rebate on the tax for the financial year 2020-21. As per MC officials, there are over 50,000 rental properties in the city, including residential rental properties, PGs and labour quarters. When contacted, property tax superintendent Vivek Verma said, “The property tax will now be collected on the basis of annual rent. If the owner of a 200-yard building is collecting an annual rent of Rs 1 lakh, then he will have to pay Rs 7,500 as tax. Until now, the tax for such a property was Rs 1,000. The revised rates would be applicable from April 1, 2020.” Residents oppose move Facing financial crisis amid the pandemic, residents are not happy with the MC’s decision to hike the tax. Damanjot Singh, a resident of Model Town area, said, “Middle class families are already struggling to make ends meet and now, the MC has increased the property tax. Even the tenants are struggling with the payments. This will just add to everyone’s troubles. The government should spare a thought for the common man before taking such decisions.” Resolution for increasing tax was passed in 2018 Until 2013, residents had to pay a house tax of 9% of the annual rent, however, after the introduction of property tax in 2013-14, the rate was reduced to 3%. In 2014-15, the rate was again revised and Rs 5 per yard was being charged from the rental residential properties. Later in 2018, the MC General House approved a resolution to increase the tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-hikes-property-tax-owners-to-shell-out-to-7-5-of-annual-rent/story-yNEv2xhMZRfontdpbR54LL.html

02-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: Symbolic protest held over poor condition of Jeevan Nagar road||Staging a symbolic protest against authorities over failure in repair of the Jeevan Nagar road which has been in a deplorable condition for long, the members of Azad Yuva Shakti Sangh begged for alms on Wednesday. The members rued that the protest was staged to wake the authorities from their deep slumber as accidents had been taking place owing to the pathetic condition of the road. The shopkeepers in the area have also been left as a harried lot as the dirt gets into their shops due to the movement of vehicles on the potholed road. Members said the issue had been raised several times in front of the authorities but no action had been taken yet. The road connects Chandigarh road with the Delhi highway and the condition of the road becomes worse during rainfall, they said. As per the information, MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and MLA Sanjay Talwar had inaugurated the construction work of the road around three years back, but the project had not been initiated at ground level. As the civic body was facing a shortage of funds, the project has ultimately been forwarded to Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) recently. PSIEC chairman Gurpreet Gogi said, “As the MC failed to construct the road, the PSIEC has taken the responsibility to provide relief to the public. The PSIEC has already initiated a project to reconstruct the 26km long stretch of roads in the Focal Point area at Rs 40 crores. We have come up with an estimate of over Rs 8 crores for the construction of Jeevan Nagar road and are waiting for the final approval from the state government for taking up the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-symbolic-protest-held-over-poor-condition-of-jeevan-nagar-road/story-AxuMeZuHRiJZ47lPRh2WYP.html
02-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad sero survey to start on September 4, 1,080 samples to be collected||The first sero survey in Ghaziabad that was supposed to start in the last week of August will now take place from September 4 to 6 and will collect about 1,080 samples from Ghaziabad’s 4.4 million residents. The survey is being conducted in 11 districts, including Ghaziabad, on the UP government‘s directions . The other districts are Kanpur City, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Agra, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Moradabad, Lucknow and Baghpat. The activity will cover Covid-19 and viral diseases, hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C, simultaneously. “The training for the collection of samples is on for 10 teams that we have formed for the purpose. In all, 1080 samples will be taken up and no previous positive patient will be included. Persons willing to give samples will first be tested with rapid antigen kits. Once they are found negative, they will be able to give their samples,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “The samples will be sent to King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, for testing. People who give samples will have to give a declaration and should be aged between 18-59 years as per directions,” CMO added. A serological survey checks for an immune response against the coronavirus in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population. It can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought off the virus without showing symptoms. According to the recent Delhi survey results, almost 30% of the 15,000 people surveyed in the national capital had antibodies for Sars-Cov-2. Delhi has a population of about 19 million while Ghaziabad has a smaller population of officially estimated at 4.4 million. “There is no particular definition of how many samples will be taken up from a population in sero-surveys. It is based on complex formulae and also depends on capacity to test the samples. It is also a probability that another round of survey is taken up in future and more people can be tested,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). For Ghaziabad, the survey will be conducted in 45 wards, including 39 in urban areas with 12 residential wards falling in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation. The 12 wards identified for the survey include localities such as Garima Garden (ward 64), Shalimar Garden Main (ward 37), DLF Colony (ward 10), Makanpur, near Indirapuram, (ward 57), Govindpuram (ward 30), Ghookhna (ward 13), Dundahera, near Crossings Republik, (ward 27), Nehru Nagar 2(ward 8), Patel Nagar (ward 19), Arthala (ward 38), Sudamapuri (ward 7) and Rahul Vihar (Siddharth Vihar) (ward 2). Overall, the survey will cover 12 wards in the municipal area, three wards in Nagar Panchayat of Dasna, five in Nagar Palika of Loni, seven in Muradnagar, six in Nagar Palika of Modinagar and three in Nagar Pnchayat of Niwari among others. Combined, the 45 different wards have an overall population of about 70,493. Overall, across the 11 districts, the officials have selected 495 wards with a combined population of 452,231 for the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-sero-survey-to-start-on-september-4-1-080-samples-to-be-collected/story-mz6TIt9vZJqeabTjKnonIL.html
02-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Containment zone list not in public domain despite govt directions||Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, the list of containment zones that is prepared by the district administration is still not in public domain. The residents have complained that due to lack of proper information on containment zones they find it difficult to know about the areas which should be avoided. The Uttar Pradesh government, in their three consecutive orders issued for Unlock 2, Unlock 3 and Unlock 4, has directed the respective district magistrates to put up containment zones’ list on the district’s official website and also send the same to the Union ministry of health and family welfare and the state’s health and home departments. According to the official records, on September 1, the district had 336 containment zones with 842 active cases under category 1 (having single positive case) and category 2 (having more than one positive cases) zones. However, the number of active cases in the district on September 1 stood at 1,421, as per the state control room figures. Notably, the containment zones are created as per defined norms which have been issued time to time by the government. “The list of containment zones in Ghaziabad is not in the public domain. We somehow used to get the list off and on during initial months when the number of zones was less. Now, with high number of cases, the number of zones is also on the rise. The working of the district administration is not transparent in this regard. It makes us think that whether the containment zones are managed properly or not,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ association. “We often read in newspapers that the district has a particular number of containment zones. But nothing is known about the areas in which these zones are present. Whether they are sealed properly or not is not known to citizens or the civil society,” he added. The neighbouring district of Gautam Budh Nagar, on the other hand, has been regular in updating the list of its containment zones. The official website of the district has a link -- gbnagar.nic.in/novel-corona-virus-covid-19/ -- where the list of containment zones are uploaded since July 1 and updated regularly. In Ghaziabad, in one-off tweet from the Twitter handle of the district magistrate, a list was last shared on June 18. “At present, on the ground the concept of containment zones hardly exists. The list is not in public domain for the use of residents to know which areas should be avoided. We have taken to social media and also contacted the respective incident commanders of the zones to provide us the list,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of association of apartment owners. When asked about the issue, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he will hold a review meeting on Wednesday evening in this regard. Pandey said he will ensure that list of containment zones is put up in public domain. “It seems that there has been some laxity on part of some officials. I will hold a review meeting on Wednesday evening and will see to it that the list gets uploaded. A comprehensive review will be taken up during the meeting,” he added.According to the list accessed for September 1, the highest active cases, 147, are under the jurisdiction of Sihani Gate police station where 46 zones are active. The next on the list is the Indirapuram police station area which has 77 zones with 142 active cases. Likewise, the police station areas of Sahibabad, Kavi Nagar and Vijay Nagar have 18, 28 and 23 zones with 84, 101 and 90 active cases, respectively. The containment zones are created on the recommendation from the health department. Thereafter, the administration officials, called as incident commanders, are tasked to supervise the sealing and timely de-sealing of the zones. According to UP chief secretary RK Tiwari’s order on July 24, the category 1 zones were revised to have an area of 100 metres radius as against 250 metres earlier. The category 2 zones were also directed to have an area of 200 metres radius as against the previous area of 500 metres, along with an additional buffer zone of 250 metres outside the containment zone. At present, defining the buffer area is left to the district officials on the basis of local assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-containment-zone-list-not-in-public-domain-despite-govt-directions/story-XQY5GYbYoNhoHZLw1faNEP.html

The victim has been identified as Aarti Devi, 32. The accused, Anand Kumar, 37, a tailor by profession, fled the scene after the crime. The incident came to light in the morning when the victim’s three children-- two daughters and a son-- saw their mother’s body in a pool of blood and raised the alarm. Soon, residents living in the locality gathered around the house and informed the Salem Tabri police about the incident. Salem Tabri station house officer Goldy Bedi said initial investigations reveal that the accused was an alcoholic and killed the wife under the influence of liquor. The kids have reportedly told the police that the couple used to have frequent fights and last night too, there was an altercation. “The murder appears to have taken place around 4am as the residents of the colony spotted the man escaping from the house around that time,” said the SHO Goldy Bedi. The accused seems to have gagged the victim’s face and then slashed her neck with a scissor, said SHO Bedi. The body was sent to the civil hospital for post-mortem and a manhunt launched for the accused. Amritsar man found murdered: The second murder took place at Meharban Area, where the body of a 62- year-old factory employee was found in a one-room accommodation. The victim has been identified as Baldev Singh, a resident of Jandiala Guru in Amritsar. He was working at a quilt manufacturing company, located a few metres away from his quarters. The incident came to light when the area residents spotted Baldev’s body in a pool of blood early in the morning. Soon, the husband of village sarpanch informed the police about the incident. According to additional SHO Harshpal Singh, the victim had suffered a fatal injury on his face, which resulted in heavy bleeding. “The body has been sent for post-mortem examination,” he added. The SHO further said that prima facie, there is nothing to suggest that robbery was the motive behind the murder. “However, we are probing the case from all angles and the killer will be arrested soon,” said Singh.The case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-cold-blooded-murders-in-a-day-send-shockwaves-across-ludhiana/story-6xCs1Dn00pjGGZGxqll1AP.html

As per the PPCB officials, there are around 20 scattered units, but the dyeing association members claim that there are around 50 such units in the city. While CETPs are being established for dyeing industry clusters at Tajpur road and Focal Point, the owners of scattered units have failed to get themselves attached to the project. The CETP for the Bahadurke road industry is already operational. Dumping of waste by scattered units is adding to the woes of the residents as the MC sewer lines are choked when excessive waste is dumped by the owners. Also, it adds to pollution in the Buddha Nullah. The matter was also raised in the meetings of the special task force constituted for cleaning the nullah.MLA (Ludhiana east) Sanjay Talwar said, “Residents of wards 7, 10, 12 and 15 are suffering a lot due to dumping of waste by the owners of dyeing and dairy units in the MC sewer lines. They dump excessive waste in the MC sewer lines, due to which the sewer lines get choked and sewer waste accumulates on the streets. The MC and PPCB officials are aware of the problem but still, no action has been taken against the units.” In mid-August, councillor of ward number 57, Manju Aggarwal had also submitted a complaint with the MC officials regarding the dumping of untreated waste in the sewer lines by dyeing units, after she saw untreated waste at Shingar Cinema disposal point PPCB chairman, Satwinder Marwaha said, “The 15mld CETP for Bahadurke dyeing industry has already made operational. The 40mld CETP for the Focal Point industry and 50mld plant for the Tajpur road industry would be made operational by December this year. The owners of scattered units have also been told to shift to ZLD technology, wherein no waste is dumped by the industry and treated waste is reused. If not, then they should get the units attached with CETPs, otherwise, strict action would be taken against them and their connections would be snapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-aim-for-zero-liquid-discharge-or-attach-dyeing-units-with-cetps-to-avoid-action-ppcb-chairman-tells-owners/story-1booV4Z24iwZGeaewibrwL.html

In the latest analysis by state health department, Punjab’s CFR has increased to 2.7% as on August 30 which was 2.5% on August 20. In case of Delhi, the CFR has come down to 2.6% against the 2.7% it had just 10 days back. India’s overall CFR rate has also come down to 1.8%, reveals the department’s analysis. Notably, Delhi’s caseload is more than double that of Punjab as on August 30 with 52,536 Covid-19 cases and 1,404 fatalities. On this day, Delhi had 173,390 patients and 4,426 fatalities. For Punjab, August proved to be the grimmest month with 1,067 deaths and 37,873 fresh cases. The month’s CFR for the state stood at 2.8%. Now, only Maharashtra and Gujarat have worse CFR than Punjab’s with 3.1% and 3.2%, respectively. In July, Punjab surpassed Madhya Pradesh to reach the fourth spot in the country’s worst-hit states. Notably, in last 15 days, Maharashtra and Gujarat have improved their CFR, from 3.4% to 3.1% in and 3.5% to 3.2%, respectively. Deaths per million up Punjab also witnessed a jump in deaths per million which stood at 46.8 on August 30 as compared to 28. 3 as on August 16. In the same fortnight, India’s deaths per million increased from 27 to 35.9. State’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the biggest reason behind the surge in deaths is that people are not coming forward for testing and are only reporting at government hospitals when their condition worsens. “Now, the department even has given the option of home isolation for positive patients. Still, people are shying away from reporting to us,” said Bhaskar. The nodal officer claimed that it was only due to the sustained efforts that the contact tracing in Punjab has increased to 5 people per positive patient, which was 3-3.5 just two weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-covid-fatality-rate-third-worst-in-country/story-U5BCQ7eUSRi7Hgwrly4iaN.html

It said the government is hiking fees despite the high court’s order not to charge any additional fees other than tuition fees until the pandemic situation improves.During the protest, SFI state secretary Amit Thakur said the state government and university authorities are only completing formalities to conduct the examination as many students are being forced to walk to the examination centres as they have no transportation facilities.“The university has only set up 38 examination centres for the upcoming PG exams in which around 60,000 regular and private students are expected to appear, which means that around 1,600 students per examination centre will be accommodated. How can social distancing be maintained in such a situation?” he asked.SFI has warned of intensifying the movement if their demands are not fulfilled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sfi-holds-protest-demands-promotion-of-hpu-students/story-CQFCZidH8obLTfSQAD2vJN.html

The secretariat of the Governor, who is also Chancellor of state universities, submitted its affidavit in the SC that all the vacancies in the B.Ed colleges of the state for 2020-2022 session would be filled through CET-B.Ed scheduled on September 22.“The apex court has given its nod for the scheduled test,” said Amit Pawan, counsel for Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU), Darbhanga, which is the nodal university for conducting 2020 CET-B.Ed. The CET-B.Ed, which came into effect in 2018, was an initiative of the Chancellor office to regulate the mushrooming of private teachers’ training colleges in the state.Last week, the apex court had on Thursday asked the Governor to decide the mode of admission in B.Ed course across the state. Compared to the first year in 2018, the number of candidates registered and appearing in the examination dropped last year. This year, 1.22 lakh candidates filled up the form.Due to the lockdown and subsequent rise of Covid-19 infections, the entrance examinations had to be postponed thrice.Private B.Ed colleges had been demanding permission to admit students on the basis of marks this year and had written to the chancellor. They had also moved the SC for relief.According to sources in the LNMU, the entrance test would be held in one sitting across the state with increased number of exam centres to adhere to the social distancing norms.“We have sought reports from all the exam centres across the state and based on the feedback we will plan accordingly,” said a senior LNMU official.After the examination, the LNMU will have to work fast to ensure early publication of results and then counselling to ensure early start of the 2020-22 session, which has got already delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-gives-nod-cet-b-ed-now-on-sept-22/story-OroRmoSE8U8fHl8k11k6tL.html

The Chinese government must acknowledge the failure of its policies in Tibet, he said.In 2019, Sangay said, the US State Department report on international religious freedom ranked People’s Republic of China (PRC) among the worst offenders.Earlier this year, five United Nations independent mandate holders called on the Chinese government to provide information about the whereabouts of the 11th Panchen Lama and to allow an independent monitor to visit him.“More and more nations around the world are waking up to the threats to global democracy posed by the PRC. In June this year, senior parliamentarians from eight countries including the US, Canada, UK, Germany and Australia announced the launch of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a coalition that would seek a proactive approach to the challenges posed by China,” he said.Sangay also recalled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama’s contribution in building and strengthening Tibetan democratic system over the years.As we celebrate the trajectory of the young Tibetan democracy in exile, we recall our responsibility to our brothers and sisters in Tibet who live under a regime whose every action mocks the values and principles of democracy, the Sikyong said.“The task is now on our shoulders to protect and strengthen our robust democracy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/resume-talks-grant-tibet-genuine-autonomy-exiled-govt-to-china/story-W8CqwzGhptlMuzkUXWLKGL.html

There has been no discussion about seat sharing for the upcoming Assembly elections,” said party president Manjhi.“My party will work for the victory of each alliance candidate,” he said and clarified he had joined the NDA without any conditions. “I have very old relations with Nitish Kumar. How many seats we get to contest is a matter between JD (U) and HAM-S,” he said.HAM-S sources, however, said the party could contest on 10 assembly seats. An NDA source said JD (U) national president Nitish Kumar wanted Manjhi to contest against former assembly speaker Udai Narain Chowdhary of RJD, but the former CM showed his reluctance to contest assembly polls. “There is a possibility of Manjhi going to Rajya Sabha at an earliest opportunity,” said a HAM-S leader.Manjhi’s party had contested on 20 assembly seats in 2015 assembly polls and won one. JD(U) sources said that after the exit of Shyam Rajak from the party, Manjhi could be a face for Dalits, who account for 16% of Bihar’s total population of 10.41 crore as per the 2011 census.“Seat sharing is not at all an issue for us. The party decided to be with the development agenda of the NDA,” said HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan. Soon after announcing his party decision to ally with NDA, Manjhi attacked RJD and rued his decision to join the Grand Alliance. “I fell in Lalu Prasad’s trap and joined GA. RJD is full of corruption and neck deep into scams,” he said.Reminded that RJD had made his son MLC, Manjhi said, “He got the membership through merit. He is not a seventh pass but a MA, Ph.d.”Welcoming Manjhi’s decision to join the NDA, deputy Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted, “Manjhi’s leaving GA goes on to prove that a party run from jail cannot do justice to Dalits and backwards. Welcome Manjhi ji.”JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said, “The NDA is going to benefit from his experience. It is a great setback for the GA.” LJP, however, did not react. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-cm-manjhi-ends-suspense-joins-nda/story-MySWhj8ikzSukpWfECfDrO.html

Carrying signatures of former SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh, the note reads, “Total 80 saroops along with related items were damaged in fire and due to water used to douse the blaze. As these saroops were not worth parkash (installation), these were sent to Goindwal Sahib for cremation.”The saroops were damaged in a fire incident at the Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib-based SGPC publishing house on May 16, 2016. Dated February 20, 2020, the note is addressed to Roop Singh by Kanwaljit Singh, who was an assistant supervisor of the publishing house. Roop Singh resigned from the post on August 27 this year after the SGPC executive took action on the basis of an inquiry report.Kanwaljit is the man on whose statement, the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) uncovered the issue of missing saroops. He retired on May 31 this year. When he gave charge to his predecessor, 267 saroops were missing. The SGPC had accused him of using the 2016 fire incident to save his skin. He has also been indicted by the Akal Takht-appointed panel that probed the issue. A day after the PHRO accused it of hiding the matter and understating the damage to the saroops, the SGPC top functionaries on June 26 this year refuted the charges, terming the accusations as “misleading” and “condemnable”. In a press conference that day, SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta, chief secretary (now former) Roop Singh, secretary Manjit Singh and additional secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhoora said 14-15 saroops were burnt and nine got damaged in the fire-control operation. PHRO writes to SGPC chief Attaching a copy of the office note’s, the PHRO on Wednesday wrote to the SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal and the sub-committee set up to initiate legal action against those indicted in the inquiry panel. “Mehta and other SGPC functionaries lied about the damage to saroops. He was also a member of the sub-committee constituted in 2016 to probe the incident. For misleading the community, he must be disqualified as the SGPC member,” reads the letter signed by the PHRO investigator Sarbjit Singh Verka. Mehta said, “What we stated was based on office record. Actually, 80 was the total figure. Barring 14 saroops which were damaged heavily and sent for cremation, others carried minor damage and were repaired. The PHRO are playing into the hands of the anti-panthic forces and causing divisions among the Sikhs.” SGPC chief Longowal did not take a call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-saroops-row-deepens-as-sgpc-office-note-says-2016-fire-damaged-80-birs/story-ioTbVfN6ZH5B5YhZyYbarI.html

Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori, on August 6, had sent a report to the principal secretary (health) seeking action against the hospital.In his inquiry report, assistant commissioner (grievances) Randeep Gill found that hospital had charged Rs 5,500 for the test on July 21; the government has fixed maximum charges for the test, including taxes, at Rs 2,400. When contacted over phone, state principal secretary (health) Hussan Lal told HT, “We have written back to the Jalandhar DC last week that he is the competent authority to take action in this case, under the Epidemic and Disaster Management Act.”Thori rejected Lal’s claim and said, “I have not received any copy of any order to date. I had written to higher authorities, seeking action based on the report and after receiving the order, appropriate action will be taken against Patel Hospital.”The hospital wrongly charged Rs 3,100 extra from the complainant Rajeev Makol, a resident of Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar, towards the cost of PPE kits for safety of lab technicians and clinicians, violating state government orders, the DC’s report to the secretary says. The report also mentions that the complainant met medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Swapan Sood, who justified the higher rate, saying that the hospital was a private facility conducting the test locally. Dr Sood also claimed that the test charges were Rs 2,400, and the remaining amount was towards the PPE kit and doctor charges of pharyngeal swabbing.The inquiry report, however, states, “The government order states that Rs 2,400 is inclusive of all expenses from tax to packaging, transportation, reporting and documentation. The money charged by the hospital for PPE kits has no ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-action-against-jalandhar-hospital-found-overcharging-for-covid-19-test/story-BTBElzZk6NPKhfGNxGPT8M.html

He singled out the Thakur caste, which the chief minister belongs to.Earlier, the AAP MP had accused the UP government of being pro-Thakur.He targeted the UP government for being casteist and tweeted: “Murders of Brahmins and Dalits in UP are not a crime, but a survey whether the Yogi government is casteist is a crime.”He also had a word of advice for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled dispensation in the country’s most populous state. He suggested that the state government should not waste public money in conducting investigations and instead the police could get in touch with him about the caste-based survey.The FIR was lodged after many people received automated calls on their mobile phones, asking them to respond to a question whether the UP government has a pronounced pro-Thakur bias. The FIR was filed under section 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and also the Information Technology Act, 2000, for misuse of electronic communication, a police official said.Singh is facing probe in multiple FIRs lodged against him for accusing the UP government for favouring the Thakur caste. In August, nine FIRs were filed in various districts across the state following which the AAP lawmaker had written a letter to RS chairman and Vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu drawing his attention to the matter.Somen Barma, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central, Lucknow, said the latest FIR stated that the automated calls were made to hundreds of people, asking them to respond to the question by pressing 1 or 2 on their mobile phone keyboard. He said the public was also asked two more questions related to castes favoured by various political parties when in power. A senior police official privy to the investigation said an electronic surveillance team collected call details of the mobile phone numbers used for the caste-based survey. He said the team was also probing the call generation points and the people behind the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/aap-leader-sanjay-singh-sparks-controversy-over-role-in-caste-survey/story-mKzThbs7RWKcLL1qBHDilM.html

Ambedkar later claimed that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has assured him of reopening all religious places in the next eight days. Earlier in the day, the VBA leader arrived at Pandharpur where he was stopped by police as a large number of supporters gathered. After two hours, the district administration allowed Ambedkar along with a select number of warkaris (pilgrims) to visit the temple. “I along with 15 others went inside Lord Vitthal temple. The CM has now assured me that the government will issue standard operating procedures for devotees and open temples in the next eight days. I welcome his decision,” Ambedkar told reporters after taking darshan. When Ambedkar arrived at the Shivaji square, a massive crowd accompanied him to enter the temple. As he began marching towards the temple with a select number of followers, police stopped him and asked him to wait for the administration’s response to the letter Ambedkar had handed over to the district collector. “I had given a letter to Solapur district collector for allowing us to enter the temple. The collector responded after talking to the government and allowed 15 persons to enter into the temple,” Ambedkar said. To prevent protesters from entering in the temple, the local administration at Pandharpur had put up checkpoints at entry and exit points to the temple town while barricading the roads leading to the Vitthal temple in view of Monday’s agitation by the Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi (VBA). Several warkari organisations (pilgrims) have extended support to the VBA agitation that demands the opening of religious places across Maharashtra. According to Solapur superintendent of police, Manoj Patil, cases are being filed against all those who violated government order by crowding at one place during the pandemic. “The police have registered an FIR against Ambedkar and 1,000 others on Monday, they have been booked under IPC section 143 and 144, ” Patil said. Earlier on Sunday, police issued notices to VBA workers under section 149 of CrPC. To prevent anyone from entering into the temple town, the state transport bus service was also suspended in Pandharpur for a day. Since March 25, all places of worship across the state have been closed for devotees in view of the Covid pandemic.

02-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi government releases FAQs to aid doctors in Covid-19 management||To help doctors better manage patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the health ministry, along with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), has prepared a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to answer queries, such as whether hydroxychloroquine should be given to health care workers as prophylaxis or whether medicines to prevent clotting should be given to patients even after they are discharged. A set of 20 questions on the use of various therapies for Covid-19, such as the use of convalescent plasma, antiviral medication like Remdesivir and Favipiravir, and the deworming tablet Ivermectin has been uploaded to the health ministry website. The FAQs provide information on how to prevent sudden deaths in Covid-19 patients or when one has to be put on a ventilator. The FAQs can be accessed here. This is an extension of the e-ICU programme developed by AIIMS and the ministry where tele-consultations are held twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays to help doctors from across the country manage Covid-19 patients. So far, 17 such sessions have been attended by doctors from 204 institutions across the country. The aim of the programme is to reduce Covid-19 mortality further. So far, India has reported 48 deaths per million population, less than half of the global average of 110 deaths per million population, according to data provided by the Union health ministry. The highest deaths per million population have been recorded by the UK with 611 deaths per million, followed by Brazil with 576 deaths per million population, and then the USA with 570 deaths. “We should expect more cases just because of the sheer size of our population. Even if 1% of the people get the infection, in terms of absolute numbers it will be a lot. However, the good things is that we have had fewer deaths due to the infection. Even if there is some under-reporting, deaths cannot really be hidden. And, this means that the situation is not very bad, people are silently getting the virus and recovering without even showing any symptom,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-releases-faqs-to-aid-doctors-in-covid-19-management/story-nSjeZmll9eSTVbBQi0jfCN.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||High court judge recuses from hearing plea of former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini||A Punjab and Haryana high court judge on Wednesday recused from hearing the plea of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini seeking either quashing or transfer of the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The plea was taken up by the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh, which referred the matter to the high court chief justice. The judge has not recorded any reason for recusal but observed since the petitioner has sought an early date, the matter be immediately be put up before chief justice Ravi Shanker Jha for assigning it to another bench. The additional district and sessions judge of Mohali had on Tuesday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of the former DGP. His lawyers are in the process of filing an appeal against that order also. Saini had approached the high court on August 19 when justice Manoj Bajaj raised questions with regard to the maintainability of the plea. The plea could not be taken up after that. Saini was booked in May this year in connection with the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco). Multani, a resident of Mohali, had been picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh, in 1991. Punjab Police on August 28 had conducted raids at Saini’s Chandigarh house and other locations but he could not be found. However, hours later on the same day, the Mohali court had extended Saini’s interim bail till the final orders on his anticipatory bail plea, which was subsequently dismissed on September 1.Saini faces arrest as the court had on August 21 allowed Punjab Police to add a murder charge against him in this case after two former Chandigarh Police personnel, who were also co-accused in the case, turned approver.The police had claimed that Multani escaped from custody at Qadian in Gurdaspur district. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Balwant Multani’s brother, Palwinder Singh, who is a resident of Jalandhar. Initially, the case was registered against them under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali. In his plea, Saini says the first information report (FIR) is the result of malafide act against him for launching probes against Congress leaders and their relatives to unearth scams due to which he had become an eyesore for political parties. He demanded that the FIR be quashed or probe be transferred to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-judge-recuses-from-hearing-plea-of-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini/story-Oo0DSb5LMkwakeKQ1cCd1I.html
02-09-2020||Mumbai||In another letter to Uddhav Thackeray, Fadnavis questions Mumbai’s Covid testing strategy||Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, on Wednesday sent yet another letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking him to increase the number of Covid-19 tests being carried out in Mumbai. The former chief minister has penned more than 10 such letters over the last five months, asking Thackeray to up the number of tests to get the real picture of the spread of infection in the metropolis. Fadnavis said that while the state has upped the number of tests done in the last month-- from July to August-- by 42 per cent, in Mumbai, the increase was only 14 per cent. “In July, 6,574 tests were carried out every day in Mumbai, which increased to 7,709 tests daily in August, an increase of only 14 percent. As a result of this, we see fewer cases being recorded in the city now. In Maharashtra, the tests were increased from 37,528 per day in July to 64,801 per day in August, which is a hike of 42 per cent,’’ stated the letter. The former chief minister pointed out that the state contributes to nearly 21 per cent of the new coronavirus cases in the country and around 38 per cent of the Covid-19 mortalities.The average case positivity rate in Maharashtra is 18.44 per cent and 13.64 per cent in Mumbai, higher than the national average of 8.57 per cent. Fadnavis, who recently returned from a tour of Western Maharashtra, also asked Thackeray to look into certain issues pertaining to the region including a lack of sufficient hospital beds in a district like Satara and poor implementation of the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Also Read: Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally crosses 8-lakh mark, death toll nears 25k mark“In Satara, the rate of Covid-19 infection is 22 per cent and there aren’t enough hospital beds for the patients.

With colleges shut, almost no visitors and less staff, the cafes are struggling to keep the business afloat.“The lockdown has impacted the hospitality sector the most and we are still facing the consequences of the pandemic,” says Tenzin Thardoe, director, AMA Cafe who agrees that the majority of the footfall at the cafe comprised of university crowd and without them around it has resulted in 50% fall in the footfall. Due to the decrease in the sales they’ve also started to deliver at home for the first time since the establishment of cafe in 2013. Eateries in Kamla Nagar, popular with college going students are also facing the problem of manpower. Harsh Sambher, founder, Momos Point says, “We were left with a small crew after the lockdown as our employees started travelling by Shramik trains back to their hometowns. It’s become a challenge to operate the it.”As many students too have shifted back to their hometowns, restaurateurs pin their hopes on them to return that will contribute in generating revenue. “The market is horrendous and it will pick up in the true sense when the students will return,” says Udai Khanijow, COO, Big Yellow Door Cafes. Khanijow also elaborates that student population is a big propellant in sustaining and growing the market health.Long waiting queues of college students are conspicuous by their absence since March. Shailly, founder, Sambookas believes that cafes are facing a difficult time during this period since their primary clientele is university crowd. She says, “We will remain affected till the university doesn’t open up. Our cafe has been a popular hangout zone with students and we hope to get the vibrance soon. We are all ready to serve scrumptious food to them.” Follow htcity for more updates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/cafes-in-delhi-university-s-north-and-south-campus-face-low-footfall-due-to-absence-of-university-crowd/story-BJLmEB7oFdEgCZjzs6OSzO.html

No one was injured in the incident.According to BMC, the backside portion of the building, named Razzaq Chamber, collapsed at around 7.28 am following which, four fire engines and one JCB machine were rushed to the spot.The BMC officials added that the building was among the cessed buildings of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). However, MHADA is yet to issue any comment on the claim.Cessed buildings are structures whose occupants pay a repair cess tax to MHADA. These buildings were constructed before 1969, with some of them being over a hundred years old. These are mostly tenanted properties with rents frozen under the Rent Control Act. There are 14,375 cessed buildings in the island city and their redevelopment has so far been sluggish.

02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Amid border standoff, Chinese student is among record 114 foreign applicants seeking admission to Haryana university||Amid the tense Indo-China border standoff and the Covid-19 pandemic, a Chinese student is keen to pursue postgraduation in Hindi from Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak. He is among the record 114 foreign students seeking admission to different courses at the government-run university in Haryana for the 2020-21 academic session. Ajay Rajan, dean, centre of international academic affairs at MDU, says Guosong Zhao from China’s Henan province is among the students from 18 nations who have applied for admission this year. “We are eagerly awaiting this student’s admission. His decision to opt for India to pursue higher studies will motivate others, too,” he says. “Students from at least 10 countries have applied for the first time. We are surprised to see such a rise in the number of foreign applications amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” Rajan says.MDU is the only state university in Haryana attached to the central government’s Study in India portal. SUSHMA SWARAJ’S INITIATIVE HELPS MDU Saravjeet Singh Gill, deputy adviser of international relations, MDU, says the applications of 108 students were received through the central government’s Study in India portal and six through the Indian Council of Cultural Relations. “We had directly invited foreign students and the admission process began on August 31. It will continue till September 15,” he says. The university’s foreign students’ cell, which was launched from the 2013-14 session, was upgraded as the Centre for International Academic Affairs two years ago. The number of foreign students has seen a steady rise since April 2018 when former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s decision to launch the portal was implemented. Only 19 students had taken admission at MDU in 2013, 12 in 2014, six in 2015, four in 2016, seven in 2017, and 40 in 2018, 62 in 2019 and 114 this year. Sunit Mukherjee, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication who holds the charge of MDU’s public relations department, says the quality of education, good food, similar culture and low cost of living as compared to other universities are primary reasons behind the increase in the number of foreign students seeking admission. “We charge an academic fee of Rs 1.67 lakh from students belonging to the Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations and Rs 2.07 lakh from non-Saarc nationals besides a hostel fee of Rs 30,000 a year,” he says. MOST APPLICANTS FROM AFGHANISTAN All students have applied for on-campus postgraduate courses. Courses such as masters in business administration (MBA), MA (public administration), MA (political science) and postgraduate diploma in career guidance and counselling are popular among international students. According to the university’s international relations cell, of the 108 students who applied through the Study in India portal this time, 86 are men and 22 women. Fifty-six applicants are from Afghanistan, including 11 women students, seven each are from Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Tanzania, six from Ghana, and five are from Nigeria. Yasmin Saifi from Afghanistan, who is enrolled in MA (public administration) at MDU, said over phone that students from her country chose India as both the countries have similar culture. “We can speak Hindi and English easily. More students from Afghanistan are applying at MDU as this university has better infrastructure, good faculty, and a peaceful and safe environment. I’m waiting for the Government of India’s decision to resume classes so that I can return to MDU,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-border-standoff-chinese-student-keen-on-studying-hindi-among-record-114-foreign-applicants-for-admission-to-haryana-university/story-i2cSmgKezfa88k9AZHUXmN.html

However, five families consisting of 22 members escaped unhurt.The Nalasopara building was redeveloped in 2009, but in 2018 major cracks had developed in a few parts of the structure, following which the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) had declared the building dangerous and unfit for residents and issued evacuation notices to 20 odd flat owners. Around 15 families moved out, but five families consisting of 22 people, including men, women, children and senior citizens, decided to stay back in the building.An unidentified resident said they stayed back since they could not afford steep rents in other buildings and we were fighting a court case against Abhay Naik, the builder, for shoddy construction using bad quality cement and materials. He alleged that Naik had also made some illegal structures without an approval from the VVMC.A few of the residents had held a meeting in the building premises on the evening of Anant Chaturdashi (Tuesday) when they noticed a huge pile of soil near the main gate following which, the residents decided to lodge a complaint with the Vasai civic body on Wednesday.Also Read: Thane civic body to make a list of illegal structuresAt around 2315 hrs, while the residents were preparing to go to bed, they heard sounds of falling rubble.

02-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s new parking policy implementation: 6 things you need to know||After a lull of nearly five months due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, the implementation of the Parking Management Area Plan (PMAP) is slowly kicking. The training of civic officials to effectively formulate and implement PMAPs has already begun.Here are six things you need to know about the parking policy and PMAPs.1.What is Delhi’s parking policy for?The parking reforms were notified on September 23, 2019 by the Delhi government as Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019, commonly known as parking policy. Under the policy, municipal agencies will make parking management area plans (PMAPs) and regularise haphazard parking in residential as well as market areas. It also recommends a dynamic pricing mechanism for parking in peak and non-peak hours.2.What is a PMAP?It is an area-specific solution to streamline vehicular parking in residential and commercial areas. Municipal agencies have been authorised to make parking management area plans with neighbourhood-specific solutions. The PMAP primarily aims at giving priority to pedestrians, cyclists, emergency vehicles and vending zones by improving availability of on-street and off-street parking in any area. In Delhi, these PMAPs are to be developed for almost the entire city by the three civic bodies — North, East and South Delhi Municipal Corporation.3.Dynamic Pricing Mechanism Dynamic pricing mechanism aims to motivate people to avoid roadside parking for long durations in market areas. It means that user will have to pay at least double for on-street parking for the first hour as much as off-street (multi-level, stack, cinema, mall) parking. On-street parking fees shall increase exponentially with every hour to discourage long duration. 4. The pilot projectAfter notification of the parking policy, three areas in south, east and north Delhi were chosen to be developed as model areas. These parking reforms were implemented in Lajpat Nagar-III in south Delhi, Krishna Nagar in east and Kamla Nagar in north Delhi on a pilot basis. Haphazard parking in these areas was regularised and at least one main market street was pedestrianised in Krishna Nagar and Kamla Nagar. However, Karol Bagh market was the first place where PMAP was first implemented in May 2019 even before the policy was approved. 5. Current status of the policyIn June this year, vehicular movement was allowed on pedestrianised stretches in Krishna Nagar, Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar on traders’ demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now the Supreme Court has asked civic bodies to present a roll-out plan for the entire city. So the civic bodies have started training its engineers on the modalities of PMAPs and how to implement them in neighbourhoods as part of the new parking policy. Officials are being trained on how to make PMAPs for different localities in a way that they meet parking requirements.6. The way forwardNow after training the officials, the civic bodies will start consultations with the RWAs and market associations in a fortnight to draw parking management area plans. According to civic officials, the municipalities have to submit PMAPs for areas under their jurisdiction to the Supreme Court by the end of the year. Initially those residential areas would be picked which are located near busy markets and witness spillover of vehicles. Pedestrians facilities will witness a major push under the parking policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-new-parking-policy-implementation-6-things-you-need-to-know/story-s3yOSwgeCNHhUIHEs9fBzL.html

Mukherjee, who passed away on Monday, had developed a lung infection at the Army’s Research and Referral hospital in Delhi, where he was admitted for brain surgery. He had also tested positive for coronavirus.“He [Pranab Mukherjee] had almost memorised the entire Chandi as he used to chant it every day the first thing in the morning. So while performing the Durga Puja at his ancestral home he could chant it without referring to any scriptures,” said Rabi Chattoraj, who shares a very close and cordial relation with the Muherjee family. Chandi Path, the recitation of 700 powerful slokas of ‘Durga Saptashati’ from Markandeya Purana, is an ode to Goddess Durga. Organisers of the Arvind Setu Sarbajanin Durgotsav Samity said that this time they decided to pay tribute to Mukherjee and legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray. The puja committee is celebrating their 44th year. “The theme of our puja this year would be Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali. Paying tribute to the former President, we would be playing the Chandi which Mukherjee used to chant. We are trying to procure the recordings and have already got in touch with a few persons,” said Mintu Patra, media coordinator of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chant-by-pranab-mukherjee-to-play-at-this-durga-puja-pandal-in-kolkata/story-ni1lsPdhCMc44ZWbWuzvHP.html

Kafeel spent about nine months in jail in connection with the case before he was granted bail on April 25, 2018 by the Allahabad high court, which observed that there was no proof of medical negligence against the doctor.Kafeel was, however, later arrested in the AMU hate speech case.‘I was kept in jail for no crime committed by me and was framed in a false, fictitious and baseless case. I was not even provided food and water for five days’ alleged Dr Kafeel Khan after coming out from jail on late Tuesday night. Former leader of Congress legislature party and former MLA from Mathura Pradeep Mathur and brother of Kafeel Khan were present at the time of his release from Mathura jail.

02-09-2020||Mumbai||Panje: Contrary to forest report, complainants unearth 66 hacked branches||Miffed with the forest department’s report which claimed that just 11 to 14 mangrove trees were hacked at Panje in Uran, Navi Mumbai, a local resident and an environmentalist have filed a follow-up complaint submitting photographic evidence of 66 hacked trees at the site.The mangrove cell has agreed to reinvestigate the site to confirm the allegation.Meanwhile, a member of the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed mangrove and wetland grievance redressal panel has asked all city-based environmentalists to approach the HC to file a contempt petition, as the committee had ‘failed’ to address several cases of mangrove destruction, including Panje.On Monday, a local resident and birder Parag Gharat, and environmentalist Aishwarya Sridhar wrote to the forest department opposing the mangrove cell’s submissions that investigated a section of the Panje wetland on Saturday.The duo were also among the complainants who highlighted the mangrove destruction at Panje last week by filing separate complaints on Wednesday and Friday. “We decided to visit the site during low tide on Monday for easier access to deeper patches that were not inundated and found 66 hacked mangrove tree branches at a small distance from each other. We have taken photos of each branch and can guide the forest department through the entire route of environmental violation,” Gharat said, adding, “The reason why the forest department found very little trees cut is because their inspection took place closer to high tide when most of the cut branches were underwater and could not be clearly seen.”Mangrove destruction was banned by the HC in September 2018 across Maharashtra. “This is clearly contempt of HC orders and an attempt to prove that this wetland has no mangroves so that the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) can start land filling the area,” said Sridhar.Environmentalists, the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco), and private companies have been in a tussle for over two years now to protect Panje from proposed industrial and residential projects including the NMSEZ. The owner of the land is Cidco, Navi Mumbai’s planning agency, which has leased it out to private companies developing the NMSEZ.On Saturday itself, the forest department wrote to the Raigad district administration to act in the matter and told Cidco to respond to the environmental violation. HT had reported on Sunday that Cidco’s nodal officer (environment) said that mangroves had been hacked by unidentified persons for aquaculture purposes (tree branches to hold nets during high tide). “There is no such activity at Panje or in the vicinity for decades now,” countered Sridhar.Ashish Thakre, the deputy conservator of forest (Alibag) said, “We will be sending our team of forest officers to the site again during low tide to inspect and confirm the exact number of trees hacked. It is a serious violation and exact details need to be brought on record.”Stalin D, a member of the HC-appointed panel, responded to one of the complainants in the Panje mangrove destruction case on Sunday. His letter, which HT has reviewed, read, “As a member of the committee I apologise for the miserable failure on the ground to protect Panje. All directions given by the committee to Cidco, revenue department and local administration have been flouted time and again. Please consider filing a contempt petition in the Bombay HC at the earliest.” He told HT that the state’s coastal zone management authority, responsible for issuing permissions for building a seawall near Panje, had not attended a HC-committee meeting while local residents of Panje village had vested interests in actively pursuing wetland destruction. “I want to ensure citizens do not feel handicapped in such environment violations, and complainants need to know the facts. There is a need to highlight the lawlessness even after clear instructions have been passed by the HC,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/panje-contrary-to-forest-report-complainants-unearth-66-hacked-branches/story-KSKLwqIo7YdPRkagPZOcZK.html
02-09-2020||Dehradun||CBI books 6, including 4 cops, for framing Uttarakhand dhaba owner in drug trafficking case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)’s Uttarakhand unit has booked six people, including four police personnel, from the Udham Singh Nagar district police department and two special police officers (SPOs) for allegedly framing a dhaba owner and his employees in a drug trafficking case and criminal conspiracy, officials said.Also read: Two arrested by NCB for drug trafficking in Mumbai The case was registered against the six police personnel on August 28 after the Uttarakhand high court (HC) gave its order on August 19. The dhaba owner, Anil Sharma, had filed a criminal writ petition in the HC requesting the quashing of the case against him and taking action against the erring police personnel, said officials. PK Panigrahi, superintendent of police (SP), CBI, Uttarakhand, said, “We have booked six people in the case, including two SPOs, on August 28 on the directions of the HC.” The accused have been identified as sub-inspector (S-I) Prakash Tamta and constables Tribhuvan Singh, Chandan Singh and Harish Giri. SPOs Parvez Ahmad and Rajwant Singh have also been booked. “The accused have been booked for criminal conspiracy, disobedience of law by public servant, framing incorrect documents, fabrication of evidence, removing evidence and making false charges of offence under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A probe is in progress. However, the accused are yet to be arrested,” said Panigrahi. The case was registered after a preliminary probe found that the six police personnel was involved in an incident on July 28. They had visited the dhaba of petitioner Sharma and thrashed one of his employees for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking. However, the police personnel failed to find any contraband in the dhaba to support their accusation. Sharma was booked for drug trafficking under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, when he had tried to protest against the police high-handedness.Though 100 grams of cannabis was claimed to be found on Sharma, the charge proved to be false during the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/cbi-books-6-including-4-cops-for-framing-uttarakhand-dhaba-owner-in-drug-trafficking-case/story-p3Z8fuQTmsfbYjFPf9owTP.html

As the area of ‘ahata’ had not been taken into account earlier, they were accusing the government of betrayal, he said, adding the review of these orders would help them get their due.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/jewar-airport-up-govt-to-revise-farmers-compensation/story-O5nxWJhKNIV4tozRbW39oN.html
02-09-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow, Agra malls get licence to sell global liquor brands||The Uttar Pradesh government has cleared licences for prominent supermarkets and individuals to sell high end global brands from malls. Out of the 10 applications made to the excise department, the first four licences have been cleared for Agra and Lucknow. In Agra, a mall has already begun sale and in Lucknow, air-conditioned liquor vends are being readied for sales shortly. Also read: Punjab liquor contractors refuse to pay excise tax for August citing low sales“The six other applications _ two from Moradabad and one each from Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Varanasi and Gorakhpur _ are in different stages of clearance,” said additional chief secretary, excise, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy. Excise department officials feel that soon about 60 of the 66 malls that got the Cabinet nod in May, would have premium retail liquor vends. The annual fees for running such vends is Rs 12 lakh, lesser than what the government charges from standalone liquor vends. “There is no restriction on how many liquor vends can be opened in a mall...so the licence fee has been kept low,” the officer said. Tarun Taneja, a city-based businessman who applied for two licences but got one, said he was all set to open his liquor vend in a Lucknow mall. “It’s going to be an altogether new experience. We would cater to a new generation of mall goers, including women, who might otherwise hesitate to approach the conventional liquor vends,” Taneja said. He said there were many who prefer to gift wine and scotch, which they could now pick up from malls. “It will be an entirely different experience for connoisseurs as well as ones looking to gift imported wine on special occasions,” he said. Such vends are allowed only in malls, departmental stores, super markets or hybrid hyper-markets having a premises of at least 10,000 square feet. “Premium retail vends should have at least 500 square feet carpet area and be able to provide customers the facility to walk in the shop and select their brands from air conditioned shelves,” Bhoosreddy said. It’s not just about ambience; these premium retail vends would also help in bringing in the much required revenue. “Even now, despite sales (from roadside vends) having picked up slightly, we haven’t quite been able to overcome the losses due to Covid-19 induced lockdown. Post lockdown, the recovery has been slow. So even if marginally, the premium vends would help,” an excise inspector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-agra-malls-get-licence-to-sell-global-liquor-brands/story-YChRKKGeX5WHppt5EbbUzL.html

This year, Durga Puja will be held between October 22-26.“Our Aurobindo Setu Committee had decided to dedicate this year’s Puja celebrations to Satyajit Ray, and his film Pather Panchali. But as the news of the former President’s death reached us we changed the plan a little,” Puja, the member said.“Both of them are Bengalis, and Pranab Mukherjee used to do a very good rendition of Chandi Path. We will dedicate the stage to him and play his rendition throughout the festival as a mark of respect to him,” she added.The former President’s funeral took place on September 1 with full military honours and he was cremated at the Lodhi Road crematorium.Mukherjee, who had tested positive for the coronavirus, died on Monday, weeks after his brain surgery.

02-09-2020||Kolkata||Unlock 4:Restaurants in Bengal open bars after five months||Unlock 4 brought relief for the bibulous in West Bengal on Tuesday when restaurants opened their bars after five months, following an order from the state excise department. Managers at several popular bars and lounges said that although business was not overwhelming on the first night, many customers turned up with friends for a drink or two. Safety protocols were however in place with occupancy restricted to 50 per cent of the sitting capacity. There are more than 600 bars in the districts and around 350 in Kolkata. The state government allowed stand-alone liquor shops to reopen in May but imposed an additional 30% tax to raise money for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Since this led to a drop in retail sale and affected the state’s revenue, the government has planned to break up the tax into several slabs, excise officials said. “No customer is allowed to enter without a mask and hand sanitizer is provided by the management. Customers can take off their masks after taking their seats,” said a staff at Moulin Rouge, one of the oldest restaurants at Park Street, the Mecca for foodies in the state capital. Also Read: JEE Main 2020: Examinees brave rain and lack of transport to take tests in Bengal “There were more customers at Aqua, our poolside bar, than ‘Some Place Else’, the lounge.

On June 8, when Unlock 1 was enforced, eateries and restaurants reopened after more than two months. But as Kolkata’s restaurants prepared to adapt to the new normal, unanswered questions loomed large over the business because of social distancing norms and people’s concern for safety.

I miss doing that, this year,” says Chitra Madanan, a Delhi-based corporate. One of the many city residents who will be celebrating Onam this year, with precautions such as practising social distancing, Madanan says, “I will be making rangoli from the flowers delivered to our house. Me and my friends will share our final rangoli design, over WhatsApp, with each other to see who gets the most likes,” gleams Madanan. Onam (August 22 to September 2, 2020) celebration is almost synonymous with payasam, a milk and rice pudding that is prepared for guests who visit their relatives on the festival. Manmohan M, a DU student, who is spending this Onam at his PG, away from his family in Kerala, feels it’s difficult to even meet his relatives in the Capital. “I can’t believe that this year I won’t be able to enjoy the payasam that my aunt makes! Usually my friends who live in the same PG as me, accompany me to my aunt’s house in Vasant Kunj, to enjoy the Onam feast. This year, however, has put a dampener on our plans.

But, most often, the choice of breed for this furry friend is one that’s foreign. Dog rescuers have been trying since ages to alter the mindset of people, and make them show love to indie dogs as well, but have had to face hurdles all the way. In his recent Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the nation, made a special mention asking people to adopt local/indie breeds of dogs. Animal rescuers and pet parents feel that this will certainly encourage people to look beyond pedigree. Indian breeds of dogs are majestic!Also highlighted the exemplary roles played by dogs in our security forces, police forces and during times of disasters. #MannKiBaat pic.twitter.com/IzThnqRi5L“PM amasses a huge following, and his words will go a long way in helping indie breeds get adopted. But now things should change,” says Nidhi Mishra, co-founder Posh Foundation, which works for animal welfare and rehabilitation. Mishra says she gets requests for adoption every day, but adds that “50% people ask for puppies of foreign breeds; or a golden retriever. Hum counselling kar kar ke thak gaye hain (ki indie dogs ko adopt karke toh dekho)... In some localities such as Noida’s Sector 21, 80% of dogs on the streets are indie breeds, and the good thing is that they are all are taken care of; many got adopted by local families.” A Delhi-based marketing professional, Chitrangada, who adopted an indie, Royce, in 2017, says people should aim for adopting and not buy dogs. “The kind of ardent love and care Royce has brought in my life is beyond comparison. Indies live a life of constant strife, and once you adopt them, their gratitude is boundless. It’s this kind of bond which is specific to adopting dogs instead of buying them,” she adds.A Gurugram resident Umesh Yadav, who adopted two senior indies a few years ago, says buying dogs promotes forced breeding. “With local breeds and street dogs there are almost no chances of inbreeding, so their immune systems are much better and less prone to diseases. Their fur also suits the local climate, so they make better house pets than some international breeds that get adopted,” says Yadav, whereas Noida-based animal rescuer Pooja Bhat, who has been helping in the adoption of indie dogs, says, “It’s amazing to see youngsters getting involved in this cause. In the last two months, I’ve come across many girls and boys in the age bracket of 25 to 30 volunteering for this cause. With the PM’s statement now, I’m hopeful that more youngsters will help in promoting local dog breeds and stray animal welfare.” “People around the world helped us feed dogs during the lockdown and beyond,” says US-based Jessica Haltzman who runs the non-profit organisation Delhi the Street Dog Foundation that helps street indies to get adopted abroad. She herself adopted one street indie during one of her travels to India, and named it Delhi. “Indie breeds are as resilient and loyal as pedigree dogs. It’s time people realised Indian local breeds are as good as a dog of any other pedigree. Plus, adopting dogs is about love and care, instead of status symbol.” Author tweets @Bhagat_MallikaFollow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/vocalforlocal-dogs-pm-s-clarion-call-will-help-us-say-animal-rescuers-and-pet-parents/story-SLn9OVPq743rSbAdOJOyJL.html

The party also asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to reverse this order and call for an explanation from health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu in the matter. “It is unfortunate that the health department has taken this decision after a senior IAS officer of the department who had blown the lid off the earlier buprenorphine tablet scam was shunted out,” former minister Janmeja Singh Sekhon said in a statement. He said the former health secretary had detected the alleged illegal diversion of about five crore tablets of buprenorphine worth Rs 200 crore by unauthorised persons outside the system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-slams-govt-for-removing-price-cap-on-buprenorphine-tablets/story-9B9Cpea6fV4dzm6zijy1GM.html

Police said the suspect was arrested from his hometown early on Tuesday.According to the police, a call was received at Khyala police station around 7.30pm stating that two men had been stabbed and were lying in their room in D block. The duo was identified as Mohammad Ajam, 45 and Amir Hasan, 46, both vegetable vendors. “A police team reached the spot found the two men lying in a pool of blood. They were shifted to a hospital where they were pronounced dead and the bodies sent for post-mortem examination. The duo had been stabbed multiple times. A case of murder was registered and a forensics team was called to inspect the scene of crime ,” said a senior police officer. The officer said the incident came to light after one of Amir’s friend called him but the call went unanswered. When he couldn’t reach Aamir despite multiple calls, he visited his room and found the door unlocked. When he entered, he found both Aamir and Aazam lying in a pool of blood and alerted the neighbours, who informed the police.“Locals told us that Sakir had left for his hometown four months ago and had returned a fortnight ago. After his return, Amir and Ajam asked him to pay rent for four months, to which Sakir refused. This led to an altercation,” the officer said.DCP (west) Deepak Purohit said teams were then sent to Saakir’s hometown and he was nabbed from there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-kills-roommates-after-tiff-over-paying-rent/story-aP5a2oxyrQXyPFtIb8fQ0K.html

The moving bodies of people look like silhouettes.And it’s shocking to see so many people collected together in these times of pandemic.But worry not. The feeling of dense crowd is an illusion, probably arising from the fact that one is hardly used to seeing people in large groups any more. Actually, this open plaza outside Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place would be peopled with 10 times this number during the pre-corona era.Here, one can feel the attempts of the metropolis to find its footing after many many months of corona-driven hibernation.Old landmarks are back to functioning. Netaji chai stall is decked up with a wall of earthen cups, the stall owner is wearing a Gandhi cap, with his customers (masked, most of them) sitting in a semi-circle with their glasses of steaming hot adrak chai.Some distance away the person manning the Sri Banke Bihari litti chokha stall is trying to hand over a fresh plate of his littis to a customer having a heated conversation on her mobile phone.A mehendi walla is crying out to the passersby to dye their hands with henna.And the air is filled up with the hushed sounds of various people. Everyone seems to be talking in a low whisper, as if being loud might shatter this fragile normalcy.The raison d’être of the plaza, the Hanuman Mandir, is open to worshippers again. The sound of bells and prayers are streaming out from the temple and wafting across the place.Meanwhile, here and there one can spot the solitary people in various stages of emotional and material despair. Each of them silent, sheltered in their own private refuges. In the BC (before corona) days, many would depend on donations by devotees heading to the temple. Many would sleep at night in the plaza itself. How has the life altered for them during these trying months, one wonders.Suddenly, an elderly woman in white sari, who was so far sitting quietly on a bench, starts to shout. It is not clear what she is saying. Tattoo stall owners nearby look at her indulgently, without offering any word themselves, as if they were used to her rages.Not far away stands a multiplex. The wall beside the closed ticket window is decked with a poster of the yet-to-be-released James Bond film. It was originally supposed to be screened in April. It is called No Time to Die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-new-evening-with-glimpses-of-old/story-A88dAbJiyA97Bu6cjDNDfL.html
02-09-2020||City||State of cities: Amritsar among country’s 10 filthiest big cities||AMRITSAR: Home to Golden Temple, Amritsar is one of the most visited places in the world but among the filthiest big cities in the country. The recent Swachh Survekshan rankings showed it slipped from 184th rank last year to 236th position in 2020. With a population of 13 lakh, the holy city is ranked ninth among the country’s 10 filthiest big cities in the annual survey under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The city was ranked 39th among 47 cities across the country with a population of more than 10 lakh. Amritsar was ranked 236th out of 429 cities this year, if we place the city in the more than one lakh population category, the pattern that was followed in previous surveys. In 2019, the city’s ranking was 184 out of 425 cities. The poor ranking in this survey was attributed to improper garbage collection and its disposal and delayed civic works. Amritsar managed to score 40% marks (2,459.31 points out of the total 6,000), in this survey and scored 1,046.27 points in citizens’ feedback, 838.72 points in direct observation, 373.32 points in service levels progress (SLP) and just 200 points in documentation. Each category was allotted 1,500 points. However, the city scored 48% (2,406/5,000 points) in the 2019 survey and 50% (2,039/4,000 points) in the 2018 survey, in the more than one lakh population category. The city is losing marks in SLP and direct observation, every year, while the citizen’s participation is improving gradually. PROBLEM AREAS Garbage collection and disposal: The city has no planned system of garbage collection and disposal. Door-to-door collection facility is not available in the walled city area around Golden Temple and comprises 11 of the 88 wards. Sewerage lines in the walled city are choked, resulting in overflowing waste. Garbage collection in other wards is also irregular. The city has failed in solid waste management as the concept of garbage segregation (separating wet and dry garbage) is not being followed. More than 15 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste has been accumulated in the city’s Bhagtanwala dump near Golden Temple. The bio-remediation plant went non-operational soon after its installation. 400 tonnes of garbage is added to the site daily. Inadequate funds and infrastructure: Amritsar member of Parliament Gurjeet Singh Aujla says, “Though municipal corporation officials are trying to make the city better and using resources, they are unable to generate more funds. Due to inadequate funds, we don’t have machines and infrastructure.” Apathy of citizens: MC health officers Dr Yogesh Arora says of the required 26,000 people, 19,000 city residents downloaded the Swachh Survekshan mobile app. Only 1.69% of Amritsar’s population participated, while in Indore, the cleanest city in India, the percentage was 11.88. Lack of maintenance: Unkept green belts, dirty public toilets, unclean water bodies and piles of garbage are for all to see. The city is not plastic-free and the number of dustbins in commercial and public areas is inadequate. STALLED CIVIC PROJECTS *Bio-remediation plant at Bhagtanwala dump The project started in March 2019, aimed at recycling 15L MT of garbage but the project has been at halt since its inauguration. Cost: Rs 3 crore Status: Bio-remediation has started but at a slow pace. *Public toilets Most of the 225 public and community toilets built at 41 locations in the city don’t have water and sewerage connections. Cost: Rs 3 crore Status: Construction completed in March 2019 but lying locked and unused. *Biogas plant at Golden Temple Announced in March 2019, the biogas plant is yet to be set up at Golden Temple. Cost: Rs 2.5 crore Status: The MC is yet to get approvals from the Amritsar Development Authority. WHAT OFFICIALS SAY MC Commissioner Komal Mittal, who is also the chief executive officer of Amritsar Smart City Limited, says, “Amritsar lacked in processing and disposing garbage. We are focusing on this segment and have started composting wet waste at five places, including Bhagtanwala. Adequate budget allocation has been made with Rs 1.5 crore being paid every month for the collection and transportation of solid waste besides salaries to sanitation staff.” The city is in an advanced stage of tendering to get equipment worth Rs 8.5 crore for door-to-door garbage collection from the walled city. Few public toilets are awaiting power connection and water supply. All public toilets will be fully functional by September 15, Mittal says. Amritsar mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu says the MC is working to fix the water supply and sewer systems. To dispose the legacy waste, work has started for its bio-remediation and a solid waste plant will be set up at the dumping site. Additional deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal says the administration has ensured sweeping and lifting of garbage near Golden Temple round the clock. Efforts are being made to follow National Green Tribunal guidelines. RESIDENTS’ TAKE Solid waste management a concern “Residents are not segregating waste and garbage is irregularly collected and disposed,” says Kulwant Singh, president of NGO Amritsar Vikas Manch. Focus on beautification than cleanliness: The authorities emphasise on beautification but they are not concerned about its cleanliness, says Naresh Johar, a city resident. Public participation a must: The government is not the only one to be blamed as people must cooperate to keep the city clean. They must start composting at home, says social worker Indu Arora. City lacks greenery: Green belts, gardens and parks are full of litter. Ram Bagh is in neglect. Stray animals in public spaces make it dirtier, says local resident Shivam Joshi. Staff mismanagement: “The city has the MC, Improvement Trust and Smart City project staff yet it lacks cleanliness and access to clean drinking water. Development projects are incomplete and councillors are not ensuring cleanliness in their wards,” says Sandhya Sikka, the MC leader of opposition. Legacy waste should be recycled: Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu had promised recycling of legacy waste. The project failed to take off and no political leader is working to shift the dump from the residential area though this was part of the election manifesto. “If Indore can recycle 13L MT legacy waste then why can’t Amritsar?” asks Sanjay Sharma, a city resident.

02-09-2020||Chandigarh||STATE OF CITIES: Cleanliness, sanitation ‘dumped’ in Jalandhar||It’s the hub of the sports goods industry hub and one the most prominent cities of Punjab after Amritsar, but Jalandhar has had quite a flop show in Swachh Survekshan 2020, securing an all-India rank of 119 out of 382 cities with a population of up to 10 lakh.Jalandhar also scored a poor 50% in all parameters in the surveys of 2018, 2019 and 2020, chiefly because it lacks an effective garbage disposal system. City authorities, too, have failed to sanction any major development civic works in the last three to four years, say some municipal corporation officials on condition of anonymity.In the recent Swacch Survekshan, Jalandhar secured a 50% overall score (3,095 out of 6,000). This includes 988 out of 1,500 in citizens’ feedback; 1,138 points for direct observation (physical observation by the survey agency) out of 1,500; 374 points in service level progress (status of open defecation, garbage collection etc) out of 1,500 and 500 points in certification out 1,500.The city ranked 166 in 2019 with a score of 2,499 out of 5,000 in the survey, doing worse at rank 214 in 2018 with 2,002 points out of 4,000 among the category of cities with a population of more than one lakh.Problem areasWithout a solid waste management plant, nearly seven lakh tonnes of garbage has piled up at the Wariana dump, which receives 500 tonnes of waste every day.A Rs 70 crore bioremediation project planned by MC to treat waste through microorganisms and other methods has yet to take off.People’s participation is key too, says an MC official. “We need people to cooperate as we don’t get segregated waste from every household. The main areas of the city have been covered for door-to-door collection of waste, but segregation is not done.”About 80 wards and 11 villages of the Jalandhar Cantonment assembly constituency have been added to the MC – controlled zones, but the delimitation of the villages is yet to be done.At loggerheads over hiring staffCriticising officials for delaying important waste management initiatives, the Union of Sanitation and Cleanliness Employees in the MC, asks why more staff are not being hired on contract.The union and MC are at loggerheads over hiring contractual employees.Environment authorities have noticed the problems and the National Green Tribunal panel headed by Justice (retd) Jasbir Singh has directed Jalandhar authorities to come with a permanent solution to deal with the Wariana dump.Chandan Grewal, president of the union, says the city’s upkeep is a problem area because of acute shortage of staff, with just 1,700 to 1,800 employees including safai sewaks, garbage collection staff, on the rolls. Comparing it with other civic bodies, he says Ludhiana MC has a staff strength of 8,000 and Amritsar about 4,500 people.“The MC administration should be questioned about the (Swachh rankings). We have been demanding that sanitation or cleanliness staff be hired on a regular basis, even if it has to be on minimum wage, but we will not allow any contractor to earn a profit”, says Grewal.Denying any shortage of funds under the Swachh Bharat or Smart City missions, Jalandhar central MLA Rajinder Beri feels quick utilisation of funds on projects is required. “We need to develop a small garbage dump at every colony where waste can be disposed of at zero point,” he suggests.There has been leakage of funds, alleges a senior MC official, also on condition of anonymity. “It has to be checked and the money used for development,” he adds. Basic repair work not doneProminent roads in the city, especially near the Bus Stand and Nakodar Road, are in a bad state, with surfaces damaged and potholes in some spot. Tenders for the works are being processed, officials say.RESIDENTS’ TAKEUnion leaders don’t want dump moved: MC has been supervising the cleanliness staff and their work timings, says Surinder Saini, president, Jalandhar Welfare Society. He alleges that some leaders of the Union of Sanitation and Cleanliness Employees do not want the Wariana dump to be moved because of “personal politics.” The MC needs to sort out the matter quickly, he addsGarbage everywhere: “How can you expect good rankings in the survey when garbage is scattered on the roads everywhere,” says Nachhtar Singh, a retired government official. The MC should clear it to keep the city clean. Development of roads and other works should be completed on time, he says.Public participation must: Raman Dutt of the Indo-American Friends Society says public participation is important to guarantee the success of cleanliness and sanitation projects, similar to what Indore has done. Until the public does not understand its responsibilities, Dutt adds, no officer or government can bring about changes in the city.New development initiatives needed: Drastic steps have to be taken by the government and MC authorities for the overall development of the city, which is currently in very bad shape with each and every road damaged, says businessman Maninder Singh Tikka. A number of new initiatives are required for developing the city.WHAT OFFICIALS SAYDeputy commissioner, Ghanshyam Thori says the city has improved its rankings in Swachh Survekshan 2020, which is a matter of satisfaction. “To get into the top 100, I have asked MC authorities to work on the static compactor which will deal with garbage disposal of four or five wards. View cutters also have to be set up.”Mayor Jagdish Raja asks for people’s co-operation first to improve rankings in Swachh Survekshan and to keep the city clean as segregation of waste material is not being done. “We have been able to run the Nangal Shama area’s solid waste plant, because of which the Rama Mandi zone will stay clean,”he adds. On the lack of civic development, Raja says, “we have floated tenders of Rs 35 crore for the roads and Rs 45 crore for LED light project and have adequate funds for development.” Work on roads has been delayed due to the lockdown.Municipal corporation commissioner Karnesh Sharma says work is continuing on segregation of waste material in an organised manner and providing E-rickshaw to waste collectors. “We have also floated tender for the bioremediation plant to clear the Wariana Dump in the next three years. About 5,000 new saplings will be planted for greening the city.” Two sewage treatment plants (STP’s) of 50 and 15 MLD are also being installed, he adds.Institutional composting pits will be dug for disposal of wet waste in defence services campuses, big colonies, hotels or resorts to process the waste at zero point. On potholed and damaged roads, Sharma says the MC will continue repair work, “but we will build all the roads in the next three months.”CITY FACTSPopulation: Over 8 lakhAnnual budget for cleanliness related works: Rs40 croreODF certification - RectifiedWards: 81STATUS OF PENDING PROJECTS1.

The six booked under NSA include an ex-corporator, police said on Monday.“Four FIRs were lodged with Khajrana police station against 16 people and several others in connection with their taking out a procession with Tazia in Muharram, later gathering and provoking members of a community through a video clip posted on social media in Khajrana area on Sunday in violation of sections 188, 269 and 270 of Indian Penal Code (IPC),” a police statement said.The administration had earlier shifted Khajrana police station in-charge Santosh Singh Yadav to police lines and issued show cause notice to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) on the ground of dereliction of duty for not acting against people participating in the procession.“Action under National Security Act (NSA) was taken against ex-corporator Usman Patel, Ansar Ali, Mohd Ali, Ismail Patel and Shahzad Patel, all residents of different localities in Khajrana area and Farukh Ali. The other 22 accused were arrested and sent to judicial custody on Monday. Police have launched a manhunt to nab other accused who would be sent behind the bars at the earliest”, the Indore police statement said.The release warned, “Strict punitive action will continue to be taken to check the spread of global pandemic Covid-19 against those who violate the instructions issued by the government and the administration.” District collector Manish Singh said the administration had held a meeting with community leaders a few days ago where religious leaders and others had promised there will be no procession with tazia in Muharram. “But still there were violations of orders. In fact, there were lapses on both the sides. Had the police station in charge, SDM and city superintendent of police concerned been alert the situation would have been avoided,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-corporator-in-indore-among-six-booked-under-nsa-22-others-arrested-for-religious-gathering/story-me1XFrWMaJqGdOEOfdYGEM.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh fares worst among UTs in decline in road mishaps||Chandigarh fared the worst in terms of rate of decline in road accidents — both fatal and non-fatal—among all Union Territories between 2018 and 2019.This has been revealed in the Accidental Deaths and Suicides Report in India 2019 released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Tuesday. Recording 304 road accidents in 2019, Chandigarh saw a drop of just 4.1% as compared to 317 mishaps in 2018.All UTs collectively saw a drop of 13.3%, much higher than Chandigarh’s, though the national decline stood at only 1.6%.Chandigarh has also reported the highest increase (71.1%) in accidental deaths among all states and UTs. The figures stood at 242 and 414 in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Manoj Kumar Meena, officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP), traffic, said, “It is important to see the record over the past five years. Every year, the number of road accidents in Chandigarh goes down. It is an achievement to continue this decelerating trend. More efforts are needed to make sure this continues.”DRIVER FEEDBACK SYSTEMS TO BE EXPANDEDMeena said police had recently built a divider with barricades in Sector 25 (West) to better manage traffic there, and were looking to expand the driver feedback system. “Ever since the driver feedback system was installed in December 2019, some of the most dangerous roads of the city reported no fatal accidents, which is an encouraging news,” he said.According to data provided by traffic police, 28 people have died in road accidents this year as compared to 64 till the end of August last year. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic) Kewal Krishan said, “There were fewer fatal accidents this year due to the two-month lockdown. We want to keep such deaths under 75 this year.”Navdeep Asija, member of the state road safety committee, said: “Right now, the city needs to make infrastructure changes to reduce the number of accidents. Cycle tracks make cyclists safer, but junctions are still dangerous. Traffic calming devices like table tops are the need of the hour.”Kamal Soi, member of National Road Safety Council, said: “Any reduction is good. Police enforcement on Chandigarh roads is bearing results and the authorities need out-of-the-box solutions to further reduce the number of accident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-fares-worst-among-uts-in-decline-in-road-mishaps/story-dNfywQ4HxhTEv5ffM2Kn8M.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab liquor contractors refuse to pay excise tax for August citing low sales||As a mark of protest against the Punjab government’s orders to close liquor vends by 6:30pm on all weekdays, the contractors decided to not deposit the excise tax for the month of August. The vend owners say that their sales peak in the evening hours but due to early closure, they were missing out on crucial sales. “We are also losing a lot of business due to the complete shutdown on weekends, so much so that we may not even be able to meet the sale targets,” said an office-bearer of the vend owners association.Monday was the last date for depositing the excise duty, which, as per reports, many contractors have not deposited. Going by the annual revenue target of Rs 5,200 crore from liquor sales, the state government has missed the monthly installment of Rs. 430 crore. “The vend owners had decided to stage a symbolic shut down of vends on Tuesday and hand over the keys to the deputy commissioners but we called back the protest, hoping that the government would come to our rescue,” said Anil Mahajan, a contractor from Hoshiarpur. Rajwinder Singh Kahlon, who owns stakes in liquor in Jalandhar, said that due to the early shutting of vends, there is a dip in business and break even can’t be reached. Giving an example, he said that within the municipal limits of Jalandhar city, the average tax to be paid by vend owners comes to around Rs 92 lakh a day but due to poor sales, the total business has come down to Rs 60-65 lakh, which earlier was double. “Now how do we pay taxes? The government should come to our rescue,” he suggested, while demanding that there was a need to extend the closure timings till at least 10 pm for sales targets to be met. He added the situation is likely to remain the same in September and October too and business owners would be the worst sufferers. In May, the liquor contractors had refused to open vends, demanding changes in the excise policy to accommodate their concerns. Only 10% of the total of 5,800 vends in the state had reopened since the relaxations were brought in.The traders then demanded compensation for the period during which vends remained closed owing to the lockdown. The state government then agreed to their demand and gave relaxation for 36 days, between March 22 to May 6, when vends were shut. “The government needs to again work a solution,” demanded a liquor contractor from Mohali who doesn’t want to be named. Finance commissioner (taxation) A Venuprasad, however, refused to accept that sales were down. Ruling out any scope for compensation, he said that the fiscal indicators reveal that liquor contractors are making good sales. “At least during the past two months, they recorded a good sale,” he said, adding that as per laws, the contractors had to deposit the excise fee and other taxes applicable on sale of liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-liquor-contractors-refuse-to-pay-excise-tax-for-august-citing-low-sales/story-KKkcDvoH9bg5zjgpfRezTI.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Multi-level parking needed in busy markets, suggests Chandigarh advisory panel||Multi-level parking is needed at busy locations and markets of the city to help manage the daily traffic. This was decided in the meeting of UT administrator’s advisory council constituted for traffic management on Tuesday.As per committee chairman Rajesh Kalia, a multi-level parking will help manage traffic better. “Like malls have parking spaces on multiple levels in basements, the same should be done at the busy markets of the city. When cars are parked properly, pavements can be freed up for pedestrians. This will also increase their safety on the road,” the former mayor said.Kalia added that it was important to light up cycle tracks in the city and get them repaired. “Auto drivers without fare meters should be heavily fined so that passengers are charged reasonably,” he proposed, stating that the committee members agreed they should meet at least once a month so action-taken reports are reviewed.It was also decided to construct traffic police booths with toilet facility at major chowks/ intersections. Speaking on this, DSP Kewal Krishan said, “It is tough for traffic cops on duty, especially women constables, and such facilities are badly needed. We have suggested that first they be made at Picaddily Chowk, Matka Chowk and Tribune Chowk, and then rolled out for other intersections.”Two council members, former Confederation of Indian Industry chairman Dinesh Dua and Radheyshyam Garg, pledged to install such facilities at some of these intersections from their own pocket.Manoj Kumar Meena, who is currently officiating as senior superintendent of police (traffic), acted as member secretary to the committee and shared data about accidents in the city. “Driver feedback systems have proven to be of great help and have reduced fatal accidents at some of the busiest patches to zero, where they have been installed,” he informed.All deputy superintendents of the traffic police were also present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/multi-level-parking-needed-in-busy-markets-suggests-chandigarh-advisory-panel/story-GlLhz17mDd5WuCPh5DyTsI.html
02-09-2020||City||AAP, splinter Akali group uncertain over contesting Mohali MC elections||Even though the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, Badal)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance as well as the Congress party have pulled up their sleeves for the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) elections in Mohali, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and a splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa are still uncertain.The elections, date undecided, will be held in 50 wards with an estimated 2.36 lakh voter base. The former councillors of both Congress and SAD-BJP have already started circulating their achievements in the past five years on social media.President of AAP Punjab and member of parliament (MP) Bhagwant Mann said, “We are yet to take a decision on contesting elections and a meeting in this regard will be held in a few days. We are not even sure when the state government will hold the said elections, but we are in the process of strengthening our organisation at the district level.” Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who floated the splinter Akali group in July, said, “We will be holding a meeting with the party workers before taking any decision on contesting the MC elections. We will not allow any party to sail smoothly.”Meanwhile, local MLA and cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Congress was ready for the MC elections. “The people of Mohali have seen development in the past few years and we are hopeful of winning the elections with a clean majority.”The civic body is elected for a period of five years. The last five-year term ended on April 26 this year. The MC House constituted 14 Congress seats; 23 SAD-BJP seats; the Azad group ,which was led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, won 10 seats; and two seats were won by independent councillors.In the 2015 elections, 27 councillors including 10 from the Azad group, 14 from Congress and two independent councillors had elected Kulwant Singh as the mayor, but later in August 2017, Kulwant joined SAD.Of 2.36 lakh people voting, 25,000 belong to the Scheduled Caste (SC) category; five seats have been reserved for the SC candidates, two for women (SC), three for backward classes and two for women from the backward classes. There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are reserved for women and 20 for men.Mohali delimitation meeting heldThe meeting of the delimitation board was held on Tuesday at Local Government Bodies in Sector 35, Chandigarh. The Board asked the Mohali MC commissioner to bring the drawing of the new areas balancing the population in the next meeting, which is scheduled on September 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-splinter-akali-group-uncertain-over-contesting-mohali-mc-elections/story-1BH4qGyNkYDiRLzRCxFtfM.html
02-09-2020||City||To protect Rafale from bird-hits, Ambala admn told to clean up litter near IAF base||Almost a month after five Rafale jets landed at the Indian Air Force (IAF) Station here, the urban local bodies director has written to the district administration to reduce the presence of garbage around the air base.The garbage leads to “high concentration of birds” in the 10-km zone which has the potential to cause “very serious damage to the aircraft”, the letter says.This has come after Air Marshal Manavendra Singh, the director general (inspection and safety) of the IAF, wrote to Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora, apprising her of the issue and demanding civil administration support on solid waste management near the air force base.The letter mentions that three meetings have taken place between the IAF officials and the municipal corporation on reducing the garbage around the station, and “to protect the fighter aircraft”, the administration should “implement solid waste management scheme to curb the activity of large birds like black kites in the aerodrome zone of 10-km around Ambala airfield”.“This would involve institution of littering penalty, improvement in garbage collection and setting up of a solid waste management plant...and control of pigeon breeding,” the letter reads.Acknowledging the letter, deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said the orders will be implemented.It is pertinent to mention here that earlier last year, a bird had collided mid-air with an aircraft, after which extra fuel tanks were dropped in an Ambala village. However, no injury was reported.The order also gathers importance as the Rafale fighter jets that landed on July 29 are expected to be formally inducted on September 10 in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-protect-rafale-from-bird-hits-ambala-admn-told-to-clean-up-litter-near-iaf-base/story-mJtHkDPya2GhZdc222HlwL.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER plans infectious disease hospital at Sarangpur||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is planning to build a 200-bed infectious diseases hospital on the newly acquired land in Sarangpur here.Officials at the institute who are working on the project said several pandemics had time and again stressed the healthcare system, and there was a need to have a separate facility to manage patients suffering from contagious diseases.The hospital is expected to have a high-level isolation unit which will be equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said such facilities do not exist in many hospitals, especially in resource-limited settings. “If we have learnt anything from Covid-19 it is to have a hospital which is always prepared for such emergencies. There are special requirements for such hospitals such as maintaining negative pressure in the buildings, which is generally not the case, and a trained workforce,” Dr Ram said.He added that the institute had expressed their desire to the central government and had received a positive response. “We have started working on the project and we will take it through various high-level bodies of the institute.”The PGIMER had converted a general building into an infectious disease hospital after the UT administration had requested for the same. The Nehru Hospital Extension Block that was prepared to deal with the pandemic has now treated close to 900 Covid-19 patients from across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-plans-infectious-disease-hospital-at-sarangpur/story-HMsKwz9TMaBilcMKz3FOhN.html

Police have recovered a note, purportedly written by the distressed victim, that held no one was responsible for incident. Police said a few minutes before his death, he had spoken to his wife over the phone. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “After the call, his wife, who was in Noida, informed the Gurugram police control room at about 3.30am, following which a police team rushed to the spot. By the time the police reached his house, he was found dead.” Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sadar, said, “We have informed his family and they are on their way to Gurugram. Any further probe will be initiated after the family’s statement is recorded.” Police said his body has been kept in the mortuary and the post-mortem would be conducted after his family reaches Gurugram. Gurugram does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-doctor-falls-from-eighth-floor-of-his-apartment-dies/story-FL6F6BZrJxADt71qGKb5vM.html
02-09-2020||Gurugram||Active Covid-19 cases in Gurugram more than 1,000||With 196 new Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, the tally of infected persons in the district has reached 12,113. Out of these, at least 1048 are active cases, while 10,932 have recovered from the illness. The death toll stands at 133. It is after a month that active cases in the city have breached the 1,000-mark. On July 29, the district reported 1,091 active cases, which gradually decreased to 650 on the first week of August. In the last one-week, more than 100 new cases have been reported every day. However, health officials said that the total positivity rate of the district is 6.73% and the fatality rate is under control.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), “Though the active cases are increasing, the mortality rate is at least 1.13%, which shows Covid-19 situation is under control. Gurugram, till now, has reported 133 deaths, out of which 93 were with co-morbidities and 40 without co-morbidity. It is a matter of concern if the mortality rate is more than 2%. To prevent death rate from increasing, all symptomatic positive patients are being admitted to hospitals, while only asymptomatic are being home-isolated.” The district health bulletin data shows that by June 16, active cases climbed to 1,722 with total case load of 3,682. The daily positivity rate of almost 67% raised the active numbers further to 1,820 while the total cases reached a mark of 4,512 by June-end. In July, however, the decline was visible as the daily growth rate of cases came down from 12.6% to 1.7%. The number of active cases was around 1,091 on July 29, which came down to 991 by July 30, further to 883 on August 2 and finally to 757 on August 4. However, it started increasing in the last two weeks of August with almost 600-800 new cases reported per week. Confirming the rise in infection, the health department officials said that Gurugram’s daily growth of Covid-19 cases is also fluctuating between 0.87% (August 7) to 1.1 % on (August 27) and 0.98% on Tuesday, indicating the Covid-19 cases are climbing up. In July, the daily growth rate of the cases was 1.4%. Officials said that since cases increasing across the country, Gurugram is no different. “The health department has been conducting almost 2000 tests per day. But citizens will have to take extra care by using masks, maintaining social distance and not moving out unnecessarily unless required. Some people are also violating home isolation norms, which should be prevented,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-covid-19-cases-in-gurugram-more-than-1-000/story-4DDFKUmJWmr8O25niDwbxJ.html
02-09-2020||Chandigarh||Day 1 of JEE Main: Exam centres allotted too far, say candidates in Chandigarh||Even as the first day of Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Main rolled off smoothly at five venues in Chandigarh and Mohali on Tuesday, candidates complained of the examination centres being too far from their homes.This, despite the Centre claiming that it had created extra centres for conducting the examination.The entrance test was held for candidates seeking admission in bachelor of planning and architecture programmes, while BTech aspirants will sit for JEE Main from Wednesday onwards.Barjinder Singh from Gurdaspur, Punjab, wrote his exam in the second shift, however, he had arrived as early as 10am and waited outside his centre in Industrial Area Phase 1 till it was time for the exam. “I had to travel over four hours from my hometown to reach the exam centre in Chandigarh, so I thought it prudent to come early, even if required waiting for long hours. I didn’t want to risk getting late for my exam, as the centre was allotted quite far,” he said.Avneet Kaur, a candidate who appeared in the first shift of the exam, said she drove all the way up to Chandigarh from Rai Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh to take the test. “I had opted for a centre near my residence, but it was allotted in Chandigarh.” She had reached here with her brother and father and on Monday so she could appear for her exam on Tuesday morning.The central government had said they would make arrangements for students to reach the centres for their JEE exams, however, no such provisions were seen in Chandigarh.Members of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) were seen assisting the students reach their respective centres. NSUI leader Manoj Lubana said they had arranged for the stay of four students who weren’t from the Tricity for Tuesday’s exam. “Two students each from Himachal Pradesh and Punjab stayed with us overnight.” The NSUI also provided students with water and masks outside the exam centres.Previously, NSUI had been protesting against the government for holding the JEE examination.EXAM DUBBED EASYStudents who sat for the architecture exam on Tuesday confirmed that the exam was easy and was going to be a high-scoring one. Gaurav Mishra, a student from Dhakoli, said the mathematics portion was especially easy and he was hopeful to nail the entrance exam.Ishan Chopra from Chandigarh also said the exam had easy questions and was of appropriate length. He finished the exam 15 minutes early, so he had enough time to revise. Manshika Bhardwaj from Chandigarh said though the exam was easy, her first attempt at JEE Main in January had been better.Around 70-80 students were present for each shift of the exam and said social distancing and hygiene as mentioned by the National Testing Agency in their advisory were followed at the centres. Police were present outside the centres to maintain the orders.The examination will continue till September 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/day-1-of-jee-main-exam-centres-allotted-too-far-say-candidates-in-chandigarh/story-KFwor6peETxKxrJUfTI3fO.html
02-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Social media feed helps cops keep eye on parties||The police have formed six teams consisting of four officials each to keep a close watch on people posting online advertisements for organising group parties at farmhouses in Gurugram, thereby violating social distancing norms, said the police. The teams have been given workstations to monitor social media posts and have been asked to become members of such groups online to get more details. Most of the organisers are advertising for group parties in the Aravalis, Sohna and Kadarpur areas despite a ban on public gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the police said. The move comes in the wake of a raid that was conducted on the night of August 9 on Gurugram-Faridabad Road, after the police found screen shots of WhatsApp and Facebook pages regarding the details of a group party. Police commissioner KK Rao said that they have created a database of the areas that have been identified by the police teams and are tracking mobile numbers and pages on social media to know the dates of the upcoming parties. “We have received details of 16 such parties, which have been planned by party organisers later this week, and we have identified the locations. If anyone is caught partying in groups, strict action will be taken against them and their videos will be shared on police pages and social media platforms,” he said. As per government guidelines on Unlock 4.0, a maximum of 100 people can attend a gathering only from September 21. The health department last week said during a press conference that the number of Covid-19 cases started increasing after people started organising public or private gatherings in the city. Health officials said that contact tracing in many of the newly detected Covid-19 cases showed that the entire families were turning out to be positive after attending a social function or a private gathering.The police said the organisers also serve liquor which is ordered online through social media pages from where they get hefty discounts. However, such liquor is illegal in nature. The excise officials had written to the police in April that many people are delivering liquor at the doorstep and are supplying liquor to parties without any permits and licences. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (East), said that the state government has not allowed online selling of liquor. No vendor or shopkeeper is allowed to promote their business online or deliver liquor at doorstep. “People should not fall for any of such advertisements on the social media as many people have already been duped by scammers,” she said. The police have received 112 complaints of online selling of liquor in the last four months. The cyber police station teams are conducting investigation and have already arrested four people in two cases. Around 200 cases have been registered during the lockdown between March 25 and August 10 for illegal production, transportation and sale of liquor, and 98 people have been arrested so far. The police have asked people to provide tip-offs on group parties being organised or illicit liquor trade on police control room number -100. They can also share details on the WhatsApp number of the local station house officer (SHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-social-media-feed-helps-cops-keep-eye-on-parties/story-me9NO1tfGAdYIQMhbfhuFI.html
02-09-2020||Gurugram||IMD predicts moderate rainfall for Gurugram this week||The city might witness another spell of light to moderate rainfall, starting Thursday, said IMD officials on Tuesday. According to IMD officials, moderate rainfall on Thursday and a light rain on Friday and Saturday can be expected across Delhi and NCR. “There is a possibility of moderate rain across Delhi-NCR on Thursday. Light to very light rain can be expected on Friday and Saturday respectively,” said an IMD official. As per the weekly forecast, cloudy sky with thundershowers and lighting are expected on Wednesday. The minimum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 24.5 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature stood at 34.5 degrees Celsius — a marginal drop from Monday’s 33 degrees Celsius. Gurugram’s maximum temperature is expected to stay around 34 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, as per IMD’s weekly forecast. The minimum temperature is expected to rise by three degrees and touch 27 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, as per the forecast. Air quality in the city remained ‘good’ for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, recording 50 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was a fall from the previous day’s recording of 35 in the same category. The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s most prominent pollutant, on Tuesday was 36.25 µg/m³, as per the HSPCB’s official air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ category on Wednesday. August saw several ‘good’ air quality days. The improvement in air quality in August was attributed largely to an increase in wind speed and rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/imd-predicts-moderate-rainfall-for-gurugram-this-week/story-st9Ihv21qtT4nE6lSX5rnK.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||On Day One of JEE (Main), special arrangements at exam centres; candidates say social distancing kept||Staggered entry and exits; temperature checks; face masks and hand sanitisers at the ready; contact-less frisking; and seats placed at a distance of five to six metres from each other -- the country’s most competitive test for engineering aspirants, the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), started on Tuesday with a host of arrangements, the likes of which were never seen before.The JEE is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) to carry out admissions to various undergraduate engineering and architecture courses in institutes across the country. Around 858,000 aspirants are expected to appear for JEE (Main) between Tuesday and Sunday. “JEE was conducted smoothly all over the country (on Tuesday). I would like to thank all the state governments and officials of the NTA for the smooth conduct of the examination,” Amit Khare, secretary, higher education. The National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) -- the entrance exam for medical courses-- will be held on September 13.Candidates were given different time slots to report at the examination centres to avoid crowding. Immediately on entering the centres, candidates were asked to dispose of their face masks and were provided with new ones.Puneet Kaushal,18, a resident of Haryana’s Rewari district, appeared for the Bachelors of Architecture (BArch) exam at a centre in Vivek Vivar. He had travelled to Delhi on Sunday on a Haryana roadways bus. “After giving me a new mask, they checked my temperature and asked me to sanitise my hands. Then they checked my admit card using a barcode reading machine, to avoid contact, and told me the room number to which I had to report,” he said.“I was again made to sanitise my hands before entering the room. An official checked our admit cards but without touching them. We were made to sit on alternate seats and keep our masks on. It was a very different experience. After we finished the test, we were asked to leave the room one by one and were made to sanitise our hands before leaving the premises,” he said. Kaushal will appear in the BTech entrance exam on Wednesday.On Tuesday, only tests for BArch and Bachelor of Planning courses were conducted. A vast majority of JEE candidates will appear for exams from Wednesday onwards when BTech tests will take place. Candidates said it will be a real challenge to maintain social distancing from Wednesday when a majority of students will take the exam. Avyaya Sharma, 18, whose examination centre was in Rohini on Tuesday, said, “The social distancing norms were followed at the centre but when we came out after the test, there was a rush. The rush will be more on Wednesday when a large number of students appear for the BTech exam. Today, several students assigned to my examination room were absent.”Despite all the protocols being in place on Tuesday, students said they were apprehensive about their safety. Manvi Vats, 17, a resident of Naraina, said, “Everything went well but there was still some apprehension in our minds. The anxiety of the exam and the prevailing (Covid-19) situation made everything different. I just want to reach home as soon as possible and sanitise myself. I have another exam on Wednesday and after that, I will isolate myself for at least a week.”While the majority of students reached centres in private vehicles, some also took cabs and autos since the Delhi Metro is still not open. Shruti Mehra, 18, booked a cab to travel to her examination centre from her home at INA. “I was a little worried about taking a cab but I had no other option. The Metro is not functional and it’s unsafe to take a bus,” she said.Many parents were seen outside the examination centres wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Anshu Kakkar, whose daughter was appearing for the exam at a centre in Noida’s Sector 62, said, “Even though there is fear about the safety and security of our children, I am glad that the exams are happening finally. My daughter was under tremendous stress due to the delay.”The Supreme Court had earlier rejected the plea to postpone the entrance examinations. Six Ministers of opposition-ruled states approached the Supreme Court on Friday against its order of allowing NEET and JEE Main 2020 exams despite the increasing Covid-19 cases in the country. The plea has been filled by the ministers from West Bengal (Moloy Ghatak), Jharkhand (Rameshwar Oraon), Rajasthan (Raghu Sharma), Chhattisgarh (Amarjeet Bhagat), Punjab (B S Sidhu) and Maharashtra (Uday Ravindra Sawant).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/on-day-one-of-jee-main-special-arrangements-at-exam-centres-candidates-say-social-distancing-kept/story-MpHACagypHjPiP6N5TnR2K.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||As Delhi begins sero study, cases hit 59-day high||Delhi reported 2,312 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday — the highest in 59 days — according to the Delhi government. This is the second time in a week that the number of new cases has breached the 2,000-mark in the city. The rise in cases came on a day when the city conducted 24,198 daily tests — the second-highest tests ever recorded since August 8, when the city tested 24,592 samples. The number of cases had declined for a day in between due to fewer tests — just over 14,000 — being conducted on Sunday. On an average, Delhi conducted at least 20,691 tests per day, in the last seven days.Along with the rising number of cases, the positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested – has also been increasing over the last two weeks. Delhi has recorded a seven-day average positivity rate of 8.9%, with a one-day high of 9.9% on August 30, when 2,024 new cases had been recorded. The lowest daily positivity rate — 5.1% — was recorded on August 7. “The number of cases is on the rise across India. And, if we keep testing more people, chances are we will find more cases. With how densely populated we are and the sheer volume of our population, the absolute numbers are going to be huge. But what is encouraging is that our CFR (case fatality ratio) is close to 2%,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital. Delhi recorded 18 new deaths due to the infection on Monday, taking the total fatalities in the city to 4,462. This puts Delhi’s case fatality ratio – fraction of people who die among those who test positive — at 2.52%. Delhi’s CFR has been on a decline since June third week, when it peaked at 4.11% after the government reconciled its data adding 437 deaths in a single day. It remains higher than the national average of 1.8%. The Delhi government has started collecting blood samples for the third round of serological surveillance on Tuesday with samples of about 17,000 people collected from 272 wards in the city in over five days. The sero survey will help the government estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and determine the spread of the disease. “Unlike the last two sero-surveys, in which we ensured that samples were collected from all 11 revenue districts, this time we shall ensure that samples are collected from all 272 municipal wards in the city,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. For each municipal ward, the sample size would depend on its area, population density and existing Covid-19 caseload, among other factors, said senior health officials. The health minister said that samples from all wards will be collected between September 1 and 7 and the results will likely be shared in another 10 days. “There are several models that have estimated that the transmission of Covid-19 will slow down when about 40 to 60% of the population has had exposure. We might get to see whether Delhi has reached close to 40% in the sero-surveillance and if so the number of new cases might start coming down soon,” said Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The third survey will also ensure an adequate mix of people living in rural and urban areas and in recognised and unrecognised colonies. “The decision to collect samples ward-wise has resulted in more clarity on where the samples will be picked up from. We have been asked to ensure an adequate mix of population from rural and urban areas, and from recognised and unrecognised colonies. Also, we have to collect 25% samples from 1-17 years of age, 50% from those between the ages of 18-49, and 25% from those over the age of 50, just like the previous survey” said a senior official from south-west district. The district has to collect a total of 1,600 samples. The official said samples would not be collected from those who were covered under the two previous surveys.

02-09-2020||Delhi||MCD engineers get crash courses in new parking plans||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has started training its officials, mostly engineers, on the modalities of parking management area plans (PMAP) and how to implement them in neighbourhoods as part of the new parking policy. Under the programme, officials are being trained how to make PMAPs for different localities in a way that they meet parking requirement of those neighbourhoods.To deal with the issue of chaotic and illegal parking on roads, the Delhi government had notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019, on September 23 last year. Under the policy, municipal agencies have to make parking management plans with neighbourhood-specific solutions. The plan primarily aims at giving priority to pedestrians, cyclists, emergency vehicles and vending zones by improving availability of on-street and off-street parking in any area.According to SDMC officials, south civic body engineers will be trained on Friday while that of their north counterparts is over. Officials from east Delhi will undergo training next week.The SDMC is the nodal agency to impart the training and is helping other civic bodies in implementing the parking policy guidelines. Civic officials said the move to develop area-specific parking management plans was on hold due to Covid-19 pandemic but now they are slowly reviving the initiative.“We have now started training our engineers and other required staff to impart specific training in connection with the formulation and implementation of PMAPs. We are also training engineers of other civic bodies,” Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, remunerative project cell at SDMC, said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment said this training was part of a preparatory exercise to submit a roll-out plan before the Supreme Court for areas beyond pilot projects. “The Supreme Court, a few weeks ago, had asked civic agencies to go beyond pilot projects and give a complete roll-out plan for the city. For this, civic bodies will have to form PMAPs in large numbers and for that, they need to develop capacity within their institutions. Hence training sessions have been started,” Roychowdhury said.Lajpat Nagar-III in South Delhi, Krishna Nagar in east and Kamla Nagar in North Delhi were three localities where these rules were implemented on a pilot basis.Roychowdhury said the authorities earlier used to opt for site-specific solutions but now parking issues will have to be regularised across the city by formulating parking management plans. She said parking had always been a problem in residential colonies near markets. “Area-specific parking plans will ensure there is no spill-over from market areas and the parking space in colonies is used mainly by residents. However, the plans will also suggest a shared parking facility, which means that if a residential area is close to the market, residents can use the market parking at night,” she said.The policy also recommended that parking be allowed only in demarcated areas in residential colonies and vehicles on footpaths will be towed away. On residential streets, a lane must be earmarked for unhindered movement of emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire tenders police vehicles, etc.Similarly, for market areas, the policy recommends dynamic pricing mechanisms such as peak and non-peak fees and an exponential increase per hour to discourage on-street parking for a long duration .In June this year, vehicular movement was allowed on pedestrianised stretches in Krishna Nagar, Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar on traders’ demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi United RWA Front said, “In Krishna Nagar, people who come to shop park their vehicles in our colonies leaving no parking space for residents. The parking management plan was only implemented in the market areas while residential areas were left out. The authorities need to seriously implement the recommendations of parking policy. Half-hearted implementation will only lead to chaos.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcd-engineers-get-crash-courses-in-new-parking-plans/story-6ySLFbR7LOPjgyEyHos9xI.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||AAP protests BJP’s ‘failure’ to keep Delhi clean||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday staged demonstrations in all 70 assembly constituencies, protesting against the alleged failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations (MCDs) to keep Delhi clean, a claim the civic bodies rejected.In the central government’s 2020 cleanliness survey – the results were shared last month – the south Delhi municipal corporation was ranked 31st while the north civic body stood 43rd. The east Delhi corporation ranked 46th, the second spot from the bottom of the list.Hundreds of AAP workers joined Tuesday’s protest, gathering at 250 different spots with hoardings and banners, in adherence to social distancing norms and government guidelines, the party said in a statement.“The cleanliness survey exposes the BJP’s failure of 15 years as Delhi has been found to be the dirtiest city. The BJP-ruled municipal corporation has not only tarnished the image of PM Narendra Modi but also insulted the people of Delhi with their failure. Everywhere, people say Delhi is the dirtiest city and there are three garbage mountains, and the reason behind these is the BJP. We demand that BJP should step down. And the people of Delhi should now give AAP a chance,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of MCD affairs.The BJP rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi. The next municipal elections are likely to be held in 2022.The BJP hit back at AAP, terming Pathak’s claims as “frivolous”.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “For the past two days, Durgesh Pathak has been making frivolous claims regarding running the civic bodies better than the BJP with the existing budget. He seems unaware the MCDs are in a cash crisis because the Delhi government fails to ensure timely payment of the money it owes to the civic bodies.” “As far as their claims on lack of cleanliness are concerned, people of Delhi are proud of their municipal sanitation workers who have kept Delhi clean and safe, even risking their lives during the pandemic. By repeatedly saying that city is filthy, the Aam Aadmi Party is insulting the hard work of our city’s sanitation workers,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-protests-bjp-s-failure-to-keep-delhi-clean/story-QX7tNmVVG8WjVf3uRLrTDK.html
02-09-2020||City||August accounted for 78.6% of total fatalities in Ludhiana||With 323 deaths, August accounted for 78.6% of the total Covid-19 fatalities in Ludhiana. From 88 deaths between March 29 and July 31 (64 days), the Covid toll rose to 411 by the end of August – a spike of 21 times.Men comprised 54.7% (225) of the August fatalities, while the age worst affected was those aged above 60. The virus claimed the lives of as many as 90 men and 38 women in this age group. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga attributed the higher deaths among males to the stronger immune system of females. “Women’s immunity has generally more resistance to the virus,” he said. On six occasions, the district reported 10 deaths in a single day and 15 casualties thrice. On August 29 and 31, Ludhiana witnessed record 17 and 18 Covid fatalities, while six days saw nine deaths. Besides 323 deaths, the cases also surged massively from 3,246 on July 31 to 10,222 on August 31 – a rise of 31 times.The fatality rate spiralled majorly only after the curfew restrictions were lifted on June 8. Before June 8, 11 people had died since March 29 (70 days).March had recorded one death, followed by three in April and five in May. As the borders reopened and curfew restrictions were eased in June, allowing public to venture out and businesses to reopen, the Covid positive cases shot up and fatalities rose to 12 in a month. The situation worsened in July that saw 67 deaths.Dr Bagga said lockdown was not the absolute remedy and the best preventions against Covid-19 were social distancing, washing hands and wearing mask in public.“Residents should rush to the hospital and get tested if they notice any symptoms or come in contact with a positive person. Early detection is vital. Several residents are just consulting their family doctors and taking medicine by hidings their symptoms,” Dr Bagga said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/august-accounted-for-78-6-of-total-fatalities-in-ludhiana/story-aA9bkEYKlxt1yzpZu9Vw1K.html
02-09-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal writes to PM Modi, asks for ‘viable’ GST borrowing option||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to consider a “viable” alternative to the two borrowing options provided to the states by the Union government on August 27 to meet the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) revenue shortfall, which, according to the CM, would “put an extremely onerous burden on the states”.The chief minister’s office (CMO) issued a statement on Tuesday in which it mentioned the letter written to the PM on the same day. In the letter, in which Kejriwal suggested that the GST Council should consider authorising the Centre to borrow on its behalf – for the purpose of compensating states – and extend the period of collection of cess beyond 2022.The Union finance ministry declined to comment on the matter.The GST law assures states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years from July 1, 2017, and also guarantee them that their revenue shortfall, if any, will be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury products and sin goods such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal, and tobacco products.While the GST cess and revenue collections have plunged since April 2020 because of a 68-day hard nationwide lockdown that led to almost halting all business activities, the problem of states not getting the dues promised to them goes back to October 2019. However, in July 2020, the Central government released more than Rs 1.65 lakh crore as GST compensation due to states for the financial year 2019-20.On August 27, at the 41st meeting of the GST Council, the Union finance ministry offered the states two options to plug a shortfall in their revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the financial year that ends in March 2021.In the first option, states can borrow Rs 97,000 crore at reasonable interest rates from a special window that will be opened in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Both the principal and the interest payments under this option will come from cess collections. Under the second option, the states can borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore, but will have to bear the interest cost. The Centre has defined losses arising from the implementation of GST at Rs 97,000 crore and the balance as losses arising from an Act of God (Covid-19).“Following a deliberation on the options given by the central government to the states at the GST Council meet, CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday wrote a letter to the Prime Minister stating that the two options that are given by the Union ministry of finance, which require the states to borrow loans and then meet the repayment liabilities will put an onerous burden on the states. Appealing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider a legally viable option to tide over the Covid-19 economic crisis, the chief minister said that the GST Council should consider authorizing the Centre to borrow on its behalf and extend the period of collection of cess beyond 2022,” said the statement issued by the Delhi CMO.“Terming the GST reform as the landmark reform in the indirect tax structure of India, the chief minister in the letter stated that the assurance of the GST compensation to states to meet the shortfall in GST collections is one of the pillars on which the entire GST edifice rests,” the statement added.“To create an artificial distinction between loss occurring due to the implementation of the GST and those occurring due to Covid-19 pandemic goes against the very spirit of the Compensation Act (2017) and will lead to a creation of a trust deficit between the Centre and the states, wherein in future, the states will be hesitant in coming together to achieve more such larger common national goals, as was done through the implementation of GST,” the letter added.Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said that states have a legit point in this case. “The central government owes money to states- money that was promised to them to make them agree to the GST system in the first place. Now they are being told the Centre will not repay and they must borrow on their own… It is a clear contract violation. Also, since the central government can borrow money on much easier terms and at lower interest rates, it makes much more sense for the Centre to borrow in order to pay the states their GST dues.”She further said, “States are in bad fiscal shape. They gave up their revenue raising powers with the implementation of the GST in return of assurances of compensation from the central government. Now the pandemic has made things much worse. Most states got hardly financial assistance from the central government and had to take on the entire financial burden of covid management — from healthcare to providing food and shelter to those in need. Revenues have dropped and most states are now finding it difficult to pay salaries. How can they take the burden of more loans at this juncture? How will they eventually repay?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-for-viable-gst-borrowing-option/story-Rxa7N1QAIugXaSPQUruJgN.html

02-09-2020||Pune||Covid-19 lockdown cost Maharashtra state Rs 16 crore per day in stamp duty||The Inspector General of Registrations and Controller of Stamps Office has reported a significant drop in documents registration and earnings due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, thereof.The Pune District Conveyancing Association claimed that due to the lockdown, the state was losing revenues estimated to be worth Rs 16 crore daily by way of stamp duty. Besides, it was losing Rs 2 crore which comes through registration, the organisation pointed out.According to data released by the Inspector General of Registrations (IGR) the office recorded a registration of four lakh-plus (4,13,843) documents from April to August 2020, as compared to 12 lakh-plus (12,95,062) registrations during the same period in 2019.Earning stood at Rs 2,067 crore as compared to Rs 9,382 crore last year during the same period.The categories of documents registered are conveyance, agreements, gift, mortgage deeds and power of attorney documents. The official data shows that there has been a nearly 70 per cent dip in property registrations and revenue earnings for the IGR department during the last six months.The top five articles registered comprised conveyance, leave and license (e-registration), mortgage, gift, power of attorney and other categories.Suhas Merchant, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), Pune chapter, “The property market faced business losses in the last six months, but I see the demand rising from here on. Because of the stamp duty concession, smaller flats are in demand.”“We see to it that developers complete the project on time. If there are complaints of buyers, we ensure that they are solved. The effects of restarting of the property market are likely to be seen from next month,” he said.“With more new schemes we are confident that the property market will rebound. Money has slowly started flowing in the property market and there are a lot of inquiries for small-sized flats. It will take more than a month for things to settle down,” he said.The Pune District Conveyancing Association (PDCA) in April had urged the IGR office to resume property registration after undertaking necessary precautions like wearing safety gear and maintaining the district collector specified safety guidelines.Balasaheb Thorat, state revenue minister, had ordered the reopening of all the IGR offices in the state post-May 17 and ordered that proper social distancing norms and safety guidelines were followed.Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur IGR offices witness a maximum number of property registrations and the IGR department is the maximum revenue generator for the state.Meanwhile, the state government has also stayed the ready reckoner review rate for six months taking into account the deteriorating Covid-19 situation and rise of Covid patients in the state. The RR rates are published as part of state policy on March 31 every year.Thorat has said that it would be practically not possible to review and assess the ready reckoner rates and the situation improves in the state of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-lockdown-cost-state-rs-16-crore-per-day-in-stamp-duty/story-JH0kSAaSwZVJeswjUegB7H.html

02-09-2020||Patna||Nitish busy launching schemes with eye on rural Bihar as poll announcement nears||With the date for announcement of assembly election drawing closer, Bihar chief minister is a busy man, inaugurating new development schemes, launching completed ones and making on-the-spot visits to review progress of ongoing flagship schemes at great speed.In the last three weeks alone, Kumar has inaugurated or launched schemes and projects worth Rs 60,000-crore involving departments of rural development, power, water resources, education, environment, road and the flagship ‘seven resolves’ to present his government’s development-face before the elections. The schemes cover the length and breadth of the state. Many of these schemes were in the pipeline for long, viz upgrading schools in 3,304 panchayats of the state up to class 9 to ensure presence of a secondary school in every panchayat, so that girls do not drop out after primary schooling due to lack of avenues. With Bihar achieving gender parity at the secondary level, the government has used it to silence the critics in the Opposition, which have been consistently claiming that the state had slipped on the front of education.The CM has already announced that after having ensured electricity connection to every village, his next target is to bring water to every farm, should the people give him another chance to serve on the basis of what his government has done to realise the dream of inclusive development.Also Read: BJP chief Nadda preps for Bihar assembly polls, asks MPs to reach out to votersBihar is an agrarian state with over 80% living in rural areas dependent on agriculture for livelihood. Kumar has also been asking to take the development message to the masses, especially the new generation voters, who might not be aware of “how far and from where the state has marched”, in an apparent bid to counter the Opposition narrative aimed to capitalise on any possible anti-incumbency against him.Last week, Kumar made another developmental promise to the people of the state—road connectivity linking every village to the nearby national and state highways.“In my next innings, I will provide good connectivity to every village,” he added.Also Read: Take voter base into account, avoid faulty tickets, says Rashtriya Janata Dal to alliesThe focus of Nitish government has clearly been on rural areas and small towns, which is where most of his schemes and projects are located.The projects inaugurated or launched this month include schemes worth Rs 15,192 crore by the rural works department, Rs 4,855 crore related to electricity department, Rs 180 crore worth projects by dairy and animal husbandry department, Rs 5,024 crore worth road and bridge projects, Rs 1,725 crore by the building construction department, Rs 1469 crore by the water resource department, Rs 628 crore by the minor water resources department and inauguration of two arms of flyover in Patna and the building of the Bihar Agriculture University (Sabour).At all the functions, Kumar does not forget reminding people that they should not lose sight of the development done by his government at the time of elections, “as his government’s sole objective has been to reduce the urban-rural divide by taking development to the remotest corners of the state, which the people have seen with electricity reaching every part of the state to end the need for lantern (RJD election symbol) and the smooth connectivity provided from all the districts to the state capital”.Also Read: Bihar increases salaries of teachers, librarians by 15% from April next yearOn Friday, he inaugurated projects involving piped-drinking water and pucca lanes and drainage systems in rural areas across the state, worth Rs 33,716 crore. These were part of the Bihar government’s ‘seven resolves’, a set of seven promises made during the 2015 election to ensure basic amenities to every household. He has also emphasised the need to complete the first phase of the coveted Ganga Water Lift Scheme (GWLS) for the supply of clean drinking water in towns of Gaya, Bodhgaya and Rajgir.WRD minister Sanjay Jha said though the completion of the project involving Rs 2,800 crore would stretch up to mid 2021 due to the lockdown, it would solve a perennial problem and conceiving it was, in itself, a big task.“Bihar’s development journey since 2005 is not about drawing any contrast with the previous regime prior to 2005. That is meaningless. It is what the people have experienced over the years to see change in their life in the remotest corners of the state and now rightfully have aspirations for more. Earlier, they could not even aspire,” said Bihar public relations minister and JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar.He added that Nitish Kumar was brought to power by people’s yearning for development.“This is what has brought Nitish Kumar people’s trust and this will again show the mirror to the opposition, which is harping on an empty rhetoric,” Neeraj Kumar added.Congress MLC Premchandra Mishra, however, said that Nitish Kumar seemed to be in an unusual hurry.“If he has really done so much for development, how has so much remained to be done? He seems to be in a hurry to get his name inscribed on stones when election announcement is round the corner and Bihar is battling the twin scourge of Covid-19 pandemic and the floods. Besides, he also wants to send the message that he is working for development, as his model is under question and the people know a lot more with their experience,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-busy-launching-schemes-with-eye-on-rural-bihar-as-poll-announcement-nears/story-xDgkMAmVIX7eOBvuaMjxsL.html

The meeting with MPs is considered to be very important as their feedback will also be used in seat-sharing for National Democratic Alliance (NDA),” sources said.The sources further said that Nadda will start his Bihar tour if lockdown is lifted in the state.National General Secretary Bhupender Yadav was appointed as party’s state in-charge in December last year.Earlier on August 23, Nadda addressed Bihar BJP State working committee via video conferencing and said that BJP, and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) will fight elections together under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and win the upcoming Assembly elections in Bihar.“BJP, JDU, and LJP will fight elections together and win. We have to add value not only to BJP but to our alliance partners also,” Nadda had said addressing Bihar BJP State Karyasamiti via video conferencing.The party, aiming to retain power in the state, has asked former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to go visit the election-bound state. Earlier, Fadnavis said that he will be visiting Bihar to help the party in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.”BJP usually sends its leaders to various states to help the party in elections and accordingly I will be going to Bihar, whatever party instructs I will do it,” he said.On the impact of Sushant Singh Rajput death case on elections, Fadnavis said, “I do not find any relevance of it anywhere with the actor’s death case.”Bihar has 243 Assembly constituencies and elections in the state are due in October-November as the tenure of the current Assembly is scheduled to end on November 29.The Election Commission has not yet taken a final call on poll dates in Bihar due to coronavirus pandemic and has sought suggestions from political parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/jp-nadda-to-chair-meeting-of-bihar-bjp-mps-senior-leaders-to-finalise-assembly-poll-strategy/story-x5kPvtBQhGuADK3OsEoRLK.html
02-09-2020||Patna||NDA to have a common manifesto for Bihar polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has indicated that there would not be a separate manifesto released by the party for the upcoming Bihar polls, which are slated to be held in October–November, following its assertion that the party would go the election under the leadership of the incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar.The BJP is an ally of Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in the Bihar government, under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre.Also read: BJP banks on development, Nitish to win Bihar pollsAccording to people aware of the details there will be a common election manifesto released by the allies, the BJP, the JD (U) and the LJP.A senior party leader aware of the developments said the party has made it clear that there are no differences of opinion among the allies and that the elections would be fought together under the leadership of Kumar. “So, a question of separate manifestoes does not arise,” the leader said.Responding to LJP president Chirag Paswan’s demand for a common minimum programme (CMP), the leader said it was “not on the agenda as of now”.In an interview to HT last week, Paswan had not only criticised the JD(U) for not fulfilling the promises that were made to the people of Bihar, but had also stressed that going forward, if the allies are to contest polls together and seek a second term in office, it would have to take on board suggestions of his party that would be part of his vision document. Paswan had also said that he would release the vision document within 24 hours of the Election Commission of India (ECI) announcing the poll schedule.The BJP leader quoted above said these issues would be sorted once all the allies hold talks. He also ruled out that there is a possibility of the LJP walking away from the NDA ahead of the elections. After Paswan‘s frequent outbursts against the ruling alliance in the state and criticism of CM Kumar, the BJP leadership has been unequivocal in projecting a united front.Addressing the state unit of the party on Sunday, BJP president JP Nadda said the party workers at every booth have the responsibility of ensuring the victory of party candidates as well as those of its allies in the poll-bound state.He also said that whenever the BJP, the LJP and the JD (U) have come together to contest, they have swept the polls in Bihar.On the issue of distribution of tickets, while the LJP has suggested that the exercise be conducted taking into account the performance of the parties in last year’s parliamentary elections, functionaries in both the BJP and the JD(U) suggested that winnability of a candidate would be the overarching consideration.A JD (U) leader from Bihar said that in the last assembly election the LJP had won only two of the 42 seats that it had contested and the party is not in a position to bargain for more.The BJP leader quoted above said discussions on seat and ticket distribution are yet to begin and the concerns of all the allies would be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nda-to-have-a-common-manifesto-for-bihar-polls/story-cWkXh4xs3crEsdsuJWp5KI.html
