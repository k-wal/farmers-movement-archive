Senior HSVP officials from Gurugram, who were in Chandigarh on Wednesday, said the matter was discussed in detail and it was decided that part of the land that is litigation-free would be handed over to National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is developing the regional rapid rail transport (RRTS) corridor. The remaining land, which is around 107 acres, is still in arbitration as the previous allottee had raised some objections. A decision in this regard will be taken later, officials said. According to the RRTS project plan, NCRTC requires 182 acres of land at Dharuhera to build a maintenance and logistics depot for the 106-km corridor connecting Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan. The Dharuhera depot will be a crucial facility, as it will serve both as an operational and maintenance centre. Geotechnical testing for the project is already under way. This depot will also be used in future for freight services, and for cargo and logistics operations, the detailed project report says.Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram, said after a detailed discussion with officials on Wednesday, it was decided that a part of the land, which is free of legal encumbrance, should be handed over to NCRTC. “It was decided that the estate officer would write to the agency and initiate the process of handing over this land for the construction of a rail depot. The remaining land is still in arbitrage and a decision would be taken later,” he said. The corridor will be elevated for about 71km (11 stations). The remaining 35km (five stations) will be constructed underground, mostly in Delhi and Gurugram. RRTS stations in Gurugram will be located at Udyog Vihar, Sector 17, Rajiv Chowk, Kherki Daula, Manesar, Panchgaon, Dharuhera, MBIR, Rewari and Bawal. Sudhir Sharma, spokesperson, NCRTC, said a rail depot at Dharuhera is crucial for the network. “The decision to transfer land is a very positive development as Dharuhera is located in the middle of the corridor and the entire system that will serve large industrial and population clusters in three states will be operated from this depot. The maintenance of trains, rescue operations and other related matters will be centred at this depot,” said Sharma. Asked about the proposal to align the rapid rail station at Kherki Daula with the proposed interstate bus terminal being developed by th Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Sharma said the RRTS project is based on the concept of integrating multi-modal transport systems wherever these have been designed. “We are doing this in all other corridors and efforts would be made to integrate this corridor with the bus stand,” he said. The RRTS project starts from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and will pass through Aerocity from where it will enter Gurugram along the Old Delhi Road on an elevated track. It will move along this road and take a left from Atul Kataria Chowk towards Signature Tower, then right towards Rajiv Chowk and onwards to Kherki Daula, Manesar, Dharuhera, Rewari and Bawal and terminate at SNB (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror), the project report says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hsvp-to-soon-hand-over-75-acres-land-for-rapid-rail-depot-at-dharuhera/story-9atvP9mvvLVN8b2WdrkAzO.html

Gautam said the police manhandled and used caste slurs against AAP MLA Ajay Dutt at Safdarjung hospital when they had gone to provide help to the family of the rape victim.“AIIMS, which proactively gives admission to the politicians and other influential people, denied admission to the survivor. She was admitted to Safdarjung hospital and on Tuesday, she lost her life. While waiting outside Safdarjung hospital, we suddenly found a car without a number plate at the spot. This car was there to carry the dead body of the survivor,” Gautam said. “Objecting to this act, Ajay Dutt intervened and questioned the police. Thereafter, the DCP manhandled Dutt who is an elected representative from Delhi. If the attitude of the police is such towards the elected representatives of Delhi, then we can imagine what it could be with the common people,” he said. The party requested home minister Amit Shah and the police commissioner to suspend the DCP, ACP and SHO in this case with immediate effect and said the CBI should investigate the entire case.Speaking on the allegations, Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal said, “The site of protest was a hospital where no sloganeering is permitted as it disturbs patients. Moreover, ambulances move off and on bringing patients. Protesters were time and again reminded to maintain order so that patients are not disturbed. They were repeatedly advised to wear masks and maintain social distancing in the interest of their safety and safety of others and also not to crowd the area particularly the passage for ambulances.” “...It is quite possible some persons may not have followed the advice of police and entered into an argument. No pushing or physical force was used. Announcements were made on public address systems to maintain social distancing. No other group present at the site of protest has complained of any manhandling. As soon as the family of the deceased departed,the protestors dispersed on their own. No use of force was resorted to against anyone,” Singhal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-demands-cbi-probe-in-hathras-case-firs-against-delhi-cops-over-assault-on-mla/story-Ja6nTB69ybOCAelcu7CDCO.html

30-09-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad in September: ILI/SARI symptoms, random testing had highest share in positive Covid-19 cases||According to Ghaziabad district health officials, 98% of fresh Covid-19 cases in September were of those who had symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), or were contacts of positive patients, or those who randomly arrived for testing. The other categories -- domestic travellers, health care workers, suspected field activities, pre-surgical activities, among others-- formed less than 2% of the 5,416 fresh cases in September, which increased by 53% over August.Of the 5,416 fresh cases, 2404 were those who tested positive after they were symptoms of ILI/SARI and detected. In August this was around 1,700. Likewise, about 2,314 persons who were tested at different testing booths turned positive in September compared to 1,309 in the previous month, and 595 were contacts of positive patients, compared to 413 in August. “The increase in number of Covid-19 cases has been due to our strategy of early detection and increased testing. For early detection we have been focussing on surveillance in which teams are tracing people having ILI/SARI symptoms and getting them tested. Likewise, the number of testing locations, 20, has been witnessing more incoming of people who are willing to take up testing,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Since the use of rapid antigen kits is increasing and takes less time, more people are coming to the centres to get themselves tested. We are also focussing on speedy tracing of contacts of positive patients and our contact tracing is bout 98% at present. This has also yielded results and we have been able to find more positive cases. The idea is for early detection, testing and referral to Covid facilities so that treatment can start immediately,” he added. “During the surveillance and household surveys, the teams are focussing on people having symptoms of ILI/SARI as these are Covid-like symptoms. Further, the home isolation facility has also helped people as they can stay in comfort of their homes and get treatment. So, people are more willing to come out and get themselves tested. This is why we have also increased our testing which is about 5000 in past two days,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. According to the official records, the Ghaziabad district for the first time collected more than 5000 samples, 5124, on September 28 and collected 5802 samples on September 29. The officials have also been directed to take up the total testing per day to minimum of 6000 per day. The overall testing in the district till September 29 stood at 304810 which includes 180995 tests done through the use of rapid antigen kits.Dr Gyan Bharti, senior pulmonologist from Columbia Asia Hospital at Ghaziabad said during the months of August and September there has been increase in cases having symptoms of ILI and SARI. “Since the symptoms are Covid-like, there is narrowed approach to prioritize test of people having ILI/SARI symptoms and many of these have tested positive. With opening of activities after lockdown, people who wish to go to offices and undertake travel also need tests. So, there is increase in number of people who are getting themselves tested at the centres. Since there is spread of infection, those walking in randomly are also turning positive although majority are asymptomatic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-in-september-ili-sari-symptoms-random-testing-had-highest-share-in-positive-covid-19-cases/story-qRIMqnPrYbmnQ4HiFVEjBK.html
30-09-2020||Noida||UP government scraps hotel isolation facility||After a lacklustre response and the popularity of home isolation for asymptomatic patients, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday scrapped the option of semi-paid isolation facilities at hotels for those who contracted Covid-19.  In Ghaziabad, about 34 hotels with 1,090 rooms had shown keen interest in the semi-paid hotel isolation scheme introduced on July 17, but backed out after home isolation was allowed three days later. Since then, only two hotels in Bajaria remained open. “In all we have about 106 patients who are in semi-paid facilities. They can complete the period of isolation, but the district officials have been directed that henceforth no new patients will be allowed. Since the response of the home isolation scheme is encouraging, the scheme of semi-paid facility in hotels has been discontinued,” said UP additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad. “New patients will be either admitted to home isolation or to government Covid facility.” In Ghaziabad, the two hotels in Bajaria had no patient. “No patient opted for hotel isolation scheme in Ghaziabad in view of the home isolation scheme. They found it more convenient to stay comfortably at home. The two hotels in Bajaria were instead used as paid quarantine facility for people who arrived from foreign countries under the ‘Vande Bharat’ scheme and also completed their quarantine period,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Under the hotel isolation, asymptomatic patients were allowed to stay in hotels with daily rental of ₹2000 on double occupancy and ₹1500 on single occupancy. According to the official records, the home isolation was permitted to 4,043 asymptomatic patients in Ghaziabad alone. Of these, till September 29, 3,216 already completed their term of 10 days isolation, while 827 are still active. Overall in UP, there are 50883 active cases according to the state control room figures of September 30, and 24,026 of these are in home isolation, besides 3727 in paid private hospitals and 106 in semi-paid hotel isolation.

In such a case we were asked about our preparedness and availability of infrastructure for storage. We gave our inputs saying that we have a central vaccine storage unit at MMG Hospital and 27 other storage units where our vaccines for other diseases are stored,” said Dr. NK Gupta, Ghaziabad, chief medical officer. “So, we will need to develop storage infrastructure for Covid-19 as it will be administered twice in a gap of one month. We also told that we will need to identify people aged over 50 years and more teams will be needed to be formed for the purpose. Dr Paul said that more meetings will be held in future date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-government-scraps-hotel-isolation-facility/story-CLDkDcPmwVlybnIUxOFSmN.html

The anti-land mafia task force, in its report, has mentioned that these people have allegedly encroached or grabbed 25.257 hectares of land in different areas of the district. District magistrate Suhas LY said that the names of these mafias will soon be uploaded on the ‘Anti-Bhoo Mafia’ (anti-land mafia) portal, which was set up by the chief minister in 2017 to identify people and companies that illegally acquire land. “These criminals have either sold out government or private land belonging to some other persons, or they have carved out colonies and sold it to unaware persons,” he said.He added that most of them are accused in a number of cases related to non-cognizable offences. “While the Gangsters’ Act is already lodged against Kavindra Bhati, Mukesh Kumar, Omi (single name) and Dheeraj (single name), all of whom are members of the notorious Sunder Bhati gang operating in the district, Shailesh Kumar is the main accused in five criminal cases registered at Ecotech police station,” he said. Suhas further said that very soon, more unauthorised properties of land mafias in the district will be pulled down. “While some of them have been found to have made unauthorised constructions in flood plain areas, a few of them have even encroached upon public and government land. The structures erected by these culprits will soon be demolished. In the next meeting in this connection, the action taken report will be analysed. Revenue officials of the areas concerned have been asked to inform the matter to their respective police stations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/admin-identifies-15-as-land-mafia-directs-for-firs-against-them/story-8SuyQJUjGxM4buD1HpxBHN.html

In case of non-packaged/loose sweets, the container/tray holding the same should display the best-before date of the product mandatorily with effect from October 1, 2020, Sharma said, adding that the seller in this case may also mark the date of manufacturing, but that shall be voluntary and non-binding.The health officer said the confectioners shall decide and display the best-before date of sweets depending upon the nature of the product and the local conditions. An indicative list of shelf life of various types of sweets is given in the guidance note on safety of traditional milk products which is available on the FSSAI website.Sharma said the purpose of displaying the said information is to protect the health of consumers as they would be able to know whether the sweets they are buying are expired or up to what date they are edible. He asked the people to prefer pure food items and ask shopkeepers to pay special attention to cleanliness.The new norms are not meant to harass shopkeepers, but to ensure that clean and quality food items are made available to the people, he said while seeking their cooperation in implementing the new guidelines for a healthy society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/best-before-date-must-for-loose-sweets-from-today-mohali-admn/story-Spo78OJuZhfSGBvm99qs5M.html
30-09-2020||Noida||To control pollution in Ghaziabad, DME, RRTS sites to be monitored for dust emission||Ghaziabad: The two major transport infrastructure projects in Ghaziabad – the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) and the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) – are to be brought under the eye of the district administration, who will ensure that there is no dust emission at the sites of the respective projects, failing which heavy environment compensation costs will be levied. The decision came after Bhure Lal, the chairperson of the Environment (Pollution and Control) Authority (EPCA), held a review meeting with Ghaziabad officials on Wednesday, wherein he scrutinised the status of several pollution hot spot areas which were indicated during his visit to the district September 19. “The EPCA chairperson has directed special attention to DME; it is to be ensured that there is no dust emission. We have also directed the state pollution board officials to keep tabs on under-construction activities at RRTS site as they are also likely to have dust emissions,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. Presently, the 19.2km phase two and 32km phase four of DME are under construction from UP-Gate to Dasna, and Dasna to Meerut, respectively. On the recommendation of Lal, the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) officials said that they had levied a penalty of Rs 5 lakh against the National Highways Authority of India and have also imposed Rs 50,000 penalty against the RRTS project, which had been reported by HT.“The two penalties were levied for dust emission at sites of DME and RRTS projects. An additional penalty of Rs 50,000 was also imposed against NHAI for violation of construction and demolition norms. Overall, we have imposed a total penalty of Rs 1,50,000 in 13 instances, which includes penalty for different violations,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB. “As a result of the DME project, there is dust emission and it directly affects our two monitoring stations at Indirapuram and Vasundhara. Likewise, RRTS construction also affects air quality, and monitoring stations at Vasundhara and Sanjay Nagar are affected,” he added. Officials of the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC), the agency which is taking up the RRTS project, said that they will be directing their contractors to be more vigilant when it comes to pollution abatement measures. “The contractors are already using water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to tackle dust emissions at the sites. We will ask them to be more careful as NCRTC has always maintained high standards when it comes to managing construction sites,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief PRO of NCRTC. At present, NCRTC is taking up construction of the 17km priority stretch, from Sahibabad to Duhai, and another 33km, from Duhai to Shatabdipuram in Meerut, for RRTS. NHAI said it has deployed 18 water tankers and three anti-smog guns at their construction sites. “We are ensuring that there are no dust emissions at the sites and contractors have also been asked to be more careful during construction activities in wake of the approaching winter season,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. Apart from special focus on the two major projects, the EPCA chairperson appreciated cleaning activities which were taken up outside the Sahibabad vegetable market by agencies. “The issue of dumping of solid waste and garbage at Bulandshahr Road Industrial Area is almost resolved and we will take up heavy plantation at the site. Further, all respective agencies taking up other projects in the city have been asked to inform their contractors to take precautions, otherwise their contracts will be cancelled,” the DM said. During the review, Lal also directed Ghaziabad officials to take up pending works within one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/to-control-pollution-in-ghaziabad-dme-rrts-sites-to-be-monitored-for-dust-emission/story-tMYW1YaHYhnfPdsmINDdUO.html

The suspect, Ravi Singh, hails from Etah district and lives in Greater Noida, police said. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said they detained him after receiving an alert about a suspicious looking person moving about near City Park in Beta 2 on Wednesday. “A police team reached the spot and found the person sitting under a tree. He was chatting with people using multiple mobile phones. The police apprehended him and recovered five mobile phones, 25 SIM cards, nine fake IDs, six debit cards and a fiction novel – World’s Best Boyfriend – from his possession.”Police said the suspect was later brought to Sector Beta 2 police station for questioning. The police sifted through his bag and found a diary that contained the phone numbers of over 50 women. “The names against these phone numbers were written in codes that only he understood. During questioning, he told us that he has been conning women since the past two years,” Pandey said. “He claimed to be a graduate. He said the novel helped him in understanding what women would like in a friendship/relationship. He had subsequently memorised certain dialogues from the book and used them to ensnare women he met on social media. Singh used to call these women to a meeting place and seek money or sex from them. He also blackmailed them by threatening to make their chats and photos/videos public,” Pandey said. Police also recovered a gold chain and a branded wristwatch from his possession. Sujit Upadhyaya, SHO, Beta 2 police station, said the suspect blackmailed some women into giving him their credit and debit card number and used the same for online shopping. “A scan of his mobile phone shows that he has cheated and blackmailed over 100 women for money or sex,” he said. Police said the suspect had no FIR registered against him in the past even though he was involved in this criminal activity for over two years.Pandey said subsequently an FIR was registered against him under Section 420 (cheating), Section 467 (forgery of valuable security), Section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), Section 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine) and Section 67 of the IT Act, 2008.

His mother and he had gone to Bhanota village, 10 kms away, last week.Sewaram, the victim’s grandfather, said, “The child had gone missing while playing in the afternoon. We launched a search but failed to trace him. We then informed police at 1:30pm about the incident.”Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that a team from Surajpur police station reached the spot and launched a search for the child. “The police team searched the house and the neighbourhood but could not find the child. Police the registered a case on the grandfather’s complaint against unknown persons under Section 363 (abduction) of the Indian penal code (IPC),” he said. Chander said that at around 9:30pm, someone informed the police that the boy was found inside a steel trunk on the first floor of the same two-storey house. “The police swiftly reached the spot and found the boy wrapped in a cloth inside the box in his maternal uncle’s room,” he said. Bhavyansh was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. “Prima facie, it is unlikely that the boy himself fell in the box. The fact that he was wrapped in a cloth also casts suspicion. We have questioned the family members and we suspect role of some insiders in the crime,” Chander said. Pradeep Tripathi, SHO Surajpur police station said that the boy had no visible injury on his face or body. “The post-mortem report revealed that the body died due to suffocation. We are interrogating the child’s two maternal uncles – Amit and Sumit – in this case. We will take actions based on evidence,” he said. No one was arrested till the filing of this report. Amit was the first to find the body, police said.The child’s maternal uncles refused to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-3-year-old-boy-found-dead-inside-steel-trunk-at-relative-s-home/story-KfbE3SODgpYo50RKr6nWyH.html

The adoption of paddy straw management practices enhances soil health as well as crop productivity, he said. Dr Gupta also suggested making judicious use of fertilizers in wheat.Dr Manpreet Singh, scientist, Farm Machinery and Power Engineering, appealed farmers not to indulge in stubble burning and instead use different machines, such as PAU super straw management system (SMS), happy seeder, super seeder, rotavator, baler, mouldboard plough, etc. for its management. He also discussed the economics of the machinery.Kulbir Singh, principal olericulturist, spoke about the household kitchen garden model and explained the agronomic practices to be adopted for the successful cultivation of onion and pea.

30-09-2020||City||Ludhiana administration appoints nodal officers to check farm fires||To prevent crop residue burning during Kharif season especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the district administration has appointed nodal officers for paddy growing villages where stubble was being traditionally put to fire.Seeking support and cooperation from farmers, Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma on Wednesday, appealed them to refrain from burning paddy straw especially amid the pandemic, which can further lead to serious implications in aggravating the health issues of those who are already suffering from several diseases. The DC said that the state government has decided that there is a need to pull out all stops and fully involve administrative machinery for “on the ground’ activities at the village-level. Therefore, nodal officers have been appointed for each village where the paddy is grown and its stubble is being burnt.Sharma also mentioned that these nodal officers would perform their duties in the concerned villages to control stubble burning during the harvesting period till November 15. The staff of municipal cooperation, revenue, rural development and panchayats, agriculture, horticulture and soil conservation departments and Punjab Pollution Control Board besides guardians of governance would closely coordinate to further intensify efforts to stamp out the unhealthy practice of stubble burning in the state.Sharma added that these officers have been assigned the task to ensure that harvester combines operate in the villages only with the super SMS system properly installed on them. They will also prepare the list of owners who have given their land on rent and then inform each landowner to ensure that no paddy straw is burnt on their land, otherwise, the red entry shall be made in the land record.These officers will also identify those farmers who are likely to put fire to the paddy residue and to convince them by the way of one to one contact. They would also get to know the farmers who have burnt the residue and ask the revenue patwari of the village to make a relevant entry in revenue records as per separate instructions issued by the department.Apart from these steps, the nodal officers will create awareness in villages by way of holding meetings with farmers, to help arrange CRM machines in the village, to distribute pamphlets/leaflets, etc, to make announcements in gurdwaras or by other modes, to interact with village schools for awareness lectures to students so that these students can further create awareness among their parents.The DC said that various sites have been identified/ earmarked in the district for collection of residues in common lands/cattle ponds and gaushalas, where farmers or any entrepreneur will be able to store paddy straw. This stored basmati residue can be transported to places where they can be used as cattle fodder. Notably, the paddy has been grown in 27 lakh hectares of land in the state which includes cultivation of basmati on seven lakh hectares and paddy residue of 16.50 million tons shall be produced out of paddy crop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-administration-appoints-nodal-officers-to-check-farm-fires/story-encvKrzdPIfAvF8IiQF4BJ.html
30-09-2020||Pune||Local trains to resume operations in Pune region||According to the latest Unlock 5.0 guidelines issued by the state government on Wednesday, local trains have been allowed to resume operations in Pune region. Since the countrywide lockdown began on March 23, all the train operations in the Pune railway division had stopped operations. Now, almost after six months the local trains are resuming service in Pune which is a major transport mode for working people between Pune and Lonavla. The Unlock 5.0 guidelines stated, “Local trains in Pune region to be resumed as per the protocols and procedure followed in MMR region. The commissioner of police, Pune, will be the nodal officer to coordinate for the same.” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta, said, “We will have to get it clarified. I will discuss it with stakeholders; railways, public demand, and health officials. I think it maybe about deciding the frequency, working and timings.” Currently, there are eight local trains running between Pune and Lonavla in 42 schedules. In these schedules, 21 are from Pune to Lonavla and 21 are from Lonavla to Pune starting from 5 am to midnight. Daily 30,000 passengers, including students and officer-goers, used the route. Pune divisional railway manager Renu Sharma said, “We have got the notification and according to it, the Pune police commissioner is the nodal officer for starting the local trains, so we will have a meeting with him tomorrow (Thursday). Also, I will have a meeting with our senior officials about starting of the local train operations. We will ensure the safety and security of passengers while starting the train operation on the Pune -Lonavla route. It will be decided later whether we want to start the train operations phase-wise or all together.” Regular passengers on this route have welcomed this decision, Vasudha Kulkarni, an office-goer, said, “I live in Chinchwad and my office in Pune at JM road, earlier we used to daily travel by local trains, but now it had been difficult to travel to my office as local trains were not operating. So, I used to travel via PMPML buses but it would take a lot of time. We are happy that local trains are restarting now for public keeping all the safety precautions in mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/local-trains-to-start-back-in-pune-region/story-KPnci2L14B2QzwX1WTmSGK.html
30-09-2020||Noida||From one lab that tested 100 samples, we crossed the 1-crore Covid-19 test landmark: UP additional chief secretary||On Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh crossed 10-million Covid-19 tests, a first in the country. State additional chief secretary for health Amit Mohan Prasad spoke about the initial hurdles in containing the pandemic and the way forward. Excerpts: What was the state’s plan of action when the Covid-19 outbreak started? Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state of the country with a very high population density. We were aware, right from the beginning, that we cannot let the epidemic grow unchecked in such a vast state. Test, track and treat has been the strategy of choice. The Chief Minister took the reins from the beginning and has been chairing a Covid-19 review meeting with all the senior officers of the state continuously for the last six months. This has kept the motivation level of the workforce high. The focus has been on expanding the capacity of the state to track the suspected and susceptible population early, test them quickly and treat wherever necessary. As a result of the continuous efforts of doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and personnel from other departments like revenue, police, urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions we have seen that the cases have remained controlled. Recently, we are witnessing a continuous reduction in positivity rate and cases of new infection. In a period of two weeks, the number of active cases has gone down by almost 25%. Testing was a concern in the initial days. How did you manage and enhance it? When Covid-19 broke, we just had one laboratory with a capacity of less than 100 samples per day and then we used to send samples to NIV, Pune for the confirmatory test. We started expanding our capacity quickly with medical colleges setting up RT-PCR laboratories across the state. UP was the first state to introduce pool testing in the country. We also equipped all district hospitals with TruNat machines very early. Once rapid antigen test was introduced, we quickly expanded our testing capacity to more than 1.5 lakh tests per day with a healthy mix of 1:2 ratio for RT-PCR and antigen tests, respectively. Today, we crossed the landmark of 10 million Covid-19 tests, a first in the country. Out of this, RT-PCR is about 3.5 million, while the remaining is antigen tests. We are making preparations to double the number of RT-PCR tests also. A proper and better infrastructure and increasing the number of labs are needed for this and we have already started looking for that. Through testing on a very large scale, we have been able to keep the positivity rate below 5% in the state. How do you analyse the action taken reports from all the districts of the state? And, what are the grey areas where more focus is needed? UP has used digital technology very well for data collection and analysis. With the help of UP Technical Support Unit, we have developed a portal which provides end to end solution for Covid-19. Govt of India also recognized this later when it gave us the go ahead to send data on their portal directly from our portal. We analyse the data for surveillance, testing, home isolation, hospital treatment, Covid-19 deaths, etc. from the portal. This has helped us to analyse the performance of the districts quickly. Chief Minister has been reviewing the performance of the districts on a regular basis through video conferencing. We keep them on their toes but also handhold them. This has been a collaborative affair which has resulted in great team work and exceptional results. Every district in UP has an Integrated Covid-19 Control and Command Centre, which works as the nerve centre of Covid-19 battle in the district. It is manned by people from health and other departments and is equipped with modern equipments for communication and decision making. We are continuously focussing on improving our surveillance and contact tracing as that is the key for early detection of cases and containing the pandemic. What will be government’s next step in terms of containment and surveillance? Though continuous monitoring of efforts of districts’ efforts in the containment zones and outside, we will try to keep the number of cases and the positivity rate low. Surveillance has been a key focus area and this will be further ramped up for early detection of cases, particularly the more vulnerable ones. Till a vaccine arrives, we have to focus on non pharmaceutical interventions like enforcement of social distancing norms, hand washing practices and wearing of masks by the people. Effective communication for behaviour change remains a key priority. As things open up more and more, it is necessary that people understand and voluntarily adopt Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. How did the state reduce case fatality rate (CFR)? A. CFR has been kept low by focussing on patient care and adopting the right treatment protocol by the Covid-dedicated hospitals. Virtual ICU has helped treatment centres across the state to get the benefit of expert advice of doctors from eminent institutes like SGPGI and KGMU. Government has deputed senior nodal administrative officers and doctors as nodal officers for each and every district, who analyse the deaths on a continuous basis. CFR is a statistical tool; however every death is unfortunate and we must try to avoid every avoidable death. Government provides free of cost treatment to patients coming to its facilities through more than 1.5 lakh beds including oxygen supported beds and ICUs and all drugs and consumables, howsoever expensive. We are trying to bring the CFR below the level of 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/from-one-lab-that-tested-100-samples-we-crossed-the-1-crore-covid-19-test-landmark-up-additional-chief-secretary/story-eh7H7JVzszbN6kQ9jl6PTO.html

30-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai tops cybercrime frauds in 2019, Bengaluru ranks 2nd: National Crime Records Bureau||Mumbai recorded the maximum number of cyber crime cases after Bengaluru in 2019, shows the National Crime Records Bureau data (NCRB).Bengaluru recorded 10,555 cases in 2019, while Mumbai saw a steep rise in cyber crime cases in 2019 with 2,527 cases being registered, reported the NCRB. Mumbai had recorded 1,362 cybercrime cases in 2017 and it had marginally increased to 1,482 in 2018, data showed. Mumbai had 146 cases of cyber stalking and bullying, 28 data thefts, 154 sexual exploitation cases, 15 cyber blackmailings, 100 credit/debit card frauds, 276 ATM frauds, 248 online banking frauds, 37 OTP frauds and 26 forgery cases, it said.Although the cases in Mumbai exceed 2,527, experts believe that the number should be much more but the complaints filed by the victims do not get converted into FIRs. According to advocate Vicky Shah, in the past five months, he has received over 50 calls from people who have lost money due to cyber crime but only 2 of these 50 have been able to convert into FIRs.“Cyber criminals are extremely innovative and although the police, RBI and the bank’s spread awareness, these fraudsters invent new ways to rob people online as it is the easiest way to commit crime,” said Shah.Maharashtra also recorded a rise in cyber crime compared to 2017 and 2018. Although the cases decreased from 3,604 cases in 2017 to 3,511 in 2018, the number of cyber crimes shot up to 4,967 in 2019.The NCRB shows that cyber crime cases were maximum in Karnataka with 12,020 cases being registered followed by Uttar Pradesh 11,416 and Maharashtra with 4967 cases.Of the 4967 cases, 1698 cases were of ATM, online banking and OTP fraud, while 409 cases registered were those of cyber stalking and bullying of women and children.According to the NCRB statistics, defrauding people was the motive behind 3,551 of the 4,967 cases registered. When contacted, Balsing Rajput, superintendent of police, Maharashtra cyber police, said, “The reason for rise in numbers in Maharashtra is due to the increasing number of people using mobile phones and making online transactions as Maharashtra is a commercial hub.”Rajput further said that they have been conducting awareness campaigns, “In lockdown specially we have conducted campaigns on fake news and hate speeches and we regularly make sure to generate awareness among women and youngsters as they are the main targets of cyber bullies and criminals. We have also made audio and visual campaigns which are shown in theatres and put on hoardings to alert people about cybercrime and how to prevent it,” added Rajput.A senior police officer said, “We are in a continuous process of training officers with the changing trends of committing online crimes. There is a cyber-lab and a cyber-police station in all districts fully equipped to register and investigate these crimes.”Cyber experts believe that online crimes are committed as people are impatient and do not read the entire message, “People get confused between collecting money and receiving money which the cyber fraudsters take advantage of. Another method is payment by links which is now frequently being used by criminals to confuse the users,” added Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-tops-cybercrime-frauds-in-2019-bengaluru-ranks-2nd-national-crime-records-bureau/story-EoJsHPMsNtXxftEJm1K1rI.html

In a statement here, party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the Punjab Congress after failing on all fronts and even betraying farmers by amending the State APMC Act in 2017 was now trying to win the sympathy of farmers by indulging in cheap publicity stunts. “Getting Rahul astride on a tractor in Punjab is nothing but a photo op designed to befool farmers. The Congress has always adopted an anti-farmer stance, be it the party’s 2019 election manifesto calling for abolition of the APMC Act or the amendment to the State APMC Act in Punjab in 2017 which includes all the provisions contained in the new agriculture laws,” he said. The SAD leader said before coming to Punjab, Rahul Gandhi should come clean and tell the farmers of Punjab as to where he was when the Bills were tabled in Parliament. He said Rahul should also explain why no top leader of the Congress party spoke against the Bills in Parliament and why the party did not even issue a whip to ensure all its MPs voted against the Bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-asks-rahul-gandhi-to-tell-farmers-why-he-supported-abolition-of-apmc-act/story-bdTZVZlS9sdUQ9898svlKO.html

The deceased woman was identified as Rajashree Jagtap who was 22 years old at the time of her death. The convicted doctors were identified as Dr Jitendra Suresh Shimpi and Dr Sachin Hari Deshpande while the acquitted doctor was identified as Dr Vijay Agarwal. The order was issued by additional sessions judge VR Jagdale. Eight doctors were examined during the trial. The two doctors were sentenced to 10 years of simple imprisonment with ₹2.5 lakh fine each to be paid to Anil Jagannath Jagtap, husband of the deceased woman. He works as an ambulance driver at a private hospital in Lonavala and lives on Sinhagad road. “In 2012, Dr Shimpi was in jail for 10 days and Dr Deshpande and Dr Agarwal were never in jail as they had an anticipatory from court. Dr Deshpande has an MS in general surgery but he had no specialisation and had no qualification. He was using that as the defence. However, a report from a three-member committee of BMS faculty at Indian Medical Association, Mumbai (January 20, 2014) and a report from a five-member committee at Sassoon Hospital (December 11, 2012) declared that the doctors had no qualification to perform the surgery,” said advocate Rajesh Kavediya, assistant public prosecutor, Pune. A case was registered at Dehuroad police station against the three men on January 12, 2013 under Sections 304 and 34 of Indian Penal Code. The Jagtap couple had a 2.5-year-old daughter when the 22-year-old fell pregnant again.

On the morning of June 2, 2012, she was declared dead. The case of the doctors was sent to Sassoon hospital and a case of accidental death was registered at Dehuroad police station. After inquiry, Sassoon General Hospital report claimed that among the doctors who performed the faulty procedure, none were qualified to perform the surgery.

30-09-2020||City||Former Radaur MLA Shyam Singh Rana quits BJP ‘to stand with farmers’||In a setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana, its former MLA from Radaur assembly seat, Shyam Singh Rana left the party, alleging neglect of farmers in the state.Announcing his resignation in the presence of his supporters and media at his residence, Rana said he left the party because he could no longer bear to see the miseries of farmers. “Farmers have been protesting for a long time. Tonnes of paddy have reached the mandis but so far, no procurement has been done. Had the government paid attention to the farmers’ issues, the present situation (agitations) could have been averted,” he told Hindustan Times. On being asked on his future plans, Rana said, “I’ve sent my resignation to state party president OP Dhankar. I’ll talk to my supporters and then decide the next course of action. But let me assure you, I will stand with the farmers in every possible way.”Hours after the resignation letter was sent, Dhankar accepted the resignation but in a harshly worded reply, accused Rana of not supporting the BJP candidate in the previous election due to his vested interests. “The party treated you with respect by appointing you as the district chief, giving you an election ticket and elevating you to the post of chief parliamentary secretary. But you failed to support our candidate during the previous elections. It seems you personal interests are weighing you down and you are left with no option but to resign. Therefore, your resignation is accepted,” wrote Dhankar. Randeep Ghanghas, co-incharge of the state media cell of BJP, confirmed that the resignation had been accepted by the state president.Rana, who belongs to Pehowa of Kurukshetra district, had served as the MLA on the seat from 2014-19, but was denied ticket in the 2019 assembly elections. In his place, former minister Karan Dev Kamboj was fielded from the seat as the Kamboj community has a considerable vote-share in the Radaur segment. However, Kamboj lost to Congress’ Bishan Lal Saini by a thin margin and later accused Rana of campaigning against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-radaur-mla-shyam-singh-rana-quits-bjp-to-stand-with-farmers/story-ynLHF1lx6L7M1yQcqaBXuL.html

Such requirement is not temporary. Alternatives for viable permanent constructions may need to be explored,” the bench also comprising Justice S P Wangdi said.The tribunal was hearing an application filed by the Delhi Police for permission to raise construction for accommodation of the Police trainees in the flood plains of river Yamuna.The NGT in its 2015 order prohibited any construction activity in the demarcated flood plain and directed the Principal Committee to identify all existing structures as of today which fall on the demarcated flood plain.  “Upon identification, the Principal Committee shall make its recommendations as to which of the structures ought or ought not to be demolished, in the interest of environment and ecology, particularly, if such structures have been raised in an unauthorised and illegal manner,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngt-denies-nod-to-delhi-police-for-construction-on-yamuna-floodplains/story-AsKDvT93wer5BAkzVVocON.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra stays August order issued for implementation of farm reform laws||The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government on Wednesday rescinded a notification issued in August for the implemention of the contentious farm ordinances, which were replaced by three laws passed in Parliament this month. The move came after the coalition’s key ally, the Congress, threatened to boycott a state Cabinet meeting later in the day if this was not done. The notification dated August 10 directed local authorities governing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees to implement the three central farm ordinances issued in June. Also Read: Babri Masjid demolition case verdict: Shiv Sena welcomes acquittalThe Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) representatives were likely to raise the issue of the implementation of the newly-enacted farm laws at the Cabinet meeting. The two parties have opposed the laws as “anti-farmer” and their implementation in the state. The Maharashtra government is yet to take a decision over implementing the laws. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Monday advised the states ruled by her party to explore the possibilities of legislation under the Constitution’s Article 254(2) to negate the “anti-agricultural laws” and to prevent the “grave injustice” being done to farmers. The Congress is in power in Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, and Puducherry. It is part of coalition governments in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushed three farm bills to deregulate agricultural trade. They were passed controversially in Parliament, overriding demands for greater scrutiny and voting. Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 6.2 million mark with 80,472 fresh cases, 1,179 new fatalitiesBig farmers’ groups are protesting against the laws saying the deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in a weaker negotiating position than before. Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar last week said the farm laws will not be implemented in Maharashtra. Revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said all the ruling parties are against the laws and the decision on not implementing them in the state will be taken collectively after due deliberation. The Congress has organised #SpeakUpForFarmers on social media to garner support against the laws. It also held a virtual farmer rally and gathered signatures from 10 million farmers opposing the laws. A delegation of Congress leaders met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari demanding the withdrawal of the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-stays-august-order-issued-for-implementation-of-farm-reform-laws/story-nZwE88mPz3ryY5rYReejhK.html

Director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said on Tuesday that two civilians have been arrested in connection with the killings. The two are residents of south Kashmir and have been remanded in custody for eight days. Police sources said they are believed to be informers of security forces. The DNA samples of Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Ibrar, who were gunned down on July 18 in Shopian, matched with their family members in Rajouri on September 25, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bodies-of-3-rajouri-youngsters-killed-in-shopian-encounter-to-be-exhumed-handed-over-to-families/story-aPdB41UiPELruUwv08FtYL.html
30-09-2020||Pune||Two BJP leaders swerve party line to PMC oppose amnesty scheme||Two senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have objected to their party’s decision to waive off the fine for property tax defaulters and even warned to challenge this decision legally. BJP leaders Ujwal Keskar and Suhas Joshi wrote a letter to the Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and objected to the civic body’s decision. Keskar and Joshi said, “It is wrong to waive off the money for the defaulters. Instead of giving relaxation to the citizens who are paying tax regularly, the civic body is giving relief to the defaulters. If the decision would not be withdrawn, they warned to file a complaint with either the Lokayukta or the high court.” The BJP is the ruling party in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). BJP president Jagdish Mulik, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne and leader of the house Dheeraj Ghate jointly held a meeting and decided to give a relief in the property tax for defaulters. Earlier, the parties in opposition, Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena had opposed this decision and forced the BJP to give a cap for this decision and give the benefit of the amnesty scheme only for those citizens whose dues are below ₹50 lakh. The ruling BJP with the help of the opposition parties approved the amnesty scheme and announced to give 80 per cent relief in property tax fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-bjp-leaders-swerve-party-line-to-pmc-oppose-amnesty-scheme/story-AkAVxeDmjUukc05sgtas8J.html
30-09-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s Mukundra reserve left with one injured tigress||Kota’s Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR), populated only two years back, and with four tigers and three cubs till July this year, has hardly any tigers left now. All it is left with is an injured tigress codenamed MT-4 but that too has been shifted to Abheda Biological Park for treatment. In the past two months, two tigers and a cub have died, while three, including two cubs, have gone missing. There are apprehensions that the missing tiger, MT-1, has left the MHTR enclosure. It was the last camera trapped (captured on camera) on August 19. The MHTR search team, and that sent from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, has failed to locate the big cat. The cub of dead tigress MT-2 has been missing since August 3 and that of MT-4 was last seen on camera trap on May 22. The chances of their surviving without their mothers are low, said a forest official on the condition of anonymity. As far as tiger deaths are concerned, two adult tigers died within a span of 10 days – male tiger MH-3 died on July 23 due to cardiac arrest and female MT-2 on August 3 because of a territorial fight. MT-2 had delivered two cubs in June, of which one died during treatment and the other went missing. A team of National Tiger Conservation Authority has visited MHTR to investigate the deaths and inspect the management; and another team would be coming shortly. Conservator of forest and MHTR field director Sedu Ram Yadav said a search operation is on for the missing tiger, MT-1. The neighbouring forest divisions, such as Bundi, Baran, Jhalawar and even Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, have been informed to keep a check in their respective areas. Yadav said after being camera-trapped on August 19, indirect evidence, such as pugmarks, was found on August 25. “The possibility of MT-1 having left the reserve cannot be ruled out,” said Yadav. On the health of injured tigress MT-4, currently under treatment at Abheda Biological Park, Yadav said the big cat’s condition was improving. Once fully recovered, MT-4 will be shifted to a soft enclosure before being released in the wild. Retired IFS officer Sunayan Sharma said the missing tiger is a result of administrative failure, especially the dearth of skilled personnel, from forest guard to ranger level. The monitoring and follow-up were not effective, he alleged. “The big cats had accepted this reserve as they got disturbance-free area and they started to breed,” he said. No rangers have not been recruited in the past 25 years, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-s-mukundra-reserve-left-with-one-injured-tigress/story-nRMw8bV1Kth2XWX72OQdmL.html
30-09-2020||Pune||Dabholkar murder accused’s request to visit family for third time rejected||An application made by Dr Virendra Tawade, an accused in the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar to perform concluding funeral rituals for his father was rejected by a court in Pune on Monday. In the order made available on Tuesday, the judge observed that the application was rejected as Tawade has already been allowed to visit home after his father’s death twice. He was last released conditionally from jail on September 26 to attend the 10th day Hindu religious rituals for his father who died on the night of September 15, one day before the court had allowed Dr Tawade to visit him, according to advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar representing Dr Tawade. “Whenever it was absolutely necessary, this court has allowed the request of the applicant, particularly for the funeral and post-funeral ceremony of his father. So far as ‘’Nidhanshanti’’ ritual is concerned, it cannot be said that presence of the applicant is absolutely necessary for that purpose,” read a part of the order issued by additional sessions judge SR Navandar on Monday. In an order issued on September 15, the court had allowed him to visit his terminally ill father on September 16. “But he had passed away on the previous night. We had to get another order on September 16 when we reached there and found that his father had passed on the previous night. The funeral grounds were merely 100 meters from where he was allowed to visit. However, he was not allowed to move without a court order,” said Ichalkaranjikar. In conclusion, the court observed that it “is not a very easy task” to allow the accused to be taken back home as it “creates a burden on the law executing machinery”. Dr Tawade, an ear-nose-throat surgeon and a member of the Sanatan Sanstha has been in jail since June 2016 when he was arrested from Panvel for being the mastermind in the murder. Dr Dabholkar was shot dead on the morning of August 20, 2013, on the Omkareshwar bridge in Pune. The accused in the case have been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dabholkar-murder-accused-s-request-to-visit-family-for-third-time-rejected/story-ujgLtSBF76EjAJ94xRWiGO.html

Congress members led by Singh had held a protest march towards the governor’s house against the aforementioned laws but were stopped on the way by the police. The Congress members had then held a sit-in protest before submitting a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate, who had come at the protest site to meet them. Manibhushan Shrivastava, station house officer of Dalanwala police station, where the Congress leaders have been booked said, “They were booked on Tuesday for violating the Covid norms under relevant sections of Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act.” “In the case registered, party state president Pritam Singh, vice president Suryakant Dhasmana were named along with at least three others and unidentified other members.

But we are not going to hold back despite these cases and will continue to hit the streets for the public,” said Dhasmana. He added, “We are not going to be intimidated by the government and won’t even take permission for our future protests.

This is highly condemnable,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president. This is not the first time that the Congress leaders have been booked for violating Covid-19 norms. Earlier during the lockdown, Singh, former CM Harish Rawat and other senior leaders were booked in at least three cases for organising rallies and protests against the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-congress-president-booked-for-violating-covid-norms-during-protest-against-farm-bills/story-JesjJvk5nCCBAv7otPzZHL.html

30-09-2020||Delhi||Monsoon retreats from Delhi||This year’s monsoon season in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) officially came to an end on Wednesday, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials. “Changes in low-level wind pattern into north-westerlies, a reduction in moisture content and cessation of rainfall are all indications that the south-west monsoon has further withdrawn from some parts of Rajasthan, the remaining parts of Punjab, the entire western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi -NCR and some parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP),” said an IMD scientist. Also read: Delhi sees driest September in 16 years“Usually, the monsoon season lasts between June 1 and September 30,” he added. “The transition in overall weather conditions and wind direction will predominantly remain north-westerly in Delhi-NCR. The national capital will get relief from day heat soon. The humidity levels have also come down. A slight decrease in maximum and minimum temperature may come into effect from October 5,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, who heads IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC). The average wind speed will remain around 20 kilometres per hour (kmph), which is likely to keep the air quality in Delhi-NCR in check at least until October 15, following which the wind speed is set to reduce, he added. The normal date for the complete withdrawal of monsoon from the country is October 15, as per the new onset and retreat dates of the rainy season issued by the IMD authorities in April. Until last year, the normal date for the commencement and withdrawal of monsoon was September 1 and October 15, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/monsoon-retreats-from-delhi/story-bPGKVwVKrihnXqre5PzxcO.html

30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Friendship that bridged tunnel of hope at Rohtang||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi opens the 9.2-km Atal Tunnel under the 13,050-ft Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh, on October 3, he will be paying tribute to a bond of friendship between ex-PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and a tribal farmer, Tashi Dawa. It was Dawa, alias Arjun Gopal, who had suggested to Vajpayee get a tunnel built under Rohtang, which in the local Bhoti dialect translates into “a pile of bodies” in view of the high casualty rate of those trying to cross the treacherous terrain in the winter months. Convinced, Vajpayee laid the foundation stone of the tunnel on May 23, 2002, while work on the project started in 2010. “It took 10 years but this tunnel brings hope for the people of Lahaul-Spiti. With all-weather road connectivity, the dream of Vajpayee and Dawa has been realised,” says Ram Lal Markanda, the BJP legislator from Lahaul-Spiti and tribal development minister. Dawa, who belonged to Tholang village in Lahaul valley, and Vajpayee had been friends during their stay at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) camp in Baroda, Gujarat, in 1942. Vajpayee used to call on Dawa whenever he visited his cottage at Prini village on the outskirts of Manali. Dawa passed away in 2007 at the age of 83 and Vajpayee in 2018. ECONOMY GETS A FILLIP The opening of the tunnel will give a boost to the all-round development in the tribal valley. It will revolutionise horticulture, agriculture and tourism. Farmers will get round-the-year access to markets and the reduced distance will bring down the transportation cost. Agriculture and horticulture units are expected to come up in the valley. Vegetables such as potato, cauliflower and cabbage are grown in this belt, while medicinal plants such as seabuckthorn grow in abundance. People will have the option of taking up poultry and dairy farming. BOOST FOR TOURISM The tunnel will increase the tourist flow to the region, opening up new employment and self-employment avenues. With all-weather access to the valley, new hotels are expected to come up, creating jobs and stopping migration. The valley residents shall have access to improved education and healthcare services. A few residents, however, fear the price of the abrupt model of development. “Mindless mass tourism will add to the haphazard construction and this region may start resembling other popular tourist destinations of Himachal Pradesh,” said a resident, requesting anonymity. The impact on the vulnerable ecosystem of the valley also needs to be assessed. Local culture and tradition will also need to be protected.

Three Rajouri families had identified the slain men from their pictures on social media and alleged the army had killed them in a “fake encounter” in Shopian where they had gone to work as labourers.Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh on Tuesday said that they have arrested two persons in connection with the killings.Also Read: DNA of 3 men killed in Shopian encounter matches with family: J&K police“Two persons we initially suspected and had put (their arrest) on hold.

The police were tight-lipped about their role in the case but sources said that they are believed to be informers of security forces. Their arrests come after the DNA samples of the three men—Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Ibrar— gunned down on July 18 matched with their family members in Rajouri on September 25, the police said.When questioned further about the case, the DGP said, “When the case moves forward only then we can share further details.”The investigation is being conducted by SSP Shopian Amritpal Singh and is in tits final stages, the DGP said on Monday, adding, “The army and police are both investigating the case.”On September 18, the army had said that the inquiry ordered by their authorities into the operation in Amshipora, Shopian, on July 18 had concluded and they had identified the trio killed as residents of Rajouri, adding their “involvement with terrorism was under investigation” by the police.Also Read: Govt should give hefty compensation: Farooq Abdullah on Amshipora case“The inquiry has brought out prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the dos and don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court were contravened.

Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Monday advised the states ruled by her party to explore the possibilities of legislation under the Constitution’s Article 254(2) to negate the “anti-agricultural laws” and to prevent the “grave injustice” being done to farmers.The Congress is in power in Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, and Puducherry. It is part of coalition governments in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushed three farm bills to deregulate agricultural trade. They were passed controversially in Parliament, overriding demands for greater scrutiny and voting.Big farmers’ groups are protesting against the laws saying the deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in a weaker negotiating position than before.Maharashtra had issued orders in August to implement the ordinances that preceded the laws.State minister and NCP leader Balasaheb Patil said a discussion is on over rescinding the orders. “We are with the farmers and a decision will be taken accordingly,” said Patil.The state Cabinet can take a decision in this regard. “It has to be a Cabinet resolution because it has become a constitutional issue now. Though agriculture is a state subject, according to entry 33 in the concurrent list, the Centre has the right to bring in legislation related to trade and commerce of agriculture produce,” said an official, requesting anonymity. “Also, if there is a law of the Centre and the state on a subject and there is conflict over a provision, then the central act will prevail, according to the constitutional experts. Hence, it has become a challenge as to how to stop the implementation of the central laws.”Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar last week said the farm laws will not be implemented. Revenue minister and Congress Balasaheb Thorat said all the ruling parties are against the laws and the decision on not implementing them in the state will be taken collectively after due deliberation.The Congress has organised #SpeakUpForFarmers on social media to garner support against the laws. It also held a virtual farmer rally and gathered signatures from 10 million farmers opposing the laws. A delegation of Congress leaders met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari demanding the withdrawal of the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-may-discuss-farm-bill-issue-today/story-39wjLAlt5h62DQVBDqz0JL.html
30-09-2020||City||NGT sets fresh deadline to complete Western Ghats ESA notification||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on September 28 has set a fresh deadline of December 31 for the Union environment ministry to finalise the notification of eco-sensitive zones in the Western Ghats pending for eight years.“There is a demand for more and more exclusion by those who claim the need for ‘development’ while need for ‘environment protection’ does not allow acceptance of such demands. This aspect needs to be finalised and has been pending consideration for the last about eight years,” said an NGT bench of Adarsh Kumar Goel, S P Wangdi and Nagin Nanda.Also read: Year after tragedy, Goa govt pledges to seal open cast stone quarriesAn environment ministry panel led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2011 recommended that 129,037 sq km in the Western Ghats be notified as eco-sensitive and protected. But another K Kasturirangan-led panel reduced the proposed area for notification to 56,825 sq km. The concerned states now seek to reduce it further to 50,805 sq km.The NGT said there is no justification for continued delay merely because the states have sought exclusion of areas from eco-sensitive zones. “Let the needful be done now before 31.12.2020. For any default thereafter, [the] direction to stop [the] salary of the Advisor, ESZ Division [Eco-Sensitive Zone], MoEFCC [Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change] will be operative,” the NGT bench said.The bench was hearing a Goa Foundation petition against repeated delays in finalising the matter. The NGT earlier on August 24, 2018, directed that “no changes be made to reduce the area of Eco-Sensitive Zone without the same being considered by this Tribunal”.The ministry has submitted that states have sought a reduction in the area to be demarcated as eco-sensitive as they are concerned about “prohibition of certain activities having implications on medical care, health care and education”.“There is a concern of States about certain areas within [the] proposed notification that have since the time of submission of [the] Gadgil Committee report and HLWG, undergone demographic, infrastructural changes,” the ministry told the NGT.A separate petition saying the Gadgil panel report be treated as final is pending before the Supreme Court.The Centre set up the panel in 2009 saying the Western Ghats is a global biodiversity hotspot, and needed to be conserved. It formed another committee under K Kasturirangan following opposition from states to Gadgil panel’s recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-sets-fresh-deadline-to-complete-western-ghats-esa-notification/story-n3ZLJmrcw4xUq0mgHajJSO.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Bribery in jails in Marathwada, north Maharashtra: HC orders magisterial enquiries||Taking note of frequent allegations of bribe demands by jail authorities against release of prisoners on emergency Covid-19 parole, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has ordered judicial magistrates to visit all jails across Marathwada and north Maharashtra to enquire with prisoners about the same and submit their report to the bench.The bench of justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar, on Monday, also directed the magistrates to ask prisoners if they were told of their right to get emergency parole vide a notification issued on May 8, 2020, by Maharashtra home department for releasing undertrial prisoners on a temporary bail and grant of emergency parole leave to convicts, with a view to decongest prisons to check the spread of coronavirus in jails.The magistrates have been directed to ascertain if the jail authorities had refused to accept applications for parole and directly or indirectly refused parole leave to eligible prisoners for failing to grease palms of the jail officers concerned.They have also been asked to check if some life convicts were released only on personal bonds and others were, as alleged by some prisoners before the high court, asked to fulfil the condition of providing sureties.The court instructed the magistrates to assure the prisoners that their names would be kept secret, if they so wished, and also to collect written complaints if any prisoner was willing to do so openly.The magistrates have to submit their reports within three weeks.The court was hearing separate petitions filed by two convicts lodged at Harsul Prison at Aurangabad, complaining about rejection of their applications for emergency parole by jail authorities on flimsy grounds.The bench was irked to note that despite several orders interpreting the May 8 notification and number of clarifications issued by the high court, jail officials were rejecting parole applications on the same grounds that have been held by the bench as untenable. It has now converted the petitions into public interest litigations and posted the same for further hearing on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bribery-in-jails-in-marathwada-north-maharashtra-hc-orders-magisterial-enquiries/story-HnlV1zHifZm7d24LuVWTdO.html

30-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai ranks second after Delhi in crimes against women, shows NCRB data||Mumbai is ranked second among 19 cities in the country in recording the highest number of crimes against women after Delhi, the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data has revealed. The NCRB data showed that Mumbai had reported 6,519 crimes against women last year, while the national capital had recorded 12,902 cases. However, Mumbai is ranked ninth among the list of cities that has reported the highest rate of crime against women. Mumbai has 76.5 rate of crime against women as compared to other cities such as Jaipur (235), Lucknow (175.4), Delhi (170.3), Indore (169.1), Patna (102.3), Kanpur (98.5), Nagpur (93.6) and Bengaluru (85.9).The city is ranked third in the country in recording the maximum cases of rape last year. Delhi occupied the pole position with 1,231 reported cases of rape, followed by Jaipur (517) and Mumbai (394).The government data also revealed that Mumbai is the second city in the country that had reported the maximum number of cases of molestation at 2,069 after Delhi (2,326). The molestation cases involve sexual harassment, criminal force with intent to disrobe, voyeurism and stalking. Mumbai had reported the maximum number of cases of sexual harassment against women in public transport system. It had recorded 16 such cases last year, followed by Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad. Mumbai has topped the list of cities which had reported the maximum number of cases of insult to the modesty of a woman, which refers to section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), with 575 cases, followed by Delhi (456). Mumbai had also recorded the maximum number of human trafficking cases (85), which had involved 401 victims. Delhi had reported 56 cases that had involved 388 victims.Delhi and Mumbai were the leading offenders under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.Mumbai had reported 1,319 cases under the POCSO Act, 2012, involving 1,431 minor victims. While the corresponding figure for the similar offence in Delhi was 1,662 cases that had involved 1,674 minor victimsDelhi and Mumbai are ranked in the top two, respectively, for reporting the maximum number of cases of crimes against children.Delhi and Mumbai had reported 7,565 and 3,640 cases, respectively, for the offence. The Central government data showed that Mumbai Police’s pendency in disposing of cases for crime against women is 67.2%, which is the second-worst rate in India after Chennai at 81.9%. Similarly, Mumbai Police’s pendency in disposing of cases for crime against children is also the second-worst rate in the country after Chennai at 87.5%, the NCRB data revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-ranks-second-after-delhi-in-crimes-against-women-shows-ncrb-data/story-Jm0zgPofmMY8XL2B8IkR8N.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||As Covid-19 cases increase, Delhi hospitals see an increase in plasma therapy||Delhi’s doctors said that they have seen an increase in the number of convalescent plasma transfusions corresponding to the increase in the number of cases over the last two weeks. “We have seen an increase in the number of Covid-19 patients over the last 10 days, even from neighbouring states. Many of them qualify for convalescent plasma therapy and hence there has been an increase,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant for internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. He, however, warned people against thinking that it was a miracle cure. “There are several experimental therapies being administered to patients, so we don’t really know what is working and what is not. In our clinical experience, we have seen some improvements in patients after plasma therapy if administered at the right time,” he said. Also Read: Centre releases safety workplace guidelines for industry to prevent Covid-19When Anand’s 62-year-old father-in-law needed convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), his friends came to the rescue. “I contacted several NGOs and political party workers whose numbers were being shared online. But I did not find a donor for two days. It was my friends who had recovered from the infection about two months ago who donate plasma,” said Anand, a west Delhi resident who wanted to be identified by his first name only. Doctors have already administered the therapy but his father-in-law’s condition continues to be unstable. Recently, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found that the treatment was not associated with any reduction in mortality or progression to severe disease. The trial was conducted across the country at 39 public and private hospitals between April and July to determine the effectiveness of the therapy for Covid-19. Convalescent plasma therapy uses an antibody-rich blood component called plasma from a person who has recovered from the infection to aid the immune response of someone still fighting Covid-19. Also Read: Unlock 5 guidelines likely today: All you need to know about Delhi’s plan so farThe study actually supports what Delhi’s phase 1 trial had shown, said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) which conducted the study in coordination with Lok Nayak Hospital. ILBS also houses Delhi’s first plasma bank. “The ICMR study actually reconfirms the findings of our small study—it shows that the oxygen requirement of the patients who received plasma therapy reduced, the duration for which they remained breathless reduced, and the group that received plasma tested negative for the virus quicker than others. What needs to be factored in is that the therapy was administered late, after two days of symptoms in most trial participant; it works best when given early. Also, many of the donors in the study did not have a high titre (concentration) of the neutralising antibodies,” said Dr Sarin. “For the study, I think a shorter duration (than the original 28 days) has to be chosen because mortality could be because of other complications as well,” he said. The trial by ILBS and Lok Nayak Hospital—called COPLA 1—where 29 people received either convalescent plasma or fresh frozen plasma without its therapeutic benefits showed that plasma therapy helped stabilise the respiratory rate, improve oxygen saturation, and improve the organ failure score that predicts multi-organ failure. A large scale study of 400 participants is currently underway at Lok Nayak Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in collaboration with ILBS. At Lok Nayak Hospital, the therapy continues; the hospital has its own plasma bank now. “The ICMR study says that there is a mortality benefit, but other drugs that are being used has also not shown mortality benefits so far. Nowhere does the study recommend that the therapy should be stopped. Our own study has shown encouraging results and what we need to remember from the ICMR trial is that the plasma needs to be given at an earlier stage and not when the patient is on ventilator,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital. The hospital has so far administered the therapy to 85 people under the trial—meaning half would have received a placebo, not convalescent plasma—and to 59 patients outside of the trial. At Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, 100 people have already received the therapy under trial and a couple received it outside of it. At Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, the third Delhi government hospital to have a plasma bank, 34 people have received the therapy so far. All three hospitals have plasma banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-covid-19-cases-increase-delhi-hospitals-see-an-increase-in-plasma-therapy/story-3dkddrrSaYxrz4C2gLAlcK.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Unlock 5 guidelines likely today: All you need to know about Delhi’s plan so far||The tenure of the Delhi government’s present order concerning relaxations of Covid-19 lockdown norms lapses on Wednesday.While the Central government is likely to release its Unlock 5 guidelines Wednesday, the document will be studied by the Delhi government, which is likely to issue fresh orders concerning relaxations of certain norms within two days, said a senior official of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Under the Centre’s guidelines, state governments are allowed to implement the Unlock regulations in a stricter form but they are prohibited from diluting them.Some of the key fronts on which Delhi government are likely to take a call on includeSchools and education institutesThe Delhi government is scheduled to take a fresh call on this by October 5. Under the current rules, students from classes 9 to 12 are allowed to visit their schools voluntarily and higher education institutions can be opened only for research scholars and post-graduate students of technical and professional programmes. In Delhi, however, all education institutes are closed till October 5, as per an order by the state government.Also Read: Centre releases safety workplace guidelines for industry to prevent Covid-19Multiplexes and theatresEven if the Central government allows multiplexes, cinema halls and theatres to reopen under its Unlock plans, the final call for Delhi will be of lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal’s, who is the chairperson of DDMA. A DDMA meeting is likely to take place later this week.Multiplexes, however, have standard operating procedures (SOP) in place, said a senior office bearer of the Multiplex Association of India. He added the new SOP includes gaps between seats, a thorough disinfection of halls and auditoriums after every show and complete migration to e-tickets and contactless check-ins.Maximum gathering sizeCurrently, Central government guidelines allow gatherings up to 100 people. But, the government is yet to notify that. This essentially means a gathering of over 50 people are prohibited in the city. The maximum limit of 50 was initially set for marriages and has been in place under the Central government guidelines since June 1. Under the guidelines currently applicable in Delhi, it applies to all gatherings—political, religious, cultural, academic, etc.The Durga Puja festival is also scheduled in the third week of October and most organisers are so far in a state of confusion, not having received a go-ahead from the police or the government yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-5-guidelines-likely-today-all-you-need-to-know-about-delhi-s-plan-so-far/story-xWqJtlCLg9GX8aKN34E7EP.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi crimes rose by over 20% against India’s 3% in 2018-19, says NCRB data||Crimes in Delhi increased by over 20% from 2018 to 2019, a period when the national crime figures saw a rise of just three percent in cases registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). As per data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), thefts accounted for most of these crimes in Delhi. Over 82% of the 290,000crimes in Delhi were thefts which saw an increase of 25.7% from 2018 to 2019.In sharp contrast, thefts accounted for just a little over 20% of the 3.2 million crimes across India and the overall thefts increased by 8%.Also read: Delhi Police returns Rs 21.50 lakh, gold, phones, vehicles in recovered property to the publicWhere Delhi stands in terms of thefts can be gauged from the rate of thefts -- the number of crimes per 100,000 population -- which stood at 1,233.6 in the national capital in 2019 even as the national theft rate during this period was just 50.5. In fact, even Maharashtra -- the state second in terms of rate of thefts -- was at 78.8.The Delhi Police as well as many experts have often attributed the high theft figures to the willingness of the force to truthfully register such cases. FEWER VEHICLE THEFTSVehicle thefts, which have tormented the national capital for long, witnessed a marginal dip of 0.46%. While 46,433 vehicle thefts were reported across Delhi in 2018, last year saw 46,215 such thefts.Yet, the scene in Delhi remains bleak when it comes to vehicle thefts since the rate of this particular crime was 231.8 last year. In comparison, the rate was 17.8 across India and 12.6 in the second-ranked state, Uttar Pradesh. The Delhi Police says that its willingness to register all thefts often prompts complaints from neighbouring states that vehicle owners hope registering their vehicle theft in Delhi would help expedite the insurance claim process. And yet, Delhi Police officers have often urged vehicle owners to make their own security arrangements to protect their vehicles.RISE IN RAPES AND MURDERSMeanwhile, the city continued to report high number of rapes; 24 such crimes were reported every week on an average to the Delhi Police. Rape cases in 2019 rose by 3% compared to the previous year. The city also reported marginal increase in murders which went up 1.5% from 513 to 521.Robberies, however, witnessed a substantial dip of 20% even though its rate remained the highest across India. Robbery rate in Delhi last year was 9.8 as against the all India rate of 2.3; and 6.3 by the next ranked state Maharashtra. Robberies are different from thefts in the sense that robberies include use of force while committing a theft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-crimes-rose-by-over-20-against-india-s-3-in-2018-19-says-ncrb-data/story-Z4LCxaYzF82hFgm13FlAeK.html

30-09-2020||Delhi||Teicoplanin, an antibiotic, could be potential medicine for Covid-19: IIT Delhi research||Teicoplanin, an antibiotic medicine, may be a potential option for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, according to a research conducted by scientists at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences (KSBS) in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi. In laboratory experiments, the medicine effectively inhibited the activity of the 3CLpro enzyme that is needed for replication of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. The medicine was found to be up to 20 times more effective in inhibiting the activity of 3CLpro than some of the medicines that have been used in Covid-19 patients such as anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Chloroquine, antibiotic Azithromycin, and anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) medicine Lopinavir. Also Read: Covid-19: India’s tests per million population cross 50k-mark“Covid-19 has affected millions of people across the world and there is no specific treatment for the viral infection. We have been working for the last seven to eight months to find possible treatment for the infection. We started looking at drugs that are already approved and are in the market. If found effective, these drugs will be available for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Ashok Patel, assistant professor at KSBS, IIT-Delhi. Earlier, KSBS was the first academic institute to develop a novel and cheaper reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit to conduct a Covid-19 test. The researchers decided to make the 3CLpro enzyme that they knew was the key for viral replication because a biosafety level (BSL)-3 laboratory—a requirement for any institute wanting to work on the Sars-CoV-2 virus—was not available.They found a way around to conduct the research about the virus that enters a human body and replicates within cells to cause Covid-19. Also Read: Moderna Covid-19 vaccine appears safe, shows signs of working in older adults: Study“We created a list of about 100 existing medicines that we thought could attack the captain of the cricket team, the 3CLpro protease (enzyme) that is crucial for viral replication. After testing, we found 11 molecules that were responding to this viral protein, which included the medicines already in use such as Azithromycin, Chloroquine, Lopinavir and even Oseltamivir that are used to treat H1N1, or swine flu. But, Teicoplanin turned out to be upto 20 times more effective than the other medicines,” said Dr Patel. The researchers collaborated with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, for some advanced testing. “Unlike HCQ, which is harmful for the heart, there aren’t any major side-effects of Teicoplanin,” he said. The institute did not have ethical clearance for human trials. However, these trials would be needed to prove that the medicine is, indeed, effective in treating the viral infection, he added. “Teicoplanin is an approved broad spectrum antibiotic that is given to patients, especially in critical care, for various reasons. It is an interesting finding. However, viral culture studies and small human trials have to be conducted before it can be approved for an off-label use, which refers to a use of a medicine for a condition for which it was not approved. Many antibiotics such as Azithromycin and Doxycycline are being prescribed to Covid-19 patients across the country, and at times, indiscriminately. It might lead to large scale antimicrobial resistance in the future,” warned Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor at the department of pulmonology in Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teicoplanin-an-antibiotic-could-be-potential-medicine-for-covid-19-iit-delhi-research/story-N6RFIN2h8lxQ2GC5sP1JSP.html

Mishra said the blowout occurred during workover, or maintenance operations, when OIL employees noticed uncontrolled flow of gas from the wellhead. “Different committees have been set up by the Assam government to assess how the incident happened. They have not taken a final view yet. The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) final report on the matter is also awaited,” he added.He said the well would be killed in a couple of months, but the gas would be diverted elsewhere and utilised. “You have to kill the well. But the production will continue from another well, where the gas will be diverted to,” Mishra added.Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had concluded in July that the environmental and health impact of the ongoing oil and gas spill due to the blowout in the Baghjan gas field would be long term.Also Read: Centre convenes meeting to review anti-pollution stepsIn a 178-page report submitted to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in early September, WII had cited that the highest concentration of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a toxic compound, in fish samples from Maguri Motapung wetland, which is located near the gas well blowout site, was found to be between 10 and 100-fold higher than any concentrations reported from India or other parts of the world.“The impact is significant and will have long-term effect, as many of these pollutants will leach into the ground and contaminate ground water. Long-term restorative efforts are needed for cleaning up these pollutants,” the report has said. The burnt-out area is mapped, as 65-70 hectares (ha), including crop fields, grasslands and swamps. There was a visible oil spill in the downstream of the well on June 16, it added.The report had underlined that the wetland and surrounding lowland forests are unique and, as a result, are extremely vulnerable to more oil spill disasters. “The Brahmaputra and Ganges floodplain landscape is unique in its morphology and fragility, and is responsible for shaping the unique community of plants and animals…the landscape (in Baghjan) is fragile... The dynamic nature of wetland creates mosaics of habitat, which are in perpetual flux. In India as well as the world over, only a handful of Protected Areas (PA) exist, where this system and unique biodiversity is surviving and Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and Kaziranga Orang National Park is on top of that list,” the report had said.The ministry had accorded environmental clearance to OIL on May 11 for an extension in drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations under the DSNP. “We will not touch the national park. The drilling will be done two kilometres (km) outside the park. However, the exploration will be conducted inside with new technology available to us,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/no-major-damage-to-local-ecology-oil-on-baghjan-gas-and-oil-leak/story-r9fJJLbGUcRECYUWl8s1SK.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In lockdown, new look||A historic place in Delhi, drastically transformed.While life in the city has severally shrunk due to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the Capital’s most important Sufi shrines, or dargahs, is undergoing a major overhaul. The twin shrines of Hazrat Sarmad Shahid and Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah lie tucked within a tiled chamber, at the foot of the great Jama Masjid. A neem tree grows between the graves of the two mystics, its trunk shooting up through an opening in the roof, beyond which it spreads out into a lush green foliage.The two parts of the shrine are distinguished by two colours—green for Hare Bhare Shah and red for Sarmad Shahid. The latter was executed by emperor Aurangzeb on charges of apostasy, and the red symbolises the Sufi saint’s blood. The dargah’s colour divide has always been so stark that despite being under the same roof, both graves seem to belong to two separate worlds—even the shrine’s walls are painted half in red and half in green.But now the saints are finally united. The thick cracked wall that lay between them—and that stifled the tree—has been gotten rid of. The tree has more room now, and can breathe better. While the graves are still identifiable by their respective red and green tiled wall, each has been given a canopy of white marble.“This marble is of Makrana, in Rajasthan,” says the shrine’s flower seller. “The same place where the Taj Mahal’s marble was from.”About half a dozen craftsmen from Rajasthan have been at work for one month, “and the work is not over yet.” The flower seller says that the renovation is being funded by a devotee who wishes to remain anonymous.The dargah has undergone at least one minor overhaul in the recent years, but that had not as profoundly altered the feel of the place. A regular visitor might be unsettled by the change, but the new appearance won’t take much time to get used to. This morning a few devotees, including a woman in red sari, are sitting on the floor, some with eyes closed, others with folded hands. Immersed in devotion, they seem to have already adapted their senses to the shrine’s altered aesthetics.Not far away is the garden tomb of freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who was a devotee of Sarmad Shahid and wrote a book on the saint. His marble grave has always had a white canopy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-lockdown-new-look/story-oqV1eAjDNJ4aG85HI9B1qI.html
30-09-2020||City||Punjab farmers resort to early stubble burning for sowing veggies||Farmers in Punjab, particularly in the Majha region, have yet again started burning the paddy residue early this year even as the state government is making tall claims of stopping the farm fires. They are doing so to clear their fields and make them ready for sowing vegetables. The agriculture department officials say potato and peas are sown considerably in many areas. The farmers there prefer to cultivate the Pusa basmati-1,509 and some other hybrid varieties of paddy that ripen fast and thus are harvested early. Against 159 farm fires reported in the state till September 28 last year, as many as 520 such incidents, most of them from Majha, have been witnessed during the corresponding period this time. And of a total of 407 incidents that took place in the region, 358 were from Amritsar, the state’s worst-hit district. This despite the fact that the state government on Sunday had deputed more that 8,000 field staff to check burning of straw in fields. “Since the government has not announced any incentive for straw management, the farmers are left with no option but to burn it. If the government is serious about stopping farm fires, it should announce₹200 per quintal as handling of straw in fields,” said Jagmohan Singh of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakunda). An agriculture department official said, “Actually, the farmers find burning of stubble the easiest method of disposing it though it is hazardous to health. Since the agriculture income is going down, they try to utilise the gap between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing by cultivating vegetables.” The government has deputed 8,000 nodal officers in paddy growing villages, with 23,500 machines being given to farmers for an in-situ management of paddy straw. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has appealed the farmers to shun the practice of burning straw several times. ‘We know it’s hazardous,but have no other option’ At Devidas Pura village of Amritsar district where farmers were spotted burning the paddy straw, the HT team was asked to leave the place promptly. Some farmers said, “We are already facing harassment at the hands of government officials for burning the stubble. We cannot afford any method of managing the straw other than burning it.” But in some fields, labourers were seen lifting the straw with bailer machines and tractor-trailers transported it to nearby sugar mills. Kulwant Singh, a farmer from Phoolke village near Batala in Gurdaspur district, said, “The farmers know the side-effects of burning stubble, but they still do it. Keeping in view of their financial conditions and increasing cost of cultivation, they cannot afford any other method of managing the residue. It is like a person committing suicide that he does in a state of depression.” “Nearly 80 per cent farmers have just 2 to 5 acre land. The government asks us to buy a happy seeder machines to prevent stubble burning. This machine can be operated with a new model of tractor only. It costs around 11 lakh to buy such a tractor. How many of the farmers can afford to buy these machines?” he asks. Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Thatha village of Gurdaspur, said, “Without the government’s support, managing the residue with eco-friendly methods is not possible. As far as the use of bailer machines are concerned, a sizable quantity of grain goes waste,” he added. Erring farmers fined ₹55,000 in Amritsar The administration in Amritsar has imposed₹55,000 fine on 15 farmers in the district, said deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khehra. Teams of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on Monday visited 150 villages after spotting 318 cases farm fires, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-resort-to-early-stubble-burning-for-sowing-veggies/story-ZmWyKdw0TuwmXrlTUoYzmL.html
30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmer stir hits Punjab’s Covid-19 testing pace||The protests by farmers over the agriculture bills that were recently passed by Parliament have cast their shadow on the pace of Covid-19 testing in Punjab with daily sample collection going down in the past few days. The health department’s field staff is attributing the decline in testing to the farmer stir as contact tracing in villages has virtually come to a halt with many a resident participating in the protests. As per the state health department’s media bulletin, Monday’s sample collection of 23,129 was the lowest in the past one week. While 30,929 samples were collected on September 25, the figure was 26,531 on September 26; 23,315 on September 27; 23,129 on September 28; and 23,459 on September 29. The slowdown in sample collection comes amid the state government’s repeated attempts to increase the daily testing to 30,000. Interestingly, the state witnessed relief in terms of single-day addition of coronavirus cases. On Tuesday, Punjab recorded 1,100 new confirmed cases, the lowest single-day spike in September. In the past three days, the state had 3,829 fresh positive cases. “People in villages were already running away from testing. Now, they have got an excuse to do so as they are taking part in protest marches and sit-ins. This became even more pronounced especially after September 25 when the farmers hit the roads on the Punjab bandh call,” a doctor involved in Covid-19 testing in Sangrur district said. Dr Aslum Parvez, state president of the Rural Medical Services Association who is leading Covid-19 testing team in Patiala villages, said, “We went for testing in a village where a group of influential farmers told me that they will not allow us to enter till the Central government doesn’t withdraw the contentious bills. We had to return empty-handed.” But state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar denied having fresh reports about people avoiding being tested. “The decrease in testing is an outcome of our change in strategy. Earlier, we were conducted targeted testing and were collecting samples, for instance, of teachers, policemen and health workers. Now, we are focusing on smart testing with an emphasis on smart testing and containing the potential virus carriers,” he claimed. Dr Bhaskar said the caseload is decreasing throughout the country and it is likely that India has touched the pandemic peak and the curve is flattening now. “But it is too early to say anything right now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmer-stir-hits-punjab-s-covid-19-testing-pace/story-cUdhKfUolh25p63IXIt8vJ.html
30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Delay in procurement triggers farmer protests in Haryana||After procurement agencies failed to initiate the purchasing process in the state, farmers on Tuesday expressed their ire by blocking roads, staging protests and locking offices of the marketing committees . Agitated farmers held protests in Indri, Gharanda and Kunjpura in Karnal; Pipli, Ladwa, Pehowa and Sahabad in Kurukshetra; Guhla, Cheeka, Jandhola in Kaithal; and Radaur and Jagadhri in Yamunanagar.Farmers complained that delay in procurement had led to glut in grain markets. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had to face the farmers’ ire during his visit to Cheeka town in Kaithal district where sloganeering farmers opposed his visit. The police detained a farmer leader, Hardeep Singh, for allegedly tearing down posters and banners of the chief minister and deputy chief minister.The Bharitya Kisan Union will launch statewide protests and block roads outside mandis in all the districts from Wednesday. “We had raised the issue with additional chief secretary, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs PK Dass but he did not give us any assurance,” said BKU Chaduni.Arhtiyas, rice millers join forces, farmers on edge Procurement agency officials are unable to procure paddy as rice millers are not allowing them to store it in their godowns. Arhtiyas and rice millers are opposing the government’s decision to keep rice millers out of procurement operations. Procurement agency officials will procure paddy and transport it to the rice mill from the mandi check bogus procurement. Rice millers have demanded that the government increase their milling charges from ₹10 to ₹100 per quintal and reduce returns to 64 per quintal of paddy. Haryana Rice Millers and Dealers Association (HRMDA) representatives have raised the issue with the top officials of the Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department but did not get any assurance. Association members sat they will continue the strike until the government accepts their demands. “We will not allow government agencies to use our godowns until our demands are accepted,” said Jewel Singla, HRDMA state president. Meanwhile, Arhtiyas say they will not provide ‘J form’ or cooperate until procurement agencies assure them that procured paddy will be lifted from mandi the same day.Arhtiyas and rice millers have joined hands and are not supporting procurement, putting farmers on edge. “Arhtiyas and rice millers are harassing farmers. They have no option but to stage protests,” said a Haryana State Agriculture and Marketing Board senior officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delay-in-procurement-triggers-farmer-protests-in-haryana/story-SZWTcYqs36egtAAppQbIKN.html
30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Dip in infections raises hope of curve flattening in Haryana||The number of coronavirus infections in Haryana decreased by 5,091 last week, raising hopes that the pandemic curve was plateauing in the state. As per health department statistics, Haryana’s 22 districts reported 12,525 new infections between September 21 to 27 as compared to 17,616 infections between September 14 to 20. The number of viral infections reported between September 7 to 13 was 17,092 and between August 31 to September 6 was 13,267. Additional chief secretary (ACS, health) Rajeev Arora said cases were stabilising to an extent and it was expected that the numbers will decline in the next phase. While the number of samples tested using rapid antigen tests (RAT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have also declined in the past week, health department officials said the declining infection rate outnumbers the reduced testing. Arora said with a 6.72% positivity rate and an average daily reduction of around 5,000, the decrease should be around 350 infections per day. “ Earlier, around 2,400 to 2,800 infections were being reported every day. The number has dropped to around 1,500 to 2,000 over the last week,’’ the ACS said. As per records, the health department conducted 1, 91,420 RAT and RT-PCR tests between September 13 and September 20 as compared to 1,70,309 tests between September 21 and September 27, which amounts to a reduction of 21,111 tests. Explaining reduction in sampling, Arora said when the number of infections start declining, the number of primary and secondary contacts of infected patients also comes down, thereby decreasing the sampling rate. “Then again one has to go for random sampling but we have seen the public at large resists random sampling,’’ he said. Arora said the department was going to step up the RT-PCR testing again but RAT had been reduced as it was felt that it was being performed indiscriminately. “During a recent review of national capital region districts by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Haryana’s RTPCR testing overshadowed Noida and Delhi. Our RT-PCR testing was around 65% and RAT around 35%,’’ the ACS said, adding the fatality rate in the state had remained stable at around 1.06%. Figures at a glance Officials say a 6.72% positivity rate and an average daily reduction of 5,000 samples indicates a decrease of around 350 infections per day.

Hence, it has been decided to put a stop such large gatherings.Events that have to be held in unavoidable circumstances with a maximum of only 100 people would be allowed with prior permission from the district administrations, he said.However a final decision will be taken after consulting administrations in districts that have a large number of infections.The minister said the government planned to organise awareness about COVID programmes jointly with cinema stars, religious heads, political leaders and artists.Hailing the ‘notable role’ of the media in raising awareness about coronavirus, he said the government was mulling over organising a special workshop for mediapersons.The workshop will be organised within a week, he said.The Covid-19 positive rate in seven of 11 districts is 12 per cent, he said, adding that the death rate was 1.5 per cent.Steps are being taken to reduce this to less than one per cent, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/for-the-first-time-karnataka-records-over-10-000-covid-cases-in-a-day/story-QYQ13Vthth31RgiF6DBuyN.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Arrest Anurag Kashyap for sexual harassment, minister Ramdas Athawale to Governor||Union minister Ramdas Athawale has demanded the arrest of filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, who has been accused of sexual harassment by an actor. Athawale, who heads the Republican Party of India (RPI), met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari along with the actor and requested the latter to ask the Maharashtra government to take action against Kashyap. Kashyap has denied all the allegations, calling them an attempt to silence his political critique of the central government.The actor told Koshyari that said she had put her career at stake and sought justice against the harassment that she was subjected to by Kashyap.  महाराष्ट्राचे राज्यपाल महामहिम भगतसिंह कोश्यारी यांची आज अभिनेत्री पायल घोष ला न्याय मिळवून देण्यासाठी रिपब्लिकन पक्षाच्या शिष्टमंडळासह भेट घेतली. pic.twitter.com/88JlAErwpR“I am giving an ultimatum of seven days to the state government to arrest Kashyap or else the RPI will start an agitation. The police is going slow on the investigation,” said Athawale, adding that he believed that Kashyap was guilty and hence he would also submit a memorandum to state home minister Anil Deshmukh seeking urgent action against the filmmaker.The Union minister also demanded security for the actor and claimed that she could face an attack as she came forward to lodge the complaint against the filmmaker.Earlier this month, the actor had alleged that Kashyap had harassed her around the time he was making one of his films and threatened to sit on hunger strike if the filmmaker was not arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/union-minister-ramdas-athawale-meets-maharashtra-governor-seeks-action-against-filmmaker-anurag-kashyap-in-sexual-harassment-case/story-dEitsjM9SsH7p8C9GphHjO.html
30-09-2020||City||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Sharad Pawar attacks Centre, says probe agencies trying to divert people’s attention from case||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday criticised the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and the central investigation agencies over the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. “The actual case and investigation into his death is left behind and something else is going on. Doubts have been raised that the investigating agencies are trying to divert people’s attention from the case,” Pawar said, responding to queries from mediapersons at an interaction in Pandharpur, Solapur. “We had read that an actor has committed suicide. The Mumbai Police started its investigation to find the reason behind it. Maybe the Central government had no trust in the police force. Several agencies were handed over the probe. But we are yet to see any significant progress by them in the investigation. Now, it is going on in a different direction altogether. We may have to wait more to know the truth,” said the veteran leader. Currently, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are investigating the case and all three come under the union home ministry headed by Amit Shah. Earlier, Pawar had said the decision of handing over the case to central agencies could be politically motivated. Home minister Anil Deshmukh alleged: “Mumbai Police was accused of handling the case incompetently and alleged of shielding a politician. CBI has not been able to find anything substantial in the case so far. Bihar’s former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey played a key role in the entire episode.”Meanwhile, reacting to news reports, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The report by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that ruled out poisoning has exposed the BJP’s conspiracy to take advantage of the case for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections and defame Mumbai and Maharashtra. CBI should find the mastermind behind this conspiracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-death-sharad-pawar-attacks-centre-says-probe-agencies-trying-to-divert-people-s-attention-from-case/story-QEO7aGBri1fQs8zQIQw9XJ.html
30-09-2020||City||Farm laws: Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in a dilemma||MUMBAI Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena, appears to be in a dilemma over the contentious farm laws passed recently by Parliament. The Centre had issued three ordinances in June, replacing them with three bills – Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 – which were passed by Parliament last week. After the bills were passed, deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar announced that the state government would not implement the farm laws in the state. Revenue minister and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat also claimed that the three ruling parties have opposed the bills and the issue would be discussed in a coordination committee meeting. However, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray hasn’t yet made a public comment on the row. His government had even issued a circular in August, directing the local authorities to implement in letter and spirit the ordinance that preceded the legislation. “I am sure after due deliberations, all three parties will be on the same page. The Congress and NCP have already opposed the implementation of the laws. The issue will now be discussed with the Sena,” Thorat told HT. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said the decision on implementation of the laws will be taken by the government. “We had opposed the bills in Parliament and I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Congress-NCP leaders. CM Thackeray has been holding discussions with his cabinet colleagues and the decision will be announced by him,” he said. On Monday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked all Congress-ruled states to explore the possibility of enacting the legislation under Article 254(2) of the Constitution to negate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government’s “anti-agricultural laws” and prevent “grave injustice” from being done to farmers. A senior Congress leader in Maharashtra said they were holding consultations within the party and with their alliance partners. “We are consulting with the law and judiciary department. It will be discussed in a coordination meeting of ruling parties. The Shiv Sena’s stance on the bills was initially shaky, but they have realised the nuances of the laws after nationwide protests,” said a Congress leader, on condition of anonymity. The circular on implementation was issued on August 10 by Maharashtra marketing director Satish Soni. “As per the provisions in the ordinances, the farmers are free to market their produce at field, factory, warehouse or cold storage without any hindrance and without any market fee applicable under APMC Act. Any other fee or charges applicable under APMC Act cannot be charged now as per the provisions made in the ordinances. The law and judiciary department has vetted the ordinances and validated its applicability. Though the existence of the APMCs has not been affected by promulgation of the ordinance, the farmers will have a parallel mechanism to get fair prices for their produce. The market committees are expected to implement the provisions in the ordinances effectively,” the circular stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-laws-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-government-in-a-dilemma/story-46VKw2y2R0J07niJlX1FxI.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut petition: You are a parliamentarian, show some grace, Bombay high court tells Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut||The Bombay high court (HC), while saying it did not agree with the tweets by actor Kangana Ranaut pertaining to the state government and the Mumbai Police, on Tuesday said that Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut should have shown some grace and restraint when responding to her, considering he was a parliamentarian. In his affidavit, Raut, while admitting that the words in the interview to the TV channel were directed at the petitioner, said that it was not due to any malice towards her, but were prompted after she raised aspersions about the state not being safe. The court, hearing Ranaut’s petition against the demolition carried out at her Pali Hill bungalow here by the Brihanmumbai Municipal (BMC) on September 9, has directed all parties to submit their written submissions within a week and posted the matter for hearing next week. A division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla, while hearing the response of Bhagyawant Late, designated officer of the BMC who was impleaded in the case after the petition of the actor was amended, was informed by senior counsel Anil Sakhare that the actor’s allegations of malice were baseless. While responding to the allegations made by the actor against him, Sakhare submitted that Late’s subordinates had visited the Pali Hill bungalow around 1pm much before her tweet, which was made around 5pm. Hence, the allegation that the detection was prompted due to her tweet was not valid. Sakhare further submitted that as per previous judgements, making allegations of malice were easy, but proving them was the responsibility of the accuser. However, at no place in the petition or affidavits submitted by the actor had she proved malice on his part. In light of the submissions, Sakhare sought dismissal of the petition. The court then perused Raut’s affidavit wherein it was submitted that he was not concerned with the demolition matter and that he had not threatened the actor in a derogatory and abusive manner as alleged. “In the said interview, I have only referred to the petitioner as “dishonest” because the petitioner had made a statement saying that Mumbai is like “Pak Occupied Kashmir”,” stated the affidavit. Raut said, “I responded because the petitioner had insulted Mumbai and Maharashtra.” After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “You are a leader, a parliamentarian. You should have been cautious while making statements. Even we don’t agree with what the petitioner has said. Is this the way to address?” When Raut’s advocate submitted that his outburst was due to the provocation by the actor, the court said, “We are all Maharashtrians and we are all proud to be Maharashtrians. We have to show grace. You have to ignore such things. Is this an example you set for others by asking ‘Kanoon kya hai’?” Thereafter, senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf, who along with advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, for the actor, responded saying that the case was very much in the jurisdiction of the court, even though senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, for the BMC, on Monday had said that the actor had a remedy in a suit for claims and the court should not entertain the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-petition-you-are-a-parliamentarian-show-some-grace-hc-tells-raut/story-ASFSwWSXdKqAR3pROnunPK.html

Aakash Parab, 21, suffered a thigh bone fracture during the stampede on the foot overbridge (FOB) at Elphinstone Road (now Prabhadevi) railway station on September 29, 2017. He was among the 39 people injured in the incident. His younger brother Rohit, 11, was the youngest of the 23 who died in the stampede. “I recall the stampede – people started falling and someone fell on me and I lost consciousness. I was taken out and put in a police van. I started searching for Rohit the minute I regained consciousness, but I could not see him. I called my friends and then my parents and asked them to come to the hospital,” Parab said, remembering the tragedy. Parab suffered a fractured thigh bone and had to spend 18 days in the civic-run KEM Hospital. He also underwent surgery for his injury. “It’s tough to stand for long hours,” he said. Parab now has a temporary job at an office in Marol.Ankita, Parab’s mother, said the family has struggled to make a living during the lockdown. “We had a flower shop that was shut completely. There was no source of income at all. We suffered a lot and did not know how to get money to survive. Aakash got a job but it is temporary and the salary is less. It is extremely difficult to manage,” she said. Ankita has written to the ministry of Railways and the chief minister of Maharashtra, asking for a job for her son, but said she has not received any reply. “I am hoping that the Railways reply and my son manages to get a job,” she said. However, the Railways had clarified previously that it cannot assure any job to anyone injured in the stampede. A compensation of ₹8 lakh was given to the families of those who lost their kin in the tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-years-on-survivors-recall-mumbai-s-elphinstone-stampede/story-ls2aUYip9mzq1zo8SqN6RL.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Inquiry against NCB officer over leak of part of Rhea Chakraborty’s statement to news channel||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has ordered a departmental inquiry against their officer who allegedly leaked a part of actor Rhea Chakraborty’s statement in connection with the drug angle in the Sushant Singh Rajput death to a TV channel. NCB had recorded Chakraborty’s statement for three days after which she was arrested on September 9. Sources said as Chakraborty’s statement was shown on a national television channel, a senior officer confiscated mobile phones of all NCB officials present in Mumbai office, as the picture had the background of NCB’s Mumbai office. The phones were checked and a report was made against the officer concerned and sent to Delhi. The officer was then taken off the investigations and sent to Delhi, said NCB sources. Meanwhile, according to NCB sources, all three actors – Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor – questioned in the connection with the drug link gave almost identical statements, which make it seem that they were tutored by a senior advocate. All the three actors told NCB that they did not use drugs, but only used to chat where they referred to a cigarette as ‘maal’, hashish as ‘patla cigarette’ and marijuana as ‘mota cigarette or roll’, said NCB sources. Sources said Kapoor had brought CBD oil, but she claimed that it was brought for external use, which is not illegal. NCB sources also said the agency was authorised to place phones of suspects under monitoring, and that it had verified several calls of suspects before calling them for statements. Sources also said that phones of several Bollywood personalities were being monitored and they could be called for inquiry soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-inquiry-against-ncb-officer-over-leak-of-part-of-rhea-chakraborty-s-statement-to-news-channel/story-QilDWXp7Cg7fDD5vU2aLRL.html

30-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput didn’t need me to ‘finance’ drug purchases, Rhea Chakraborty tells high court||Refuting the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) allegation that actor Rhea Chakraborty, along with her brother Showik, “financed” the drug purchases of her boyfriend and late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde told the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that “Rajput was in no dearth of funds”. Chakraborty and her brother were arrested on September 9 in connection with the alleged drug angle in Rajput’s death. Justice Sarang Kotwal reserved order on all applications. Arguing for their bail, Maneshinde said: “Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda used to take care of all household expenses, and there was no question of Rhea financing drug purchases for the deceased actor.” Responding to NCB’s accusation that Chakraborty was part of a drug syndicate, Maneshinde said the allegations were merely on the basis of a solitary incident of March 17, when she gave her credit card to Miranda, who withdrew Rs10,000 using it and purchased contraband for the deceased actor. He maintained that no amount was paid directly using Chakraborty’s card to any of the alleged peddlers for procuring drugs and so she can’t be said to be associated with any drug ring. It is an admitted fact that Rajput used to consume drugs even before Chakraborty became acquainted with him in April 2019, and two of Rajput’s co-stars, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor, have reportedly told NCB that he was consuming drugs since long, he said. Maneshinde said Showik too was accused of being part of a drug syndicate for allegedly paying petty amounts on three occasions in April for purchasing minuscule amounts of ganja and charas. The lawyer added that even if one were to go by the allegations levelled by NCB, stringent provisions contained in section 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (financing illicit trafficking of drugs or harbouring offenders) were not at all applicable to Chakraborty or Showik. Maneshinde said NCB’s reliance on recovery of commercial quantity of drugs from one Anuj Keshwani and then the claim that Chakraborty and Showik were part of a drug ring cannot be maintained as neither of them had any connection with the alleged drug supplier. NCB had further alleged that Chakraborty had harboured Rajput who used to consume drugs. Maneshinde contended that during the relevant period, Chakraborty was residing with Rajput in his house and questioned how she could have harboured the late actor in his own house. Advocate Taraq Sayed, who argued for bail of another accused, Abdel Basit Parihar, submitted that NCB has been claiming to have busted a major drug ring by arresting 18-19 college students. He claimed that almost all accused arrested by NCB in this case come from well-to-do families and cannot be termed drug peddlers or suppliers. Sayed submitted that the arrests were made only on the basis of statements recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act, especially when there was hardly any recovery from most of them. He said the statements under section 67 can at the most be used to corroborate recovery from an accused, and not otherwise. Sayed said Parihar is a last-year student of architecture and has missed his examination as he has been arrested by NCB. He added although moralistic argument is being advanced on behalf of NCB as to how society, especially the young generation was affected by the menace of narcotic drugs, in our country, more people die due to smoking than by drug abuse. Maintaining that all alleged transactions involve small quantities of drugs and therefore were bailable, Sayed said all five applicants before HC – Chakraborty, Showik, Miranda, Rajput staffer Dipesh Sawant and Parihar – were entitled to bail as a matter of right. In support of his submission that the offences alleged are bailable, he relied on a 2010 judgment of the Bombay high court holding that all offences under NDPS Act involving small quantities were bailable. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who opposed the bail applications on behalf of NCB, however, submitted that the applicants were under wrong assumption that all offences under the NDPS Act involving small quantity of drugs were bailable. Singh submitted that NDPS Act nowhere states that certain offences were bailable and claimed that all offences under the Act were non-bailable. Justice Kotwal agreed with his submission. The judge pointed to a 1999 judgment of a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, observing that all offences under the NDPS Act were non-bailable, and no other court was therefore authorised to take a different view of the issue. Singh added that so far 19 persons have been arrested by NCB in this case, and all of them were interlinked and connected with each other. Referring to recovery of commercial quantity of drugs from Anuj Keshwani, he said case of none of them can be separated from that of the others. “Drug dealings was a regular affair of the drug syndicate,” Singh said. “Showik was in regular contact with the dealers. Sushant Singh Rajput, the consumer of the drugs, may not be alive today, but persons involved in these deals can’t go scot free only because he is no more.” Singh also responded to Maneshinde’s contention that NCB had no jurisdiction to investigate the case in view of the August 19, 2020 direction of the Supreme Court to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over cases “on the death of Rajput and surrounding circumstances”. Maneshinde had submitted that in the replies filed by NCB to the bail applications of Chakraborty and Showik before the special NDPS court, NCB had in clear terms said it was a fallout of the drug angle in Rajput case. “This case has nothing to do with the death of Sushant Singh Rajput,” said Singh. “It is nobody’s case that Sushant Singh Rajput died due to drug abuse.” The additional solicitor general added that the case was connected to Rajput only to the extent of him being the consumer of drugs, and not otherwise. Besides, it is a settled position of law that an accused cannot choose the agency to investigate offences against him or her, he said. This argument is not available to Chakraborty that the case should have been handed over to CBI for investigation, he said. Chakraborty and Showik moved HC for bail after their bail applications were rejected by the special NDPS court on September 11. The other three accused have approached the court separately after being refused bail by the special court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-had-no-dearth-of-funds-no-question-of-rhea-chakraborty-financing-his-drugs-her-lawyer-in-bombay-high-court/story-WRNMAc8Nucnr4QnuIWUd4M.html
30-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Only six admission rounds to IITs this year, students can report to institute virtually, JoSAA announces||Even as aspirants to the premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are awaiting the release of Joint Entrance Examination-Advanced (JEE-Adv) results on October 5, the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) has already announced few changes to the admission process this year. In a statement released on the official website, JoSAA has stated that there will be only six rounds of seat allotment conducted in 2020 as opposed to seven rounds conducted in the past three years.“JoSAA suggested to limit admissions to only six rounds this year to ensure that the admissions process is over before Diwali and that the new academic session starts immediately after,” said professor Siddhartha Pandey, chairman JEE Adv 2020, IIT-Delhi.JoSAA conducts admissions to IITs, as well as National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and other government-funded technology institutes (GFTIs).He added that another major change in the admissions process this year is that students will not be expected to physically report to their allotted institutes to confirm admissions.“This too was a suggestion by JoSAA, especially keeping in mind the increasing Covid-19 cases. This year students will confirm their admissions by submitting all necessary documents online itself,” added Pandey.Until 2015, JoSAA conducted three rounds of seat allotment, which was increased to six rounds in 2016 to bring down vacancy of seats in IITs. However, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, seven rounds of admissions were conducted but almost all IITs—old or new—had one or more seats vacant by the end of the common admission rounds. Almost 300 seats had remained vacant after six admission rounds across 23 IITs in 2019 which were reallotted in the seventh and final round.“Seat allocation rounds are of no importance after the first three rounds because the top courses in top institutes are already full by then. Students are very ambitious and clear about their choice of course and institute and when they know they haven’t managed to bag the seat they want, they end up opting for a private engineering institute closer home,” said a senior professor and former JoSAA member. He added that this trend has been witnessed across IITs over the last five years, and has been one of the biggest reasons for increasing vacancies in the institutes.Registrations to JoSAA rounds will begin from October 6, a day after the announcement of JEE-Adv results. The first seat allocation list is scheduled to be announced on October 17 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-only-six-admission-rounds-to-iits-this-year-students-can-report-to-institute-virtually-josaa-announces/story-yJa8UPFHi6g3XUJe9APLCI.html

30-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai college is satellite educational centre for Sindhudurg, to offer 2 courses||Patkar-Varde College in Goregaon has become the first satellite education centre for the University of Mumbai. On Friday, the state government approved Sir Sitaram and Lady Shantabai Patkar College and VP Varde College of Commerce and Economics, also known as Patkar-Varde College as the satellite centre for Sindhudurg on a pilot basis.The college can now offer a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in hospitality, catering services and tourism, and Master in tourism and travel management at Kudal. The centre will commence the courses from the academic year 2020-21.The satellite centre has been approved for Pinguli village, which falls within the Mumbai circle, said an official from the state higher and technical education department.The concept of the satellite centre was conceived in the amended Maharashtra Public University Act (MPUA), 2016, as an educational centre that will promote academic curricular and research work in rural Maharashtra. However, this is the first time the state has approved a satellite centre. However, the University of Mumbai senate member Mandar Sawantdesai has alleged that due process was not followed in the appointment of the college as a satellite centre. “Neither the state government’s department of higher and technical education nor the university had published any advertisement inviting applications for starting satellite centre on a pilot basis,” said Sawantdesai. He has written to the governor and chancellor of universities Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Mumbai University vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar, highlighting discrepancies. Sawantdesai said that under the section 109(4)(d) of MPUA, 2016, the government may grant permissions only to such institutes as it may consider fit and proper in its absolute discretion on or before 15th June. However, in exceptional cases and for reasons to be recorded in writing any application not recommended by the university may be approved by the state government. “Has the government recorded any such reasons while approving the above-said pilot project to the said college?,” asked Sawantdesai.Gurunath Pandit, joint secretary, Patkar-Varde college management, said, “We have been following the matter with the government since the MPUA was amended in 2016, but it is only now that the centre has come to fruition. Sindhudurg is a tourism hotspot and we realised that courses in that area will help students from the region. We have good existing infrastructure that we can use for the purpose.” The courses will begin as soon as Covid-19 circumstances improve, he added. An official of the University of Mumbai, on the condition of anonymity, maintained that the selection of the college was done following the guidelines laid down by the state higher and technical education department in a government resolution issued on September 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-college-is-satellite-educational-centre-for-sindhudurg-to-offer-2-courses/story-D7MpU3sFf08Y40a5HjLhPP.html

The woman was assaulted by four men in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh and had been brought to Delhi for treatment. Expressing solidarity with the family of the victim, Asha Devi said, “I just want to tell the mother of the victim that she is not alone and I, and many mother like me are standing with her in her fight for justice for her daughter. I can understand what she is going through because I was in her position eight years ago.” She said that little has changed ever since her daughter was gang-raped in a moving bus eight years ago. “It is upsetting that even after years of fighting for the cause of women’s safety nothing has changed, some other Nirbhaya’s mother is now fighting. Governments change but situation remains the same.”Also read| ‘We hoped she will survive’: Unease shrouds Hathras rape victim’s villageShe also questioned the action taken by the investigating agencies and said that this incident would have become another statistic, if the woman had not lost her life and the “incident had not hit headlines”. “How many daughters will have to die before some action is taken?” she asked.Hundreds of protesters gathered at Gate number 5 of Safdarjung hospital, close to the emergency wing, soon after the 19-year-old victim was declared dead. By evening the crowd had swelled to at least 300 people, which included members of the Aam Aadmi Party, the Congress and the Bheem Army. However, no one was arrested or detained from outside the hospital and no medical services were obstructed by the gatherers as the protest remained peaceful, said senior police officers.Leading the protests outside the hospital, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said he has appealed to all members of the Dalit community to take to the streets and demand death penalty for the guilty. “The government should not test our patience. We won’t rest until the culprits are hanged,” he said.The protesters even lit candles and raised slogans demanding justice for the rape victim.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said around 2.30pm, members of Indian Youth Congress and other units of the party tried to reach the Raisina Hill near Vijay Chowk to stage a protest, demanding harsh punishment for the accused.“The protest at Vijay Chowk was led by Amrita Dhawan, president, Delhi Mahila Congress. 22 men and 14 women were detained and removed from the spot. As the protesters violated prohibitory orders in force due to Covid-19 they were booked under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act. A case was registered against them at Parliament Street police station,” said Singhal.According to the police, some protesters attempted to block the Ring Road in front of the hospital. Senior police officers, including the joint commissioner of police had reached the spot to control the situation. The traffic was obstructed for a short time but the protesters were removed from the main road using additional police force, police said.In the evening, as more people started to join the victim’s family members outside the hospital, a team of Uttar Pradesh police left the hospital with the body of the rape victim while her family was still at the hospital. “The UP police team was escorted till the state border under heavy security to ensure there is no law and order situation,” said a police officer, who wished not to be named.In order to ensure that the gathering outside the hospital doesn’t swell further, Delhi police had to even announce that Safdarjung hospital is a Covid-19 designated hospital and that such a gathering may result in mass transmission of the virus.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya said after the family members left, the protesters were also completely dispersed by 9.30pm. “No one was arrested or detained from outside Safdarjung hospital. It was ensured throughout that the hospital services are nor obstructed in anyway,” he said.Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj, who had also reached Safdarjung hospital, accused that Delhi MLA Ajay Dutt, who is also a local Dalit leader, was beaten up by Delhi Police officials.“The relatives of the victim have been calling me, complaining that they are neither being allowed to come to Delhi nor being given any information about the body,” Bharadwaj alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protests-at-safdarjung-delhi-braveheart-s-mother-says-nothing-has-changed/story-O5PTKMMj5zpLM863C1BHrL.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi cop arrested for shooting friend, killing father-in-law||The Delhi Police sub-inspector, who allegedly shot dead his 62-year-old father-in-law in Rohtak’s Bhainsi village on Monday morning, nearly 12 hours after he shot at his woman friend in Delhi’s Alipur, was arrested from Rohini Sector-3 area on Tuesday morning. Investigators said sub-inspector Sandeep Dahiya was arrested nearly three hours after he forwarded a note titled “Dying Declaration” on the WhatApp group of his batchmates, explaining the circumstances that allegedly forced him to commit the crimes. He also shared his location in the purported note, saying he was contemplating to kill himself, said members of the team which arrested Dahiya. According to investigators, Dahiya has confessed to have used his service pistol to kill his father-in-law, Ranbir Singh, and injuring his woman friend. The pistol was found in his possession with four out of the 10 cartridges that were allotted to him by the Lahori Gate police station, where he was posted since December 2017. While Singh was shot in his forehead and died instantly, the woman suffered three bullet wounds in her right shoulder and arm. Her condition is stated to be stable. Police officers said two bullets had fallen on the road when Dahiya was loading the gun at the spot in Alipur where the woman was shot at following an argument. A passerby, Satbir, also suffered a shrapnel injury in his leg, the officials said. Another Delhi Police sub-inspector, Jaiveer, posted at Shahbad Dairy police station, had spotted the woman lying on the side of the road while he was crossing the Sai Mandir on the G T Karnal road and had taken her to a nearby hospital. On the way, the woman had revealed that she has been shot by Dahiya.Dahiya’s wife had told the Rohtak police that they had been living separately for some time due to strained marital relations and also alleged that her husband had earlier threatened that he would kill her father. The Rohtak Police on Monday had said Ranbir was cleaning a drain outside his house when he was shot. A CCTV camera installed in the street showed an SUV with a Delhi registration number, leaving the area after the crime was committed.“Ballistic experts will examine the pistol to verify Dahiya’s claims,” a police officer associated with the case said, requesting anonymity. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said Dahiya’s location in Rohini Sector-3 was tracked through “technical and manual investigation”. “Our teams spotted his white Duster car parked in an unauthorised parking space near the M2K shopping mall but Dahiya was missing. They laid a trap and caught him when he came to take his car,” said Alphonse. “We produced Dahiya before a magistrate that sent him to judicial custody. The two investigating officers (IOs) in the two cases – Alipur and Rohtak – may secure his custody from the court for investigation,” he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Meham (Rohtak Police) DSP Shamsher Dahiya, said, “We will approach the local court here after the accused will be sent to judicial custody. Then, the court will issue production warrant against Sandeep Dahiya.” The Rohtak police have registered a case of murder against Dahiya. Police said Dahiya spend two nights in his car and survived mostly on apples and bottled water. After shooting his woman friend on Sunday evening, Dahiya fled to Rohtak. After killing his father-in-law, he went to Kundli and spent the Monday night there in his car, before reaching Delhi on Tuesday morning. Dahiya kept his mobile phone switched off throughout the two days and switched it on Tuesday morning to send the purported “dying declaration” note, mostly written in Hindi, said another officer privy to the investigation. HT has seen the note but could not independently verify its authenticity. However, speaking on the condition of anonymity, senior police officers confirmed that the note was sent by Dahiya. In the WhatsApp note, Dahiya has blamed his dead father-in-law for ruining his married life. “I tried to save my married life for four years. But my wife was under her father’s influence and he destroyed my family. He tried to take half of my salary but could not succeed,” another investigator said, quoting Dahiya’s note. Dahiya’s wife Rajesh Devi demanded “harsh punishment” for him. “This man had ruined my life and he had always had a questionable character. I urge the police to take strict action against him,” she added. Police said, in his purported note, Dahiya claimed that if wanted to go untraceable the police would not be able to find him. He also gave locations of important documents kept in his house as well as the password of his laptop. He also claimed “harassment” by his woman friend and said no member of his family should be held responsible for his actions. Dahiya had joined the Delhi Police in 2006 as a constable and became a sub-inspector in 2010 after clearing an examination. He was residing at Shalimar Bagh Police Colony. He was on medical rest for two days and joined duty on Friday. Since he has been the division officer, 9MM pistol with 10 rounds was allotted to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-cop-arrested-for-shooting-friend-killing-father-in-law/story-wCjrGFOO5k6awVTFOBbl9M.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Laptop stolen from MLA Raghav Chadha’s car||New Delhi: Two unidentified men allegedly broke a window glass of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha’s car and stole his laptop in west Delhi’s Naraina Vihar on Monday night. The police said that they have registered a case of theft.According to the police, the incident took place between 9.30 pm and 10 pm, when Shivam Aggarwal, a staff at Chadha’s office in Delhi Jal Board – of which Chadha is the vice-chairperson – had parked it outside his house in Naraina Vihar. After some time, a security guard from the area noticed that one of the glasses of the car was broken and he alerted the neighbours.“The neighbours called Aggarwal. He came out to check on the Swift Dzire car and found that a laptop that was kept in the car was missing. The theft was then reported to the police,” said a police officer who wished not to be identified.The officer said during initial investigations CCTV footage of nearby areas were checked and two suspects have been spotted. “It looks like they are thieves who operate in the locality. Efforts to track them are in progress,” the officer added.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said a case of theft has been registered to probe the matter. “Multiple teams have been formed to track the suspects at the earliest,” he said.In a letter to Delhi police commissioner SN Srivastava on Tuesday, Chadha said, “Some unknown assailants broke the windowpane of the car into pieces and whisked away with my laptop containing sensitive data along with other crucial documents kept in the car. Pursuantly, he was immediately found forced to call the PCR where after he got his statement recorded.”The vehicle is registered in Chadha’s name, the MLA said in his letter to the commissioner which HT has seen.In his letter to the commissioner, Chadha also mentioned “earlier instances” of the attack on him by “assailants adopting almost similar modus-operandi” but did not elaborate further about specific instances. “There is an unholy nexus of anti-social elements to disrupt law and order and also create an alarm to me through such belligerent and wicked planning in order to satiate their evil motives,” said the letter.In a separate statement to the media, Chadha said: “The brazen attack on a sitting MLA’s car, that too in an area like Naraina Vihar, bears testimony to the crumbling law and order situation in Delhi... It reflects blatant impudence of offenders. It begs a serious question that if vehicles of legislators and official functionaries are attacked in this fashion, and they are put to constant threat and a state of fear, then what would be the plight of a common man?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/laptop-stolen-from-mla-raghav-chadha-s-car/story-cWW5UrTN2tBrDfhA5O5iXI.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Now, pay to pick a DDA flat of your choice||To ensure a good response to its next housing scheme, which is likely to be announced by the end of this year, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday approved a proposal to allow applicants to select the location of a flat by paying a preferential location charge (PLC) -- a practice common in private residential projects in NCR cities.For the first time, an applicant can choose the location of the flat (floor level, corner flat, facing the green area, etc) by paying between 1.5% and 3% of the total cost of the apartment, if they are successful in the draw of lots conducted by the DDA for the housing scheme.The decision was taken at the authority’s meeting chaired by Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, along with other important announcements regarding in-situ slum redevelopment, relaxation in parking norms for state bhawans and state guest houses, land use changes, etc.The preferential location charges approved by the DDA are -- 3% of the total cost of the flat for the ground floor, 2.5% for flats facing green areas, 2.5% for flats on the first floor, 2% for corner flats and 1.5% for second-floor flats. An applicant can opt for multiple preferences and will have to pay accordingly, said a DDA official aware of the development. For instance, for a first-floor flat facing a green area, an allottee will have to pay 5% of the total cost of the house as PLC.This is for the first time the land-owning agency has introduced such a provision, which till now was available only for projects offered by private developers and is quite common in NCR cities such as Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram. “Till now, we used to allow applicants to give their location preference and we didn’t charge anything for it. But with this, applicants can choose better. The charges are not much. We are working out the details and necessary changes will be made in the draw of lots process. This will be done for the first time in the next housing scheme. No preferential location charges for the floor will be charged for allotment of ground or preferred floor to persons with a disability,” said the official.The DDA has nearly 10,000-15,000 flats lying vacant and around 40,000 flats in various stages of construction. The land-owning agency has flats either ready or nearing completion in Dwarka, Jasola Vihar and Narela. In the next housing scheme, DDA plans to bring 400 MIG in Jasola Vihar and 200 HIG flats Dwarka.The last housing scheme was announced in 2019 in which 18,000 flats were initially put on sale. But when it did not get the desired response, DDA reduced the number of flats on offer from 18,000 to 10, 294, of which only 8,438 were sold.While DDA officials say this is being done to help applicants, Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with the authority, said, “DDA’s mandate is not to make a profit but to provide affordable housing to people. By allowing people to select the location by paying PLC, they are denying an opportunity to those who don’t have money to pay such charges. Under the previous allotment, all applicants had equal opportunity to get a first or a ground floor.”Urban planners are divided. While some say it is against the mandate of DDA, others say it necessary to change the norms to remain relevant. AK Jain, former planning commission with DDA, said, “It is a good move, as it will give people a choice to opt for a location, floor. etc., of their choice. It will also help DDA ensure better response to its housing scheme. This is a common practice by private developers.”In-situ rehabIn another important decision, the land-owning agency on Tuesday allowed private developers involved in in-situ redevelopment projects under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to decide the type of development in the remunerative component and use floor area ratio up to 300.It is through the remunerative component, which is on 40% of the total area, that developers recover the cost of the in-situ project and provide houses to slum dwellers at affordable rates.“Currently, developers had to plan the remunerative project as per the prevailing land use. Due to this, some projects were not financially viable for the developer,” said an official.A decision was also taken to amend the ‘Nazul rule’ to allow group housing plots to be auctioned to private developers and organisations to meet the city’s housing requirement. The DDA had advertised for the auction of nine group housing plots in January and May but had to withdraw due to technical reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-pay-to-pick-a-dda-flat-of-your-choice/story-Jo3UsFYmE9Esp2STK3jSYL.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||North civic body mayor suspends 22 councillors, AAP says it’s undemocratic||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor on Tuesday suspended 22 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillors for creating a ruckus and disrupting the proceedings of the corporation’s House. As per the mayor’s order, the suspended councillors will not be allowed to attend the next three House meetings.AAP senior leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the councillors were suspended “undemocratically” and that they will hold a day-long sit-in protest on Wednesday outside the North MCD mayor Jai Prakash’s office, demanding roll back of the suspension order.The AAP has 30 councillors in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The House convened on Tuesday to discuss the financial crunch being faced by the civic body and ways to boost revenue to pay salaries to 55,000 employees and dues of over 20,000 pensioners. “I had given the AAP councillors a warning even in the previous House meetings to not raise slogans and allow the proceedings to go on peacefully. However, today again when such an important issue was being discussed, they continued to raise slogans and came into the well of the House. I will not allow them to attend the proceedings of the House for the next three meetings,” said Jai Prakash. The cash-strapped civic body has been unable to pay salaries of its employees including doctors, nursing staff, paramedics, teachers as well as safai karamcharis. Leader of the Opposition in the North Corporation and AAP councillor Vikas Goel said the AAP members were raising relevant questions but they were not allowed to participate in the discussion. “We had filed a short notice to discuss the various sources of revenue such as the recovery of payments from parking contractors, among others. They did not take up the discussion even towards the end of proceedings,” said Goel. Pathak said the AAP councillors wanted to fix accountability for the poor financial condition of the civic body. “The BJP is so scared that they are trying to muzzle AAP’s voice. Today, Delhi is the dirtiest city of India and the AAP wanted to discuss this matter with the mayor. We also pointed out that the budget of all the MCDs is around Rs 18,000 crore but the municipal staff are not getting paid for the past several months. The AAP councillors wanted to know where the money went,” Pathak said addressing a press conference.Pathak said the suspension means that the AAP councillors will not be able to attend the House for the next three months because the North MCD House usually meets only once a month. Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Kejriwal government owes crores of rupees to the three municipal corporations.”It is because of sheer political malice that the Delhi government has neither released the entire funds allocated to the MCDs of their budget and whatever fund is given, it is not given on time,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-civic-body-mayor-suspends-22-councillors-aap-says-it-s-undemocratic/story-5aEKPNwjmPvFDfpvWjWHHJ.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||7 state agencies owe DJB Rs 6,811 crore in bills: Raghav Chadha||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said seven government agencies, including the three municipal corporations, have not paid water and sewerage dues for years, amounting to Rs 6,811 crore. The DJB issued show cause and recovery notices to all departments, asking them to pay the dues at the earliest. Chadha said the Covid-19 pandemic had hit the economy hard and so it was imperative for the Delhi government to recover all its dues.The seven agencies are the Indian Railways, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Delhi Police and the North, East and South Delhi municipal corporations. “The Indian Railways, managed by the Central government, owes the highest dues -- Rs 3,283 crore. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation owes the second-highest dues, amounting to Rs 2,466 crore,” Chadha said at a press conference on Tuesday.The Indian Railways spokesperson did not comment on the matter. North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash reacting over the DJB notice said, “Firstly, the DJB cannot charge commercial fee on water and sewerage from a municipal corporation, as we providing public services. Secondly, they owe us at least ₹300 crore as compensation for cutting roads. Besides, they also owe us house tax for all their buildings, the amount of which will also run into crores.”Despite repeated attempts, the DDA and CPWD could not be reached for a comment. “Delhi Police is yet to pay bills of Rs 614 crore while the CPWD and the DDA owe Rs 190 crore and Rs 128 crore, respectively. The East and South corporations owe Rs 49 crore and Rs 81 crore, respectively,” he said. The notices were issued to the departments between September 1 and September 15 under relevant sections of the Delhi Water Board Act. The agencies are required to pay the dues within 40 days of the receipt of the notices, said Chadha. He said if the agencies fail to pay the dues in time, the DJB will be forced to use penal provisions to recover the money. “The pandemic and all of the other factors, cumulatively, have put the DJB in a precarious situation. If the dues are not cleared within the stipulated time, the board shall be constrained and left with no other option but to initiate coercive action until the full and final payment is recovered,” said Chadha. Chadha said these were unprecedented times and every government department was having a hard time in managing finances. The DJB had its own financial liabilities and needed to recover these dues in order to keep providing the essential water and sewerage services, he said. A senior police officer said they will look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-govt-agencies-owe-rs-6-811-crore-to-djb-as-water-and-sewage-dues/story-ZeuWRxvIWZhYsSltUiCSEK.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Four Youth Congress office holders among five more held for burning tractor at India Gate||The Delhi Police has arrested five more people, including the Punjab Youth Congress president Brinder Singh Dhillon, who had allegedly led the group that had set afire a tractor at India Gate on Monday morning. On Monday, around 7.30 am, Dhillon and 20-25 others had set a tractor on fire at Rajpath near India Gate lawns in support of the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the newly passed farm laws. The police on Tuesday also wrote to Punjab Police, demanding action against four Punjab Police personnel who had allegedly escorted the group of protesters to India Gate on Monday morning.Police said of the five men arrested on Tuesday, four are affiliated with the Youth Congress. Apart from Dhillon, who was arrested from a luxury hotel in Delhi, the others were identified as Harish Panwar, national general secretary of All India Youth Congress; Abraham Roy Mani, national general secretary of the All India Youth Congress; and Bunty Shelke, secretary of the All India Youth Congress, who is also in charge of Punjab Youth Congress.Police also arrested a driver, Omprakash, a resident of Pathankot, who had come to Delhi with the other protesters.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said police received information that Dhillon was staying at a city hotel. “We sent our team there and he was arrested. Based on the information he gave, the other three Youth Congress members were arrested from different parts of the city. They have all been charged under Section 3 of the Epidemic Act, 51(B) Disaster Management Act, Section 4 of the Damage to Public Property Act, and under relevant Indian Penal Code sections for creating mischief by fire, and obstructing public way, among others.Singhal confirmed that the Delhi Police has also written to Punjab Police on Tuesday, demanding disciplinary action against four policemen who had escorted Dhillon and others in uniform up to India Gate. Punjab Youth Congress vice president Gurjot Singh Dhindsa said they have no regrets and are ready to face any legal action. “We are fighting for the rights of Punjab farmers. Another protest is being planned Delhi but I cannot share details,” he said.Police said the group was not stopped by any policemen as they were accompanied by policemen and, hence, could successfully reach Rajpath, where the tractor was set afire.Police had arrested five men on Monday. The men had even raised slogans of ‘Jai jawan jai kisan’ and ‘Bhagat Singh amar rahein’ in support of the farmers’ agitation . The protesters went live on social media and clicked group pictures alongside the burning tractor. They were also carrying a picture of Bhagat Singh, police said.Following the incident, the Delhi Police has stepped up security in and around India Gate. The police have also tightened security across the city’s borders last week, amid the ongoing farmers’ protest in Punjab and Haryana against the newly passed farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-youth-congress-office-holders-among-five-more-held-for-burning-tractor-at-india-gate/story-dUKLBU7CrEa79LJhyRxyTN.html
30-09-2020||Delhi||Centre convenes meeting to review anti-pollution steps||With farm fires flaring in parts of Punjab and Haryana, the Centre has called a meeting of several states’ environment ministers on October 1, which will also be attended by state pollution control boards and municipal authorities, to review air pollution control measures states and Centre formulated in 2016. However, senior officials warned that prevailing discontentment against the farm bills may render tackling stubble burning an uphill task this year as well.Officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board said 350 stubble fire cases have been identified in the state since September 21 this year, even as month-long trials of the microbial consortium — developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute, are underway in the state, as well as Haryana. The consortium helps decompose stubble without the need for straw management machinery — the purchase of which is a major hurdle for small and marginal farmers, thereby hindering the mitigation of stubble fires. In 2019, the Supreme Court had asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to pay Rs100 per quintal of crop as an incentive to paddy farmers who have not burnt stubble on their fields, but that plan hasn’t been implemented yet.Punjab is in talks with Centre to make funds available for the incentive. “The Punjab government has sought the Centre’s support for the incentive. The government is very serious about tracking down violators. Around 8,000 people have been deployed at the village and district levels to track fires. Machinery is being made available to all farmers, especially marginal farmers,” said Karunesh Garg, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary. Just around 25% of farmers in Haryana have access to straw management machinery, senior state officials said. “We are providing subsidised equipment to individuals and cooperatives for the in-situ management of crop stubble. We are also providing ₹1,000 per acre subsidy for farmers choosing ex-situ options (like using for fodder). Our assessment is that 25% farmers have access to straw management machinery. For marginal farmers even rentals are not being charged by cooperative societies. So, we are expecting a reduction in fires,” said Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary of Haryana’s agriculture and farmers’ welfare department.Javadekar on Tuesday said he will speak about the farm bill agitation and the issue of air pollution from stubble fires separately and said the two are not to be discussed together. “We came up with short-term, medium term and long-term plans to control pollution in 2016. We plan to review implementation of those plans and assess preparedness for this winter,” Javadekar said.He added that two meetings with northwestern states was also held in the past month — one headed by the cabinet secretary, and another by the principal secretary to the Prime Minister. Javadekar said the Centre had accepted the air pollution problem and brought out policies to deal with it over the past four years. “The PM brought out the national air quality index (NAQI) so that people can easily understand pollution levels. The Badarpur power plant was shut down, the Sonepat thermal power plant was also phased out, we built the peripheral expressway which was pending for 15 years. The Eastern Peripheral Expressway ensured that 60,000 trucks which passed through Delhi polluting it to reach other states could bypass Delhi, BS- 6 emission standards have been introduced and BS VI fuel is also available. We introduced the Waste Management Rules, 2016, which include rules for construction and demolition waste, 3000 industries in NCR have got piped gas supply. So, we are working on all fronts,” Javadekar said, adding that ICAR will conduct various trials this year to curb crop stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-convenes-meeting-to-review-anti-pollution-steps/story-YQWOWJ6XmbEFibSFpo9TDP.html

During the first two weeks, PMC areas reported, on average, 1,900 positive cases daily. Now that has dropped to 1,500 per day. Experts are hoping it will drop further, but the main challenge in front of us is now the Navratri festival,” said Rao, who, along with municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and district collector Rajesh Deshmukh held a joint online press conference on Tuesday.To avoid a the repeat of the post-Ganesh festival scenario, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar warned citizens not to step out of their homes unnecessarily. The warning came even as the Maharashtra government asked for the Navratri and Dussehra festivals to be celebrated in a low-key manner.The government has also prohibited dandiya, which attracts a large number of revellers for all nine days of Navratri. “If citizens do not follow the guidelines and instructions given by the government, again there will be a surge,” said Kumar. According to Rao, with cases coming down, the city’s positivity ratio this week is at 24%. “I would like to appeal sincerely to citizens to follow the guidelines and celebrate Navratri at home only. If people do not roam, we will be able to bring down the numbers, otherwise there will be a surge again, putting pressure on medical manpower and the administration,” said Rao. Vikram Kumar said, “During the Ganesh festival, people visited each other and travelled to nearby places. Immediately after the festival, positive cases increased in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/post-ganesh-fest-surge-has-civic-admin-sounding-stay-home-alarm-for-navratri/story-KjlDy4YcgR0HRIfRlKEGQN.html

In fact, until our hospital has processed maximum claims under the scheme for which we were appreciated by the MPJAY scheme. We immediately intimate the patient that the refund has been sanctioned under the scheme and that they can collect their cheque. Also, across the hospital we have also put up banners to provide all information to the relatives. We have proof to counter this claim.” The son of the 75-year-old woman who died due to Covid-19 alleged that the hospital charged for treatment and applied for the MPJAY scheme.The relative alleged that the hospital also refused to refund the money until a local politician intervened. However, Dr Bharati claims, “The patient’s relatives did not submit any documents until we followed up on the matter.”The 48-year-old man, son of the deceased, said, “I admitted my mother to the hospital in Kharadi on August 12 at 11:30 pm and we got to know that she is Covid-19 positive. She was in critical care and needed a ventilator. Unfortunately, she died within 24 hours on August 13. We had submitted Rs 35,000 during admission and after the death, the hospital refunded Rs 5,760 the very next day. However, a few days ago I got a call from a government official who said that my mother’s treatment would be covered under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Yojana. The hospital did not inform me about the same. Later, when I investigated, I got to know that the hospital did get the funds from the scheme and did not refund my money.”MNS leader Vasant More said, “The hospital refunded the amount after I intervened in the matter. We had to talk to the hospital authorities who later paid back Rs 16,000 under the sanction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/addl-civic-chief-orders-inquiry-into-allegations-of-mis-mgmt-of-mpjy-at-pvt-hosp/story-CpQ6MSFARyZtQPIvcLccCN.html

That figure touched 7,500 passengers on September 25. The latest figures released by airport authorities show that 2,61,320 passengers have arrived in the city between May 25 and September 25. However, 2,82,847 passengers departed from the city during the same period. According to the Lohegaon Airport authorities, on September 25, the airport recorded its highest footfall in terms of passengers in four months, to and fro, a total of 7,500.“There has been an increase in the number of flights from Pune and also the number of passengers flying have increased during the last four months,” said Kuldeep Singh, director, Lohegaon Airport.Dhairyasheel Vandekar, an aviation analyst, said, “The central government is taking strong steps to ensure strict implementation of Covid-19 travel guidelines. Traveller numbers this year will increase gradually. At least air traffic has increased after the reopening and this figure is likely to up in the next few months.” According to Lohegaon airport authorities, from October 26, the runaway will be available for 12 hours only due to re-carpeting of the surface.

The votes will be counted on November 10. As per the Representation of People Act, an assembly byelection must be conducted within six months of creation of the vacancy. However, the bypolls were delayed due to the pandemic. Section 151-A of the Act provides that the EC, in consultation with the central government, can defer the byelection if it certifies that it is difficult to hold the polls within the said period. As per the schedule announced by the EC, a notification will be issued on October 10 and the nomination process will start on the same day. The last date for filing nominations is October 16. The nominations will be scrutinised on October 17. The last date for withdrawing is October 19.With the EC announcing the poll schedule, model code of conduct has been enforced in Sonepat. Earlier, Haryana’s chief electoral officer had sent a report on the prevalence of Covid infection in the district. The district has around 8,000 cumulative cases and stands third in the state. As per the EC’s broad guidelines for conduct of general and byelections amid the pandemic, there shall be a maximum of 1,000 electors instead of 1,500 at a polling station.Campaigning guidelines The EC has stipulated that only a group of five people, including the candidate, but excluding security personnel will be allowed to participate in door-to-door campaigning.
