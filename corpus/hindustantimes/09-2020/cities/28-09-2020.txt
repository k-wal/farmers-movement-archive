The exercise will take stock of available cold chain equipment (CCE), such as walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-lined refrigerators and temperature-monitoring devices, which are used in the storage and transportation of vaccines. The assessment will also identify potential sites for bulk storage of vaccines, known as cold chain points (CCP).Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer and nodal officer for cold chain management in Gurugram, said, “We have not received an official intimation about the same, but are aware that Central orders have been issued earlier this month. As soon as we get the order from the state National Health Mission, we shall begin the task.” Prabjot Singh, mission director, NHM, Haryana, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.A senior doctor working with the NHM’s Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) in Haryana, seeking anonymity, confirmed that as per a central NHM order issued earlier this month, all states and union territories in India will be expected to create district-level plans for storage and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines within the next month. Task forces to oversee this preparation are expected to be constituted at the district- and block-levels. “The main challenge in the delivery of this vaccine will be the immunisation coverage. The target population for our routine immunisation drives is confined to infants, children and mothers. With Covid-19, we have to vaccinate the population at large, which has not been done before,” the official said, adding that the vaccine would likely be administered in phases, beginning with health workers and high-risk groups. Health department officials in the district added that in addition to assessing the availability of cold chain infrastructure, they will also be making plans to train an adequate number of qualified technicians in cold chain management. “Retaining the integrity of the vaccine requires its storage at a certain temperature. Otherwise, it will lose its efficiency. We will need to identify and train qualified cold chain managers, cold chain handlers and cold chain technicians for this purpose,” said Garg. Gurugram district, which currently has 39 existing CCPs for storage and delivery of vaccines, also serves as the regional storage point for immunisation programs in four other districts, namely Faridabad, Rewari, Palwal and Jhajjar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-department-to-assess-storage-infrastructure-for-possible-covid-19-vaccine/story-KlM1YKxaWr0L0xDOy2vimM.html

The police said the accused driver was arrested on Sunday evening and released on bail. The deceased has been identified as Devendra Kumar, a resident of Pratap Nagar, who ran a photo studio shop on Khandsa Road. According to the police, the incident took place around 11.30pm when Kumar was on his way to his house and had reached near Raj Nagar crossing. The police said a speeding car arrived at the crossing from an approach lane and hit his scooter from the side, as a result of which he fell on the road. According to footage from a CCTV, the police said he was thrown from his scooter upon impact and collided with a pole and suffered serious injuries. The incident was reported after the victim’s wife called on his phone to check on him and the phone was answered by a commuter, who informed her of the incident. The victim’s brother, Manish Kumar, said, in the complaint, “A commuter informed us that passersby had taken him to a hospital on Basai Road. His scooter was completely damaged in the collision. We reached the hospital and decided to shift him to another private hospital since his injuries were serious. He was declared dead on arrival by doctors.” The police said they found the number plate of the accused man’s car from the spot and traced the driver on Sunday evening. “The number plate of the car fell off after the collision and with the help of regional transport authority officials, the accused man was traced and arrested. During preliminary questioning, he said that he had just gotten off a phone call and was running late. As such, he got confused between some lanes. He did not notice the victim coming from the side. He was released on bail on Sunday,” said a police official, requesting anonymity. A case was registered against the accused man under sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Shivaji Nagar police station on Sunday, said the police. Last week, a three-year-old boy died after a SUV had crashed into a rickshaw he was travelling in near Sector 37D and a 35-year-old carpenter died while his friend suffered minor injuries after a car had brushed against their motorcycle on Golf Course Road (GCR) in DLF Cyber City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/40-year-old-man-killed-in-a-hit-and-run-mishap-on-khandsa-road/story-AQoDgxLg6uteJ1M1Bgt7WK.html
28-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government forms committee to probe illegal abortion cases||The Maharashtra government on Monday formed a four-member committee to investigate cases of illegal abortions at hospitals across the state. The committee, which will be headed by retired IPS officer Ajit Parasnis, has been mandated to submit its report within a month after an incident and also make recommendations to stop them. Parasnis is the former director general of police (DGP) and retired from the position in 2011. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director health services; an expert professor in gynaecology and an assistant director of health services will be the other three members of the committee. Under the existing laws, abortions can’t be conducted after the 20-week limit. Despite that, Dr Varsha Lahade, a gynaecologist at Nashik civil hospital, was accused of having carried out an abortion on a 24-week-old foetus in March 2017. The gynaecologist and another resident doctor were booked by the Nashik police under sections of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act and the Indian Penal Code. The same year, the police had found 19 female foetuses from a sewer in a village in Sangli district of western Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-forms-committee-to-probe-illegal-abortion-cases/story-yjbEDj37mTilVnJoPuyWZN.html

28-09-2020||City||Gurugram: New cycle tracks between HUDA City Centre and Bakhtawar Chowk from October 2||Gurugram: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to ramp up cycling infrastructure in the city. To start with, new cycle tracks between HUDA City Centre (HCC) and Bakhtawar Chowk, along Netaji Subhash Marg, will be opened for use on October 2, said GMDA officials on Monday.  The officials said that they plan to establish around 650 kilometres of dedicated cycle lanes across the city as part of the authority’s strategy to promote non-motorised transport.VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, said that the city roads are currently built not keeping the right of way (ROW) of cyclists and pedestrians in mind, and hence, with basic engineering changes, steps needed to be undertaken to ensure they are given an adequate share of the road space.“We are starting with the setting up cycle tracks along both sides of Netaji Subhash Marg as a pilot project. We will be examining its day-to-day progress carefully to understand both the positives and negatives of the project, and accordingly undertake corrective measures before setting up cycle tracks in other parts of the city,” said Kundu. The public body is aiming at setting up cycle tracks at 17 junctions across the city in the coming months. “HCC is both the terminating and starting point of Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line and hence, has one of the highest concentration of people anywhere in the city. Initially, the cycle track project would all originate from HCC towards other major road networks such as MG Road, Signature Towers, and Golf Course Road. Subsequently, we will cover other parts of the city,” said Kundu.As per Kundu, it was easy to select Netaji Subhash Marg for the pilot project, as service lanes already existed on both sides of the five-kilometre stretch. “The stretch already has service lanes on either carriageway that are separated by medians. In patches, the service lanes are not there primarily due to illegal encroachments, which have been removed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). To protect cyclists from fast-moving traffic, concrete bollards will be placed at these patches,” said Kundu.The officials said work on the Netaji Subhash Marg project is further divided into two phases. “In the first phase, cycle tracks are being set up, while in the second phase, the three junctions along the stretch would be re-engineered to become both pedestrian- and cycle-friendly,” said an official privy to the matter.Kundu said that with the construction of an underpass and flyover at HCC, the cycle tracks would initially be covered 200-300 metres short of the junction, and would be later extended once both the projects are completed. He further said that GMDA and MCG, in consultation with Raahgiri Foundation, are working together on setting up cycle lanes across the city.All master roads and stretches which carry traffic from one city to the other, such as Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, Golf Course Road, and Golf Course Extension Road fall under GMDA’s jurisdiction. Arterial roads are stretches that carry traffic between one or two sectors/villages and they fall within the MCG’s jurisdiction. MCG on Sunday had asked Gurugram residents on its official Twitter handle to share over social media the challenges and concerns they face while cycling in the city, so that the civic body can undertake steps to improve the existing infrastructure. “We have asked residents for their feedback on the problems they face while cycling in the city so that we can use their inputs, and accordingly execute changes on ground and improve cycle mobility across the city. We are working on multiple aspects to enhance cycling infrastructure,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.There have been two attempts at creating cycle tracks across the city in the past. In October 2017, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had built cycle tracks on service lanes around Signature Towers, Rajiv Chowk, and Iffco Chowk, inexplicably, without any fencing or barricading. The entire cycle lanes are left completely in the open. Only a white line, along with a few cycle symbols, had been painted on the road to demarcate the space meant for cyclists on the carriageway. As part of its Raahgiri initiative, MCG had also built cycle tracks along Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and Saint Thomas Marg in February 2016. Along both the stretches, MCG had placed concrete bollards to protect cyclists from fast-moving traffic. However, within a month, the bollards had been broken or removed at several points altogether and made way for illegal auto-rickshaw stands and small shanties.“The biggest deterrent to cycling is unsafe infrastructure. The under-construction segregated cycle track is a step in the right direction. A network of cycle tracks, along with bicycle parking facilities, can usher in a revolution of sorts on promoting cycling not only in Gurugram but also the rest of the state,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri Foundation.Meanwhile, cyclist enthusiasts have welcomed the GMDA’s move. “My father was in the Army. I used to cycle every day within the army cantonment area. It was my favourite workout. However, when I moved to Gurugram, I tried cycling a few times and found it to be extremely unsafe. If there are dedicated cycle tracks, then I can resume my favourite activity once again,” said Sandeep Kumar, a cyclist enthusiast who resides in Sector 49.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-new-cycle-tracks-between-huda-city-centre-and-bakhtawar-chowk-from-october-2/story-yJqMUzeMPVUMMJvypOeV2K.html
28-09-2020||Chandigarh||On their canvas of life, artists explore with themes of struggle, hard work||For artists in the city, the Covid-19 period has been a time of reflection, when demand for art has ebbed at a dismal low, but left many with the steely determination to survive. Experiences of seniors, therefore, definitely act as balm to younger artists who have yet to find their moorings. Walk into the studio of senior painter Madan Lal, whose works have won recognition nationally and internationally, and one finds hundreds of paintings and sketches lining the shelves and cupboards and an easel never without a work in progress. A 1987 graduate from the Government College of Art, Lal says: “Life is never free of struggle, but survival is the key word. The prices that I am being offered of late by national galleries after the Covid outbreak are 50% less than what I was getting earlier. I do accept this and sometimes when I work for architects I am asked to match the colour of the art piece with the sofa upholstery and I go with it for I have to continue working as a freelancer now.”Once out of college, Lal started freelancing with advertising agencies and it was only in 1990 that he got a job as the director of the Design Centre. Ups and downs continued as he left soon after to pursue painting full time, moonlighting in between at an institute of fashion and design to make ends meet. Reminiscing, he adds: “When I was a student the college faculty was supportive and told us about the ways to survive, which is not the case now and students with masters of fine arts degrees find themselves at a loose end.”Photographer Diwan Manna, who is also chairperson of the Punjab Lalit Kala Akademi and has worked for years as a freelancer, says: “I did all kinds of things to survive, including wedding photography, which meant walking on the roads of the city with wedding processions and clicking pictures or taking up a small assignment as a programme manager. Even now I sustain myself by doing industrial photography. Such is the condition of artists not just in India but all over the world. Only a handful manage to sell big and very often after their lifetime.”Sidharth, a 1981 graduate from the College of Art, says he often got into trouble at the institute for his outspokenness. Essentially self-made and now recognised for his work in art circles for his unique style and play of colours, Sidharth says: “I did get a degree from the college but I was given just the pass marks of 35%. With marks so low I could not even get a schoolteacher’s job. So I moved to Delhi with a bus fare of just Rs 10 in my pocket and did odd jobs till I became a housekeeper of sorts for a business family and also tutored their children. However, I have no regrets because I did find my recognition as a painter past the age of 42. In fact, I am also grateful to the college for the treatment meted out to me for otherwise I would have been an art teacher in a village school all my life.”All three artists who have made a name for themselves in their field have this message for the younger artists who find themselves without work or any means of sustenance: The road may be long but they will be able to realise their dreams with hard work and, above all, passion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/on-their-canvas-of-life-artists-explore-with-themes-of-struggle-hard-work/story-9GPLgSb8SWS28QjnihevmM.html
28-09-2020||City||Two students move Supreme Court against crop residue burning||New DelhiPollution caused by stubble burning in Delhi’s neighbouring states can exponentially increase the mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, claimed a petition filed in the Supreme Court seeking total ban on stubble burning.The plea has been moved by two young environmental activists – a Class 12 student who under his own initiative of “Plant A Million Trees” has planted 1.5 lakh trees in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) and a third year law student who is an active campaigner against use of Single Use Plastic.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde has listed the petition for hearing on October 6 along with the batch of M.C Mehta matters pertaining to Delhi pollution. The petition was mentioned by senior advocate Harish Salve who is assisting the Court as amicus curiae (friend of Court).“The consequence of allowing any stubble burning to take place in the times of this pandemic will be catastrophic,” the petition by the two young environmentalists said. Citing international medical studies, the plea stated that medical studies have found that persons with weak respiratory system or living in polluted areas are at serious risk of contracting COVID-19 leading to death in some cases.“Any increase in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR this year while the COVID-19 pandemic is spiraling out of control, will exponentially increase the mortality rate due to COVID-19 by compromising the respiratory system of the citizens, particularly in the case of senior citizens and children,” the petition stated. Further, it stated that enhanced pollution level can offer “direct pathway for airborne transmission” of COVID-19 virus.Salve told the Court that the petition raised an important issue and requires to be heard. Delhi witnesses exponential rise in air pollution levels around this time of the year due to stubble burning by farmers in Punjab, Haryana Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Last year, the air quality index (AQI) crossed the 1000 mark as stubble burning releases suspended particulate matter in the air and emits harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and methane.Farmers have to prepare the fields for sowing of the rabi crop after harvesting the kharif crop. As the period between the two events is short, the remains of the kharif crop cannot be manually plucked out and to remove it, they are set on fire. As a way out, the petition suggested that stubble removing machines should be either provided at affordable rents by state governments to small and marginal farmers. It recommended daily wage workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme. The petition has even recommended putting strict curbs on construction activities and polluting industries in Delhi-NCR if AQI crosses 150.In the M.C Mehta case, the Supreme Court has been monitoring the stubble burning issue by asking respective state governments to inform progress made on setting up biomass plants and providing stubble removal machines to small farmers. Alternatively, the Court has directed setting up of a smog tower in Delhi on an experimental basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-students-move-supreme-court-against-crop-residue-burning/story-QyP96q7LPhgXBlINob2R4H.html

28-09-2020||City||Over 50% JNU research scholars may drop out if ‘roadblocks’ not removed: Survey||New Delhi: A survey conducted by Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students to understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on research scholars says a substantial percentage of them will drop out of their research programmes during or in the aftermath of the pandemic in case the “roadblocks” they face are not mitigated. The survey, conducted by three JNU scholars -- Alamu R, Yangchen Roy, and Somashree Das -- covered as many as 530 research scholars, including both MPhil and PhD programmers, in the university. The survey was conducted online between June 27 and July 6. According to the findings, 53.9% scholars say they would drop out if they are unable to access resources required for research work (primary material/secondary material/lab facility). “More than 40% of the respondents said they would drop out in case of financial distress... if they needed to look for a job to support their families,” it stated.The university has been physically shut since March in view of the pandemic. The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) has been demanding a phased return of research scholars to the campus since the last two months. “Nearly 4 out of 5 (78.1%) research scholars could not carry adequate research-related resources (books, photocopies, readings, notes) from their hostels, library lockers and laboratories back home,” the report stated.“For research scholars to access the work they have already done, but which is locked up in their hostel rooms and in library carrels, and to access the secondary resources in libraries and archives, universities need to reopen in a staggered or phased manner,” it added.JNUSU general secretary Satish Yadav said the union has been demanding return of the research scholars to the campus. “We have written to the administration multiple times since July but there is no response. We will hold a press conference on Tuesday to share the issues of students due to the delay in their return,” he said.JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA) president DK Lobiyal said the administration should allow students to return to the campus in a phased manner, taking all precautions. “Many students are having lots of difficulties in accessing learning material online and attending online classes. There are many students who have to submit to submit their PhD thesis in December. They could not do anything in the last six months. They can come back to the campus and resume their work.They can also attend online classes using their hostel WiFi.”A senior official at the university, requesting anonymity, said, “The university is yet to take any decision on the return of students at the campus.”The survey highlighted the digital divide among students and concluded that only 35.8% scholars have access to 4G data speed. “Another 14.9% only have 3G or 2G speed. Those who do not have access to internet services on an everyday basis constitute 8.1% of the sample,” it stated. The survey reveals prevalence of anxiety among scholars amid the pandemic. “As many as 87.5% of the scholars from the survey reported being anxious since the pandemic began...future prospects and problems pertaining to research work, including stalled fieldwork, were the most prevalent reasons for their anxiety,” it stated.At least 85.4 % of the scholars said they need a research period extension. “Close to three- fourth (71.9 %) of the scholars said without a research period extension they will not be able to submit their thesis on time,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-50-jnu-research-scholars-may-drop-out-if-roadblocks-not-removed-survey/story-ixugBsnedVRtfWglpLk9oL.html
28-09-2020||Mumbai||Teachers raise concerns over weekly report mandate by Maharashtra education department||A few days after the Maharashtra education department issued a government resolution (GR) asking teachers to submit a weekly report on online education, teachers have raised concerns over the process.Uday Nare, a teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public school in Andheri, said, “Teachers are doing their best to ensure that students do not miss out on their studies amid all challenges. Many teachers as well as students do not have access to internet and often struggle to get network. At such a point, such mandates add to the stress of teachers.” Some teachers also reported issues with submitting their details on the portal.As per the September 25 GR, teachers now have to upload details of the students attending classes online, those who are contacted offline via phone or other means, and those who cannot be reached despite all attempts. Teachers have also been asked to share data with respect to learning outcomes. The data has to be uploaded on a portal created by the state education department.A principal from a Ghatkopar school said the government first needs to give clear guidelines to schools with respect to the academic calendar and conducting exams. “We have not got any guidelines about the format the exams need to be conducted in. The government should first focus on these fundamental issues rather than asking us to share only figures on attendance,” said the principal.An official from the education department said the data needs to be compiled for identifying the reach of online learning across the state. “It will help identify issues with respect to access, on the basis of which further policy can be devised,” said the official.Teachers from several junior colleges across the state have decided to boycott the process. The State Junior College Teachers Mahasangh said in a statement, “Teachers are already overburdened with a lot of responsibilities related to teaching, conducting exams etc. They will not take up additional pressure of this excercise.”Teachers from several junior colleges across the state have decided to boycott the process.

The accused — Hanumat Singh Rajput, 27; Ganga Singh Rajput, 30; and Guru Singh Rajput, 28 — posed as renowned industrialists and duped the company. According to the police, the incident took place on September 8 when a Malad-based foreign exchange company received a call from a man who introduced himself as an industrialist. An officer from Malad police station said, “The unidentified man inquired about exchanging Indian currency worth ₹25 lakh in Euros. An official from the company asked him to visit their office to exchange the money.” “After sometime, a man came to the office but he wasn’t carrying any Indian currency to exchange. The company officials told him they cannot hand over the Euros till he gives the Indian currency,” the officer said. The complainant in his statement said that, “The man then dialled his boss who claimed that he was a known industrialist and assured the company officials that another of his employee was on his way with the Indian currency, and requested them to give the euros as he had to catch a flight urgently. One of the officials trusted him as he knew the industrialist personally and handed over 27,500 Euros. As no one came with the Indian currency after the man left the office with the Euros, the official then dialled the industrialist’s number but it was switched off, following this they realised they had been duped.” The police managed to get images of the accused from CCTV footage and tracked him to Silore district in Rajasthan. A team of police officers camped in Rajasthan for eight days to arrest them, and recovered 11,300 Euros from them. Pramod Toradmal, an inspector from Malad police station, said, “We have arrested all three accused from Rajasthan and are investigating the case. On Monday, they were produced before court and have been remanded in police custody till October 1.” The accused were booked under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-arrested-from-rajasthan-for-duping-forex-firm-in-mumbai/story-f9oSwTQXYI2MaXN4eGvERI.html

28-09-2020||City||Thane corporator’s son killed: Step-brother arrested||Thane Police arrested Sachin Patil, 40, for allegedly killing his step-brother Rakesh Patil, 35, the son of Thane-based Sena Corporator Manik Patil, on Sunday. Patil had shot Rakesh with a revolver and dumped his body in Vashi Creek over property dispute last week. Kasarvadavli police, while investigating the missing person’s complaint filed by Rakesh’s wife, have also recovered the revolver and the 3.7 gram gold jewellery stolen by the accused. The body has not been found yet. The police arrested Gaurav Singh, Patil’s driver on September 24 while Patil was absconding since September 23. Patil had staged a robbery at his father’s house to establish that Rakesh has eloped with jewellery. Singh, however, confessed to helping Patil kill and dispose Rakesh’s body in exchange for ₹2 lakh. The police then formed several teams to look for Patil in Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ambernath. Senior police inspector K Khairnar said, “The accused was not using cell phone, therefore tracking him became difficult. Our teams have been keeping an eye on his friends and family. Through informers, we come to know that he would be coming to Ulwe in Navi Mumbai on the night of September 26. We laid a trap and arrested him. Later, we recovered the gold jewellery which he had stolen as well as Rakesh’s scooter and a revolver.” Patil confessed to the crime after being arrested, said Khairnar. “The accused said he called Rakesh for a party in his father’s home when no one was around and gave him alcohol. After he fell asleep, the accused shot him on his head. Later with Singh’s help he rolled the body in cloth and threw it in Vashi Creek early on September 20. They kept Rakesh’s scooter in Azadnagar where Singh stays. Singh was given ₹2 lakh for helping Patil,” Khairnar said/ Patil has been remanded in police custody till October 4. Rakesh is the son of Manik Patil’s first wife, while the accused is his son from the third marriage. According to police, Patil shot Rakesh and stole his mother’s jewellery to show that Rakesh fled with valuables. Manik Patil and his wife came back on September 20 and filed a complaint regarding the theft with Kasarvadavli police. On September 20, Rakesh’s wife filed a missing person complaint with Kasarvadavli police station. Rakesh had recently agreed to move in his father’s new bungalow in Waghbil, which led to insecurity in Patil. He allegedly killed Rakesh fearing his closeness to their father, which he though would lead him to lose a major share in the property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-corporator-s-son-killed-step-brother-arrested/story-JCSzIRagDClcydIQVRU6cN.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||HC asks state prisons if they have enough Covid isolation wards||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought to know from prison authorities whether they have sufficient number of isolation wards to accommodate all prisoners who would surrender if the bail extension orders issued by it are recalled. The query by the court came after a plea was moved before it seeking clarification on interim bail granted to a prisoner in wake of Covid-19. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel, Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Talwant Singh also posed a query to the jail authorities on details regarding the number of Covid cases in the three jails in the national capital, the number of prisoners who were out on bail but needed to surrender next month and the number of isolation wards in each of the three jails.The high court also issued notice to the director general of prisons, who is in charge of the all three jails — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli — in the national capital and sought his stand before the next date of hearing on October 16.The bench also sought the presence of DG Prisons, via video conference, on the next date, but was informed that he was suffering from Covid-19. Thereafter, the court directed that he may appear if he was well or someone can represent him.The court’s directions comes while hearing a plea seeking modification of two orders — passed on July 13 and July 24 — by which it had clarified that interim bails/parole extensions granted will be applicable to all prisoners who got the relief before or after March 16.The plea had contended that the two orders were being misused by prisoners by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or some such other such reasons, instead of regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the high court’s direction.The plea was filed after additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav had sought a clarification from the HC and the state after he saw that several accused in riots cases had opted for interim bail on humanitarian grounds and later extended it citing guidelines of the high powered committee for decongestion of jail.The high court said it will not permit misuse of its orders and would recall its extension order if it was being misused. While expressing concern in the surge of cases of Covid-19 in the national capita, the court also asked the prison authorities if they have sufficient number of isolation wards to accommodate the large number of prisoners who would surrender if the extension orders are recalled.The high court on August 24 had extended till October 31 all the interim orders, which were to expire on or after August 31 in cases that are before it as also the district courts in view of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-state-prisons-if-they-have-enough-covid-isolation-wards/story-Qy39mj2xfHPaWOelX8prZK.html
28-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Kangana Ranaut to submit her tweets, video of Sanjay Raut; BMC refutes her claims about demolition||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing the petition of actor Kangana Ranaut, asked her to substantiate the claim that she had been abused by Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut. Senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf, appearing for the actor, played a video clip in which Raut is heard saying “Woh haramkhor ladki”. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) responding to the court’s query during an earlier hearing on whether there was ongoing work at the time of inspection of Ranaut’s bungalow in Pali Hill, said that finishing work was being carried out on the unauthorised alterations and additions made in past.Regarding Ranaut’s claim that Raut abused her on the social media platform, Dr Saraf said Raut used the abusive word to refer to Ranaut, and that it was the politician’s malice towards the actor which prompted the demolition of her bungalow on September 9. However, when the bench questioned Raut’s lawyer advocate Pradeep Thorat, he clarified that as his client had not mentioned the actor’s name when he spoke, it could not be construed that he had abused her.Dr Saraf informed the court that the abusive stance of Raut had been prompted by a tweet by Ranaut on September 5.Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “I believe the tweet which is referred by Dr Saraf was made around 5pm. If Dr Saraf is referring to any other tweet prior to that, it will have some relevance.” In light of this, Chinoy sought a clarification on the timing of the tweet which allegedly led to the altercation between Ranaut and Raut. After hearing the submissions, the court asked Dr Saraf to submit all of Ranaut’s tweets and the entire video interview of Raut. Meanwhile, responding to the HC’s query regarding Ranaut’s petition filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee on September 9, seeking a stay on the ongoing demolition of her bungalow by BMC. The civic body submitted that while the petitioner in her response to the stop-work notice issued on September 7 had claimed that there was no work going on, the work was ongoing, and added that the civic authority was justified in considering the finishing work to be in continuation with the previously made alterations and invoking section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act. In view of this, BMC submitted that Ranaut’s claims were not maintainable as she had an alternate remedy available by filing a suit for claims and hence sought dismissal of the petition. While hearing the BMC’s arguments and submissions in support of the demolition, the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla was informed by Chinoy along with advocate Joel Carlos that the actor was trying cover up her illegal actions and get immunity by approaching the court. “This case actually is on the other side of the coin. It is like claiming immunity by relying on your public utterances and saying that if action is taken against unlawful construction, it is harassment,” Chinoy said. He further submitted that the actor had not shown any exceptional circumstance to move the petition. “It cannot be that a political controversy that has been created by the petitioner in media is an exceptional circumstance,” said Chinoy. The civic body then countered the actor’s claim that she was not in Mumbai when the notice was served and that she was not allowed time to respond. Chinoy said, “In this day if you can tweet while on your way from Mohali to Mumbai, you can also answer your advocate on the phone.” While justifying the application of section 354A of the MMC Act, Chinoy submitted that in her response to the stop-work notice, the actor had said that there was no ongoing work even though the inspecting personnel had seen five workmen and a supervisor. “Had she replied that water-proofing work was going on, BMC would have given her seven days’ time, but as she refused [that any work was going on], the officers assumed that it was work in continuum to the unauthorised alterations and additions done in the past, and hence resorted to demolition within 24-hours of serving the notice,” he said. Chinoy also pointed that in the petition or other documents filed by the actor during the course of the hearing she had not explicitly denied carrying out the unauthorised alterations and additions that were demolished, and hence BMC was justified in carrying out the demolition. He also said that the actor’s claim for ₹2-crore compensation could not be dealt with in the writ petition and hence the petition should be dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-kangana-ranaut-to-submit-her-tweets-video-by-sanjay-raut-bmc-refutes-her-claims-about-demolition/story-cAJzg52UL9gHIVOowkCUrM.html
28-09-2020||City||My doors are open, don’t air grievances in public: Rawat to Punjab Cong leaders||Chandigarh All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat on Monday advised the party MLAs not to air their grievances in public, saying his doors are open for everyone. Rawat, who is on his first visit to the state after being given the charge of party affairs in Punjab, gave the advice in the meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) here. Rawat told MLAs that he does not want to be caught by surprise, and they should call or SMS him if they have some grievance or views on any particular issue instead of going public. “I am accessible to everyone even at midnight. And, solutions can be found on the party platform,” he said. The state in-charge’s statement holds significance as the rumblings of discontent within the state unit have grown in recent months, with two Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, both former state unit chiefs, publicly criticising the chief minister and his decisions. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar were also present. Rawat, a former CM of Uttarakhand and five-time MP, also asked Amarinder to tell the ministers to go to party offices to meet the people and party workers and solve their problems instead of just interacting with them at their residences. “This will help strengthen the party. It is the party that contests the elections,” he said. The ministers and MLAs were also told to reach out to people on the farm laws, “destruction of federal structure” and refusal and non-release of GST compensation. When Jalandhar Cantonment legislator Pargat Singh urged Rawat to give time to MLAs, Rawat said he has come to meet them. The AICC general secretary met 16-17 party legislators who called on him individually or with delegations from their constituencies on Monday. The MLAs told Rawat that there was need for unity in the party, according to sources. When contacted, Jakhar said his meetings are being lined up with party MLAs on Tuesday as well and he will also be a part of the chief minister’s meeting with representatives of farmer unions on the three contentious farm laws in the morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/my-doors-are-open-don-t-air-grievances-in-public-rawat-to-punjab-cong-leaders/story-4Io9ibE9Ib6wEyt1j5pPXI.html

28-09-2020||City||Principals set up funds, manage donations to help students pay board exam fee||New Delhi: With the deadline to submit the fees for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) board exams nearing, principals of various Delhi government schools have expedited their efforts to help poor students arrange money to pay the fee. The students have to submit the fee before October 15, the deadline for the schools to upload the complete list of candidates appearing for class 10 and 12 board exams.“Several parents are concerned over paying the fee. Loss of jobs and businesses due to the Covid-19 pandemic has made it difficult for many of them to arrange the money. We have set up a fund of Rs 15,000 to help students who won’t be able to pay the examination fee this time. The amount may increase or decrease based on the needs of the students,” said Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector-8. Jha said he has been holding digital parent-teacher meetings to discuss the issue with parents.Last year, after the CBSE hiked the board examination fee, the Delhi government announced that it would pay the fee for over 3.14 lakh Class 10 and 12 students in government schools. However, this year, the education department asked its heads of schools to follow the “2018-19 status”, meaning the fee had to be paid by the students.A senior official in Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s office said, “We have written to the CBSE, requesting them to waive off the exam fee for the current academic year due to the economic slowdown arising out of the pandemic. The government also lacks funds because of the major shortfall in revenue collection.”CBSE controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said the board had not received any letter from the Delhi government so far. “We are a self-financing board. The expenditure over conducting exams is likely to increase this time. It is anyway a challenge to conduct the exams using the current exam fee,” he said when asked if the board was contemplating a fee waiver.On Monday, the Delhi government also told the Delhi high court that it had written to CBSE asking for an exam fee waiver due to the pandemic. The court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Ashok Aggarwal of NGO Social Jurist seeking a waiver of the exam fee. The court has asked the state government and CBSE to treat the petition as representation and take a decision within three weeks.Last year, the examination fee of class 10 and 12 students belonging to the general category in Delhi government schools was increased from ₹375 and ₹600, respectively, to ₹1,500 for five subjects. For SC/ST candidates in class 10, the examination fee was increased from ₹375 to ₹1,200 and for class 12, from ₹600 to ₹1200 in Delhi government and government-aided schools. If practical and additional or optional subjects are to be taken into account, the fee comes to around Rs 2,750 for class 12 students and to Rs 1500 for class 10 students.Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, said, “Based on the number of requests we receive from students and parents, we will rope in school management committee members and alumni to look for donors who may help these students.”Several principals HT spoke to said they were planning to use the school’s People Welfare Fund (PWF) to help needy students. Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of the Government Girls Senior Secondary School in New Kondli, is worried since her school has over 700 students in class 10 and more than 650 in class 12. “Many parents are worried about how they will pay the examination fee. If a parent has two children in class 12, they have to pay around ₹5,000 which is extremely difficult for many. We are planning to use PWF to help these students. We are screening their applications to ensure that only genuine cases receive help,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/principals-set-up-funds-manage-donations-to-help-students-pay-board-exam-fee/story-siMWwF1TQ1PaNB8naUQeBN.html
28-09-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Congress on road to revival or destined to suffer?||The 2015 assembly elections in Bihar saw the Congress regaining a reasonable space in the state legislature. After a gap of fifteen years, the party’s tally rose to double-digit, as twenty-seven out of forty-one candidates in the fray won their seats.“It was indeed a massive jump for the party, from just four seats in 2010 to twenty-seven in 2015. The Congress’s success, however, was mainly attributed to the invincible coalition that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Janata Dal (United) had stitched to defeat the BJP-led combine,” said Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, former Patna University teacher and political analyst.Many believe the Congress was unable to seize the opportunity to bring the party back on revival course, as it continued to rely heavily on the RJD to keep its political relevance in the state. “Bihar has never been in the focus of the party’s leadership. A virtual ad-hocism prevailed in the state Congress after removal of Ashok Choudhary as the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief. Madan Mohan Jha replaced Choudhary in 2018, but his cry to reconstitute the BPCC was hardly heeded to,” said a senior Congress leader.The apathy led to desertions by many senior leaders, including former presidents like Choudhary, Chaudhary Mahboob Ali Kaiser and Ram Jatan Sinha. “The party hardly made any serious attempt to reach out to the masses and associate itself with their issues. Chaudhary, currently elevated as executive president of state JD(U), was the last BPCC chief who carried out a padayatra across the state to rake up the issues of farmers and labourers,” said a former general secretary of the BPCC, adding that the party lost its aggressive gesture over the years after many senior leaders got sidelined under the current set-up.The Congress had lost power in Bihar in 1990 assembly elections when it won only seventy-one seats. Still, it remained the main opposition party in the assembly. The worse came in 1995 when it could win only twenty-nine seats, less than the BJP which became the main opposition. The slide continued and it won only twenty-three seats in 2000 assembly polls. However, it joined the government led by Rabri Devi. The Congress contested the February 2005 elections in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), but could only win nine seats.Also read: ‘Mahagathbandhan’ seat sharing talks hit roadblock in BiharIn October 2005 assembly polls, the Congress contested on fifty-four seats in alliance with the RJD and won only ten seats while the NDA, comprising the JD(U) and the BJP, formed the government. In 2010 assembly polls, the party fared badly and managed to win only four seats. The last Lok Sabha poll dealt a massive blow to the Congress as it could win only one out of nine seats it had contested. The rest thirty-nine seats were won by the NDA.Political observers say that the Congress began to lose its support base as it failed to read the signs and address backward caste aspirations between 1988 and 1990 when four of its chief ministers –Bindeshwari Dubey, Bhagwat Jha Azad, SN Sinha and Jagannath Mishra - were nominated to the top post only to be pulled down swiftly, giving in to the intra-party caste divides.The Congress’s support base in Bihar suffered massive erosion following the desertion by Muslims after the Bhagalpur riots in 1989 and Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. “We erred in not rebuilding the party since 1990. Have you ever seen the party on the roads, agitating, gheraoing the assembly, taking up a cause or even with some gumption to stand a lathi-charge, except at the time of polls? No. How do you expect us to survive?” a party legislator asked, adding that it allowed a leader like Lalu Prasad to fill in and ride to power in 1990 at the expense of the Congress.Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, DM Diwakar, however, sees good electoral prospects for the party, particularly for the role it had played to mitigate sufferings of the migrants and students during the lockdown and its active support to the farmers’ protest against the enactment of three new laws. “Anti-incumbency is slowly creeping in the state. Joblessness is at its highest level. Industries and other sectors are in deep distress due to the Covid-19-induced pandemic. Farmers in Bihar have now begun to realize the dangers of the new acts that intend to take away their right to challenge any dispute in the court of law,” says Diwakar.He also sees a new realignment of electors shaping up in Bihar. “Apart from a section of upper castes, who are mainly into farming, Dalits and Muslims are now mobilizing in favour of the Congress and its allies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-congress-on-road-to-revival-or-destined-to-suffer/story-kAvXwhAaOCDvC6bMhtoXfI.html
28-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid: PU waives tuition fee of 30 students||Despite grappling with financial woes this year, a special panel of the Panjab University (PU) on Monday decided to waive the tuition fee of around 30 students who had sought relief from the university. The tuition fee of these students will be waived off for both the semesters of the 2020-21 academic session. PU’s Dean Students Welfare (DSW) SK Tomar, a member of the panel, said, “We have given the relief to the students according to the direction of the vice-chancellor. He had directed us to extend all possible help to students who are unable to pay the fee.” Around 30 students had written to PU seeking a special concession in fee this year. However, few students, who had not explained the reasons, will be asked to state them. Another member of the panel said that most of the students had stated that their families’ income had been affected severely due to the pandemic. “We will provide help if any other student requests us to,” the member said. PU has already given a 5% concession in semester fee to all its students. The 7.5% fee hike for self-financed courses and 5% for traditional courses for the 2020-21 academic session was also put on hold by the syndicate in May. After the students had held multiple protests on the varsity campus in August demanding a complete semester fee waiver, the varsity committee had suggested awarding concessions to individuals who had been affected by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-pu-waives-tuition-fee-of-30-students/story-s45zWrYY76RoAElChSyUUK.html

28-09-2020||Mumbai||Farm bills: Maharashtra Congress leaders to intensify protest, leaders meet Governor||Maharashtra Congress has decided to up its ante against the three farm bills passed by the Parliament last week by intensifying protests against them. Senior party leaders met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and urged him to withdraw the bills, terming them anti-farmers.The party has announced to observe Save Farmer-Labourers Day on October 2, hold a virtual farmer rally next week and gather signatures of over one crore farmers on the petition to oppose the newly passed law.In the memorandum handed over to the Governor, the party has demanded the bills to be scrapped as they are anti-farmer and were passed without any discussion.“The bills will lead farmers to the slavery and safeguard the interests of a bunch of industrialists, who are close to the BJP leaders in power. There was no discussion held within the cabinet, among the NDA partners or in the Parliament. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi had announced to double the income of farmers by 2022, but the farmers are deprived of even the minimum support price. The Central government is ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ and do not represent poor farmers,” said party leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan after meeting the Governor. Chavan said that the governor has assured them that the matter would be discussed with the Centre.The party in its memorandum has termed the claims made by the PM about the bills a sham. “PM has said that the farmers were free to sell their produce anywhere in the country. 86% of the farmers are marginal farmers with little holding and are not in a capacity to sell their produce outside the APMCs. The new system will deprive the farmers of the minimum support price and leave the direct and indirect employees of the AMPCs jobless. The bills are against the federal system of governance and lead to the revenue losses to the state governments. The bills will give a boost to contract farming, resulting in farmers turning into labourers in their own fields. Removal of the cap from the holding of the essential services will further compel farmers to sell their produce cheaper,” the 10-point memorandum reads.Party will stage protests at district collectorates and in Assembly constituencies on October 2 to oppose the bills. It has resolved to gather 1 crore signatures from the farmers between October 2 and 31 to protest the bills.Meanwhile, Congress leaders including state unit chief Balasaheb Thorat, public works minister Ashok Chavan could not be part of the delegation to Raj Bhavan as precautionary measures.

A ‘pen-down’ protest, where employees refused to do any official work, was launched as part of a state-wide protest called by employees of all 14 non-agricultural universities of Maharashtra. The employees have demanded revision of their pay based on the recommendations of the seventh pay commission, five-day week, assured career progression plan as well as pension for all employees. The strike has been called by the Maharashtra State College Universities Employees Action Committee—a collective of eight employees associations in the state. “We have launched the pen-down strike that will continue till September 30. If our demands are not met by then, we will call for a complete strike,” said an employee participating in the strike. The strike comes at a time when the university is conducting online examinations for its students amid the Covid-19 pandemic. A senior official of the university said that the strike has so far not affected the examination process. However, if the strike were to continue, some exam-related works may be impacted, said the official. While the recommendations by the seventh pay commission came into force in 2016, the state education department has not yet revised the pay scales of university staff so far. State education minister Uday Samant held a meeting with representatives of the committee. “The state government will soon implement the recommendations of the seventh pay commission in non-agricultural colleges and universities. As soon as the Covid-19 situation improves, we will start the process of filling the vacant positions. The government is positive towards fulfilling the demands of the employees,” said Samant. Despite the minister’s assurances, the Maharashtra State College Universities Employees Action Committee has refused to call off the strike. “The minister’s assurances alone will not suffice. We will continue to protest until the government expedites the process,” said a representative of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-varsity-staff-employees-launch-strike-demand-implementation-of-7th-pay-commission/story-dqtpY16spNrl3VhK24E39J.html

28-09-2020||Chandigarh||621 doctors, healthcare workers in Ludhiana contracted Covid while on duty: Report||A report released by the Ludhiana health department revealed that 621 healthcare workers have contracted Covid-19 while treating patients so far. Of the 621 infected healthcare workers, the report mentioned, 50 were doctors. Among these doctors, 34 worked at government hospitals, while 16 were from private healthcare facilities. Apart from doctors, 571 infected healthcare workers included nurses, housekeeping staff and class-IV employees. While 440 such staffers belonged to private hospitals, 131 caregivers worked at government hospitals. Ludhiana civil surgeon Rajesh Bagga, while praising the doctors and healthcare workers, said, “I have no words to express my gratitude to the doctors and paramedical staff. Initially, some private hospitals were not attending to patients, and it was then the doctors at government healthcare facilities came forward and started offering treatment. We knew a little about the virus then. Several of our doctors got infected and fell ill. But after recovering from the disease, they again joined the duty and started serving the humanity.” ‘Treating a patient in such circumstances ain’t easy’“Dr Bandeep Singh, Dr Amanpreet Kaur, Dr Anmol Rattan, Dr Varun Bansal and Dr Ankit, the list of doctors is long and I am sorry that I could only name a few. But my heart fills with pride on seeing their dedication and devotion. Treating a patient, while knowing that one could get infected, is not easy,” Dr Bagga added. The civil surgeon said the list of doctors and paramedical staffers who tested positive for Covid-19 was compiled to find out the reason as to how they contracted the virus. “There were multiple reasons. Besides working in hospitals, the healthcare workers and doctors had been also visiting the field to collect samples of patients. Despite being attacked and facing hostilities from people who were against offering samples, the doctors and paramedical staff did not deter. If the fresh Covid infections have reached a plateau and are on a decline, the credit should also be given to these heroes,” he added. As per the civil surgeon, in majority of the cases, it was seen that the healthcare workers caught the infection from their spouses or while eating during a gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/621-doctors-healthcare-workers-in-ludhiana-contracted-covid-while-on-duty-report/story-QoUiMBCumEEcESFSfMBfLM.html

28-09-2020||Dehradun||‘Drug addict to aspiring lawyer’: Uttarakhand boy’s life story is all about grit and determination||When 21-year-old Archit Sharma was caught by police of Raipur locality in Uttarakhand’s Dehradun, he never thought he would come back to the same police station later as an aspiring lawyer. Sharma’s journey is an example of transformation, grit and determination. It also shows the humane face of police which offered him refuge at the police station where he is now living and studying for his class 12 examinations and law entrance test. After getting released from jail, Sharma’s family refused to accept him after which he took refuge at the same police station where he was booked for theft to fund his drug addiction. Drugs addiction after father’s death Narrating his story, Sharma says that he was good in studies and never consumed drugs till he was living with his family in Uttarkashi district. Everything changed after moving to Dehradun to his grandparent’s place following his father’s death. “After my father passed away, my mother, younger sister and I came to Dehradun to my maternal grandparent’s place to live with them as they were our only caretakers along with my maternal uncle. There, unfortunately, I got into the wrong company of friends which ultimately pushed me into drug addiction,” said Sharma. He said that as his drug addiction problem got serious in Dehradun, he was then sent to live with his maternal uncle in Bangalore.

As my uncle is very strict, I was away from drugs there. However, I couldn’t tolerate his behaviour and returned after a year in 2015 only to again get into drugs,” said Sharma. “The addiction got worse and I got a supplementary in one of the subjects in class 12 boards in 2017. Ashamed of it, I left home without telling my family members.” Petty jobs for drugs Sharma said that after leaving home, he spent two years wandering in different areas of Dehradun while working in restaurants and dhabas to earn money to buy drugs. “As I was deep into drugs, I funded my addiction with the money I earned by working in restaurants. Then one day, one of my relatives saw me in a restaurant and took me home,” he said. After going home, he claimed that his drug addiction got worse and he started stealing household things. “I first stole some household things and then sold them to buy drugs. I stole gold jewellery for about Rs 3-4 lakhs and spent it all on drugs. Finally, my family members got to know about it and lodged a complaint against me in Raipur police station,” said Sharma Sharma was arrested by police on June 25, 2019, and produced before a court which sent him to jail for one year. No acceptance from family “I was released from jail on parole citing the pandemic on April 2 this year. I went home but my uncle, who is the guardian of my grandparent’s house, refused to accept me. I then turned back and spent 2-3 days on roads,” said Sharma. He said that he relied on the food being distributed by people for the needy ones during those 2-3 days. “During that time, the lockdown was strict and police caught me sleeping in an auto-rickshaw and asked me to go home. I told them I don’t have any home and they let me go,” said Sharma. “Later when I lost all hope, I turned towards the same Raipur police station for a refuge where I was arrested. I met its station house officer Amarjeet Singh Rawat and narrated my ordeal on which he provided me with a place yo live in the police station premises. I am still living there,” he said. Sharma says that it was initially an unusual experience for him to live in the police station but later he settled down.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine portal launched, all data linked to research on it “Initially I would see some people crying, shouting in the police station with police bringing strangers in the lockup. I used to think what is this unusual scene. Later it got normal,” said Sharma. While living in the police station, he started helping cops in rescue operation in accidents and social work of distributing food to needy ones and stray animals. “SHO Amarjeet sir helped me a lot by providing me clothes, food and even books when I told him that I want to study. As my class 12 was incomplete, he filled my form for it for which I will be taking my examinations next year in April,” said Sharma. He said when he told Rawat that he aspires to become a lawyer, he also bought him books for the preparation for law entrance examination. “He treats me like his own and never made me feel that I am living with cops. The other personnel in the police station also help me a lot and treat me like their family member which shows that police also has a humane face,” said Sharma.Sharma says that he is not in touch with his family members as his uncle didn’t allow his mother and sister to talk to him over the phone. “Initially I used to call my mother with the mobile phone provided by SHO sir. But then my uncle got to know about it and stopped her from taking my calls. I miss my mother a lot and once I stand on my own feet after becoming a lawyer, I will bring her from there to live with me,” he said. Police lauds Sharma’s transformation Station house officer (SHO) Amarjeet Singh Rawat said, “He has changed completely. Nobody can tell that he was a drug addict and had spent time in jail.” Rawat said, “When he came to me crying that he has nowhere to go as his family members refused to accept him, I decided to help him and allowed him to live in the station premises.” Rawat said he provided him with space in the police barracks. “For food, I have asked our police mess to give him food while sometimes I also bring him food from my home. We were impressed with him helping the needy ones and strays in the area with a pure heart,” said Rawat. He said, “When he expressed his desire to study, I made all the required arrangements for him by filling his form for class 12 as well as for law entrance examination. I have taken full responsibility for his studies till he stands on his own.” Rawat said that he tried to convince his family members to take him back several times. “But they refused straight away citing the theft incident.” Governor pardons remaining jail term Rawat said, “When Governor Baby Rani Maurya came to know about his good conduct while living in the police station, she pardoned his remaining jail term of about three months.” “We are happy to be a part of his transformation journey and setting an example on how one can leave the menace of drug addiction and lead a meaningful life with self-determination,” said Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/drug-addict-to-aspiring-lawyer-uttarakhand-boy-s-life-story-is-all-about-grit-and-determination/story-UKw5nhZUhPRWrgYtyiyPrO.html

28-09-2020||City||World Rabies Day: Srinagar reported 55,000 animal bite cases in past decade||Despite a dog birth control programme in place to stabilise the increasing population of stray canines in Jammu and Kashmir’s capital Srinagar, the annual bite cases here have not shown a major decline.Data of the past decade from Valley’s only anti-rabies clinic at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital (SMHS) in Srinagar reveals a constant increase in the number of dog bite cases.In the period 2009-10, the clinic recorded 3,711 people getting animal bites, a majority of them caused by dogs. The number shot up to 7,324 cases in 2015-16 and since then around 6,500 animal bite cases have been documented at the clinic annually. Around 55,000 animal bite victims have reported to the anti-rabies clinic from 2009 to 2019. These cases are beside the dog bite incidents reported in the towns and villages of Kashmir.“Annually 6-7 thousand dog bite cases are reported by the SMHS clinic, run by the department of community medicine, where anti-rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin are provided free of cost to the bite victims,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine at Government Medical College and Hospital, Srinagar.On the occasion of World Rabies Day, the department in collaboration with non-profit organisation ECHO organised a webinar on this year’s global theme ‘End Rabies: Collaborate, Vaccinate’.“The cases of rabies are still reported. However, such patients don’t come to the anti-rabies clinic and are treated in general hospitals,” Khan said.Stray dogs menace has remained a persistent issue in Kashmir, particularly in capital Srinagar, where conservative estimates put the dog population anywhere around 60,000. With animal rights activists against any culling of dogs, the animal birth control (ABC) or sterilisation measures by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) authorities started in 2013 to control the dog population have often been described as sluggish.“The sterilisation is not happening. We have numerous dogs on the roads. Outside the state, stray dogs starve due to lack of food but here they get protein-rich diets in the form of animal wastes. Even after eight years, the ABC is not showing results,” Khan said.The SMC’s veterinary officer, Dr Javaid Rather, said their ABC programme at Shuhama was on a halt since August 5, 2019, when the Valley was put under restrictions followed by lockdown due to Covid-19 in March 2020.“Due to the pandemic, there was no work. We started ABC again at Shuhama from September 1 where we are sterilising 8 dogs on an average daily,” he said.The official said the construction of another facility at Tengpora, where they could perform 50 sterilisations a day, would still take two to three months to complete.He said they were trying to implement a two-pronged approach. “We are trying to minimise the availability of garbage to the dogs and in the long term we are hopeful to implement the sterilisation programme after our infrastructure is in place,” he said.“We believe the dog bites are stabilising and showing some decline in Srinagar,” he claimed.GFXCanine attack A year-wise breakup of the animal bite cases reported at the anti-rabies clinic of SMHS Hospital, Srinagar:Year Number of cases2009-10 3,7112010-11 4,5152011-12 4,1542012-13 4,4892013-14 6,0412014-15 4,9172015-16 7,3242016-17 6,5482017-18 6,802||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/world-rabies-day-srinagar-reported-55-000-animal-bite-cases-in-past-decade/story-wqt6O2x3UVgQ5XRNH3JMmI.html

The bridge weighs around 530 tonnes and there are over 34,000 nut bolts.Also, the road being constructed on this bridge will be a three-lane road.The project worth ₹24 crores is being carried out by a Delhi-based company and the bowstring girder was prepared at a workshop in Ghaziabad. Senior section engineer (SSE) (constructions) Gurdeep Singh said that normally a bridge has two lanes but the newly constructed part of the Jagraon bridge will have three lanes for movement of traffic. It is the longest bowstring bridge in the state as earlier a similar bridge was constructed in Shahkot but it is around 50m long. A resident of BRS Nagar, Surinder Singh said, “The authorities have taken four years to complete the project, but now when the bridge is complete it would now become the landmark of the city. The bowstring design fascinated the commuters.” The completion of the Jagraon bridge project would also streamline the movement of traffic in the area, which has been hit for over four years. Member of Punjab Road Safety Council, Rahul Verma said, “It will be a huge relief for commuters as it will reduce the pressure on nearby roads including Lakkar bridge, Railway station road, etc. Now, the administration and the civic body should work to expedite the other pending projects including the construction of a ROB at the missing link, construction of ROB/RUB at Pakhowal road etc.”Bridge to open for traffic on Tuesday: MayorThe railway authorities claim that there has been some delay in the completion of work at the site after the machine to lay mastic asphalt developed a snag and the work is now expected to complete by Tuesday afternoon. However, Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that the railway authorities have assured that the bridge would be completed by Tuesday and it will be opened for traffic on the same day only. The bridge was opened for a trial run on Sunday. He said that the MC would also further beautify the bridge by installing colourful lights as part of the Smart City project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagraon-bridge-s-bowstring-girder-catches-the-fancy-of-commuters/story-86kdlfdxfzroJ0emyWoyJI.html

The BJP, however, claims the support of an independent councillor Parvinder Kaur.While the Congress holds a majority in the general house with 64 councillors, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) stands at fourth position with seven councillors. Of the total 95, there are three independent councillors in the city. With this, there seems to be uncertainty over who will retain the position of the leader of opposition in the MC general house.With the SAD claiming to be the main opposition party, the BJP leaders said that they will conduct a party meeting in the coming days to discuss the issue. SAD district president, Ranjit Singh Dhillon and current leader of opposition in the MC house, councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “SAD has 11 councillors and the party will retain the tag of the opposition party as BJP has 10 councillors and the vote of the independent candidate will not be counted.” Dhillon said, “The BJP would soon see the implications of SAD pulling out of the alliance and they will witness a downfall in the coming time.” BJP district president, Pushpinder Singal, however, said that BJP has 11 councillors in the house as independent councillor Parvinder Kaur is also a part of their party.“We will soon conduct a party meeting to discuss different issues including the leader of opposition in the MC general house and nothing has been decided till now.”This division will benefit Congress as it will not have a strong opposition in the general house.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Leader of opposition would be announced after both parties give in writing the number of councillors in their party’s support.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-quits-nda-bjp-no-more-main-opposition-party-in-ludhiana-mc/story-A826NYhROV8hABMFTLs3VO.html

28-09-2020||Mumbai||Biodiversity by the Bay: Mumbai’s green gems plotted on a map||The Karvi flower that blooms once in eight years, flamingo-watching spots, a new species of scorpion – there are among the many natural treasures that often go unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of Mumbai’s dense urban sprawl . Now, you can discover these wonders for yourself, with a first-of-its kind biodiversity map that has been created by illustrator and cartoonist Rohan Chakravarty as part of a campaign to highlight sustainable development.  Conceived by Purpose Climate Lab (PCL), the map is part of the Biodiversity by the Bay campaign, run by citizens’ collective, Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic and other partner organisations. “The campaign was designed to inspire citizens to use their creativity and collective power to fight for Mumbai’s biodiversity. This map is intended to inspire pride in all of Mumbai’s treasures,” said Sonali Bhasin, senior strategist, PCL.  The map shows urban and forest spaces in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) and contains pointers to forest patches, intertidal spaces, mangrove areas, as well as animal species that can be found, like the two spiders, a scorpion, and a lizard species that were discovered in recent years in Aarey Milk Colony. “The motive behind producing this map, which will also be an interactive webpage, is to empower young Mumbaiites with a visual resource of their biodiversity, to instil a sense of pride and ownership in the city’s wildlife, and to drive responsible governance,” said Chakravarty. It took dentist-turned-cartoonist Chakravarty a month to make the map, which provides an index of intertidal wildlife hotspots – Girgaum Chowpatty, Haji Ali, Carter Road, and Juhu Beach – as well as urban green spaces, mangrove forests, and wetland patches. He used information from experts, marine enthusiasts and scientific reports in addition to information provided by the PCL team. “Usually I conduct field visits before taking up such projects but because of Covid-19, this time I had to rely on secondary information,” said Chakravarty, who, as a wildlife and conservation enthusiast, has previously done nature walks in Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and along the Mumbai coastline.  In addition to the city’s flora and fauna, the map also identifies spots for photography, nature trails, and other recreational activities. “I have laid emphasis on state symbols, animals discovered from Mumbai and also tribal heritage, with the compass paying tribute to the indigenous Warli art,” said Chakravarty. Among the green gems plotted on the map are the Karvi flower that blooms at Sanjay Gandhi National Park once in eight years; Mumbai’s infamous beach stinger, the Portuguese Man-o-war; and the two species of flamingo that come to the city.   “When we think of Mumbai, we immediately think of a fast-paced city with its vibrant film industry and endless opportunities. This iconic map highlights the flora, fauna, green spaces and indigenous communities of this region which remain hidden in the hustle and bustle of our city of dreams,” said Suma Balaram, senior designer, PCL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biodiversity-by-the-bay-mumbai-s-green-gems-plotted-on-a/story-82a15YWKL72mqA4CSJ4IIO.html

Addressing the media on the occasion, Baljinder Kaur said there were times when SAD used to work for the betterment of Panth, Punjab and Sarbat, but in the recent times, its leaders have abandoned the agenda and were running the party like a private firm. “The Akali Dal has lost political ground and is now going to launch demonstrations from three Takhts starting October 1 to exploit religious sentiments of the Sikhs. Political demonstration by the Badal family on September 24 at Takht Sri Damdama Sahib was a misuse of the Guru’s house,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-asks-akal-takht-jathedar-to-not-let-sad-misuse-shrines/story-cE5PyOLzXKvqyZ1YWE3NFN.html

28-09-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: ‘Mahagathbandhan’ seat sharing talks hit roadblock||Losing friends fast, the opposition ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in Bihar is facing strong headwinds weeks ahead of the assembly elections with new allies hard to come by and the old seeking a greater share of the electoral pie, virtually blocking seat-sharing talks among its constituents.The grand alliance spearhead, the RJD, which had emerged as the single largest party in the last elections with 81 seats, it finding it tough to convince its recalcitrant partners of its pre-eminence in the coalition and allow it to contest 150 odd seats of the 243-member assembly.The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has already deserted the coalition and returned to the ruling NDA.Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) of former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha looks set to follow suit, with the party having already said “all is not well” in the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, which its leader Lalu Prasad and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar had cobbled together to humble the BJP in the 2015 assembly polls.Apart from RJD’s 81, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) had won 70 seats and Congress 27. A cornered BJP had managed toclinch just 53 seats.The RJD is fighting its first state polls in the absence of Lalu Prasad, who is serving time in a Jharkhand prison after conviction in multiple fodder scam cases.Prasad’s son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav has already been declared the RJD’s chief ministerial candidate, something that has not gone down well with some alliance partners.Sources in the coalition said the RJD, the main anti- NDA force in the state, is not ready to settle for anything less than 150 seats.The Congress, which happily played a second fiddle to the RJD for many years, has been insisting on at least 75 seats, a demand lalu Prasad’s party is not prepared to concede.“We have given the Congress a proposal to contest 58 assembly seats and the Valmikinagar Lok Sabha constituency which will have bypoll soon,” RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari told PTI.Another RJD spokesman Shakti Singh Yadav also confirmed the numbers and said “one or two seats can be adjusted here and there.” Bihar Congress spokesman Rajesh Rathor refused to go public about the number of seats the party wants to contest, but maintained it has definitely sought a larger share than what was being offered. “In the 2015 election under the grand alliance, the JD(U) and the RJD had contested 101 seats each and the Congress 41. Now that JD(U) has ditched the Mahagathbandhan and joined hands with the BJP, the seat distribution arithmetic is needed only for the 101 seats Nitish Kumar’s party had fought then.“Out of that we expect proportionate distribution of seats to us,” Rathor told PTI.RJD’s Tiwari, however, is unconvinced. He said the Congress being a national party has the scope to contest elections in many states but Bihar is the only strong turf for the state’s main opposition party.RLSP chief Upendra Prasad Kushwaha is already camping in New Delhi where he is believed to have met top BJP leaders to finalise the modalities for his return to the NDA.Kushwaha, according to sources in the NDA circles, wants to contest the Valmikinagar Lok Sabha byelection, which has been necessitated following the death of sitting JD(U) MP Baidyanath Mahto.Sources in the Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) of Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni said with the number of alliance partners shrinking, the party wants to contest a respectable number of seats. As a Mahagathbandhan ally, it fielded candidates in three places in the Lok Sabha polls but had drawn a blank.Even RJD’s Jharkhand partner JMM has expressed keenness to be a part of the grand alliance and field candidates on some seats.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren had recently met Lalu Prasad in Ranchi and the two were learnt to have discussed the issue.The RJD also hopes to bring on board the three Left Parties- the CPI-ML, CPI, and CPI-M.Of these, CPI-ML alone has pockets of influence and three MLAs in the outgoing assembly.However, it is peved at the ‘nakaratmak’ (negative) approach of the RJD in taking along opposition parties, including the prospective allies like the Left.“The CPI-ML has been contesting around 100 seats on its own. But for the sake of unity among anti-NDA forces, we first scaled down our demand to 50 seats and finally to 25.“But the RJD has a negative approach as it does not want us to contest from constituencies like Paliganj, Sandesh and Obra that are out traditional seats,” CPI-ML Secretary Kunal said.“The RJD’s logic about our traditional seats is that it had fielded candidates there in the 2015 election and hence can’t leave them for others. But it should understand that in 2015 they fought elections to make Nitish Kumar the chief minister while now they want to throw him out of power,” he told PTI.Kunal said his party may decide to go to the hustings alone if the RJD remains intransigent and refuses to accomodate the ultra-Left party’s demand.Leave alone taking forward the seat-sharing talks with the existing and probable allies, the Mahagathbandhan remains an amorphous entity weeks before the first phase of polling on October 28, a situation that will make the rival NDA camp, which in any case looks sitting pretty, all the more happier.The three-phase polls in Bihar will be held on October 28, November 3 and 7. The votes will be counted on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-mahagathbandhan-seat-sharing-talks-hit-roadblock/story-9atnRu1p8awBGS2nWZMCjO.html

28-09-2020||City||Sixth Schedule for Ladakh: Will sustain campaign if hoodwinked by Centre, says ex-minister Chering Dorjay||Though the Centre’s assurance to include Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of Constitution has rekindled hope among the people of the Union Territory, former BJP minister and ex-president of the party’s Ladakh unit Chering Dorjay on Monday cautioned of a sustained campaign in case they were hoodwinked.Apex Body of People’s Movement, an apolitical body having former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Thiksay monastery head Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora as members, has been demanding constitutional safeguards under its Sixth Schedule to Ladakh on the lines of north-eastern states.The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organisations and Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association.The safeguards also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers.On Saturday, after Union home minister Amit Shah’s assurance over the same, the delegation withdrew its call to boycott the ensuing polls of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council.Dorjay said, “Following home minster’s assurance, we have withdrawn the election boycott call. The assurance had to be verbal because of the model code of conduct and we have to trust him. But if the central government hoodwinks us, we will launch a sustained campaign and resorting to other modes of protest.”“As per the home minister’s word, Ladakh will be brought under the Sixth Schedule within 15 days after the culmination of the hill development council polls. However, the exercise has to be preceded by participation of the representatives elected in the polls. We will also have to take the people of Kargil on board,” said Dorjay.He informed that the apex body will visit Kargil in the next few days to have detailed discussion on the issue.Dorjay said the Sixth Schedule also guarantees no settlement of outsiders.“Outsiders purchasing land or property in the region is the main concern of the people here because Ladakh region has vast swathes of barren land which are vulnerable to human settlement. Eventually, trains will also reach Ladakh. Atal Tunnel has already come up and the Zojila Tunnel upon completion will provide easy connectivity to the region. Thus, apprehensions of the tribal people here are not unfounded,” he maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sixth-schedule-for-ladakh-will-sustain-campaign-if-hoodwinked-by-centre-says-ex-minister-chering-dorjay/story-gazox0KuzaI2pBYl5hDo6J.html

The suspect has been identified as Sandeep Dahiya, a 35-year-old sub-inspector (SI) posted at the Lahori Gate police station in north Delhi, officials from Delhi and Haryana police said.Biker passing by area hurt A motorcyclist from Haryana, identified by his first name Satbir, was also injured while he was passing by the area, where Dahiya fired three bullets at the woman, with whom he was in a relationship for over a year, as the bullets’ flying shrapnel his hit left leg. Satbir saw his leg injury only when he reached Sonepat and got himself admitted to a local hospital. The Delhi Police team met him and recorded his statement. Satbir is a key witness to the Alipur firing incident, said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north Delhi) Gaurav Sharma. Woman out of danger According to Sharma, the 34-year-old woman was spotted in an injured condition on the roadside on GT Karnal Road by another Delhi police officer, sub-inspector Jaiveer, who was passing through the area in his car around 5.30pm on Sunday. Jaiveer took her to a nearby hospital. “On the way, she had told him that SI Sandeep Dahiya had shot her following an argument. She also told him that Dahiya had strained relations with his wife. We registered a case and formed teams to search for the SI. The woman suffered bullet injuries in her right shoulder and arm. Her condition is stable and out of danger,” said Sharma, adding that they are probing whether Dahiya used his service weapon in the crime. On Monday morning, the absconding sub-inspector reportedly drove up to his in-laws’ house in Rohtak’s Bhainsi village and shot his father in-law, Ranbir Singh, 62.Shot father-in-law in the forehead Dahiya’s wife Rajesh Devi said the incident took place around 7am when her father was sanitising the street outside their house. “My husband, along with my brother’s father-in-law, Balbir Singh, and cousin Pawan, came in an SUV and pumped a bullet into my father’s forehead, killing him on the spot,” said Rajesh Devi. She further revealed that she had moved back to her parents’ house four years ago following a marital discord, and a case was pending in the local court. “My husband had illicit relations with my sister-in-law, Reena. She had also filed a case seeking divorce from my brother as she wanted to marry my husband. Sandeep wanted to take custody of our son but I was against it,” she added.Meham deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Shamsher Singh Dahiya said the suspect, a resident of Sisana village in Sonepat, has been booked under Section 302 (murder) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. He further said that the victim’s family members have revealed that the accused had threatened to kill him a few days ago. The DSP added that the footage of closed-circuit television cameras installed near the crime scene has been collected and a hunt is on to nab the accused. ‘Cop had not turned up for work’ As per information from north Delhi police officials, Dahiya had been deputed for patrolling duty in Lahori Gate area between 9pm (September 26) and 1am on September 27 but he had not turned up. On September 23 and 24, Dahiya was on medical leave as he had complained of stomach pain. Being a division officer, Dahiya was allotted a 9mm service pistol and 10 bullets on September 26. Since Dahiya neither came for duty nor returned the service weapon, he was marked absent and a daily diary (DD) entry, mentioning his indiscipline, was made in the police station, they said. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said, “Multiple teams are now on a lookout for Dahiya. We are working in coordination with the Alipur police and our counterparts in Haryana,” said DCP Alphonse. ‘Cop’s troubled personal and professional life’ Delhi Police officials said Dahiya joined the police force as a constable in 2006. In 2016, he became a sub-inspector after clearing the exam for the post. He has been posted in north district since 2013 and in Lahori Gate police station since December 2017. He has been living in a government allotted flat at Shalimar Bagh police colony. “Dahiya has been in a marital dispute with his wife, who already filed a dowry harassment case against him in a police station in Rohtak. He faced a departmental inquiry in regard to that. His service was also forfeited after the inquiry found him guilty,” a police officer who knows Dahiya said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-cop-on-shooting-spree-kills-father-in-law-injures-female-friend/story-1CZsKmq4JIb43bUiOyc7UM.html

In its complaint lodged at Siliguri police station in north Bengal, where the chief minister is on a three-day tour, the TMC refugee cell said Hazra’s comment was distasteful and an insult to a woman. It went against the culture of India, the complainants said. “By making such a statement at the administrative head of a state, Hazra has violated the Constitution. We see this as an insult to all women,” said the complaint lodged by two women members of the refugee cell, Tara Biswas and Arpita Das. Also read: ‘Will hug Mamata Banerjee if I have Covid-19’ - BJP’s new national secretary from BengalHazra made the statement at Baruipur in South 24 Parganas on Sunday, a day after his party made him national secretary by replacing former state president and veteran leader Rahul Sinha. Sinha reacted sharply, saying after serving the BJP since its birth he had to leave to make way for TMC leaders. On Sunday, Hazra and a large number of BJP workers were not wearing masks and social distancing norms were flouted during a meeting at Baruipur. Reporters asked Hazra why wasn’t he or the others wearing any mask.“Our workers are fighting a bigger enemy than Covid-19. They are fighting Mamata Banerjee. Since they were not affected by Covid-19, they are not scared anymore. I will hug Mamata Banerjee if I get infected. She treated victims of the disease in a pathetic manner. Their bodies were burnt with kerosene. We don’t even treat dead cats or dogs like that,” said Hazra. The statement drew flak. Hazra could not be contacted on Monday after the police complaint was lodged and the BJP distanced itself from the controversy.“Any responsible person should be more careful before making any statement,” said Mukul Roy who was made a national vice president during the reshuffles in the BJP’s national committee in Delhi on Sunday. Hazra was a TMC Lok Sabha MP from Bolpur in Birbhum district. He joined the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He was fielded against popular actress Mimi Chakraborty, the ruling party’s candidate from the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency. Hazra was defeated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/police-complaint-against-bjp-national-secretary-for-covid-hug-remark-on-bengal-cm/story-WJFAJLAXTrCccC8EvRuKBP.html

28-09-2020||Kolkata||Bengal sweet shop owners seek PM Modi’s intervention to roll back FSSAI directive||Sweet shops owners in West Bengal, a state that is known for its traditional sweet treats, has sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee to roll back the latest directive of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that makes it mandatory for sweets shops to declare the ‘best before date’ of non-packaged or loose sweets.The food safety regulator, in a letter dated 25 September to the commissioner of food safety of all states and Union Territories, said, “...In the public interest and to ensure food safety, it has been decided that in case of non-packaged/loose sweets, the container/tray holding sweets at the outlet for sale should display the ‘Best Before Date’ of the product mandatorily with effect from October 1, 2020.”Authorities of the sweet manufacturers’ association said that this could spell doom on the small and medium sweet shops in urban areas and towns, which form the bulk of the Rs 2,000 crore sweets industry in Bengal. Also read: Centre drops offset clause in govt-to-govt deal in new weapons buying policy“While a small-time shop manufactures around 20-30 varieties of sweets every day, for a big shop this can go up to 100 varieties. Imagine keeping a tab on each and every tray and noting down the time and mentioning the best before date on each tray. The industry is already facing a shortage of labour. Also, you need a literate person who can maintain the log. Not all labour in a sweetshop can do that. We would need to employ another person or two for this. This could spell doom,” said Asis Pal, joint secretary of the All West Bengal Sweet Manufacturers’ Association, who has been in the business for more than four decades and has two shops in a district. Bengali sweets, most of which are primarily made of milk and chhena, are not just popular in the state but are also famous across India. According to the association, there are around 1.5 lakh sweets manufacturers and shops in Bengal.“We are ready to abide by laws. But it has to have some practicality. This new directive may suit big brands and traders but would be disastrous for the small and medium traders,” said D Das, who owns a popular confectionary and is a member of the association. The letter also said that the food business operators (FBOs) might also display the date of manufacturing, adding that “it is not mandatory”. The food regulator said that the decision was based on various complaints about the quality and adulteration of sweets, mostly during the festive season.“We have already written to the Prime Minister, the chief minister and Union MSME minister Nitin Gadkari seeking their intervention. We are also trying to meet the chief minister. The new directive would spell doom on us,” said Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-sweet-shop-owners-seek-pm-modi-s-intervention-to-roll-back-fssai-directive/story-KNyqKEHvrVA4bU8CFQbG9O.html

This was announced by committee’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher during a protest near Devidaspura village in Amritsar on the occasion of the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on Monday.The protesters laid siege to tracks on the Amritsar-Delhi rail link and were joined by hundreds of youths. “The Union government had passed the legislations to benefit big corporates. We will intensify our stir and will force the government to scrap the anti-farmer laws,” said Pandher. The farmers under the aegis of the KSC have laid siege to the railway tracks since September 24. Sporting yellow turbans and holding pictures of Bhagat Singh in their hands, the youths from various villages of the Majha region started thronging to the protest site around 10am. They pledged that they will continue supporting the farmers until the controversial laws are scrapped. They termed their joining the protest as “true tribute” to Bhagat Singh on his birthday.Harpal Singh, a youth, who had come from Chabba village, said; “Now, the time has come to walk the path shown by Bhagat Singh. Every youth of Punjab should come out not only to support the farmers, but also to fulfil the dreams of our revolutionary martyrs.”“Our fifth day’s protest is dedicated to Bhagat Singh, who had laid down his life for the freedom of the country. Now, our protest is being joined by hundreds of youth from various villages. This will give strength to our movement,” said Sukhwinder Singh Sabhran, district president of the KSC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-extend-rail-roko-stir-till-oct-2/story-oMIGcDltK2RT0HxyoQq8CL.html

Even the closed rented accommodations are being unnecessarily being charged every month and the landlords are being pressurised to pay up, adding to their monetary woes, he rued.The residents’ body will intensify its movement if their demands are not fulfilled immediately, the SNS secretary warned.Apart from this, the other demands of the SNS include rationalisation of civic bills of paying guests, gymnasium, street vendors and other small shopkeepers; no hiking of garbage and water bills by 10% every year; no 10% late charges for water bills; slashing parking charges; withdrawal of property tax rates for municipal shops, stalls, warehouses owing to coronavirus; waiver of garbage collection and water bills from landlords whose tenants have left to their native places; 20,000 litres of water should be provided free on the lines of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shimla-residents-stage-protest-ask-mc-to-waive-inflated-bills/story-W5hT7f8BB5c0Kbaaa0z4nN.html

They said even after having raised the connectivity issue time and again with the officials concerned, including the chief minister, MLAs and district administration, no progress was made and they were still without a road.Shanghad panchayat pradhan Savitra Devi said many people from the village, including pregnant women, have lost their lives as they were not able to reach the hospital on time due to the unavailability of road. It is disappointing that even after seven decades of Independence, Shanghad has no road, she rued.“We demand the state government to provide us road facilities as soon as possible or else we will start a movement,” said the pradhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-no-motorable-road-85-year-old-man-from-remote-hp-village-dies-on-way-to-hospital/story-coTxBEMGRPR2mZ7M3H8ZrK.html

28-09-2020||Chandigarh||SIT names former Punjab DGP Saini, suspended IG Umranangal as accused in 2015 Behbal Kalan firing case||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing incidents has named former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Paramraj Singh Umranangal as accused in the first information report (FIR) in the Behbal Kalan case registered at Bajakhana police station. A senior member of the SIT said, “During investigation, it was found that Saini and Umranangal were involved in the Behbal Kalan firing conspiracy, so they have been nominated as accused in the FIR.” Though they have been accused of criminal conspiracy, they won’t be arrested immediately as the Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the SIT to give them a seven-day notice before initiating action against them in the police firing cases. The SIT is likely to issue notices to Saini and Umaranangal soon. The development comes weeks after a policeman, the prime accused in the firing incident, turned approver. On September 15, a Faridkot court allowed the SIT’s application seeking pardon to inspector Pardeep Singh, the then reader to former Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Charanjit Singh Sharma. On September 10, SIT member IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had told the Faridkot court that then DGP Saini and suspended IGP Umranangal were the main conspirators in the Behbal Kalan firing incident. However, hearing the plea of another accused, a former Kotkapura station house officer Gurdeep Singh Pandher, the high court last week directed the SIT not to submit any supplementary chargesheet in the Behbal Kalan firing case till the next hearing on October 3. Pandher has alleged in the petition that Kunwar Vijay Pratap is biased against him and he has been threatened on his instance. The high court sought a reply from the state government that if it would be willing to substitute IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap with another officer to be part of the SIT constituted to investigate the Behbal Kalan incident. Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village had died in the police firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. Besides, many people were seriously injured in the incident. Umranangal, who was the then Ludhiana police commissioner, is also an accused in the Kotkapura police firing incident of October 14, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sit-names-former-punjab-dgp-saini-suspended-ig-umranangal-as-accused-in-2015-behbal-kalan-firing-case/story-CRECwO7O0iy5IZtTS2BTiI.html

28-09-2020||City||Covid essentials adding to plastic waste||Covid-19 has pushed up the sale and use of hand sanitisers exponentially and you don’t need much imagination to think of the amount of plastic waste that the empty containers are generating. And that’s not the only impact of Covid- 19 on the environment. With increased hand washing, our consumption of hand soap in plastic dispensers has gone up substantially, thereby increasing the quantum of plastic containers and plastic refill pouches going into trash cans and subsequently to our landfills and water bodies. That’s not all. Increased hand washing and sanitising has robbed our hands of moisture and we are, therefore, buying more moisturisers to overcome the dryness -- so more plastic trash. Worse, the pandemic has made us so nervous that we are buying a variety of power cleaning liquids– for the kitchen, for the floors, for the bathrooms, for the laundry and for sanitising packages. All claiming to kill 99.9 per cent of germs and many of them packaged in plastic trigger sprayers. Another popular item of purchase is the vegetable and fruit cleaner, also filled in plastic bottles. Just think of the amount of plastic debris created from these products, besides the additional amount of chemicals being released into the environment by all these cleaning agents.Then there’s the waste generated by plastic gloves, personal protection equipment and the disposable masks by the general public (this is besides the huge quantities of medical waste coming out of hospitals). Increased online shopping in these Covid times is also resulting in larger volumes of plastic waste, particularly bubble wrap.Un-Plastic Collective, a voluntary multi stakeholder initiative to eliminate plastic pollution and move towards a circular economy, had estimated recently that India generates 9.4 million tones of plastic waste annually , of which 40% uncollected. There are no estimates as yet on the increase in plastic waste as a consequence of Covid-19, but the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that about 75% of the plastic generated on account of the world pandemic will become plastic waste, clogging landfills and floating in water bodies around the world. A highly worrisome scenario.Coming back to sanitisers and cleaners, I checked a number of these containers to see if there is any information on whether the containers are recyclable and the manufacturer takes responsibility for collecting and recycling them or whether they are compostable. I saw no information whatsoever. In fact a look at the wide range of fast moving consumer goods on shop shelves also makes you realise how over the years, our consumption patterns have changed, adding substantially to the plastic waste that we generate. The shift from bathing bars or soap cakes to body washes, hand washes and face washes, from shikakai powder or soapnut powder to shampoos and conditioners, from utensil and laundry washing bars and powders to liquid cleaners and fabric softeners, from an all purpose toilet cleaner to a variety of them for different surfaces, have all stepped up the volume of plastic containers. Covid-19 and the increased generation of plastic waste should make us scrutinise our purchases once again from the point of view of their environmental impact . We obviously cannot do away with alcohol-based hand sanitisers for now, but we can certainly review our choices vis-à-vis household cleaning products and toiletries, eliminate non-essentials and opt as much as possible for products made from natural substances rather than harsh chemicals. More important, we must choose products of only those manufacturers who take these measures in respect of their packaging: (a) use non-plastic packaging or (b) use compostable packaging or (c) collect and process or recycle their containers. There are also manufacturers who are bringing out concentrated or compressed versions of their product to bring down their weight and sell them in eco-friendly packages. Remember, it is only consumer preference and demand that will promote these changes in manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-essentials-adding-to-plastic-waste/story-C7OSKWvv5Rop4uRhqavGWO.html
28-09-2020||City||Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University to speed up crop improvement programmes: V-C||The Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University (HPAU) will speed up various crop improvement programmes for diverse farming communities of north- west Himalayas, vice-chancellor professor HK Chaudhary said on Monday.Chaudhary, who was heading twin departments of genetics and plant breeding and agricultural biotechnology before his appointment as V-C, said scientific innovations and research work at internationally acclaimed High-tech Molecular Cytogenetics and Tissue Culture (MTC) Lab during his leadership, invented Chromosome Elimination Mediated Wide Hybridization Technique. It is cross of wheat and Imperata Cylindrica System leading to Doubled Haploidy (DH) Breeding.“This work has been able to open new vistas by shortening the breeding cycle and accelerating the varietal development programmes of bread (chapati) and durum (pasta) wheat,” he said. He said the HPAU was first to develop release DH wheat variety ‘Him Pratham’ in 2016.Professor Chaudhary said many institutes of the country were using the HPAU facility to accelerate varietal development programmes and also developing gene mapping populations in shortest possible time.This high- tech Lab has also pioneered in establishing, for the first time, molecular cytogenetics facility with the support of ministry of science and technology for physical mapping of targeted genes introgressed in various crop species by using novel tools like Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for enhancing precision of selection of desired recombinants in an accelerated manner.Combination of DH Breeding and Molecular Cytogenetics techniques has opened new horizon in the sphere of speed and precision breeding for the targeted crop improvement in the shortest possible time, he said.The V-C said efforts were afoot in the HPAU laboratory to develop wheat varieties associated with high profile drought and disease resistance for rainfed agriculture and enhance the productivity and quality level by utilising Himalayan old wheat genetic resources.Keeping in view the congenial environment at Palampur and available technical expertise in the high-tech MCT Lab, he said, the HPAU has proposed to develop a national facility for DH Breeding in wheat to cater to the needs of wheat geneticists, breeders and biotechnologists of the country for accelerating their wheat improvement endeavours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-pradesh-agricultural-university-to-speed-up-crop-improvement-programmes-v-c/story-QGNOUajeW3LhgNeXkC9PPL.html
28-09-2020||Dehradun||Two rogue elephants stray into Uttarakhand from Nepal, forest officials fail to track them||Uttarakhand forest officials have failed to track two elephants from Nepal a fortnight after they ventured into the state’s Udham Singh (US) Nagar. Forest officials said they have spotted the animals’ pugmarks several times but have not been able to track them because of the tall bushes. Last year also, two rogue elephants from Nepal had created panic in border areas of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. After straying from Nepal on June 27 last year into Uttarakhand’s Khatima area in US Nagar district and later into Uttar Pradesh, the tuskers killed five people, causing panic in the bordering districts like Rampur, Pilibhit, Bareilly, Moradabad and US Nagar. “This time, two elephants from Shuklafata sanctuary in western Nepal came to the bordering areas of US Nagar nearly two weeks ago. Villagers spotted them and informed us. Our teams have been trying to track them to ensure they don’t enter villages and endanger human lives or damage crops or properties,” said Babu Lal, sub-divisional officer (SDO), forest, Khatima. Lal said it is not clear whether these two elephants are the same tuskers as those of the last year. “Ultimately, they were tranquilised before being shifted from Bilaspur area of Rampur to Khatima,” he said. Last year, forest officials from India and Nepal had met in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve to discuss how effective measures could be taken to monitor and check the entry of elephants from Nepal into the bordering areas of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where they have been damaging crops and killing or injuring people. The SDO said their main concern is to track them and not let them come near the villages. “These elephants from Nepal have become a mystery for forest officials here. Despite patrolling by teams of forest officials, they haven’t succeeded in locating the animals yet. Only their pugmarks have been spotted, not the elephants,” he said. Lal said, “Their location, Nakhatal area of forest, is close to the Nepal border and a traditional elephant corridor. The area is rich in terms of fodder and water. High bushes in the forest due to rainy season are creating a hindrance in spotting them.” Jeevan Chandra Joshi, conservator of forest (CCF), western circle, and Nitish Mani Tripathi, divisional forest officer (DFO), Terai-East, also visited the area last week to take stock of the situation. “Our concern is that they should not enter villages and attack people. We have instructed our officials to trace them and keep a watch on their movement round-the-clock,” said Tripathi. AG Ansari, a Ramnagar-based wildlife expert, said, “Nakhatal connects the elephant corridor in Uttarakhand to Nepal. These elephants from Nepal keep moving in this corridor. Due to the dense growth of bushes these days, it is a bit challenging to locate them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/two-rogue-elephants-stray-into-uttarakhand-from-nepal-forest-officials-fail-to-track-them/story-iVivQ0zZQ6rHEntHhW6MPL.html

You should provide all necessary supplies: Tissues, hand sanitisers or soap and water, masks, distance markers, closed bins,” Jain said in a Facebook post.Experts cautioned against indicating to people that things are okay. “These kinds of messages make people believe that the situation is better; things are returning to normal. But the truth is that over 3,000 infections are still being reported. Plus, we are moving towards winter when the incidence of infections goes up and [it] likely will happen with Covid-19 too. With the Unlock [easing of restrictions for social distancing] process in place, people have thrown caution to the wind, especially those who do not have comorbidities or are not old,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor of pulmonology at New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.Also Read: Covid-19: India crosses 60 lakh-mark, latest million added in 11 daysGupta added people must not be encouraged to flout norms. “If such gatherings do happen, they have to be monitored closely,” he said. “If people travel unnecessarily, they might spread the infection to those who are vulnerable and at risk of severe disease.”Jain also shared a post about herbal remedies like chyawanprash, turmeric milk, and herbal tea made with basil, cinnamon, black pepper, dry ginger, and raisin to boost immunity.On Saturday, Jain said the number of Covid-19 cases has been consistently below 4,000 over the previous week. “Over the week, the positivity rate has also reduced to an average of 6.5%. The hospital bed occupancy has also gone down a little, with about 6,800 people hospitalised. Over 55% of the beds earmarked for Covid-19 are vacant,” Jain said on Saturday. He credited aggressive testing and isolation of patients for the decline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/make-social-gatherings-safe-with-tissues-sanitiser-masks-delhi-health-minister/story-wosJcajvNwNR4qOq1nk9XK.html

I am foreseeing a bigger role for the charismatic leader in 2022 when Punjab goes to the polls. He can do well on the national political scene as the former cricketer has the ability to build a mass campaign. We will make meaningful use of his abilities,” All India Congress Committee general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat said here. On the reorganisation of the state Congress unit, Rawat said the party has assigned him the task of ensuring the Congress returns to power in Punjab in 2022. “For this, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) will be reconstituted. It’s long due. I will meet state Congress leaders and workers to assess the party’s mood, build consensus on issues, and give the feedback to the party president, who will take a final decision.” Rawat did not confirm if Sidhu was being considered to lead the party’s state unit but said he will work for better coordination between the party and the government. On the Shiromani Akali Dal snapping ties with the BJP, he said, “The SAD parted ways as a face-saver on the farmer issue. The SAD and the BJP have lost support of their votebank in Punjab. The Congress has strong chance of returning to power.” Rawat, who has already met Congress rebel members of Parliament Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo in Delhi, said that he had listened to their views and issues raised by them. “Every problem has a solution. Their issues will be sorted out. I have asked them not to speak to the media and to raise their issues on a party platform,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navjot-singh-sidhu-is-an-asset-for-congress-says-party-s-punjab-affairs-in-charge-harish-rawat/story-cUDgcN6Fwr7ItngZew5jaJ.html
28-09-2020||Pune||SPPU issues notice to final year students to vacate hostel premises||The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is gearing up for the final year students’ examination, however, final year students are now facing a fresh issue regarding hostels. Final year students lodged in SPPU hostels have received notices by the SPPU administration to vacate their rooms and collect their luggage by October 3, 2020. However, students are preparing for their exams and most of them who used the hostel are not residents of Pune. Kamlakar Shete, a final year student at SPPU in the Commerce department demanded more time to collect luggage than what is allotted. “On September 25 we got to know about a circular issued by the SPPU hostel department in which they have told students to vacate hostel rooms until October 3. And if the luggage or belongings are not taken away by students by the given date, then it will be kept in the storeroom of the hostels. As most of the students left for their homes before lockdown, we were not able to take our entire luggage, important documents, study material and other goods. Now our examinations are coming close and by issuing such notices students are getting worried and confused. So, our demand is such notices should be taken back and more time must be given to students to collect their luggage,” Shete said. The SPPU management sent the notice to all final year students of the academic year 2019-20 to vacate their hostel rooms by October 3. As the majority of the students are in their hometowns and are preparing for their final exams to be conducted soon, they have taken objection to the directive. Students have demanded an extension; while SPPU has given a deadline of October 3. After the deadline, the SPPU will clear the premises and store the luggage in the storeroom of the university. Prafulla Pawar, SPPU registrar said, “We are aware of the situation and that there is a final year examination scheduled, but we need to start this process at some point in time. Already 60 per cent of students have taken their entire luggage from the hostels. Now for the remaining students, we have issued this circular, and if there is any problem for the students, they can contact us and we will surely help and cooperate with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-issues-notice-to-final-year-students-to-vacate-hostel-premises/story-wcntid4QuyoJ6CG4YyA4cK.html

We will discuss how to proceed in the matter and then challenge the legislation in the Supreme Court.” Capt Amarinder Singh said that he will request Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to join the farmers’ protest. “Rahul Gandhi has been tweeting daily and issuing statements that the BJP has betrayed the farmers,” he said. “The BJP has snatched the constitutional powers of one state after the other. How do we run the state? BJP leaders think they will remain in power but I want to remind them that the Akalis also thought so. People threw them out.

28-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks Kangana Ranaut to submit her tweets, objectionable video by Sanjay Raut||The Bombay high court, while hearing the petition of actor Kangana Ranaut, asked her to substantiate the claim that she had been abused by Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut. Senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf, appearing for the actor, played a video clip wherein Raut is heard saying “wo haramkhor ladki”. Dr Saraf said that Raut used the abusive word to refer to Ranaut, and it was Raut’s malice towards Ranaut which prompted the demolition of her Pali Hill bungalow on September 9. However, when the bench questioned Raut’s lawyer advocate Pradeep Thorat, he clarified that as his client had not mentioned Ranaut’s name when he spoke, it could not be construed that Raut had abused Ranaut. Dr Saraf informed the court that the abusive stance of Raut had been prompted by a tweet made by Ranaut on September 5. Also Read: Kangana Ranaut must be booked over anti-farmer tweet: Lawyer files complaint in Karnataka courtSenior counsel Aspi Chinoy for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “I believe the tweet which is referred by Dr Saraf was made around 5 pm. If Dr Saraf is referring to any other tweet prior to that it will have some relevance.” In light of this, Chinoy sought a clarification on the timing of the tweet which allegedly led to the altercation between Ranaut and Raut. After hearing the submissions, the court asked Dr Saraf to submit all Ranaut’s tweets and the entire video interview of Raut. The hearing will continue at 3pm. Ranaut had filed a petition on September 9 through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee seeking a stay on the ongoing demolition of her bungalow at Pali Hill by the BMC. The BMC had issued Ranaut a show cause notice on September 7 and a stop work notice under Section 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act was pasted on her gate on September 8. The stop work notice stated that during inspection of the bungalow on September 5 by a mukadam and another inspection by the executive engineer on September 7 it was found that there were 14 unauthorised alterations and additions to the bungalow which were illegal as per the sanctioned building plan and were carried out without the permission of the BMC’s ward office concerned. On expiry of the 24-hour period after the stop work notice was issued, BMC personnel, along with Khar police, had entered the bungalow and started the demolition. Ranaut filed a petition the same day and sought an urgent hearing and stay on the demolition, which the court granted and asked both parties to maintain status quo. Thereafter, Ranaut sought to amend the petition, which the court allowed. In the next hearing, Ranaut’s amended petition, apart from the prayer to stay the demolition, also sought Rs 2 crore as compensation for the damage caused to the bungalow and movable properties. Ranaut had claimed that almost 40% of the bungalow had been demolished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-kangana-ranaut-to-submit-her-tweets-objectionable-video-by-sanjay-raut/story-iZuEixdA8xRC2Qlu9FdQKK.html

But the only thing is whether we are blinding ourselves to the other patients,” Justice Jalan said during the hearing.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter. Also Read: Delhi HC stays AAP govt decision to reserve 80% ICU beds in private hospitals for Covid-19The bench did not grant interim relief to the government even as its additional standing counsel, Sanjoy Ghose, said Covid-19 cases were increasing exponentially, warranting the reservation.On September 22, the court had stayed the government’s September 12 order reserving 80% of all ICU beds in private hospitals and nursing homes for Covid-19 patients, saying it appeared to be “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and in “violation of the fundamental rights of an individual”. It said the state cannot discriminate between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.In the order, the Delhi government directed nursing homes and private hospitals to reserve the beds with immediate effect.On Monday, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, who appeared for the Delhi government, told the court that Covid-19 cases were again rising in the city. He said Covid-19 patients require care related to lungs, kidney, etc, as the virus attacks these organs.The court said the government has to first satisfy the court that there are sufficient numbers of ICU beds available for non-Covid patients. “Also show us how you are compensating private hospitals for keeping their ICU beds vacant for Covid patients,” the bench said.Advocate Ghose told the court that there are 3,222 ICU beds and only 1,186 of them are being reserved for Covid-19 patients. Jain said several patients were coming to Delhi from other parts of the country for treatment as well. ASG Jain told the court it had not given any money to hospitals because none of them have sought compensation.Also Read: 30% patients in Delhi hospitals in ICUs, says govt dataFollowing some arguments, the court posted the matter for further hearing on October 9.The government, in its plea, said the stay order did not take into account the submissions regarding the surge in the number of Covid-19 patients and its efforts to tackle the changing situation. It said states such as Maharashtra have issued similar orders and notifications to tackle the issue of rising cases.“Even in the approach adopted by such other States, health care providers have been directed to make all attempts to increase their bed capacity to accommodate maximum number of patients. 80% of total operational bed capacity (excluding beds of PICU, NICU, day care, maintenance haemodialysis) will be regulated by rates prescribed,” the government said in its plea.The association moved the court against the September 12 order, saying it puts non-Covid-19 patients at risk of contracting the virus. It alleged that the order was issued without prior discussion with private hospitals and understanding the current demand-supply gap in critical care beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/icu-bed-reservation-delhi-hc-asks-for-heathcare-providers-association-response/story-GHC1LSo3I6jiTH5TPN3H9I.html

28-09-2020||Chandigarh||Centre must make MSP a legal right, say Congress MPs Bajwa, Dullo||A Congress Rajya Sabha members Shamsher Singh Dullo and Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday demanded that the Centre must make the minimum support price (MSP) a legal right to prevent private corporations from buying agricultural goods below this price.Speaking to reporters after paying obeisance at Golden Temple, Dullo and Bajwa, both former state Congress chiefs, said that Punjab must unite and ensure the Centre repeals the Acts that seek to liberalise agriculture. “By notifying the anti-farmer laws on September 27, the Government of India has committed a mistake. The people of Punjab have been the sword arm of the country and have always been at the forefront to protect the nation. In the 1950s, when food security of India was under threat, and the Centre pushed through the Green Revolution, farmers of Punjab and Haryana led the battle to ensure India became the food surplus nation it is today. These sacrifices by farmers of Punjab and Haryana have come to nought now that the bills have been become law,” they said in a joint statement distributed on the occasion. The two Congress MPs said the Centre must make MSP a legal right to prevent private corporations from buying agricultural goods below this price. “Any purchase below the MSP should be made a punishable offence. The Centre must use the Swaminathan Commission recommendation to fix the MSP of crops. The Food Corporation of India must also be made to buy all prices at the MSP and never below,” their statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-must-unite-to-ensure-centre-repeals-anti-farmer-acts-congress-mps-bajwa-dullo/story-E89AGmEebiITv89FDS7KuO.html
28-09-2020||City||Covid-19: Maharashtra mortality rate rises over past two weeks||Maharashtra has reported a rise in the weekly Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in the last two weeks. The CFR, the proportion of people who have died among the confirmed cases, had dropped to its lowest since the outbreak of the pandemic to 1.74% and 1.91% respectively in the first and second weeks of September (August 31-Sept 6 and Sept 7-13), only to see a sudden rise after that. In the last two weeks (Sept 14-20 and Sept 21-27), the CFR rose to 2.11 and 2.22% respectively, which also resulted in the overall rise in the rate. The two weeks reported 148,334 cases and 3,140 deaths; and 130,590 cases and 2,900 deaths respectively. Also read: India inching closer to 1% Covid-19 death rateThe first two weeks of September (August 31-Sept 6 and Sept 7-13) had reported 126,523 cases and 2,205 deaths; and 153,096 cases and 2,927 deaths respectively. The fourth week has seen the drop in the cases and the fatalities, but the death rate kept mounting, which is a cause of worry for the authorities.According to the health department officials, they have not been able to bring down both the fatality and the positivity rate vis-a-vis the target set. “In July, we set the target of bringing the CFR below 1% and the positivity rate below 10%, but could not achieve them in three months. Positivity rate still hovers between 20 and 22%. We have now been targeting aggressive tracing through ‘My Family My Responsibility drive’ launched on September 15 and hope to see cases being brought to the facilities at early stages. This would help us in bringing the caseload as well as the CFR down,” said an official from the department requesting anonymity. The officer also said that the hike in the number of tests and allowing inter-district movement from September 2 has resulted in the sudden spurt in the cases. Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, former national president of Indian Medical Association, has attributed the rise in the mortality rate to faulty management of data and weak health infrastructure. “First of all, the Covid-19 is a ‘patchy pandemic’ which has no certain pattern to describe. The data maintained by the state government has many factors attached to it, leaving room to believe it to be unscientific. Many a times, the older cases and fatalities are added to it, sometimes the turnaround time of the reports take days, resulting in a sudden rise or drop in the percentage,” he said. Dr Wankhedkar said that the overall CFR in Maharashtra is one of the highest owing to the poor healthcare system and mechanism that lags in tracing contacts. “The patients are admitted to the government facilities for Covid-19 only after their health has deteriorated. The state should now seriously focus upon bringing down the CFR,” he said.Maharashtra has recorded 1,339,232 Covid-19 cases and 35,571 deaths till Sunday evening. The state conducted 693,408 tests over the past week (Sept 21-27) at the daily rate of 99,058 with the positivity rate of 18.83%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-maharashtra-mortality-rate-rises-over-past-two-weeks/story-oCrVI7p0K9axaOz8A3qU0N.html

Saini walked in alone around 11am as the SIT waited for him at the Mataur police station in Mohali. The police had pasted summons outside his house in Sector 20, Chandigarh. The Supreme Court recently granted Saini interim protection from arrest in the case. Multani, the junior engineer with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco), was allegedly picked up by the police in December 1991 after a terror attack on Saini that left three policemen dead. Saini was injured in the attack. Trouble started for the former DGP when two co-accused policemen turned approvers and recorded statements against Saini, corroborating the series of incidents which proved that Multani was tortured and eliminated at the ex-DGP’s behest. Thereafter, an independent witness who is a resident of Sector 33, Chandigarh, advocate GK Mann, and another independent witness, who is a resident of Kharar, deposed against Saini, turning approvers.

CDRI has now started the trials at ERA’s Medical College.CDRI director Tapas Kumar Kundu said the idea is to ensure a broader base for trails that will give more accurate findings. “The trials are being done as per the schedule and if everything goes right, we will be in a position to release the findings in November.”Kundu said Umifenovir has a good safety profile and acts by preventing the entry of the virus into human cells and also by priming the immune system. “It has been in use to cure influenza in countries like China and Russia for over two decades. Our preliminary research shows that it could be a suitable candidate in Covid-19 management. The clinical trials are aimed to gauge its efficacy.”He declined to specify the number of Covid-19 patients involved but people aware of the matter said it could be between 150 to 200.CDRI began the trials after getting a go-ahead from the Drug Controller General of India in June.As part of the trials, patients have been divided into groups with some administered Umifenovir while the rest placebo. None of the candidates will know if they are getting the drug or a placebo to check the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Umifenovir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cdri-extends-covid-19-drug-trial-to-another-lucknow-hospital-results-by-november/story-qNMDuu2qqro9KritpaeAgM.html

The commissioner said wearing a mask was mandatory during the election, while arrangements for ensuring compliance of social distancing had also been made at polling booths. The voting will take place from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm. After the voting is over, counting of votes will begin. The second phase of election will take place on October 3, third on October 6 and the fourth on October 10. In total, 3,848 gram panchayats will go to polls in the state in four phases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/1st-phase-of-rajasthan-gram-panchayat-election-begins/story-e5v9MNr9HUHv5poiPd5lNP.html

28-09-2020||Delhi||Mandatory quarantine order for Covid-19 patients above 60 in Delhi withdrawn||The southwest district of Delhi withdrew an order on Sunday that mandated isolation in a Covid Care Centre or Covid Health Centre for any Covid-19 patient above the age of 60 or with comorbidities. The home isolation guidelines by Delhi government, similar to the Central government guidelines, allow those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms to isolate at home, provided there is enough space for them to isolate themselves from other members of the family. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described home isolation, along with aggressive testing, as the “most important strategy” for fighting coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city. In June, when the number of cases had last surged, the government had fought the lieutenant governor’s decision of mandatory institutional quarantine for all Covid-19 patients. Also Read: Covid-19: India inching closer to 1% death rateAccording to data shared by the government, over 101,000 patients have recovered in home isolation in the city and only 40 people died of the infection in home isolation till September 17. Last week, the government had directed all district commissioners to mandatorily shift any Covid-19 patient in home isolation to institutional isolation if they were found to be violating guidelines. Southwest Delhi’s order had come just a day before this meeting. As per government data, as on September 17, 7,847 patients had recovered in the district in home isolation, there were 1,545 active cases, 110 people were moved to hospitals and none of the patients had died in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/order-for-mandatory-institutional-isolation-for-senior-comorbid-patients-withdrawn-by-s-w-delhi/story-ePUdgFa82iPljMGj7K0VDP.html
28-09-2020||Lucknow||UP Assembly bypolls: Congress names candidates for Suar and Bangarmau seats||The Congress on Sunday became the first political party to start declaring candidates for the forthcoming Assembly bypolls for eight seats in Uttar Pradesh. The party named its candidates for two of the eight seats. Haider Ali Khan alias Hamzah Mian will contest from Suar (Rampur) and Aarti Vajpayee from Bangarmau (Unnao). All India Congress Committee general secretary Mukul Wasnik announced the two names saying that the Congress President, Sonia Gandhi has approved them. The two candidates would make the contest interesting and tough on the respective seats as both are local and are from strong political families that had won elections in the respective area multiple times, Congress leaders claimed. Haider Ali Khan is the son of Nawab Kazim Ali and the grandson of Begum Noor Bano. Kazim Ali had won the Suar assembly seat thrice as Congress candidate while Noor Bano had twice been a Congress MP from Rampur. This would be Haider Ali Khan’s first assembly election. Aarti Vajpayee is the daughter of late Gopinath Dixit, a former UP minister and was also related to late Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit. She had contested the same seat in 2012 as an independent candidate. “Both our candidates are heavyweights and are local. They have the trust of people,” said Anshu Awasthi, a UPCC spokesperson. Elections are likely to be announced soon for Malhani (Jaunpur), Suar (Rampur), Tundla (Firozabad), Bulandshahr (Bulandshahr), Naugawan Sadat (Amroha), Ghatampur (Kanpur City), Bangarmau (Unnao), and Deoria (Deoria) assembly seats. Of these Malhani and Suar were held by the Samajwadi Party and the rest of the six by BJP. In the last by-polls in 2019 for 11 seats, the Congress had drawn a blank. Bangarmau and Suar seats fell vacant following disqualification of the sitting MLAs on these seats. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Bangarmaul Kuldeep Singh Sengar was disqualified following his conviction (life sentence awarded to him in a rape case) and Samajwadi Party’s Mohammad Abdullah Azam’s election to Suar seat fell vacant after the Allahabad High Court declared his election invalid in a fake birth certificate issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-assembly-bypolls-congress-names-candidates-for-suar-and-bangarmau-seats/story-WvU5ENmeXtT82VXJlUPxTM.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality likely to improve slightly: IMD||With mainly clear sky and strong surface winds expected on Monday and Tuesday, Delhi’s air quality is likely to improve slightly. According to scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), strong surface winds are expected over the next two days, keeping the air quality from dropping. “Because of slight rainfall in neighbouring Rajasthan, strong winds are travelling towards Delhi. The winds are also likely to reduce the overall humidity levels. However, this is likely to change from October 1 when the wind speed will reduce,” said a senior IMD scientist. The IMD has warned that the air quality may dip slightly from next month with a change in wind pattern and reduction in wind speed because of the overall weather transition. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) on Monday at 6 am was 125 in the ‘moderate’ category. This is likely to improve with the winds picking up, as the day progresses. The average overall Delhi AQI was recorded at 117 on Sunday, as per CPCB data. “The air quality is likely to improve though remaining in the moderate category over the next two days,” said a senior CPCB official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-likely-to-improve-slightly-imd/story-GD6Ma7a00U0MF1ZZYl7HGP.html

The two men decided to leave the dhaba, but they were attacked from behind,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cop-saves-man-from-armed-attackers-in-delhi-s-anand-parbat/story-OLMJwA09WLR6S55hSA2MAK.html

28-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Her plans for tomorrow, and for days after tomorrow||It’s late night and Poonam Yadav is sitting by the desk, with her laptop and scores of bulky books on Corporate Tax, Strategic Management and other subjects of the kind. “I have my first of the final year exams in the morning,” she says, looking half-amused as she chats on WhatsApp video. Is she smiling at the ironic timing of this rare power cut, that has forced her to light a candle? She playfully shrugs. A masters student in commerce, Ms Yadav is the only one in the family to be awake at this hour, in the third-floor house in Gurugram’s Sector 11. In her mid-20s, she will be the only person in her family to become a post-graduate. She is also the family’s only earning female. “I’m a beauty professional.”In the eerie stillness of the quiet hour, Ms Yadav explains that she prefers to depend on herself to finance her dreams. “I don’t like being told, ‘Ab study band karo aur shaadi karo (now, stop the studies and get married).’”Three years ago, she trained in a beauty salon and started a salon-at-home service. It’s by diving into her earnings drawn in this career that she bought her study table, laptop and a series of mobiles—while the supportive family paid half the amount for the scooty.Not looking an inch nervous about the approaching Cost Accounting Standard and Reporting exam, she declares she has many plans. “If I like anything I have to learn it quick... so I learned stitching from mummy, car driving from bhayya, and in the lockdown, I taught myself pickle-making on YouTube.” She also set up a kitchen garden on her terrace as her beauty business took a severe beating due to the pandemic, “perhaps because my regular clients fear calling me at home due to virus threat.”After finishing her exams, Ms Yadav intends to prepare for scores of competitive entrances for clerical-level placements in government departments. Winning one of those hard-to-get jobs won’t be the culmination of her ambitions, though. Leaning closer to the phone screen, she says, “I do not want to stick to just one thing... I have many dreams, I want to try them all.” Even so, she confesses: “At some point I would be obliged to marry. Then, what I will be doing will also depend on the expectations of the family I go into.”By now it’s almost midnight, and she must get back to her books. The exam starts at 10am tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-her-plans-for-tomorrow-and-for-days-after-tomorrow/story-K9weyvr1DpBcNgLyVgF2VM.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||Fatality rate lower than 1% over last 10 days: Satyendar Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said that Covid-19 case fatality rate in the national capital was less than 1% in the last 10 days while attributing the spike in the number of fresh infections to the increase in testing.The case fatality rate (CFR) is the proportion of infected people who have died from the disease.He said Delhi recorded 3,372 fresh cases on Saturday and 4,476 patients recovered within 24 hours.As on Sunday, Delhi had a total of 271,114 Covid-19 cases and 5,235 deaths due to the disease, according to the Delhi government’s daily bulletin. Commenting on 46 deaths reported on Saturday — the highest in nearly 70 days -- Jain said, “We do not look at the figures for a single day. The average fatality rate for the last 10 days has been 0.94%. The patients who have succumbed are not those who tested positive in a day. These are people who tested positive 15-20 days back. That is why we take the average of 10 days,” he said.The overall case fatality rate is 1.94%, the data shows. The occupancy of beds in Delhi hospitals has declined in the last four to five days and 55% beds are vacant, the minister added.The Delhi government had constituted a three-member committee to audit daily deaths caused by the disease in the city.Jain said the committee visited all the hospitals and the report is “satisfactory”.“There were a few glitches which have been ironed out. There was a time when the fatality rate was at 4% but it has remained below 1% in the last 10 days,” he said.In the national capital, the number of containment zones breached the 2,000-mark last week, which Jain said is a part of Delhi’s strategy to tackle the spread of the virus. As on Sunday, there were 2,380 containment zones in Delhi.“We tripled the number of tests and those who tested positive were isolated in small zones to contain the spread. We knew we would have to do it aggressively for two to four weeks and we are seeing positive results now as the cases are declining,” he added.“Wherever cases were reported, now there is a slowdown. In the last seven days, cases and positivity rate have declined. The positivity rate for the last seven days has been 6.5%. Two weeks ago, it was 8.5% and three weeks ago it was 9%.The positivity rate shows how widespread the virus is in a region.The Delhi government has so far provided 60,042 oximeters to patients in home quarantine, according to official figures.The Arvind Kejriwal government had in June announced that it would provide oximeters to all Covid-19 patients in home isolation with no symptoms or mild symptoms of the disease and facing breathing problems due to low oxygen levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fatality-rate-lower-than-1-over-last-10-days-jain/story-mjmP2yhKJTbSfLaWLYXavI.html

28-09-2020||Delhi||Join drive to prevent spread of dengue: Kejriwal to RWAs||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to residents’ welfare associations (RWA) in the national capital to endorse the “10 Hafte –10 Baje –10 Minute (10 weeks, 10 o’ clock, 10 minutes)” campaign against dengue and other vector-borne diseases.“I appeal to all RWAs to talk to people in their neighbourhoods and motivate them to join the campaign. We have to join hands in the fight against dengue. We have to stop the breeding of mosquitoes and protect our families, and all Delhi residents, from dengue,” the chief minister said in a statement.The campaign urges the public to inspect their homes for any possible sources of stagnant water, which may lead to the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, which spread diseases. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government launched the programme last year in a bid to rein in the number of dengue cases and deaths.Several senior AAP leaders, MPs, MLAs, councillors, as well as party volunteers joined the campaign, sharing their pictures on social media.Saurabh Gandhi, secretary of United Residents of Delhi (URD), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, said, “WhatsApp groups maintained by RWA groups have played a significant role in anti-dengue, anti-malaria campaigns. We shall continue with our efforts on this front.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/join-drive-to-prevent-spread-of-dengue-kejriwal-to-rwas/story-gu7GE9CGeYBX07ktqsosaL.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||4 days, 14,000 applications: Demand for HSRPs hots up||Around 14,000 vehicle owners in Delhi have applied for high-security registration plates (HSRP) and colour-coded stickers since Wednesday — when the Delhi government issued a public notice urging vehicle owners to fix their vehicles’ number plates and avoid being penalised, even though no deadline has been set so far.“Between September 23 and 26, 13,966 vehicle owners have applied for HSRP and colour-coded stickers,” said a transport department official, who asked not to be identified.The official said there are around 3.2 million vehicles in Delhi — commercial and private — which are supposed to have high-security registration plates. These include around 1.1 million four-wheelers and 1.9 million two-wheelers, while the rest include auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, buses, trucks, and others. The rule applies largely to vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, as vehicles registered after that date are mandatorily equipped with HSRPs and stickers, the official said.In 2018, the Delhi government had made it mandatory for vehicles registered in the Capital to be equipped with HSRP. Since then, around 3.5 million vehicle owners in the city have updated their registration plates, the transport official said.Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Thursday wrote to the transport department, asking for provisions be made for vehicle owners who want to avail only stickers.In the letter, Gahlot also asked the department to make provisions for vehicle owners who own vehicles of brands that may not have showrooms and dealerships in Delhi, and to do away with the requirement of uploading registration papers and other documents while booking a time slot with a dealer.To get an HSRP and colour-coded stickers, one has to contact any of the 236 vehicle dealers authorised by the Delhi government. The list is available on the state transport department’s website. Or, one may book an appointment with the chosen dealer online.Starting Monday, the website can be used to book slots for availing stickers too, said another government official.Vehicles registered in other states will need to have their registration plate upgraded from authorised dealer in the respective state.“It takes four or five days for the HSRP to be ready and delivered to the vehicle dealer. The customer will have to go to the dealer just once at the scheduled appointment date and time to get the HSRP affixed. The process does not take more than 30 minutes, subject to the existing circumstances,” said a spokesperson of Rosmerta Security Systems Private Limited, which manufactures HSRP and manages the website for booking time slots with dealers.Addressing concerns that people would not get enough time to install the registration plates and colour-coded stickers, transport minister Gahlot said, “Adequate time will be given to people for compliance.”Under the motor vehicles law, transport department officials and traffic officials can fine any vehicle between ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 for not having HSRP and colour-coded stickers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/4-days-14-000-applications-demand-for-hsrps-hots-up/story-wE8D2orI7mvFND8oP8DmwM.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||With Delhi’s pollution going up, watchdog begins to crack whip||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has launched a crack down on waste burning and industrial units using fuels that emit toxic fumes at 13 pollution hot spots across the city.In Delhi, 13 areas — Okhla phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram and Jahangirpuri — were identified as hot spots by the DPCC and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) last year based on particulate matter (PM) concentrations. Pollution levels in these areas were found to be higher than the city’s average.According to DPCC officials, during inspection drives, more than 20 such units using unapproved fuels in areas such as Mandoli in east Delhi have been issued notices.Also read: Farm fires set to continue as subsidy may not encourage shift to tech“The drive has been going on for the past 10 days and notices have been issued to errant industrial units. The units have been given time to convert to piped natural gas (PNG), failing which the units will be shut down,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) had asked the DPCC to direct all agencies concerned to formulate an action plan to curb pollution levels at the 13 hot spots sites ahead of winter.It had also asked the DPCC and other agencies to start night patrolling at the hot spots from October 15.Every year, Delhi’s pollution levels soar in winter due to a combination of factors, including changes in meteorology such as cold weather, calm winds, local emissions, coupled with stubble-burning in neighbouring states.The pollution watchdog has also roped in industrial associations to keep a vigil and not allow dumping of waste, which is eventually put to fire.Also read: Air quality on the decline in Delhi, expect worse in coming week“A number of spots such as Anand Vihar and Punjabi Bagh, among others where traffic congestion and dust pollution is a major issue, road owning agencies have been asked to pave the stretches and work out an arrangement with the traffic police to reduce congestion,” the official said.DPCC has imposed fines amounting to Rs4 crore on 31 ready mix concrete (RMC) plants and eight large construction sites for violating air pollution control norms. The pollution control body also issued directions to stop construction and demolition work at four large sites for not installing anti-smog guns and causing air pollution.“Steps taken to minimize dust emission were deficient at 31 RMC plants. Accordingly, action has been initiated. Penalties ranging between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh have been imposed,” DPCC had said in a statement. “Directions have been issued to close 11 plants where violations were more serious,” it said.The Central Public Works Department has been asked to stop work at CGO Complex and deposit an environmental compensation of Rs5 lakh for not taking dust control measures, including an anti-smog gun, the DPCC said.In an action taken report prepared by the Epca based on inspection of 15 locations, including the hot spots and surrounding areas, the anti-pollution watchdog found that dumping of garbage/construction and demolition waste/industrial waste, road dust as well as traffic congestion are major contributors to high pollution levels in these areas.Epca inspected several locations, mostly having confirmed and non-confirmed industrial pockets, during August-September.“In most industrial areas, plastic, rubber and cloth waste was found dumped and burning in some places. More material was found stacked for burning. We have asked concerned agencies to file an action taken report in the matter before the next review meeting,” said Bhure Lal, Epca chairperson.Meanwhile, the number of crop stubble burning cases in Punjab has been increasing over the past five days, especially in Amritsar district, satellite images released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) have shown. Nasa also warned that with plumes of smoke being seen over Delhi, the city’s air quality may also deteriorate in the coming weeks.Delhi government data shows that last year stubble burning accounted for 44% of the city’s air pollution.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said that now with the opening up of the economy, the PM concentrations are again building up. “To curb overall pollution levels, there is a need for a spot-specific local solutions as well as city level systemic solution. For instance, paving an unpaved road could be a local solution, but in case of waste burning, a larger systemic solution is required so that it doesn’t get burnt at any time of the year. An interface between the two strategies is the need of the hour,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-delhi-s-pollution-going-up-watchdog-begins-to-crack-whip/story-yXltRPA8nQTNQA7cxaSHCI.html
28-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 shadow over big, fat weddings in Delhi||With the wedding season just round the corner, banquet and tent house owners are demanding that the Centre and the Delhi government relax the number of guests at a wedding function—currently only 50 people are allowed—to 50% of the the banquet hall’s capacity.They want the restriction on the number of guests be waived off in the next Unlock guidelines, which are likely to be announced soon.While the Centre had allowed a gathering of 100 people from September 20 onwards in its Unlock 4 guidelines, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently allowed only 50 people in wedding gatherings. The decision was made due to a rise in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, said an official.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBanquet owners say that this has adversely impacted their business. While the number of bookings for the upcoming wedding season is far less as compared to last year, some banquet halls have started getting cancellation requests.Puneesh Khanna, 45, director of Lavnaya Motel, a banquet facility in north Delhi’s Alipur, resumed work earlier this month after five months of closure because of restrictions imposed to halt the spread of Covid-19.Khanna said, “We have been banking on the upcoming season to stay afloat. But the order has led to confusion among people. Those who had booked the hall thinking that 100 people will be allowed have started cancelling the event. In the past week, 10-15% bookings have been cancelled.”Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 6 millionWith over 50 motels and farmhouses along GT Karnal Road, Alipur is one of Delhi’s preferred destinations for big, fat, fancy weddings. Popular wedding venues are also located in Wazirpur, Peeragarhi, Rohini, Punjabi Bagh, Chattarpur, Mehrauli, etc, that can accommodate anywhere between 1,000 and 1,500 guests.Like Khanna, banquet and tent houses owners in Delhi now are pinning their hopes on the wedding season in November and December after facing huge losses due to the lockdown and Covid restrictions.Banquet and tent house owners ask why they are not being allowed when gyms, restaurants and Delhi Metro have been permitted to operate on 50% capacity. Sandeep Madan, owner of The Heritage Grand at Britannia Chowk in north Delhi, said, “Metro has started at 50% capacity. The government has allowed gyms and restaurants to operate. Then why not us? There are over 10 lakh families associated with our business.”Madan said that banquet owners as well as those who are planning weddings are in a dilemma. “The government should give some clarity of what they plan to do. We can restart our businesses on a week’s notice. People book banquet halls months in advance,” said Madan, who is the senior vice president of the Community Welfare Banquet Association.Also read: Why adequate testing is crucial to saving livesWhile uncertainty looms large, some banquets have started taking bookings based on fixed charge for the hall and a gathering of 100-250 people. Ramesh Dang, president of the Delhi Banquet Federation, said, “We are waiting for the next set of guidelines. We will take up the matter with the Centre, Delhi government and the Lieutenant governor of Delhi and request them to allow gathering up to 50% of the capacity. Currently, we are taking minimum bookings for the venue. As for the number of guests, we are telling the clients that it will depend on the government’s order.”A majority of banquets — there are around 500 in Delhi — have 2-3 halls with a capacity of 350-500 guests each.Virender Singh, who runs a construction material firm in Mehrauli and lives in Aya Nagar, said his family had cancelled his 22-year-old niece’s wedding scheduled for April 26. The family had then planned to call 1,000-odd people. The event was postponed to November 29. The family hired a tent house to set up a venue in a park. But now that plan also stands cancelled.“There is no clarity on how many guests will be allowed. We have a big family. If we count just our close relatives, we have at least 80-90 people whom we have to call. There is no clarity on whether the government will increase the number of guests. For us, it is a big event. We don’t want to spoil it. We have cancelled the wedding. We will plan it once things are normal,” said Singh.While banquet owners have started bookings, tent house owners are still out of business. A majority of tents are erected for big weddings and other events mostly held in parks. But according to lockdown norms, commercial activities in parks are prohibited.“Customers who want big weddings opt for tent houses. But due to the restriction on the number of guests, there is no demand for us. People are opting for banquets. The government should think about us also,” said Nitin Gulati, owner of Gulati tents, who largely operates in west and north Delhi.Gulati also said that there was a shortage of manpower since labourers engaged with them had gone home and were yet to return. Even banquet halls are working with limited staff with only one guard deployed to screen guests at the limited number of functions which are being organised these days.A large number of tent houses have taken godowns on hire to store items. Pankaj Shokeen, president of the Delhi Tent Federation, said, “There are close to 5,700 tent house owners in Delhi. As these are temporary structures, people have taken big godowns in villages to store goods. Now owners have asked them to vacate as they are unable to pay rent,” Shokeen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-shadow-over-big-fat-weddings-in-delhi/story-O5NucA9dhDoYbJSvIO9ipI.html

He said that breaking the alliance was ‘too little and too late’. Badal’s aides, who were earlier supporting the bill, recently took a u-turn on realising that they were losing their political ground in the state, he added. “But now they are exposed. Both Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal had won the elections by sitting comfortably on the Modi wave. I challenge them to resign and fight for re-election to prove that they had won without Modi wave,” said Bains. “Till now, the BJP was quiet on the illegal businesses of Badals and their aides. As now they are out of favour, the cases of drugs against Bikram Singh Majithia will resurface. I hope a probe into Badal family’s private transport racket will also be launched and reveal how it caused losses to the government-run public transport sector,” said Bains. On the issue of allying with BJP, Bains said, “We are fighting for farmers, while the saffron party is ruining the farming sector. I hope the local BJP leadership will visit Delhi and acquaint the central leadership about the situation in Punjab.” Bains asked chief minister Amarinder Singh to lead the farmers’ agitation to Delhi to press the government to withdraw the bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-s-too-little-too-late-bains-on-sad-snapping-ties-with-bjp/story-d22LJiJBURM416to0iun2L.html

Under the initiative, 24 city roads have been adopted for cleaning and maintenance. The MC will look after the dust management on these roads and also undertake the repair of three pothole-ridden roads. Besides, strict action will be taken against those found littering here.

Waste segregation survey The MC will also conduct a survey of 10,000 households to study the implementation of waste segregation. Besides encouraging residents to separate wet and dry waste, the civic body will also exhort them to make useful products from waste material. Green initiative Apart from that, cleanliness competitions will also be organised for the 95 councillors and sanitary inspectors of the health department. An independent agency will monitor the cleanliness initiatives undertaken by councillors and sanitary inspectors and accordingly declare the winners. Councillors to be sent to study Indore model Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mayor Balkar Singh said that it is the duty of the MC to clean and beautify the city but it cannot happen without the cooperation of the public. “The entire MC team is working hard to beautify the city.

He said that if Indore can secure India’s cleanest city tag, why can’t Ludhiana. “We will send a team of councillors to Indore for comparison and to ascertain that where we are lacking,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eye-on-swachh-rankings-mayor-launches-clean-ludhiana-green-ludhiana-campaign/story-YCq0ROVrehnLYnPSVLjsqO.html
28-09-2020||City||Political dynamics in Ludhiana set to change as SAD, BJP go separate ways||The snapping of ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will change the political dynamics in Ludhiana. Normally sharing seats in the assembly constituencies of Ludhiana urban, SAD is now likely to field their candidates in Ludhiana West, North and Central constituencies. Conventionally these seats were reserved for BJP candidates on seat share basis. However, the saffron party had lost all three seats in the 2017 assembly elections. The SAD leaders had been eying these constituencies for long, wishing to field their own candidates.During the 2017 elections, some SAD leaders had even deserted the party to fight as independents.Madan Lal Bagga, once a prominent leader in the party, had snapped ties with the Akalis and fought the elections from Ludhiana North in 2017. However, he lost the elections. In a twofold blow to the SAD, the then BJP candidate Parveen Bansal had also suffered a defeat.May lead to vote splitting Political experts believe that the breaking of alliance between the two parties will also divide the dedicated vote bank and increase the possibility of a multi-cornered contest with Congress, SAD, BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and Lok Insaaf Party fielding their respective candidates.SAD senior spokesperson and former cabinet minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “Not just in Ludhiana, we will fight alone across all constituencies in the state. Our workers are enthusiastic and filled with renewed energy.” He added, “SAD has a legacy of making sacrifices in the interest and welfare of the people of Punjab. We will not let an inch of land fall in the hands of corporates. First our leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal did not hesitate to resign to register her protest against the farm bill and then the party decided to snap ties with the BJP. Our workers and leaders were feeling suffocated in this alliance as the BJP is turning communal and pro-corporate in nature. Our decision of pulling out from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will have far-reaching repercussions on BJP.” While addressing party workers at a gurdwara in Alamgir Sahib on Saturday morning, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had hinted that he would analyse the performance of party workers in each assembly constituency and accordingly allot the tickets. On the other hand, Dakha MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali, said, “I am thankful to the SAD high command for snapping ties with the BJP. The saffron brigade was trying to destroy the farmers but we will not let this happen.” BJP’s state vice-president Parveen Bansal reiterated that it was the 23-year-old alliance between the SAD and the BJP that had taken Punjab on the path of development. “The alliance worked as a strong bridge between the communities divided by the dark days of militancy. However, it is the SAD that decided to part ways from us after praising the bills as pro-farmer. Let me reiterate, we have not touched the old system of procurement. We have just provided another option to the farmers to sell their produce. Our decision is being projected as harsh to cash on the farm vote bank but it is going to help the farmers in the long run and the BJP will emerge victorious in 2020,” said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/political-dynamics-in-ludhiana-set-to-change-as-sad-bjp-go-separate-ways/story-EYOaX0i8quoACdhFPxF5yL.html
28-09-2020||Chandigarh||8-acre landfill for non-recyclable solid waste coming up at Chandigarh’s Dadumajra||The Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) will be setting up a new sanitary landfill (SLF) at Dadumajra for dumping of non-recyclable solid waste generated in the city.Spread over 8 acres, the site will be developed at a cost of around Rs 12 crore over a period of one year. It is located adjacent to the current dumping site in Dadumajra and the waste processing plant. The municipal corporation, through CSCL, is already undertaking the “Mining of Legacy Waste and Recovery of Land” project at the Dadumajra dumping ground. Nearly 5 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of waste, lying at the ground for over 20 years, is being bio-mined and processed through scientific procedures. MC intends to reclaim the entire land, about 25 acres, for scientific waste disposal and treatment.Confirming the development, NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL, said, “The landfill is a crucial component for achieving total waste segregation in the city, in its entire cycle, from collection to processing and disposal. The site will be used specifically for dumping non-recyclable dry waste, which will neither be re-used nor processed at the waste processing plant.”Stating that site will be developed on scientific lines so that there was no damage to the environment and inconvenience to the people living nearby, Sharma said, “The site will be surrounded by a 4.5m tall and 10m deep boundary wall. The waste dumped there will be covered at all times. The site design incorporates systems that will leave no scope of seepage of water into the dumped waste or the ground beneath. There will be no foul smell generated at the site.”CAPACITY AUGMENTATIONThe city’s urban and the rural areas generate about 450 MT municipal solid waste (MSW) per day, which is estimated to increase to 788 MT by 2036.The treatment plant for resource recovery is able to divert only about 20% as refuse-derived fuel (RDF), while the rest is dumped in the open. RDF is a fuel produced from various types of waste such as MSW.MC is currently operating Phase 1 of the SLF, which was constructed in 2007 and commissioned in 2012. SLF’s Phase 1 area is about 10 acres and it is planned to be taken to an average height of about 10m. Given the large quantity of waste arrival, Phase 1 has almost run out of capacity.“Considering the proximity of habitations, the adverse impact on public health and environment, and the urgency of compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, it is imperative to expand the capacity of the SLF for safe waste disposal for a foreseeable period in the future,” said a senior MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/8-acre-landfill-for-non-recyclable-solid-waste-coming-up-at-chandigarh-s-dadumajra/story-okjGbkjpn4wl1JuTg7pb0N.html

28-09-2020||City||After 4 years, Jagraon Bridge repair finally complete||Four years after the Jagraon Bridge was closed for vehicular traffic as its girders were badly damaged, Ludhiana mayor Balkar Sandhu on Sunday announced that the repair work has finally been completed. Announcing this, he threw open the bridge to the public but Congress councilors Sunny Bhalla and Rakesh Prashar said that the bridge was opened only for 45 minutes on a trial basis and closed again. When contacted, Gurdeep Singh, railways engineer, who is supervising the construction work on the part falling under the railway’s jurisdiction, said that some final inspections for checking wear and tear was left and it is expected to be completed by Monday evening. “We will open the bridge for vehicular traffic on Tuesday morning,” he said.NO INAUGURATION CEREMONYAs per sources, the Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were set to jointly inaugurate the bridge, but Saturday night’s political developments, wherein the Akalis walked out of the alliance, shelved the plans for a grand inauguration. A SAGA OF DELAYSThe 132-year-old bridge, which is major lifeline of the city, was closed for heavy vehicles in May 2016 after its girders were found badly corroded. Two months later, in July, it was closed for all vehicles except two-wheelers.This affected the traffic movement on the Railway Station Road, Jagraon bridge, Lakkar bridge and nearby areas, even as the repair project kept hitting several hurdles and inviting the wrath of residents. For over two years, the project stayed in limbo as the railways refused to pool in money for it. It was only after the municipal corporation (MC) handed over ₹24.3 crore to the railways that the construction finally began in 2018, with a deadline of June 30, 2019. This was extended to December 2019, when the MC took over the project and announced it will be completed by March 2020. However, roadblocks caused by the Covid-19 lockdown pushed the completion date further.Last week, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had announced that the project will be complete before Gandhi Jayanti on October 2. Traffic expert Rahul Verma said that all’s well that ends well. Rahul, along with other activists, had been observing ‘Barsi (death anniversary) every year, in a symbolic protest against the project’s delay. “Finally, people would be able to commute through the bridge from Tuesday morning. I have urged the mayor that the potholes on the existing side of the bridge, upon which the traffic was diverted to, should be filled once the new stretch is operational,” said Rahul||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-4-years-jagraon-bridge-repair-finally-complete/story-qpXFGOH0qVYwW14x2oLwBI.html
28-09-2020||Chandigarh||PU’s libraries asked to cut short subscription of online journals||With Panjab University grappling with financial crunch this year, its libraries may cut short the online journal subscriptions on the basis of their usage to curtail the spending. This was recommended by the varsity’s panel constituted for austerity measures to minimise the expenses in view of the revenue loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The scrutiny of the list of online journal subscriptions is among the various other measures recommended by the panel. The recommendations have been approved by PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar. The committee has said that the list of online journal subscription by libraries may be scrutinised and pruned on the basis of their usage and the possibility of subscription of online journals through a consortium of Chandigarh-based institutions via Chandigarh Region Innovation and Knowledge Cluster (CRIKC) be explored.Jivesh Bansal, librarian of PU’s AC Joshi library, said, “We will explore all possibilities for subscription of online journals via CRIKC also.”PU is not expecting revenue from various resources this year which include hostels. The varsity has also given concession of 5% in semester fee as well to all students.A staffer at the library said that the scrutiny of subscription of online journals was also done by a committee a few years ago. “The committee has suggested that there are journals whose usage is less and they should be removed from the list,” he said.According to the estimated budget for 2020-21 of PU approved last year, the expenditure on books, journals, and publications was pegged at Rs 10 crore. The panel for austerity measures in its meeting last month had also recommended that the work of manpower audit initiated by the establishment section may be expedited to ensure rationalisation of manpower at the university.What is CRIKCCRIKC was founded by Panjab University in 2013, where 29 academic institutions from the region collaborate. The consortium includes Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER); Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chandigarh; Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar; Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Sector 32, Chandigarh and other institutions. It aims to foster and sustain close academic alliances between institutions of higher education and research in the Chandigarh region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-s-libraries-asked-to-cut-short-subscription-of-online-journals/story-4ADEVXyamNUXCY3h2zLKnI.html
28-09-2020||City||Noida: Drive conducted in Sector 51 for tenant verification||Noida: The residential body of Sector 51, along with the local police, on Sunday conducted a tenant verification drive in the area to identify illegal squatters. The move is aimed at curbing crime in the area, said members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA). The drive was conducted a day after an incident of vehicle theft in the area. “A car was stolen around 4pm on Saturday. The theft is a major security concern for us. It seemed that someone living in the sector might be involved in it. So we decided to conduct a verification for tenants and illegal squatters in the area,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary, Sector 51 RWA. The police said that a case has been registered at the Sector 49 police station regarding the car theft.A team from the residents’ body and local police visited many houses in E and D blocks of the sector on Sunday afternoon.“We have identified 12-13 families that were unable to provide any verification. In one house, it seemed that three families were squatting illegally. We have asked them to bring back an acknowledgment from the landlord and submit it within three days to the police. We don’t want to create problems, but only want to ensure safety of all people living in the sector. Landlords who refrain from getting tenants verified should also take responsibility and abide by the laws,” said Kumar.The RWA will continue the drive over the coming weeks to ensure that there are no illegal tenants in the locality before going for legal action against offenders.Saunvir Singh, in-charge of Sector 51 police post, said, “We accompanied the RWA officials to provide support to them and ensure that nothing happened outside the gambit of law.

The police said that all the suspects are currently on the run.The victim, Ismael Khan (40), who is a carpenter, had sustained a bullet wound on his left hand, and is now stable, the police said.According to Ismael’s younger brother, Akbar Khan (30), the victim was going to his farm in Salempur Gurjar village early Saturday morning when a group of people ambushed and shot at him. “Ismael has a property dispute with our older brother, Akhtar Khan. Akhtar along with his three sons – Babli, Sameer, Bhola, and two other accomplices – Raju and Manish – followed Ismael to the farm. They surrounded him and started abusing him.

28-09-2020||City||Greater Noida: Fire breaks out at electronic goods manufacturing factory, none injured||A massive fire broke out at an electronic goods manufacturing factory in Sector Ecotech in Greater Noida on Sunday. No injuries were reported in the incident.The police said that prime facie, it appears that the fire, which started around 2pm, was caused by a short circuit. The fire at the two-storey factory was doused after nearly four hours, said the fire department.Electronic equipment including mobile chargers, head phones, power banks, among others are manufactured at the factory. Construction work was also going on at the premises of the building where the factory runs from, the police said.“ While construction work was going on in one portion of the building, the factory was functioning from the second portion. Around 2pm, we received a call about a fire in the factory. A police team reached the spot and also informed the fire fighters,” said Vivek Trivedi, station house officer, Kasna police station.Trivedi said that nearly 10 workers were successfully evacuated from the premise as soon as the flames started erupting. “It appears the fire originated from a short circuit in the electronic equipment unit located on the ground floor of the building. Soon, the fire spread to the first and second floor of the factory,” the SHO said.As many as 20 fire fighters were engaged in dousing the flames. The police said that initially the fire tenders struggled to reach the spot as number of people had also gathered congesting the narrow lanes leading to the factory. The police personnel barricaded the area so that the fire tenders could reach the factory.Police said there is no immediate report of any person getting harmed in the fire and the loss of property is yet to be assessed. Trivedi said the factory management has not filed a complaint in this regard.Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire safety officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The fire had spread to the entire building and we controlled it by 6 pm. There was no injury to any person during the incident.

28-09-2020||Noida||NTPC to partially use crop residue to fire power plants||In order to keep tabs on its carbon footprint as well as help reduce burning of crop residue by farmers on their fields, power producer NTPC Limited has decided to use biomass pellets for co-firing its various thermal plants. Co-firing is a process where coal and biomass pellets – made up of crop residue – are co-combusted in boilers to produce power. NTPC has envisaged consumption of five million tonnes of biomass pellets in the current year at its 17 power plants across the country, including the one at Dadri. Besides helping reduce carbon emissions, co-firing also aims to help create large scale rural employment opportunities, through processing and supply chain, for the biomass, an NTPC spokesperson said.For this, the power producer has issued a tender to hire an agency to supply biomass pellets after collecting crop residue from farmers in different states. The NTPC, in a press statement, said that as per their estimates, about 145 million metric tonnes per annum of crop residue remains unutilised in the country and most of it is burnt in open fields, giving severe air pollution.An official of the power corporation said that the NTPC had first undertaken this initiative on a pilot basis at its Dadri plant in 2017, wherein 100 tonnes of agro residue-based pellets had been fired. The test-firing was carried out in four phases, with a gradual increase in percentage of firing. Till date, the company has fired more than 7,000 tonnes of agro residue pellets.“Post successful implementation at Dadri, the NTPC now plans to replicate the model at 17 of its plants. The application process for bids for the tender will start on September 28 and the last date is October 5,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ntpc-to-partially-use-crop-residue-to-fire-power-plants/story-EKZA2hG5Jcp1GhqKyR7zEO.html
28-09-2020||City||Noida: Yeida directed to demarcate area for Film City project||Senior Uttar Pradesh government officials on Sunday inspected the land in Sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway earmarked for the Film City project.Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home and information) Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who visited the site along with others, directed Yamuna expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) to send a proposal to Film Bandhu, a state nodal agency for film projects, to get the ball rolling on the detailed project report.The directions come a week after the Uttar Pradesh government on September 20 announced setting the Film City on a 1000-acre plot in Sector 21.Awasthi, who was accompanied by Yeida’ chief executive officer, CEO, Arun Vir Singh and other senior officials of the authority, also instructed the staff to demarcate the boundary of the site where the Film City will come up.“We will send the proposal about the project in the next 10 days to the state government, paving way for the detailed project report. The state government has put this project on fast-track and we are working on this project very seriously,” Singh said.Once Yeida sends the proposal, the UP government will appoint a consultant to prepare a DPR for the project. The DPR will be made at earliest and no deadline has been fixed for it so far, said officials.“We have started the process to hire a consultant who will make the DPR. Once the DPR is finalised, the project will witness further progress,” Awasthi said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on September 18 announced setting up the country’s “biggest” and “most beautiful” film city in Gautam Budh Nagar and had instructed officials to search for land in or around Noida and Greater Noida.“We have already acquired 835 acres agricultural land from farmers for the project. We have expedited the work to procure 165 acres of land for this project. All farmers from Rabupura village in Sector 21, where the Film City will come, are happy to give their land for the project,” Yeida CEO said.Once ready, the Film City, located close to upcoming Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar, will house film studios, film academies among other facilities.“The Film City will benefit not only aspiring filmmakers, actors, cameraman and technicians among others, but also the film industry at large at large as they will get a much needed facility for shooting at reasonable cost. The project will give a platform to local talent, groom them employ them,” said Piyush Singh, CEO, Vistas Media, a Singapore- based company keen to set up an international film Academy at the Film City. The firm had earlier this week submitted a proposal to Yeida to set up a film academy over 20 acres, with an initial investment of USD 10 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-yeida-directed-to-demarcate-area-for-film-city-project/story-Eceh7KqlJPGVR2VyrBzx0N.html
28-09-2020||City||Noida: Woman ‘raped’ by neighbour||Noida: A 24-year-old man allegedly raped his 21-year-old neighbour at her house, located under the jurisdiction of the Sector 20 police station. The alleged incident came to the fore on September 27, when the woman’s husband filed a complaint with the Noida police in the matter.“The man would send her obscene messages and we had warned him earlier (against this). Yesterday (Saturday), I saw him leaving my house and when I went inside, I found my wife in a poor condition. She was in a semi-conscious state and her clothes were torn,” the woman’s husband alleged in his police complaint.Police officers said that the family was initially scared to approach them due to social pressure, which is why the matter was reported to them a day later. “An investigation is underway in the matter. The suspect is absconding at the moment. A woman constable was sent to speak with the victim, who has also been sent for a medical examination,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer of the Sector 20 police station.Police officers, however, added that a case had not been registered yet. “We will know more after the investigation and file a case after that,” said a police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-woman-raped-by-neighbour/story-wq04anMhEY1o3gBsxt1NbI.html
28-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Number of patients, surgeries remains low during Unlock phase||The number of surgeries in Gautam Budh Nagar hospitals have plummeted by around 40% in July to September period (till date) this year when compared to 2019, the district chief medical officer (CMO) said. During the same period, he added, number of out-patient department (OPD) patients dropped 70%.This period comes after the 68-day Covid-19-induced lockdown period. From June 8, the central government’s Unlock protocols had begun and economic activities were slowly opened and movement of people resumed. The latest of these Unlock protocols, the fourth, was announced on August 29.The numbers could suggest that people are yet to confidently approach hospitals and that hospitals were continuing to defer non-essential surgeries. Another reason could be that migrant workers were yet to return to the city.There are 17 government hospital and over 100 private hospitals. Of these, six government hospitals and nine private hospitals are dedicated to treating Covid patients.In the sector 30 district hospital, OPD turnout was 56,125 and surgeries were 697 during 2020 period. Last year, there were 225,736 OPD patients and 1,359 surgeries. Hospital superintendent Dr. V B Dhaka said that Covid-19 had derailed the whole health care system. “We have only two anaesthetists. While one of them contracted Covid-19, the other one is deputed to a Covid-19 facility in sector 39. As a result, we have so far cancelled about 300 surgeries in the last three months,” he said. Dr. Dhaka said that an ad hoc anaesthetist handles critical surgery cases. “I hope things will get normal once the pandemic situation is over and our hospital will have its full strength of staff,” he said. Dr. Balraj Bhandar, deputy medical superintendent of Employee’s State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital in sector 24, says they are serving emergency surgery cases. “There is a big fall in patients turnout. As compared to last year, the number of OPD patients from July has halved,” he said. The usually teeming OPD of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) nowadays wears a deserted look. After being designated an L-3 Covid-19 facility to treat severe cases, the hospital shut its OPD ward. The hospital is the only critical government healthcare centre for this area and many adjoining villages. Dr. Rakesh Gupta, GIMS director, said that despite knowing this, the hospital is not in a position to start its OPD again. “At present, we serving only Covid-19 cases. Before the pandemic, the average daily turnout in OPD here was around 2,000 patients, while our doctors use to do surgeries of at least 100 patients daily. But now these facilities are not available here,” he said. Private hospitals, too, have been impact. Sharda hospital recorded around 45,000 OPD patients since July, a third of its figures during same period last year. “The number of surgeries recorded from July is around 2,500, which is less than half compared to last year’s figures,” said Dr. Ashutosh Niranjan, the medical superintendent of Sharda hospital. The spokesperson of Fortis hospital in sector 62, also said that there is a sharp decline in OPD patients and surgeries since July. “The number of surgeries done between July 1 to September 26 last year was 5,632, which has been reduced to 3,450 in same period this year,” she said.“The reason for low turnout in OPDs is that people are apprehended to go hospitals. They fear that that in contact with other people they might get Covid infection. Even in normal surgery cases, people are trying to avoid it,” said CMO Dr. Deepak Ohri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-number-of-patients-surgeries-remains-low-during-unlock-phase/story-E6hLL8Rm0ERIfPhLUnUdYI.html
28-09-2020||Chandigarh||Missing fuel at Citco’s Sector-17 pump: Retired judicial officer to conduct inquiry||A retired judicial officer has been entrusted with the inquiry into the case of missing petrol and diesel at Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (Citco) petrol pump at Sector 17.The case pertains to the misappropriation of around 20,000 litres of petrol and diesel detected at the Sector-17 fuel station in May this year after Citco management ordered physical verification of its petrol pumps. The management has pegged the loss incurred by Citco at more than Rs 12 lakh.Confirming the development, Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu, managing director, Citco, said, “We have marked an inquiry into the matter. Additional sessions judge BR Bansal (retired) will head the probe. We will take strict action in case of any wrongdoing on the part of the Citco employees is confirmed after the inquiry report is submitted.”In March this year, Citco management had ordered inspections of its petrol pumps in Sector 9 and Sector 17. But, due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the same could not take place. These were finally conducted in May after the lockdown restrictions were eased.The petrol and diesel stocks in the Sector-9 petrol pump were found as per the record and norms. But, in the investigation of the Sector-17 pump, serious irregularities in the stocks of three categories of fuels were reported.The investigation revealed that the pump’s stock register, dip register and daily sales register were not updated correctly. As per the set standards of the HPCL, around 7,500 litre diesel and about 13,000 litre petrol was found to be less than stipulated by the record and company norms. Shortages were also found in power petrol. CNG storage was found to be in tune with the stipulated norms after its meter readings were noted.Consequently, Citco sought clarifications regarding the shortage from the HPCL and its employees posted at the petrol.After investigations, it found that shortage of some of the fuel was because of its seepage into the ground. “The deficiency of around 10,000 litre was due to the leakages caused by faulty constructions of the underground storage facility. The reason for the shortage of the remaining fuel is being ascertained,” said a senior Citco official.The corporation has issued show-cause notices to four of its employees who were supervisors at the petrol pump during the period when the shortages have said to taken place.Meanwhile, Citco has also claimed compensation from the company for the faulty construction of the underground storage tanks. “Company has in turn initiated action against the contractor who built the tanks, and asked for financial damages from it,” the official added.Fuel FiddleSHORTAGEAfter physical verification and record checking, 7,500 litre diesel and 13,000 litre petrol was found missingREASONWhile some of the fuel loss was due to seepage/leakages, major loss was suspected because of impropriety ACTION SO FARShow-cause notices have issued to four supervisors at the petrol pump; retired judicial officer entrusted with an inquiry||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-fuel-at-citco-s-sector-17-pump-retired-judicial-officer-to-conduct-inquiry/story-mBsQGpLthHPGfkmJ6qS2bI.html
28-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Free OPD at child PGI for Covid-recovered patients from today||Gautam Budh Nagar’s Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), better known as Child PGI, will start a free out-patient department (OPD) for its Covid-recovered patients from Monday.The aim of the OPD is to give post-treatment care to these patients. Of late, there have been many studies that suggested that the coronavirus disease could affect other organs as well. On Sunday, Union health minister HArsh Vardhan acknowledged these studies, but added that these were small sample sizes and advised against generalisation. An L-3 hospital that treats severe cases of Covid-19, Child PGI has treated and discharged 470 cases till date. These patients will get free consultation and medication at its OPD.Child PGI director Dr DK Gupta said, “We decided to start the OPD to take follow-up feedback from patients and check for any consequent complications. The OPDs will be in two rooms on the ground floor of the hospital from Monday.” “We are in regular touch with the patients during their post-recovery period to diagnose and treat their mental and physical illness. A team of seven doctors have been deputed to this OPD, who will take full stock of patients’ physical and psychological health after their recovery from the infection of Covid-19 virus,” he said. He also said the OPD will not only help in post-recovery treatment of Covid-19 patients, but will also help in analysis of their symptoms with co-morbidity. “The cured patients will also be classified in two categories-- symptomatic and asymptomatic -- and then they will be provided different doses of medicines and vaccines according to their health conditions. We will also analyse the longevity of antibodies in different patients, which can play a vital role in later stage of researches,” he said. Dr Gupta further said that out of 470 cured patients, more than 130 were below 18 years of age. “At present, we are taking the whereabouts of 25 patients every day. During the telephonic calls, we have found that patients above 45 years are having some complications. We are sure that their problems will be solved at this new OPD. Our doctors have also cured number of new-born babies, who got infected from the virus just after their birth,” he said. Meanwhile, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY has also appreciated the decision of doctors of child PGI, to open Covid-19 follow-up OPD. “Such efforts will not only help the recovered patients to come out of fear, but will also help in analysis of their post-recovery status,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-free-opd-at-child-pgi-for-covid-recovered-patients-from-today/story-eFQ3jlL1ekDdRb7LHtUHrJ.html
28-09-2020||City||In September, Ghaziabad saw almost 200 new Covid-19 cases per day||Ghaziabad: In September, the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases reported daily in the Ghaziabad district are found to be at an average of about 195 so far, official records show. According to officials, they estimate that the trend is likely to continue in October as well, as testing will be ramped up to 6,000 tests per day from the current 3,500-4,000 tests per day.According to records of the district health department, at least 5,073 Covid-19 cases were reported till September 26.Meanwhile, July saw 3,440 cases (average of 110 a day) while August saw 3,392 cases (average of 109 a day). “In July and August, we conducted about 600 tests per million of population per day, while in September, the number of tests has been over 800 per million per day. So, the rise in cases could also be a result of increase in testing. As of now, we are conducting 3,500-4,000 tests per day in Ghaziabad,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of the district.“The nodal officer has directed for strict enforcement of norms in containment zones and testing to be increased to 6,000 per day. Besides, we are strictly monitoring coronavirus patients who are in home isolation. If a patient is found flouting norms, they will be immediately shifted to Covid facility. With the increase in testing, the trend of a steep rise in cases is likely to continue in October as well,” Dr Gupta, added.According to official records, the district conducted an average of 617 tests per day per million in July and 677 tests per day per million in August. Data reveals that this rate was ramped up to about 850 tests per million per day in September so far.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 140 Covid-19 tests per million residents a day.“Increase in testing is also one of the reasons why the number of cases increased in September. However, with more and more social activities opening up, there is a lot of mixing of the population in areas like markets, offices and other places. Besides, the public has been showing signs of complacency as people are often seen not wearing masks and even not adhering to social distancing norms. So, all these factors have contributed to the rise in the number of coronavirus cases,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.However, the rise in cases is mostly in urban segments and less in rural areas as there is less overcrowding in the latter, Dr Jindal added. “It is estimated that the number of cases has been seeing an upward trend since March and hopefully, we have reached a plateau. However, it may take more time to see a declining trend. Till then, adherence to all health protocols is essential,” he said.The district had a positivity rate of 4.59% till September 26, with 2,94,819 sampling/tests conducted so far. Official records show that positivity has been below 5% since the past three months. According to recommendations by WHO, the positivity rate of a region which has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. The district had a recovery rate of 85.87% till September 26, while the fatality rate with the overall 76 deaths so far was about 0.56%. Experts, however, caution against confusing seasonal flu with Covid symptoms.“Apart from opening up of activities, the public, seeing that the rate of recovery is high, are becoming more casual and less fearful of the pandemic, which is causing the number of cases to rise. The other reason is that seasonal flu is also prevalent in August and September, and people are misjudging their symptoms, taking a longer time to decide to get themselves tested, which is aiding in the easy spread of the infection,” said Dr Gyan Bharti, senior pulmonologist from Columbia Asia Hospital at Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-september-ghaziabad-saw-almost-200-new-covid-19-cases-per-day/story-EEYSAD5KLTof9EjSAU020O.html
28-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: CM directs officials to focus on surveillance, initiate ‘virtual ICUs for Covid-19 patients||Ghaziabad: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, during a video conference with Ghaziabad officials on Sunday, underlined the need for intensifying surveillance, and contact tracing in order to keep the positivity rate for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) below 5% and death rate below 1% in the state. The CM also stressed on the concept of creating ‘virtual ICUs’ in order to provide better treatment and consultation to Covid-19 patients.The conference was held Sunday evening wherein the CM said that care should be taken to ensure that patients get help in the initial stages of the disease itself. “The CM directed that efforts should be made to ensure that patients do not reach the severe symptom stage, which needs hospitalisation at L3 hospitals, and are treated at L1 or L2 level hospitals instead. He said that if the patient reaches L3 category treatment, then there is a problem with the surveillance system, which needs to be strengthened. He has directed that the positivity rate should be below 5% and the death rate should be below 1%. The district is already below the desired levels,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals are part of the state government’s three-tier Covid healthcare facility. The L1 hospitals are for treating asymptomatic patients while L2 hospitals deal with patients having moderate complications. The L3 hospitals deal with patients who have severe symptoms.The meeting was held with officials from 16 districts of the state, which have been seeing an average of 100 or more coronavirus cases a day. These include Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar.“The CM has also directed to initiate the concept of virtual ICUs and remotely connecting specialists from the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences and King George’s Medical University at Lucknow to patients. At present, we have 164 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in the district. We will soon start the virtual ICU facility, through which online consultation with specialists is available to Covid-19 patients lodged in ICUs in Ghaziabad,” Dr Gupta added.The CM has also directed district officials to come up with ‘micro containment zones’ which will be more compact, with a reduced parameter, in order to cover a smaller number of houses. Officials said that more modalities about the micro containment zones are expected to be received in a day or two. “Besides, the chief minister has directed that one-third of total testing should be done through the use of RT-PCR method, while the rest should be with the help of rapid antigen kits. In this context, the government-appointed nodal officer took a review meeting on Sunday evening and directed us to increase the testing to 6,000 per day, and also to increase testing at the new RT-PCR lab at MMG Hospital to 750 samples per day,” Dr Gupta added. He said that in order to scale up testing, he has provided five lab technicians for the new lab. The district is presently testing 3,500-4,000 samples per day. “We have directed the concerned authorities to take up strict enforcement of containment zones in the district. District officials will monitor containment zones regularly,” said IAS, Senthil Pandian C, the nodal officer for Ghaziabad for reviewing Covid-19 preparedness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-cm-directs-officials-to-focus-on-surveillance-initiate-virtual-icus-for-covid-19-patients/story-QkhxDF5vBR5gXfN66ZJBFI.html
28-09-2020||Mumbai||No more online order or discounts on liquor, says Maharashtra excise department||Consumers will no longer be able to order liquor via online platforms or get discounts as the Maharashtra excise department is all set to crackdown on such mediums.The excise department in its circular issued this week said that home delivery of liquor allowed during the Covid-19 pandemic was temporary in nature, and added that any listing, advertisement or offer was against excise rules and could invite prosecution as per law. This is in contravention of the May 22 circular issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wherein the civic body allowed the use of online platforms for selling liquor to avoid crowding at wine shops.The excise department’s decision has irked many consumers who have questioned as to why liquor was being excluded from online platforms when all other goods are available.Kevin Rodrigues, 39, who works in a leading BPO, said, “When liquor is legal, what harm is there to allow it to be sold online? In fact, tipplers will get a good choice of brands from the comfort of their homes,” said Rodrigues.Savio D’sa, bar and restaurant consultant, is of a similar view and said it is about time liquor business is eased. “Online deliveries will prevent overcrowding at the counters, especially when Covid-19 cases are increasing by the day, and will encourage people to order more. Currently, the state coffers are bleeding and such a move (allowing online delivery of liquor) will only add more revenue to the exchequer,” said D’sa. According to a senior official of excise department, home delivery of liquor was not allowed but an exception has been made due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Wine shops can only give their names and addresses. They cannot even list liquor brands. We have observed that some stores are displaying bottles and in some there are models promoting the brand. Some are also promoting incentive schemes on bulk purchases. This is not allowed,” said the official requesting anonymity. Excise commissioner Kantilal Umap has defended its decision saying he is following the rules. “We will crackdown on all who are advertising, whether it’s online or offline, as it’s not allowed,” said Umap. Excise Department has warned that anyone indulging in such advertisements will face penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment and/or a fine of ₹5,000 under sections 23 and 24 of the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949. Wine shop merchants agree that advertisements may have taken place. “It’s true that some merchants may have advertised, but it was due to lack of clarity of rules. However, now things are clearer,” said Arvind Miskin, president of Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors.Liquor has been one of the major sources of revenue for the state government. The state was able to garner ₹15,434 crore as excise duty from sale of liquor during the previous financial year (April 2019-March 2020). This was one of the reasons that the cash-strapped government allowed opening of liquor shops from May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-more-online-order-or-discounts-on-liquor-says-maharashtra-excise-department/story-yPMrGxrSfhFVaWBqUuATiI.html
28-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 case tally 1,339,232; toll 35,571||Maharashtra recorded 18,056 fresh Covid-19 infections on Sunday, taking its case count to 1,339,232. If Maharashtra were a country, it would be at fourth position globally in terms of cases, according to reference website worldometers.info.Active cases went up to 273,228, which is 20.40% of the total. The Covid-19 death toll climbed up to 35,571 after 380 casualties were reported. Of them, 200 were in the past 48 hours, another 96 were from the past week, while the rest 84 were from the period before that, health officials said. Maharashtra has recorded 547,978 cases in September till date, highest total of any of the months since the first case was reported in March. In August, 371,238 cases were detected, while in July, June, May, April and March, total cases were 247,392; 102,172; 57,157; 10,196 and 302. The surge in cases has led to a rise in average number of cases a day. In the past 27 days, average number of cases a day has jumped up to 20,295, compared to 11,975 cases a day in August and in July, it was only 7,980 cases per day.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said daily cases were not going up in the past one week and have remained constant by far. “The daily infections were rising in the first and second week of September, but from the third week, the growth rate has showed some sort of stability. The reason is less number of cases from the areas where infection rate was very high. For instance, in Pune, the rate of infection is not going up,” he said. “We are not sure if it is a temporary phenomenon or not. We need to wait at least for three weeks to draw any conclusions,” he added.State authorities have also been struggling to deal with the high number of casualties per day as the daily figure is not coming down. This has led to 10,626 casualties reported in this month till Sunday, which is again the highest number of deaths in any of the months.In August, the state had reported a total of 9,589 deaths, whereas in July, June, May, April and March, the casualties reported were 6,988; 5,638; 2,286; 449 and 10 deaths respectively. This, too, has led to a rise in the average number of deaths per day to 393. If compared with August, average casualties were 309 deaths per day, while in July, June, May and April, they were 282, 187, 59 and 14 deaths per day, showed the statistics of the state health department.However, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state is reducing gradually, but it is mainly because cases are going up rapidly. The case fatality rate (CFR) was recorded at 2.66% on Sunday and it comes at second position after Punjab. The CFR of Punjab was 2.93% (with 3,188 deaths) on Saturday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.“To bring down the casualties, we have launched the ‘My family, My responsibility’ campaign and are hoping for positive results. In most cases, people are found asymptomatic despite being infected with the virus. In case of senior citizens or people having comorbidities, it is a direct risk to life. The initiative is helping us in early detection of the virus, consequently, we will be able to save lives and reduce per day deaths,” said a senior health official, wishing not to be named.Mumbai recorded 2,261 cases, highest in the state, pushing its tally to 198,846. Of them, active cases were 26,716.The city toll reached 8,794 with 44 deaths on Sunday.Pune city has contributed second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,557 cases, taking its tally to 152,540, while Pune district became the third-highest contributor with 948 cases, pushing its count to 59,406.

The complainant, Jayantibhai V, a fashion designer who owns a store in Vile Parle, and resides at Dahisar, in his complaint said, “In March 2020, he received a call from a woman who identified herself as Sonali. She asked him to join the dating club and meet ‘beautiful women’. She also offered lakhs of rupees if he registered with their dating and friendship club service.” The complaint said that he ignored the call, but on June 3 he received a call again from another woman who lured him with a similar offer. The woman told him many men and women were members of her club and they provided service to many who were separated or divorced. She also enticed him with an offer to earn ₹30,000 to ₹40,000.“I was asked to deposit ₹25,000 for lifetime club membership. From June 3 to August 22 the accused demanded ₹15.05 lakh citing various reasons, but never provided any contact number of women,” said Jayantibhai in his complaint. The complainant later realised that he was being cheated and decided to file a complaint. An officer from Vile Parle police station said, “We have registered an offence and are investigating the case.” Police booked unknown fraudsters under section 419 (punishment for cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code and section 66(C) (punishment for identity theft), 66(D) (punishment for cheating by impersonation by using computer resource] of Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fashion-designer-duped-of-15-05-lakh-in-dating-club-membership-scam-in-mumbai/story-owxYO2ryK21rAjHnEO21LI.html

28-09-2020||Mumbai||‘Investment firm’ dupes 241 of ₹76 crore; Mumbai Police’s EOW arrests 2 owners||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police arrested two of the six co-owners of an investment firm for allegedly duping 241 people to the tune of ₹76 crore by accepting money from them by offering 12% annual interest. The accused used the money to invest in other firms for higher returns, but as they failed to pay the interest as well as return the principal amount, the investors lodged complaints against them. Hasmukh Gogari and Pankaj Chheda, co-partners of Ramnik Hashmukh Associate have been arrested, confirmed Parag Manere, deputy commissioner of police, EOW. Both the accused have been charged under sections 409 (breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act. Other accused partner in the firm and their relatives who were named in the case are Ramnik Dedhia, Dilesh Vira, Mukesh Chheda, Kushal Chheda and their relatives Hemant Chheda and Jayesh Dedhia. They are yet to be arrested. “Arrested accused Gogari and Chheda are one of the main accused in the fraud in which 241 investors have been duped of ₹76 crore. They were produced before the court and have been remanded in police custody till October 1,” said Rajendra Sangale, senior inspector, MPID unit. According to EOW, the arrests have been made based on the complaint of Rajesh Shah, a Goregaon resident, who alleged that Ramnik Hashmukh Associate lured him into investing money by offering 1 to 1.05% interest per month in 2016. “The firm had given a promissory note to investors as an acknowledgement. The said note was allegedly also signed by concerned executives of the firm where the investor’s money would be further invested for high returns,” said a police officer. Shah, who works at a senior post in a private bank, was also promised by the accused firm that they would return the money within a month if the investor wished to withdraw the amount. Shah invested ₹48 lakh and initially received the interest regularly. However, since January 1, 2018, he had not received interest nor the principal amount, following which he filed a complaint, a copy of which is with HT. Later, Shah learnt that many others had also not got their money from the firm, and all of them all visited the firm’s office in Matunga. The firm told them that they were facing a major crisis due to demonetisation. However, investors later found out that the firm invested their money in eight other companies under their relative’s names. Shah and 77 other investors then approached EOW. The case was first registered at Matunga police station, later EOW took over the investigation. During investigation more victim investors turned up before the police and now there are 241 victim investors. The number of investors and fraud amount are likely to go up in coming days as the two accused have been arrested, said Sangale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/investment-firm-dupes-241-of-76-crore-mumbai-police-s-eow-arrests-2-owners/story-EiPI3Stuu6apgMWuAUnEYJ.html

One officer from Virar police station, who was deployed at Khanivade post, has been transferred to the office of Palghar superintendent of police (SP) as he failed to check illegal sand mining operations there. An inquiry has also been initiated against police officers, and if found guilty others may also face suspension, said Dattatray Shinde, SP, Palghar. “The two local police stations of Virar and Vasai were not informed about the raid. We first conducted the raids and then informed the two police as per strategy,” said Shinde. He added that the police seized 152 suction pumps, 1,650 brass sand, an excavator and 230 boats worth ₹7.90 crore from the two spots. The state revenue department evaluated the seized materials. Though no arrest has been made, a case has been registered against unknown accused under section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code, said Shinde.Illegal sand activity is rampant in Khanivade and Vaitarna creek. Palghar district collector has banned all kinds of sand mining activity in the vicinity of Vaitarna rail bridge as the foundation of two bridges in the area got damaged due to sand dredging.Earlier on November 16, 2019, the then Palghar SP Gaurav Singh conduced a surprise raid on sand mafia and arrested three people and seized 15 excavators, dumper and 330 brass sand worth ₹2.90 crore.

28-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: BPTP Park Serene residents demand access to revenue road, better maintenance||Residents of BPTP Park Serene condominium in sector 37 on Friday complained to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) of certain deficiencies in their society. They claim that the elevators were failing regularly, plaster was falling from the balconies, and the developer had blocked a revenue road. Hemant Kumar, a resident said that the revenue road had been blocked without any reason as a result of which over 800 families have to depend on a narrow access road. “The revenue road should be opened as it will ease the movement of residents. Also the sewerage treatment plant is not functional for the last one month and, despite complaints, no action had been taken by the developer,” said Kumar. Another resident said that due to seepage of water, the elevators had become faulty and the vendor has refused to repair them. “The lifts are not in good shape and people often get stuck inside. There is urgent need to take remedial measures,” he said. The residents also complained that plaster from balconies is falling down at several places this putting lives of people in danger. “We have also met the deputy commissioner and asked for criminal complaint in the matter,” said Kumar. A report submitted by residents said that common amenities shared by BPTP projects in sector 37D -- Park Serene, Park Generations, Park Spacio and Terra -- were not sufficient for Serene residents. The residents in their submission also alleged that partial occupancy certificates (OCs) were being issued despite inadequate infrastructure. When asked about the matter, RS Bhath, district town planner, said that they will visit site in a week and also will issue notice to the developer to reply on the matter in 15 days. “If there is any encroachment on revenue road it shall be removed at the earliest,” said Bhath. A spokesperson for the developer said that they had assured the residents that the issues would be resolved. “We will resolve the issues and abide by the direction of authorities. Another issue is that a lot money is pending as maintenance fees with residents and they need to pay it for ensuring quality services,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-bptp-park-serene-residents-demand-access-to-revenue-road-better-maintenance/story-E2Xd6C1RAkRNKMnQi5m1FM.html

28-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Air quality fluctuates with seasonal changes; pollution expected to surge in next two weeks||After recording ‘moderate’ air quality for two weeks in succession — from September 9 to September 22 — air pollution readings in the city have shown a wide variation in the past five days, with experts warning that the city’s air quality is likely to deteriorate in the next few weeks due to the incoming pollutants from stubble burning in the neighbouring states. From 184 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Saturday (the highest concentration of pollutants recorded all month), the city on Sunday recorded 82 on the AQI, indicating ‘satisfactory’ air (among the lowest recorded in September).Experts and officials attributed these wide variations to the changing meteorological conditions. “When air quality varies so widely from day to day, it means we are in a transitory period, in terms of weather and meteorology. For example, on September 23 and 24, wind speeds in Gurugram were very high and the winds were accompanied by light showers. This helped to bring air quality back into the satisfactory AQI range. But on September 26, when wind speed was low and atmospheric moisture was high, the reading shot back up because particulate matter was being ‘held’ in the atmosphere,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist.The next two weeks, however, are likely to witness a steep deterioration in the air quality, with transboundary pollutants from across the Indian border, as well as from Punjab, expected to accumulate in the northern Indian plains. “The next couple of weeks will give us an idea of how the winter will progress. Incoming pollutants due to crop stubble burning are expected to reach NCR within the next week itself,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).Changes in atmospheric temperature, Singh, will also play an important role in determining the nature and extent of pollution in the coming days. “The daily maximum temperature has been around 35 degrees throughout September, and it dropped sharply to about 33 degrees Celsius over the weekend. But this was immediately followed by high wind speeds, which improved the air quality on Sunday,” he said.According to the Early Air Quality Warning System for Delhi-NCR, operated by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, “The air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to improve marginally but remain in the moderate category on 27.09.2020 and 28.09.2020. The air quality is likely to remain in moderate category on 29.09.2020.” The forecast also states, “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from northwest direction in Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph, mainly clear sky and strong surface winds (20-30 kmph) during the day on 29.09.2020.”Experts said that while these high speed winds may have a positive impact on air quality in Gurugram in the short term, they will eventually bring in pollutants from crop burning within the next two weeks. “Once the temperature drops and winter commences, there will be little wind left to disperse these pollutants, and we can expect the AQI in Gurugram to touch about 250, in the poor category,” said Panwar.

28-09-2020||Chandigarh||Patients have right to access hospital bills, treatment details: Mohali consumer panel||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has said it is the fundamental right of patients to get detailed information from hospitals on medical bills and treatment. The commission was on September 21 disposing of a complaint filed by Satrajit Sharma from Ludhiana after he was not given bills for treatment and medicines by Chandan Hospital in Phase 7, Mohali.“As per the new Consumer Protection Act, 2019, rights of consumers are very carefully protected. We feel that it was fundamental and natural right of the consumer to get bills and details of medical treatment. To our mind, a hospital can never be permitted to withhold the medical treatment details as well as bills from its consumer,” said the commission’s president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma in the orders uploaded on the commission’s website on September 24. Satrajit, who had been treated for cardiac ailments at Chandan Hospital in May 2017, paid Rs 1.50 lakh to the hospital as it was not empanelled with the insurance company issuing his policy.In his complaint, Satrajit said after he sought claims from the insurance company the hospital did not give him detailed bills, because of which treatment costs could not be reimbursed.The commission has directed the hospital to hand over medical bills, treatment chart and receipts of medicines administered to the patient within 30 days from the date of receipt of free certified copy of the order. Compensation of Rs 25,000“Since the hospital have unnecessarily caused harassment (to) Satrajit, who is a heart patient, it is ordered that hospital will also compensate him with consolidated amount of compensation to the tune of Rs 25,000 for mental harassment and litigation expenses,” the order read As no one appeared before the commission on behalf of Chandan Hospital, the commission proceeded ex parte against it. Commenting on the order, consumer rights activist Pankaj Chandgothia said, “A patient is the owner of his body and must have all records pertaining to its functioning. The hospital has been paid for its services and has no right to retain the records.” Records of the treatment are necessary to inform doctors and hospitals about the patient’s condition should he or she require treatment again, he said.“Even PGIMER does not give the entire records, but private hospitals have made it a practice of not handing over detailed reports and bills to patients to avoid being caught for charging for services not provided. People have to apply and get the information through Right to Information,” he said.Advocate HC Arora too was of the opinion that it was the right of any person to access details of treatment. “Most hospitals fear litigation, but they have to provide the records for complete transparency,” he said.Former president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Rajesh Dhir also felt there should be no secrecy about the line of treatment and the patient should have complete access to the medical history. Most hospitals were giving the requisite information to patients, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patients-have-right-to-access-hospital-bills-treatment-details-consumer-panel/story-saFzAFbijbM24Yu3mpiPLM.html
28-09-2020||Pune||FDA claims availability of 11,000 remdesivir vials in Pune; hospitals complain of shortage||Despite the city having at least 11,000 vials of remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment, hospitals are complaining of a shortage. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has said that the system of distribution is being improved and all hospitals have been asked to regularly update the stock so that the supply can be monitored.The remdesivir injection is prescribed to critical Covid-19 patients.According to assistant commissioner Dinesh Khivasara, there is a stock of remdesivir with hospitals as well as wholesale medical stores and dealers, who have been asked to provide it to doctors and patients.“As of now, we have 4,000 vials of remdesivir with the hospitals and 7,000 to 8,000 with the stockists. There is absolutely no shortage of the drug and we are improving the system to monitor the supply. We have now asked the hospitals to send us a daily update of the stock that they have which we monitor daily. The demand has increased now,” said Khivasara.SB Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), Pune division, FDA, said, “We are now asking the hospitals to send us a daily report of the stock that they have and have also asked them to keep a strict vigil on their staff. Based on the guidelines issued by the central health ministry, we have asked the hospitals to use the injection only for patients in moderate condition on oxygen.”Earlier, the state government had asked hospitals to judiciously use oxygen and now they have extended the guidelines for remdesivir too.However, hospitals have countered the FDA claim saying the injection is in short supply.Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble hospital, said, “Just three days ago despite paying the full advance payment for 600 vials, we got only 250 vials; that too in instalments. Despite repeatedly telling the FDA to look into it, the matter was not resolved finally after much follow up we got the vials all in one lot. This simply says that although there is no shortage, the fact remains that there is hoarding and the shortage is artificial.”The FDA claim comes a day after Maharashtra government issued a circular to all the divisional commissioners in the state. The circular has asked the administration of each district to make judicious use of injection and for it to be given with utmost care. According to the state health department, the medicine cannot be used for every Covid patient.Following the circular, the FDA has also started monitoring any black marketing of remdesivir in the city and other parts of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fda-claims-availability-of-11-000-remdesivir-vials-in-pune-hospitals-complain-of-shortage/story-MIG4iJzwhthf8CO8CRsAJO.html
28-09-2020||Pune||Despite EWS quota, Maratha protests intensify||Various Maratha outfits under the banner of Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) staged protests on Sunday in front of political party offices in the city, demanding immediate resolution of the reservation issue. The protests will continue until the first week of October, MKM convenors said. Members of various outfits gathered at offices of BJP on Jangli Maharaj (JM) road, Congress at Shivajinagar road, Shiv Sena at Deccan and NCP on Tilak road. The community outfits have intensified agitation days after Supreme Court stayed the reservation for Marathas, referring the matter to a larger constitutional bench. Earlier on Saturday, Maratha outfits staged a ‘dhol-bajao’ (beating the drum) in front of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s residence in Baramati. The agitators said they will further escalate their stir if the government does not take concrete steps. The agitators also submitted a memorandum to the additional superintendent of police Milind Mohite. While the state government has already taken a decision to bring Marathas under the 10 per cent quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) after the SC order, community leaders have decided to raise the issue politically and stage protests outside residences of members of Parliament (MPs) and legislators. “The steps taken by the state government are inadequate as the EWS quota does not serve its purpose. The government has to first take a call about thousands of youths awaiting jobs after clearing exams and also about the admissions. If the state government is so much concerned about Marathas, it should increase seats in education sector to accommodate Marathas,” said Rajendra Kondhare, convenor of the Maratha Mahasangh . Meanwhile Shiv Sangram Party founder Vinayak Mete held separate meetings with BJP Rajya Sabha MP and Chhatrapati Shivaji’s 13th descendant Udayanraje Bhosale and party legislator from Satara Shivendraraje Bhosale to chalk out planning for the upcoming community meeting. The meeting will be held in Pune on October 3 and Udayanraje and Shivendraraje are expected to attend it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-ews-quota-maratha-protests-intensify/story-IiC0kGMJ84xxUvgrjIhp2L.html
