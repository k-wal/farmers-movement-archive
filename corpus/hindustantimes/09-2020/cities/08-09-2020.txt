The police said the alleged drug peddlers used to source the narcotic from a supplier in West Bengal and sell it in small quantities in the city and across the National Capital Region (NCR). The accused have been identified as Minrul Sheikh, Mujibur Sheikh and Majnu Sheikh — all natives of West Bengal. The police said, prima facie, the probe has revealed that they had been peddling drugs for the past six years. According to the police, the crime branch of Sector 17 received a tip-off at 10pm, following which they cordoned off an area near Ambedkar Chowk in Sohna near Sohna-Palwal Road and set up a check post. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “A car in which the accused were travelling was stopped at the check post and during the search, a packet containing 798 grams of smack was recovered from their possession. The accused said that their main supplier was in West Bengal and their job was to peddle the narcotic in the city and NCR for a portion of the sales. We are questioning them to trace their aides.” The accused men were booked under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at Sohna City police station on Tuesday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-held-with-798-grams-smack-worth-over-1-crore/story-f1tbIc2PS4sEu5ILeQcQaM.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||As Covid-19 cases rise in Gurugram, 60% of ICU beds occupied||With cases of Covid-19 steadily rising, 60% of all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the district are currently occupied, as per the data available with the district health department. This is up from occupancy of about 30% till early August.Officials in the district administration and health department said that a review of the availability of beds was undertaken on September 7 and that they are keeping a close watch on the occupancy rates, in case infrastructure needs to be ramped up in the coming weeks.There are a total of 1,740 hospital beds in the city reserved for Covid-19 treatment across 42 dedicated Covid hospitals and healthcare centres — including 1,541 general hospital beds (with oxygen facility) and an additional 199 ICU beds (which further includes 94 beds with ventilator support).Of the available ICU beds, 121 are currently occupied (including 43 patients on ventilator support). While officials did not provide older data, they confirmed that ventilator bed occupancy has risen in the past two weeks.Despite the increase, officials maintained that there is no cause for alarm. “There are at least 328 ventilators available across the district’s Covid-19 hospitals. We can always allocate more for Covid-19 treatment if need be. The capacity can be created,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram, adding that the health department’s goal was to hospitalise less than 10% of the active cases. However, health department data shows that at least 20% of the active cases are currently hospitalised.Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital management said that private hospitals currently reserve 25% of their bed capacity for Covid-19, which can be further escalated to an additional 35% in case there is a surge in the number of cases. According to a state government order, a maximum of 60% of beds can be reserved in private hospitals. “At present, there has been no step towards the further expansion as the existing capacity continues to remain unused. Divisional commissioner Ashok Sangwan reviewed the situation on Monday and we have been told to keep a close eye on bed occupancy, in case we need to ramp it up soon,” Kalia said.On the other hand, despite an increase in ICU bed occupancy and ventilator use, a significant majority of general hospital beds continue to be vacant, despite a 70% increase in active cases recorded over the past seven days. Of the 1,541 hospital beds reserved for Covid-19, just 447 (or 29%) are currently in use. Of these, 75 beds are being used by suspected cases, whose test results have not yet been processed. General bed occupancy on September 3 was higher, at 31%.This discrepancy, experts said, may indicate that the health department’s primary response to Covid-19 is no longer able to keep up with the spread of the virus. “As transmission continues and more people get infected, it may so happen that many cases don’t emerge through testing and tracing, but because an individual’s symptoms have worsened,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine. “In a lot of these cases, ventilator support will be required because the person has tested positive at a later stage of infection. So that may be one reason why ventilators are being taken up more rapidly, though this does not explain why other general hospital beds are vacant.”This view was shared by an internal medicine expert in DLF-4, who claimed to have been approached by at least 16 symptomatic cases in her private practice over the past week. “I am not an epidemiologist, but if these many people are approaching doctors with symptoms and then testing positive, it stands to reason that there are a significant number of infected patients at large,” the physician said, requesting anonymity.Other experts offered slightly a different explanation. Dr Prabahakaran Dorairaj, vice president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “More ventilator bed occupation isn’t necessarily a sign of failing surveillance. It could just be a function of the increase in cases. Proportionally, more people will require ventilator support as reported infections increase. However, it is a bit odd that oxygen beds are disproportionately vacant. But, home isolation is also being encouraged in Gururgam and many people are opting for it, so that could be why general hospital beds are going empty. If home isolation is working, especially without oxygen support, then it will keep hospitals beds empty for those who really need them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-covid-19-cases-rise-in-gurugram-60-of-icu-beds-occupied/story-JyTmTREvfcouleRv6h9LyL.html
08-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Private schools prepare to call students for practical sessions voluntary basis||Gurugram: Some private schools in Gurugram are preparing to call students on a weekly basis for practical sessions in view of the unlock 4 guidelines allowing pupils of classes 9 to 12 to visit their institutes on a voluntary basis from September 21 to seek academic guidance. Schools said they had sought feedback from parents following the new guidelines. A section of parents were in favour of visits for practical sessions. Most schools said they were creating a roster for calling students. Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said the school had sought feedback from parents, and based on the responses, it was working to create a roster for those who had expressed willingness for school visits. “We shared feedback forms with parents to gather their views. An overwhelming number of parents said they are not prepared to send children to school for remedial or extra classes. However, around 25% of parents were in favour of sending children to school once or twice in a week for some hours or for practical exams,” Misra said. She said only a handful of students would be called in a week with written consent from parents. Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools, said parents wanted the school to facilitate visits while keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols. “Parents of children in senior classes have approached us. There is a realisation that a blended model with occasional visits is needed for students, especially since senior students need to eventually participate in lab sessions. These sessions can’t take place virtually. We are looking at facilitating that,” Bhadoo said. Rashmi Malik, principal, Salwan Public School, Sector 15, said the school was planning to call students for academic guidance after the quarterly exams that start this week. “By the end of September, we will be done with term-end assessments. If we find that there are children who have not been able to cope up with academics, we may call them for guidance sessions in accordance with the guidelines,” Malik said.Other schools said they would wait for the situation to improve before they call students, even for practical sessions. Anita Malhotra, principal of Lotus Valley, said the school would wait for the situation to improve before it starts calling students for such visits in the near future. “Currently, teachers visit the lab once in a while, conduct experiments, and they demonstrate these to the children via videos. In due course of time, when things are better, children can come and practice. Whenever we start calling children, we will ask them to come in batches of 8-10. We have huge laboratories but we will only be calling one-third or one-fourth of students when we do,” Malhotra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-private-schools-prepare-to-call-students-for-practical-sessions-voluntary-basis/story-HVDhdD7FYejPvdnKcdV1DP.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||No testing camps outside containment zones, says Gurugram administration||With number of containment zones in the city rising from 67 to 108, as per the revised order issued by the district administration on Tuesday, the health department on Tuesday clarified that testing camps will be held only in sealed areas. As part of its revised strategy to curb Covid-19 cases in the district, health officials said that since the number of containment zones has increased in the city, testing camps will no longer be held in condominiums or gated societies until it is declared a containment zone.“Earlier camps were being organised in gated societies and condominiums, even if they were not declared as containment zones. Now, no such testing camps will be organised from now on. Further, in the testing camps so organised, only rapid antigen tests would take place.” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Earlier, every urban Primary Health Centre (PHC) was given a target to conduct a certain number of testing camps to identify the maximum cases to bring down the test positivity rate of that particular area. There are 19 PHCs in Gurugram. Since the containment zones have increased, and each PHC now has six to seven containment zones under it, including towers inside condominiums, office floors and lanes in a gated colony. “Since Covid-19 cases are increasing, the department will focus upon containment zones to prevent the transmission of infection. For the timely identification of the suspected cases, our health care workers are already doing visits in these areas,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer. On Tuesday, 258 new cases were reported in the city, taking the count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to 13, 726. Out of these, 760 are active cases, while 11,806 have recovered from the illness. The Covid-19 toll stands at 140, with one death reported on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-testing-camps-outside-containment-zones-says-gurugram-administration/story-LtU4n3HoV98yJhWgamV86N.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana allows walk-in Covid-19 tests; Gurugram aims for 3,000 daily tests||Following the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to allow people to test for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, without requiring a doctor’s prescription, the Haryana government too on Tuesday issued a notification allowing this.Until now, according to ICMR rules, only those with flu-like symptoms or those who are high risk contacts of an infected person were tested after they got a prescription for a Covid-19 RT-PCRT test, which is considered to be the gold standard of frontline Covid-19 testing. As part of a revised strategy to curb the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the district health department has decided to ramp up testing in Gurugram to 3,000 samples per day, with new guidelines facilitating the process. On Tuesday, at least 2,707 tests were conducted, including 1,000 antigen tests 1,004 RT-PCR tests by government labs. The rest of the tests were conducted by private labs. The revised ICMR advisory systematically lists out the scope of testing in containment zones, in non-containment areas, hospitals and for the first time provides for on-demand testing with simplified modalities. While now anyone can be tested, the advisory also includes those with existing respiratory illnesses, patient with atypical manifestations (stroke, encephalitis, acute coronary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction) of the disease and individuals undertaking travel to countries or states mandating a negative test The ICMR issued revised testing strategy after a Delhi High Court hearing over improving testing in the national Capital. As reported by HT on Sunday, the court asked why the people having no symptoms — comprising a large proportion of Covid-19 patients — could not go for a test. The ICMR stated that it was just an advisory body and states were free to make changes as per their needs. Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer (CMO), said, “The state health department has issued a notification on walk-in tests after the ICMR issued an advisory earlier this week. With this new strategy, overall testing will be ramped up in the district as people can get directly tested without requiring any prescription. Our plan is to increase the testing to 3,000 samples per day.”To ramp up testing, the state health department had already brought down the cost of RT-PCR test to ₹1,600 for private labs. In the government lab, the test is conducted free of cost. For rapid antigen test too, private labs can charge only ₹650, while for antibody test ₹250. Experts, however, cautioned that people can test negative in the less accurate Rapid Antigen Test (RAT).Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said, “Testing on demand strategy is for all individuals who wish to get themselves tested and those who undertake travel to countries/Indian states mandating a negative Covid-19 test at point of entry. It also approves any of the tests - a single RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT or RAT positive test to be confirmatory, without any repeat testing. The RAT as is well known comes with its share of false negatives. While the advisory also cautions that if symptoms develop following a negative RAT test, a repeat RAT or RT-PCR should be done. There are no means of the local health authorities following up such ‘walk-in’ candidates.”According to him, senior ICMR officers have cautioned against complacency among people towards following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “There’s a potential worry of RAT-negative status, in the absence of follow-up,” said Dasgupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-allows-walk-in-covid-19-tests-gurugram-aims-for-3-000-daily-tests/story-FC67Agbzaqa7OLprZp2USM.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Cap on guests is making weddings unprofitable, say banquet hall owners||After several attempts at booking a banquet hall for his wedding in December failed, Gaurav Sharma had to ask a friend to let him use his farmhouse outside the city instead. “I tried a lot of numbers of banquet halls that were given online but most did not even answer their phones,” said Sharma, a resident of sector 45. “Of the three that did take my calls, two said they were closed for business, and the third quoted a price of ₹7-8 lakh, claiming that he had to recuperate his losses in the last five months. It made no sense for me to pay such a high cost for a small wedding,” said Sharma.The city has 72 banquet halls and its owners say that the cap on the number of guests has made resuming operations unfeasible for them. From a total clampdown on weddings when the national lockdown was announced on March 22, to allowing an even with a 50 guest limit from May 23, and now a guest limit of 100 from September 21, the wedding venue business has suffered.“I haven’t opened my banquet hall for bookings yet. With the limitation of 100 guests, it is simply not feasible. My running costs would be nearly double than my earnings under the current scenario,” said Virender Yadav, an owner of a banquet hall on Old Delhi Gurgaon Road. Banquet halls provide a wedding with every paraphernalia that goes with it -- from lighting, sound system and food , among others. And while there were 30,000 weddings annually at these venues, this year it fell to almost zero since March. Hall owners say that the government should adjust the guest limit depending on the size of the venue.“I had initially planned on reopening and received a few enquires as well. However, when people came to my venue, they realised that it was far too big, designed to host almost 1200 people. Further, the prices I was charging to recover the costs and make a marginal profit, was much higher than they were willing to pay for such a small guest list. Hence, I have closed my hall for bookings temporarily,” said Neeraj Verma, owner of a banquet hall on Carterpuri road. Anil Rao, president of Haryana Party Lawns Association that has all banquet hall members in Gurugram registered with it, said that most owners were charging between ₹4-8 lakh. He admitted that such pricing would not be attractive for most people when an independent farmhouse or community centre come at half that price.“The problem in Gurugram is that most banquet halls are large, designed to host a minimum of 500 people and a maximum of around 1,500.” said Rao. “So, when people come with requests, most banquet hall owners decline, while some charge a hefty amount for it.” Rao hopes the situation would improve in a month’s time, when wedding bookings for the “auspicious period” of November 25-December 12.“We are hoping that by next month, the government will allow us to host more guests or changes the cap depending on the space of a banquet hall,” said Rao.Rao said that in the interim, banquet hall owners and association members are figuring out ways to conduct smaller weddings, if there is no change in the government’s stance.“We are also making preparations for that scenario, which we think is the “worst-case”,” he said. “We are planning on leasing banquet halls for a 12-hour period where two sets of guests can be staggered between the day and night events. For hosting two events in short-time, we would need to be certain that we have all adequate disinfection and sanitisation resources as well as staff and other arrangements.”BOX: Key details100- the total number of guests allowed in a wedding from September 21 onwards72- the total number of registered banquet halls in the cityRs 4-8 lakh- the cost for hosting a 100-capped wedding||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-cap-on-guests-is-making-weddings-unprofitable-say-banquet-hall-owners/story-ZiT0VGnhyRB7t4pRwaIaZJ.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid sampling now increased to 1,300, Panchkula ahead of Chandigarh||As Covid-19 cases surge in the district, Panchkula administration has increased sampling to about 1,300 a day, which with 21 collection centres is much ahead of Chandigarh, which samples 800 on an average. Also, from Wednesday, those undergoing rapid antigen tests (RAT) won’t be allowed to leave without their reports, which will be ready in around 30 minutes.RAT involves testing in proximity of the patient and directly detecting presence or absence of an antigen.“The strategy during a surge should be to conduct house-to-house surveillance to identify persons with Influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), to conduct their tests near their homes, isolate the positive ones from others and quickly provide treatment,” said Dr Saroj Aggarwal, deputy civil surgeon, Panchkula.From nine sample collection centres initially when Covid cases were first reported, the number was increased to 19 in the last week of August and to 21 on September 7.“By setting up 21 sample collection centres, we have brought the facility to (residents’) areas,” Dr Aggarwal said. “Earlier, if you asked symptomatic people to visit a hospital in Panchkula, 50% would not turn up... further spreading the infection and creating longer chain. But now, a person from Nanakpur does not have to visit Panchkula to give samples.”Adding that health officials were focused on bringing down the number of fatalities, Dr Aggarwal said the fourth round of house-to-house surveys had started. Till date, 36 deaths have been reported, of which 34 took place since August.About 47,057 samples have also been collected for both RAT and RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). In five months, from March till July 31, the authorities had conducted 19,370 tests.Sampling has increased rapidly since August after the surge, with 27,687 tests conducted from August 1 till September 7.“On an average we are conducting over 13,00 tests per day, of which over 1,000 are RAT and over 300 tests by using the traditional RT-PCR method. Area-wise, we are getting 20% to 30% positivity,” said Dr Aggarwal.With the population of 5.61 lakh (as per 2011 Census), the sampling rate of Panchkula district is much higher than Mohali district and UT Chandigarh – both with a population of 10 lakh.People sampled won’t leave centresDr Aggarwal also said ‘holding time areas’ were being created for people undergoing RAT to wait for results arriving in 15 to 30 minutes. “According to protocol, positive persons will either be sent for home isolation with kits or to the Covid care centre or hospital,” she said.The decision was taken because people were giving wrong information while being tested, which made contacting them difficult if they tested positive. “At times it used to take us 24 to 36 hours to isolate them and by that time they created clusters,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-sampling-now-increased-to-1-300-panchkula-ahead-of-chandigarh/story-p6Ha1qRKwcl5mkJRQOMEIO.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt clears Bill to allow Mhada to take over revamp of cessed bldgs stuck for years||In a major relief for the residents of the island city of Mumbai, the Maharashtra Assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill for forcibly takeover redevelopment project of cessed buildings if the developer has failed to start the project for many years. Before acquisition, it will also give six months to the landowner and another six months to the tenants to get the project started. The move is expected to give a big push to redevelopment of many cessed buildings that could not be developed for years owing to disputes and are currently in dilapidated condition.The Bill allows changes to the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) Act, 1976, to pave way for redevelopment of the 14,227 cessed buildings. “Cessed buildings have been divided into three categories — those constructed prior to 1940 in A, constructed between 1940 and 1950 in B, and constructed before 1969 in C. Most of these buildings are in dilapidated conditions and need urgent redevelopment. The amendment empowers Mhada to acquire buildings by giving six months to the landowners and six more months to the society for the redevelopment. If they fail to do so, Mhada will take over the redevelopment and complete it within three years for the old tenants. Mhada can also tie up with private builders for the project,” an official from the housing department said.The state Assembly cleared another amendment in the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, in relation to debarring tainted directors of cooperative banks from contesting polls to any cooperative bodies for ten years. The Bill has withdrawn a provision that allows implementation of the above clause with retrospective effect. “If such a person is currently a director of a bank, he will have to resign from the position, if any bank governed by him was dissolved for financial irregularities in the past 10 years,” says the provision that has been scrapped with the fresh amendment. The MVA government has reversed the clause introduced by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis led government that could have debarred many of its senior politicians including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. He was chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank, which was dissolved by the previous Congress-NCP government for financial irregularities.Fadnavis, now leader of opposition, strongly opposed the Bill. He alleged that the move indicates that the government is encouraging those involved in financial frauds in the cooperative sector.The lower House also passed another Bill for appointing “a suitable person” as administrator on close to 15,000 gram panchayats whose term is ending by this year end. The Opposition leader objected to Bill saying that the high court has clearly said that a public servant can be appointed on the position and not any private person as intended by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-clears-bill-to-allow-mhada-to-take-over-revamp-of-cessed-bldgs-stuck-for-years/story-FEFWDe2Bf4gcClWU9YDwHI.html

We hope that the PGI administration will review the decision as assured to us,” the release stated.PGIMER authorities have also appealed to the nurses not to obstruct work in these challenging times.“We all are putting our best efforts and working to contain the situation. However, nurses should not obstruct work and create unnecessary hurdles at this point of time,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director PGIMER. A day earlier when the nurses and the administration agreed to the duty duration, the institute put out a strongly worded release stating that all the demands of nurses were not genuine. “The unions and associations are creating a lot of obstruction in the management of the ever-increasing Covid-19 patient load in the hospital, which is taking care of patients not only from UT but also from the neighbouring three states,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-nurses-call-off-protest-over-long-duration-of-covid-duty/story-0UkWxE37PXJpxODsbZiy5L.html

08-09-2020||City||Two property dealers shot dead in a high-rise in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: Two property dealers were allegedly shot at by unidentified persons in the parking lot of a high-rise in Greater Noida West on Monday night. Both the victims succumbed to their injuries, the police said.The police identified the deceased as Dal Chand Sharma (32), a native of Faridabad in Haryana who was currently living in Panchsheel Greens in Greater Noida, and Arun Tyagi (22), a native of Roza Yakubpur. The incident was reported around 9.30pm from Ajnara Le Garden society where Sharma had his office, the police said.According to police officials, the incident took place when the two victims, along with two other friends, were consuming alcohol in Sharma’s Tata Harrier car. “It seems that two unidentified men walked up to the car, knocked on the window and shot at the victims,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.Sharma, who was shot at least seven times, was in the driver’s seat while Tyagi, who received three bullets, was in the passenger’s seat. The officials said that there were two shooters who fired from both the windows. Several shots were also lodged in the car as well, they said.The duo was immediately rushed to a nearby private hospital where they were declared brought dead, the police said.“Sharma’s family has named a few suspects. We have a solid lead and are working on it. Arrests will be made soon. The shooters are seen clearly in the society’s CCTV footage,” said the DCP.Seven teams have been formed to for the case, the police said.The police said that a personal enmity could be behind this incident. “In 2011, Sharma’s elder brother Rajendra was killed, along with another man, in a Faridabad village by a few people from the same village who had an issue with the family over their father’s election as the village head. Some of the suspects had gone to jail and were later released on bail. One of the suspects was killed in 2017 in Mathura and in this case, Sharma, his father and a few others had been suspects, gone to jail and were released on bail. Sharma had then moved to Greater Noida West and was known as Virat Sharma, which is actually his seven-year-old son’s name,” said Munish Chauhan, station house officer, Bisrakh police station.The Sharma’s family has given names of three people to the police as suspects. “They first killed his elder brother and then him. The whole issue started with them trying to get our family’s property in the village. My brother had left that behind to start afresh, but they are still targeting our family,” said Rakesh Sharma, the victim’s brother.On the complaints filed by the family members of both victims, a case of murder under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Bisrakh police station, the police said.“We don’t know much about the incident. We just got a call around 10pm that Arun had been hurt, after which we rushed to the hospital,” said Santosh, Tyagi’s aunt. The police suspect that the shooters were hired gunners because their descriptions don’t match those of the suspects. They also suspect that Tyagi was an unintentional casualty. The incident has, however, spooked the residents of the Ajnara Le Garden society. According to the police, a group of residents from the high-rise protested on Tuesday evening demanding more security in the area. However, they were dispersed by the police, a local police officer said.In a separate incident, a 24-year-old man from Aligarh was injured after he was allegedly shot at by a person in Jewar. “The victim, Anjuman, was visiting some family friends. There was an argument between a man and his nephew over rent of the house where they lived. The victim was caught in the middle and was shot at in his stomach. A police team was rushed to the spot and he was immediately taken to a private hospital for treatment from where he was referred to Aligarh,” said Vishal Pandey, additional DCP, Zone 3.Two suspects were nabbed and the countrymade pistol used in the incident was recovered, Pandey said, adding that a case of attempt to murder (Section 307 of IPC) was registered at Jewar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-property-dealers-shot-dead-in-a-high-rise-in-greater-noida/story-y9x4qp7nJ6Xb8tF44j2oIP.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to get 6 more driver feedback systems||Chandigarh Chandigarh traffic police plan to install six more driver feedback systems or boards indicating speed of vehicles after the success of the previous ones put up in January this year. Revealing plans, officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic) Manoj Kumar Meena said, “The files have been approved by higher authorities for six more systems. We will now go ahead with the tendering process at the Government E-Marketplace (GEM) portal.” Adding that it was too early to comment on costs, Meena said the next step would be to figure out the roads at which the systems were to be installed.He said the decision to get more systems was taken because of the change in habits of drivers that was observed after the boards were set up. “The six systems are all installed at roads which were previously classified under black spots, but since then there have been no fatal accidents.” The driver feedback systems display a vehicle’s speed, alerting drivers going over the 60km/h limit. Data is also collected on the speed of vehicles at these intersections at different times of the day. These have provision for CCTV cameras to issue e-challans for speeding.The previous systems had been provided by Pune-based firm Ador Powerton Ltd for Rs 2.5 Lakh per board. They are connected to streetlights and charge when the lights are switched on at night. After the tendering process this time, which is likely to be completed in six months, authorities will see if they want to give the contract to the same firm, Meena said. On how the boards worked, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), traffic administration, Kewal Krishan said, “The boards act as a tool of awareness as many times drivers themselves aren’t aware of how fast they are driving. Speeding caused 95% fatalities in 2019, and traffic cops can’t be on duty round the clock so the systems are used to ensure people aren’t speeding.” The traffic police have also issued over 15,000 challans for speeding in the past four months.Currently, the systems are installed on traffic intersections at the city periphery. Sources said it was likely that the new boards coming in will be placed similarly at spots where a high number of traffic fatalities had been recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-to-get-6-more-driver-feedback-systems/story-HFt0488ta8wISlwOwLTR1N.html
08-09-2020||City||Jewar Airport concessionaire agreement may be signed by October 15||The Noida International Airport Limited and the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority on Tuesday said they hoped that the airport concessionaire, Zurich Airport International AG, and special purpose vehicle, the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited, would sign the concessionaire agreement before October 15, if restrictions on air travel in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic are relaxed by that time.On May 19 this year, Zurich International had got requisite security clearance from the ministry of home affairs, paving way for the singing of the concessionaire agreement. The agreement was supposed to be signed by July 2, according to the earlier schedule. Later on June 10, the UP government postponed the agreement signing date to August 17 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“They (Zurich) have been given time till October 15 for signing of the agreement in view of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions on air travel. Currently, there are no international flights between Zurich and India and that’s why travel is not possible. Once international flights start, they will travel to sign the agreement,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of NIAL and YEIDA.Zurich International and Yamuna International Airport private limited had on January 30 applied for security clearance to the ministry of home affairs. Zurich AG cannot start work at the Jewar airport site before the agreement is signed.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration had acquired 1,334 hectares under phase 1 out of the total 5,000 hectares required for the airport project that has a budget of Rs 30,000 crore, paving way for the construction to begin at the site. But work is being delayed at the site due to the pandemic, officials said. On November 29, 2019, Zurich Airport International AG, the owner of Switzerland’s biggest airport, had emerged as the top bidder to design, build and develop a new airport in Jewar along the 165-kilometre Yamuna expressway in Uttar Pradesh. To be spread over 5,000 hectares, once completed, it will be the biggest airport in India with eight runways and will cater to 70 million passengers a year by 2040-50. The first phase is expected to be completed in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jewar-airport-concessionaire-agreement-may-be-signed-by-october-15/story-1EThIXXSjyMmCVPweUjgUI.html
08-09-2020||City||24% of 140 infected health care workers in Ghaziabad were on Covid duty||Since the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Ghaziabad in March till September 5, 140 health care workers (HCWs) were infected with the disease, of which 24% were on Covid duty and none died.Officials from the health department said that they had not acquired it while on active Covid duty, which is when HCWs must enter Covid isolation wards wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). This would imply that HCWs were more at risk from asymptomatic untested patients more than they would be while dealing with confirmed patients.“Two doctors who were infected and on Covid related duties-- one at a quarantine centre, and the other at the Delhi airport, were not on active duty at the Covid isolation wards. In one of our L-3 (tertiary care) acquired hospitals, five doctors who were on active duty too got the infection, but we believe they acquired it while performing other duties,” said Dr. NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer.HCWs are at the highest risk of being infected due to the close proximity with people and are tested regularly. These workers include those who are on surveillance duty, lab technicians deployed to test people, doctors and other hospital staff. “The low positivity in our doctors is due to prevalence and adherence to the infection prevention protocols. We are continuing with precautions. The others who acquired infection were in non-Covid departments. The major share of acquiring infection was among the health care staff members who were deployed for non-Covid duties at non-Covid health facilities,” said Dr Gupta. While five HCW each were found to be positive in April and May, 58 had the infection in June, 56 in July, and 16 in August. The spike in cases came at a time when the healthcare facilities opened up for OPDs and Covid hospitals had to deal with high number of cases which had started coming in after unlock 1 from June 8. “In our hospital only three of 50 nurses, and two other staff acquired infection but it is likely that they acquired it from outside. No doctors in our hospital got infected with Covid-19. It is due to strict schedule which we had prepared so that a doctor gets exposure to any patient only for six hours. So we strictly adhered to the roster and made use of safe delivery kits which were available with us initially when PPE kits were less in supply,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of district women’ hospital which is a non-Covid facility.The officials of the L-2 (moderate care) hospital at Sanjay Nagar said that none of their doctors acquired infection during the entire period of the pandemic so far. “None of our doctors acquired infection while on duty at the hospital. So far, we have only nine nurses and ward boys, who got infected while on duty. We have been stressing on proper sanitisation, use of masks and strict compliance of the social distancing norms,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the L2 category Covid hospital. “We made strict compliance of infection prevention training and our major focus was on use of PPE kits. There is specific procedure to wear and take out the PPE kits and any lapses could pass on infection. So, every staff was provided training in this regard and we even sanitized the PPE kits to keep away infection.” The state government as well as the district administration has laid stress on strict adherence to infection prevention protocols so that the frontline healthcare workers do not acquire in times of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/24-of-140-infected-health-care-workers-in-ghaziabad-were-on-covid-duty/story-LNAAWWmT08yVO2Ixr7v66M.html
08-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad completes 99% contact tracing of Covid patients||The district health department said it has expedited contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases in the district and has traced contacts of almost 98.9% (till September 7) of people infected with the disease. The officials said almost 10% of the total Covid-19 cases in the district were detected through contact tracing exercise.According to the officials of the district health department, till September 7evening, nearly 69,995 contacts of 9,491(out of 95,587 patients) Covid-19 positive patients in the district were identified.According to health department records, out of the total traced persons, 949—9.9% of 9587 total positive cases in till September 7—had tested positive for Covid-19.“Ideally, we have to trace about 10 contacts for every patient. We have already started working on this since July when six contacts were traced per patient. The figure was about 9 in August. Overall, since March, we have completed contact tracing for over 98% patients. The activity is ongoing and proving helpful in prevention of infection from spreading especially in containment zones,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.“Off late, there has been rise in number of cases. So, it becomes more challenging to complete the task of contact tracing of every patient within time bound manner,” he added.The health department has an overall average of identifying 7.3 contacts per patient. According to the data, about 20,391 (29.13%) of overall 69,995 contacts were traced in the month of July, while 33659 (48.08%) were traced in the month August alone.People with influenza-like illness and severe cute respiratory illness account for almost 44% of the infection, while 43% cases come from random testing at the testing booths, besides 10% cases attributed to contact tracing in Ghaziabad, officials said.“There are about 24 teams which are actively involved in tracing of contacts, and it aims to track contacts of all new Covid-19 patients within 24 hours. Since the contacts are high-risk cases, they need to be identified immediately and tested. During initial months, the contact tracing was less, but currently, we are tracing about 7.3 contacts per positive case,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The contact-tracing activity is vital to control the spread of infection. The Uttar Pradesh government from time to time has directed the district authorities to focus on contact tracing.“Contact tracing becomes vital it identifies close contacts, friends or family members of the positive patients. These are high-risk cases and their quick identification and immediate testing is important to prevent the infection spread. The process has to be always ongoing, and should be taken up on priority basis in order to prevent others from getting infected,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “In case there is delay in contact tracing, it is likely that suspected cases may spread infection to many others” he added.Activities under contact tracing are directed by the integrated command and control centre which runs from the district headquarters. Dedicated teams are deployed to coordinate with the teams who reach out contacts on ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-completes-99-contact-tracing-of-covid-patients/story-9ykBz6Wv4gKOx7Tw8xq2XM.html

In a representation submitted with the financial commissioner (taxation), Punjab, the members of the association stated that the state government had failed to intervene in the matter despite representations submitted with the high authorities and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on September 3 and 5. Due to this, they announced an indefinite strike by all the cadres of the staff starting from the level of inspectors to additional commissioners.One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said that FIRs are still being registered against the officials on flimsy grounds and arrests are also being made.“Search operations are also being conducted in the houses of officials, which is humiliating. This has inculcated fear in the minds of officials. Further, the vigilance bureau is also making public the details regarding the properties of officials booked without investigating the matter properly,” he added.The association has announced an indefinite strike and has urged the government to intervene in the matter. Rather than directly registering FIRs against the officials, a committee should be formed to investigate the matter, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/excise-officials-to-go-on-strike-from-today/story-eJM3PNbFhKNjna7v58qm4O.html

08-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Significant surge in Covid-19 cases in the past 11 days||The Gautam Budh Nagar district is witnessing a significant surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. In the past 11 days (August 28-September 7), the district recorded 1,419 positive cases with the daily average of 129 cases, registering a daily growth of 50% over the previous 11-day period. During August 17-27, GB Nagar had reported 943 positive cases with the daily average of about 86 cases, according to an analysis of data from the state health department. Also, the recovery rate has come down to around 60% in the past 11 days, compared to 84% of the previous period. On Tuesday, with 236 new cases, the district recorded the highest single-day spike so far, taking the overall tally of positive cases to 9,126. District officials have attributed the sudden surge in cases to reverse migration of workers and increasing number of tests.“Being an industrial hub, the district has a floating population. The reverse migration of workers is believed to be the main reason of increasing trend of Covid-19 cases. Secondly, if the doctors are to be believed, the season nowadays has maximum viral load, which is always a good carrier for many virus-borne diseases. And most importantly, with the restrictions eased and economic activities started, the cases will keep increasing if people don’t take all the precautionary measures,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. When asked about the measures planned by the district administration to check this sudden surge, Suhas said that early and timely tracking of the cases and providing adequate treatment to the patients have already begun by the district health department. “We appeal to the common people not to give up masks and social distancing in any case,” said the DM. However, GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that the sudden surge in the positive cases are mainly due to increasing number of tests per day. “At present, we are testing 3,000 to 4,000 persons daily. It is obvious that the more we test, the more cases will be recorded. Our mechanism is very systematic in this regard. We allow home isolation to the patients, either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms without any co-morbidity. So far, 750 patients in home isolation have been cured and the remaining 194 are in the recovery stage,” he said. District surveillance officer Dr Manoj Kushwaha said that so far 2,18,921 persons have been tested in the district. “Out of 2,18,921 tests, 1,36,375 were done using rapid antigen kits, while 77,943 through lab-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The remaining 4,603 tests were conducted through real-time TrueNat machines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-significant-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-the-past-11-days/story-qXSIjVE02rFoTyYbZTuVhM.html

While the number of active cases remain at 1,510 for Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar has 1,599 active cases.The UP government, in view of the Covid-19 situation, had on July 9 announced weekend restrictions and directed that all markets would remain shut on Saturdays and Sundays during which different agencies will take up extensive sanitisation and cleaning drives in their respective areas.The order was later modified on September 1, with the government relaxing norms and stating that markets could stay open from 9am to 9pm on all days, including Saturdays. SUnday was to be used by markets to take up cleaning, sanitisation exercise.“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed that weekly closure for markets will be as per previous arrangement (pre-Covid times), instead of Sunday. He said that all health protocols should be strictly followed. He has also directed that hotels and restaurants be allowed to operate, except those in containment zones,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).Traders of the district were quick to welcome the move and said it will bring much needed relief for them.“For the past six months, during the lockdown and Unlock phases, the traders had been waiting for the local economy to open up. It is a matter of relief that the government has done away with weekend restrictions. This will help small businesses and traders can now expect their financial condition to improve,” said Praveen Bhati, president of Vyapar Mandal – Sahibabad.In Ghaziabad, majority of markets used to stay shut on Tuesdays, before Covid-19 forced a complete lockdown.“Different associations had been writing to the chief minister and officials of the UP government to allow opening of markets on weekends.

08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Parallel associations spoiling the broth in sporting powerhouse Haryana||Over the years, the northern agrarian state of Haryana has emerged as a powerhouse in the country’s sporting scenario, sending the maximum number of athletes to Olympics and contributing a lion’s share in the country’s medal tally in the Asian and Commonwealth Games. In the last three Olympics, sportspersons hailing from the state have made the country proud — Boxer Vijender Singh (bronze, 2008), wrestlers Yogeshwar Dutt (bronze, 2012) and Sakshi Malik (bronze, 2016). But when it comes to the role of the sports administrators and associations in the state, it is a divided house, with politics often superseding genuine units. Many sports disciplines have parallel associations and in some cases, there are three bodies running the affairs of the sport, eventually leading to halting of the sports activities. The Haryana Olympic Association (HOA), currently headed by former additional director general of police PV Rathee, has 33 sports associations affiliated to it. Of these, over 10 are parallel state associations that have no affiliation to the national federation and are not eligible to send teams to national championships. However, these bodies will be voting in the state Olympic body polls, set to be held on September 19. Apart from that, there are a few state sports associations, such as those of rowing, squash, modern pentathlon and bowling, which have the national federation affiliation but they are not affiliated to the HOA even as there are no parallel state units in the sport. The state contingent in the National Games participates under the HOA banner. “There are a number of state sports associations, which are not recognised by their national sports federation and despite that, they are affiliated to the HOA. These associations not only have voting rights, but officials from these associations also hold the majority of the posts in HOA,” says Sajjan Kumar, who was the joint secretary of the HOA and resigned from the post on September 4. “In my resignation, I have raised objections over these unauthorised sports associations,” he said. Take an example of football. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) recognises Suraj Pal Amu led-Haryana Football Association and the state teams for all the national championships are participating under his association’s banner. However, the HOA recognises the football body led by former Congress MLA Rao Dan Singh. Similarly, the Archery Association of India (AAI) recognises Haryana unit headed by former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Captain Abhimanyu and the state teams participate under his unit’s banner, while HOA has given affiliation to a parallel body headed by Raghu Raj. The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) recognises the state body, whose president is Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader and MLA Abhay Singh Chautala, however, HOA recognises a parallel body. “Our association, Haryana Hockey, is a recognised unit of Hockey India and affiliated to HOA, but I am of the view that only those state sports associations should be allowed to vote, that are recognised by the national body and are eligible to send the teams for the national championships,” says Sunil Malik, secretary general of Hockey Haryana. In gymnastics, there are three bodies claiming to be the governing body of the sport in the state, but the Gymnastics Federation of India (GFI) has not given recognition or authorisation any of these to send the team for nationals. Looking into the tussle over the control of the sport in the state, the GFI selects the state team through its observer in open trials.

Banks are also issuing notices to the bus operators to pay loan instalments as the government has failed to intervene. The bus operators and their families are struggling to make ends meet, but the government is paying no heed to their problems.”In a memorandum submitted to the district administration, the bus operators also threatened to take the agitation to the next level in the coming days and hand over the keys of their buses to the administration.Association president Inderjit Singh said, “We would be left with no other option than to hand over the keys of our buses to the government. The situation is becoming worse every passing day and we demand that the government immediately announce monetary relief for the sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/school-bus-operators-protest-outside-ludhiana-dc-office-seek-monetary-relief/story-cmpkseANmIskA7zca8fSaJ.html

With 323 deaths being reported in August accounting for 78.6% of the total 411 fatalities, the death rate spiraled further in the beginning of September as 111 patients from the district succumbed to the virus in merely eight days, whereas 70 deaths were reported during the corresponding period last month. Of the 111 people who died in September, 84 were male and 27 female. Of the total deaths, 96 have been reported in the age group of 30 and beyond. According to cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid task force constituted by the state government to plug the virus spread, the fatality rate was high in the district as people were not adhering to the government guidelines. “At the time when 15 patients are dying of Covid daily, people are hosting pool parties. What else do you expect,” Dr Mohan said. He also laid the blame on prevalence of diabetes and hypertension among people of Ludhiana for the high fatality rate. “In majority of the cases, we have witnessed diabetes and hypertension to be the reasons behind the high causality rate. We have been requesting the residents suffering from comorbidities to stay indoors and venture out only if it is necessary and that too after taking proper protective measures,” the doctor added. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga, meanwhile, said self-medication was also contributing to the rising rate of deaths. Both Dr Mohan and Dr Bagga stressed that early treatment is the “only cure”. “A patient should be rushed to a hospital when his/her saturation level falls below 93. But currently, patients are being brought in when the saturation level drops to as low as 60,” Dr Mohan said. Dr Rajesh Bagga attributed the reason for higher deaths among males to the stronger immune system of females. “Women’s immunity generally has more resistance towards the virus. Moreover, hormones and chromosomes also play pivotal roles,” he added. From 88 deaths between March 29 and July 31 (64 days), the Covid toll rose to 411 by the end of August — a spike of 21 times. The fatality rate spiralled majorly only after the curfew restrictions were lifted on June 8. Before June 8, 11 people had died since March 29 (70 days). March had recorded one death, followed by three fatalities in April and five in May. As the borders reopened and restrictions were eased in June, allowing public to venture out and businesses to reopen, the Covid-positive cases shot up and fatalities rose to 12 in a month. The situation began to worsen in July that saw 67 deaths. Dr Bagga suggested that wearing masks, social distancing and frequent washing hands were the biggest protection against the virus. “I strongly believe that we are reaching a plateau following which the number of cases and fatalities will decline. But that will only happen if we would adhere to the government guidelines and shun social gatherings and parties,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fatality-rate-spirals-ludhiana-district-sees-111-deaths-in-september/story-wI7t345urxy1byVNnh9TpI.html

Four police personnel who were on duty inside the premises, one media person and a driver examined also tested positive. Necessary steps as per norms have been taken,” Speaker Biman Banerjee said.He had said last week that the session would be held in strict compliance with ICMR guidelines, and every individual will have to undertake the Covid-19 test before entering the House.The tests would continue on Wednesday also.According to sources in the Assembly, MLAs, staff members and journalists, planning to attend the proceedings, formed separate queues on the premises of the assembly, and underwent rapid antigen tests, while maintaining social distancing norms.The West Bengal house monsoon session will be held for only a day on September 9 due to the ongoing pandemic, instead of two-day as proposed earlier.The TMC said the decision to curtail the sitting for a day only was taken at the all-party meeting Tuesday.“We don’t want people to stay in the assembly for a long time. So it has been decided that the house will be adjourned after obituary reference and placing of few reports,” Banerjee said.The decision, however, riled opposition Congress.Leader of the Opposition, Abdul Mannan criticised the TMC government for not accepting proposals for bringing in resolution against the “anti-people” policies of the Centre.“We wanted to bring in a resolution against the National Education Policy and rise in the prices of essentials. But our proposal was turned down by the TMC. This only proves that TMC and BJP have a tacit understanding,” he alleged.There have been instances when resolutions have been passed without any discussions. But the state government was adamant on not bringing any resolution, Mannan said.TMC denied the charge and said the resolution was not allowed as the session will be held for just a day.The state government had sent a proposal to the speaker in August for convening a session either from the first or the second week of September in consideration of the rules that there cannot be a gap of more than six months between two sessions of the assembly.The 294-member state assembly was adjourned sine die on March 17 as the state budget session was curtailed due to coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/eight-persons-test-positive-for-covid-ahead-of-truncated-west-bengal-monsoon-session-on-wednesday/story-DL1c1xosL8F4cGiel4PANL.html

08-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board has outlined plan to augment water supply, says vice- chairman Chadha at business meet||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Tuesday said the water utility has outlined a plan to augment supply in Delhi in order to avert a water crisis.He spoke about the plan at the ongoing CII Delhi Business Week 2020. “The situation is grave at present. Niti Aayog had last year declared that 21 cities in India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, may face severe water scarcity by 2020. In Delhi, efforts are on to rationalise the distribution and ensure consistent supply in the command areas of the water treatment plants (WTPs)” said Chadha.Parts of Delhi usually faces a water scarcity during the summer months when the demand shoots up exponentially.Currently, of the nine treatment plants in Delhi, seven depend on river water (Ravi-Beas and Yamuna) that comes from Haryana. The remaining two plants in east Delhi get Ganga water from Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh. Currently, potable water at its optimum production is about 935MGD (million gallons per day) of which 90MGD is from groundwater resources, he said.He added that for efficient water auditing and minimising leakage losses, DJB has considered installing bulk flow meters in the supply infrastructure. “Around 3,000 flow meters will be installed, and 90% of them have been installed already. This will help in better management and rationalisation along with reduction in loss of potable water,” said Chadha.According to a study by the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) , estimates of which were released during the CII event, groundwater level in Delhi is depleting at a rate of 10cm a year. By 2025, the water requirement of Delhi is likely to go up to 1140 MGD ( going by the rate of 44 MGD per person per day).He also said rainwater harvesting is more than necessary in Delhi to augment the city’s water table, which has been depleting over the years.“It’s high time that all buildings, wherever feasible, installed rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures. Recently, rain centres have been established in the east district. Besides these, a 10% rebate in the total monthly water bill is being given to consumers who have functional RWH systems,” he said.He also listed other measures being taken for augmenting supply such as rejuvenation of river Yamuna through in situ treatment of drains, including Shahdara, Barapullah and Badshahpur drains, upgrade of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and laying of the sewerage network in 1,799 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, among others.Chadha also raised a set of challenges being faced by the DJB such as equitable distribution, given the increasing population and the limited resources; misuse of water by residents; and conservation of scarce natural water resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-has-outlined-plan-to-augment-water-supply-says-vice-chairman-chadha-at-business-meet/story-ZGd0HahWq32LBhZUDtx8iI.html

A report indicating the progress of investigation, including specific reasons for detaining the accused beyond the specified period, was furnished. The trial court had perused the same as well as examined the case diaries and had recorded its satisfaction in this regard,” the bench said.Saifi, in his plea, sought directions from the high court to set aside the trial court order, dated August 13, extending the time for completing the investigation till September 17. The plea has also sought to issue consequential directions that he be released on bail in terms of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Saifi, a member of United Against Hate group, was arrested on March 21 for allegedly being a part of those who conspired to start the north-east Delhi riots in February. Police booked him under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.On August 13, the trial court allowed the application of the investigating agency seeking an extension of the time period to conclude the investigation under Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA, and extended the time period by 30 days, till September 17.Besides Saifi, other accused persons in the case are Ishrat Jahan, Tahir Hussain, Gufisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Asif Iqbal Tanha, and Shafa ur-Rehman. The accused persons have denied their involvement in the riots and have accused the Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against anti-government voices. The arrested persons were prominent faces who took part in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-hc-dismisses-plea-that-questioned-extension-of-probe-period/story-rLZXDNtXxKGxQF4syV0YRP.html
08-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: BJP demands CBI probe into ‘storing of ration bags’ in school||The controversy surrounding the ‘storing of ration bags’ in classrooms of a local school refuses to die down. On Tuesday, Punjab BJP vice-president Praveen Bansal and Ludhiana BJP president Pushpinder Singhal met deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and demanded a CBI probe into the alleged storing of ration bags in a school at Haibowal. The decision was taken after a team constituted by the district food and civil supplies department gave a ‘clean chit’ to Congress leader Baljinder Singh Sandhu in the matter.Bansal along with other party workers had visited the school on August 27 and accused Sandhu, whose wife represents ward no 91 as councillor, and Congress MLA Rakesh Panday for illegally storing 4,000 gunny bags of ration in various classrooms of the school. The next day District Congress Committee chief Ashwani Sharma and other party leaders slammed Bansal for levelling false allegations against Sandhu. As the matter escalated, food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu ordered a probe into the matter. On Tuesday, Bansal gave a pen drive to DC containing videos and written statements of Baljinder Singh Sandhu, the owner of the school from where ration bags were recovered, Congress District President Ashwani Sharma and food supply officers, Harveen Kaur and Sukhwinder Singh Gill.Bansal said that there was a huge disparity between the statement of the Congress leader and the department officials. “In a statement, Baljinder Singh had said that there were 450 ration bags kept in school, however, 4,000 ration bags were recovered from three classrooms of the school,” said Bansal. “The next day, some councillors, including Ashwani Sharma, told the media that they received a total of 31,000 ration bags for the Northern Assembly constituency and there were 700 bags remaining at that time. On the other hand, district food controller Harveen Kaur said that a total of 20,000 bags were sent for the northern assembly. And on August 28, a total of 700 bags were recovered from two rooms during the investigation. I don’t know who is speaking the truth, we are demanding an impartial probe from an independent agency,” said Bansal. On the other hand, district BJP chief Pushpinder Singhal said that no method was followed for distributing the ration. “The department is doing everything possible to save its employees and Congress leaders,” he said. Singhal said that a delegation of BJP leaders will also meet cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to bring out the truth behind the scam. Besides they will urge the Governor to initiate a CBI probe into the matter, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-bjp-demands-cbi-probe-into-storing-of-ration-bags-in-school/story-wyaEGTFvcGgeR1sb2L4SQM.html

08-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: More complaints of inferior road work pour in||Despite inspections and sampling being conducted by the municipal corporation (MC) to monitor the quality of road construction works, complaints against ‘inferior quality’ work being done by contractors continue to pour in.On Tuesday, residents raised concerns over the alleged inferior quality work of interlocking tiles being done in the Harnam Nagar near Model town area.Social activist Gurpal Grewal said, “Inferior quality work is being done in Harnam Nagar area as the tiles are being installed at an uneven level. Despite repeated complaints being submitted by the residents, the MC has failed to take stern action against the contractors.”A resident of the area, Gurwinder Singh said, “There was no need to replace the tiles and the old tiles could have been repaired easily. The work to install the new tiles is also not being done properly and the MC should take note of it. The contractor should be directed to reinstall the tiles and action should be taken against him if he fails to do so.”MC additional commissioner, Rishipal Singh said, “Sampling of newly constructed roads is being done on a regular basis. No payment is released to the contractor after the samples fail the quality test and the report is sent to MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal for further action.”MC fails to blacklist erring contractorsDespite tall claims made by the MC officials regarding strict action being taken against contractors, none of them has been blacklisted by the civic body lately. The MC has however stalled the pending payments.Recently 7 out of 8 road samples of RMC roads collected from Balbir Enclave in the Haibowal area failed the quality test.Earlier seven samples collected from Amantran Colony, Guru Vihar, Chander Nagar, Bal Singh Nagar Road, Ashok Nagar, Daba Road and a road near GNE College (towards Dugri) failed the test. Besides, the samples collected from a stretch near RK Road, Circular Road near Daresi Ground and Baba Mukand Singh Nagar had also failed the test. Road construction projects likely to begin from September 15Mayor Balkar Sandhu conducted a meeting with the officials of the department of bridges and roads of the MC regarding development works on Tuesday. Sandhu said that if the weather conditions remain favourable, the road construction works would begin from September 15.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||CAG: Fadnavis government’s pet project Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan in Maharashtra failed after spending over ₹9K crore||The Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report tabled in the state legislature on Tuesday slammed the previous Fadnavis government for its failure in implementation of Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan (JSA) envisaged to make villages in Maharashtra drought-free. Besides the deficiencies in planning and lack of provision of adequate funds for maintenance of the works, JSA failed to achieve water neutrality in drought-prone villages and increase the ground water level as intended, the report has stated. The report on the general, social sectors and public undertaking for the financial year ended on March 31, 2019 and tabled in the Legislative Assembly pointed out that even after spending ₹9,634 crore, the Abhiyan had little impact. “The objective of the Abhiyan was to harvest maximum rainwater and arrest maximum runoff. However, it was observed that in 120 villages under test check, the storage planned was less than the estimated runoff by 1.64 lakh thousand cubic meter (TCM). Shortfall in creation of storage vis-à-vis planned storage (was observed) in 83 out of 120 selected villages, the storage created was not sufficient to meet the water requirement for drinking and cultivation to the extent of 61,045 TCM,” stated the report. CAG further observed that “in 37 out of 83 villages, the shortfall in meeting the water requirement was due to less storage created than planned. Further, in 25 of these 37 villages, the shortfall in creation of storage vis-à-vis planned storage was more than 20%. Consequently, in 17 of these 83 villages, water tankers were deployed for meeting the water requirement of the villages”. The report said: “One of the main objectives of the Abhiyan was to increase the level, but audit compared groundwater level in 58 selected villages for which the data on groundwater level pre- and post-implementation of the Abhiyan was assessed. For the purpose of comparison, the year in which rainfall post implementation of Abhiyan was more than the rainfall before implementation of the Abhiyan was taken into consideration.” In another CAG report on state finances for the same year, the auditor has also slammed the government for delay in implementation of irrigation projects. It has stated that out of 345 ongoing irrigation projects, 211 were under execution for more than 15 years, while remaining 69 were incomplete for more than 30 years. After spending ₹92,010 crore, the projects could not achieve the estimated objective and delays resulted in the cost escalation. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the objective could not be achieved as the incumbent government scrapped the Abhiyan. “The JSA was planned to be implemented for 10 years. Had it been continued, the objective would have been achieved. The strictures in the report are related to a few works under the scheme and not about the entire JSA. Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court had appointed an expert committee to study the scheme, and the report submitted by it had louded it. It has in details said how the JSA helped in rising the water level in Marathwada and other drought prone areas of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cag-fadnavis-government-s-pet-project-jalyukt-shivar-abhiyaan-in-maharashtra-failed-after-spending-over-9k-crore/story-CTEEzwcsAGpITGJD49MjZJ.html

08-09-2020||City||Use of oximeter by multiple people can aid Covid spread: Balbir Sidhu to AAP||Chandigarh Rejecting the AAP’s announcement on use of oximeters in Punjab as a “political gimmick”, health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Tuesday warned of the massive potential of community spread of coronavirus due to repeat use of oximeters by multiple persons without proper sanitisation. Slamming AAP’s political theatrics in Punjab villages, Sidhu alleged that this could be the possible game-plan of (Delhi chief minister) Arvind Kejriwal’s party. He warned the people that the party was misleading them completely, just as it had done in Delhi, where the Covid situation was critical, with all the 11 districts of the national capital among the country’s 35 worst-affected districts. He said the AAP was promoting the oximeters as medicine or vaccine of Covid-19, while the fact was that it simply helps detect the oxygen level in a person’s body. “Perhaps their strategy is to promote the further spread of the pandemic in Punjab in order to persuade people to believe it to be a failure of the state government,” he said. The disinformation campaign, which seemed to be deliberately spread by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to further their petty political interests in Punjab, was highly dangerous, the minister claimed, adding that it could trigger a huge risk of infecting more people and perhaps even triggering a massive community spread in the rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/use-of-oximeter-by-multiple-people-can-aid-covid-spread-balbir-sidhu-to-aap/story-dk32RmgjmrarkgsSgETTiP.html

08-09-2020||Lucknow||CBI indicts 3 IPS, IAS officers for not acting on Unnao rape survivor’s complaints against MLA||The Uttar Pradesh government could take action against three women officers - two from the Indian Police Service (IPS) and one from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) - after the CBI indicted them for negligence in handling complaints of a minor’s rape in 2017 and her father’s murder the next year, said a senior government official familiar with the development. Former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 by a Delhi court in the rape case, the official said. Sengar, an MLA from Unnao’s Bangarmau assembly constituency, is serving the jail term.A four-time lawmaker, Sengar had an exceptional hold over the Unnao region before his sharp fall from grace right before the Supreme Court transferred the trial to the national capital. When it first appeared that he may be arrested, several MLAs had approached the state government claiming that he was being framed.A senior official said the CBI had recommended action, for negligence against IPS officers, Pushpanjali Devi and Neha Pandey, who were posted as superintendent of police (SP) in Unnao between June 2017 and April 2018, and IAS officer Aditi Singh, who was district magistrate of Unnao during the same period.The official said the CBI has also recommended action against another IPS officer, Ashtabhuja Singh, who was additional SP in Unnao during the same period and was later promoted to IPS cadre in July 2019. The CBI had submitted its recommendations to the state government in the second week of AugustThe agency, which had investigated and prosecuted the lawmaker after the intervention of the Allahabad High Court, said it had found the officers’ negligence in initiating action and registering FIR against Kuldeep Sengar, despite repeated complaints against him by the rape survivor’s father between June 2017 and April 2018.The girl’s father - she was a minor when she was raped - was attacked by the former MLA’s aides on April 3, 2018 and sent to jail after framing him in a false case. The girl’s father succumbed to the injuries sustained in the attack on April 9, 2018 as he was not provided proper treatment during the judicial custody, the official said.The state government started to take action against Sengar and his aides when the matter was highlighted by the media after the self-immolation bid by the rape survivor and women members of her family near the chief minister’s residence in Lucknow on April 8, 2018, and the death of the girl’s father. Sengar was finally arrested from Lucknow on April 14, 2018 after the state government handed over the case to CBI on April 12, 2018. The CBI charged Sengar and his aides in two cases; the minor’s rape and her father’s murder.Sengar was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 by a Delhi court in the rape case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cbi-indicts-3-ips-ias-officers-for-not-acting-on-unnao-rape-survivor-s-complaints-against-mla/story-O7HKlj5mWxziwixta9y6WP.html
08-09-2020||Pune||Teams deployed to oversee oxygen supply in Pune district||Following complaints of black marketing and artificial shortage of oxygen supply, Pune district administration on Tuesday ordered deployment of officials at the premises of manufacturers premises to to ensure its supply for treatment of patients continues unabated despite a sharp spike in demand.The decision comes a day after the state government reserved 80 per cent of the oxygen supply for medical use. With demand rising amid increasing number of Covid patients, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, said that the availability of oxygen is the next big challenge for the administration and hence, the authorities have deployed dedicated teams at the oxygen manufacturing units in the district to monitor and control its supply.Teams comprising food and drug administration officials, police personnel and excise officials will be stationed at manufacturing units. “They will control and monitor the supply of oxygen for medical purposes,” added Rao. He said that the administration is also exploring options of routing supply from Raigad district.“The state government has already given instructions that oxygen-producing units will allocate 80 per cent of the total produced oxygen towards medical purposes and if need be, this percentage can be increased,” said Rao.He added that besides deploying dedicated teams at the oxygen-producing units, two officials have been deployed as nodal officers who will control the supply of oxygen to the hospitals and curb black marketing as instances of artificial shortage were reported.On Monday, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh held a meeting with manufacturers and suppliers in which he asked them to reserve only 20 per cent supply for industries. The decision came days after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state government has decided that 50 per cent of the oxygen production in Maharashtra be reserved for medical use in view of the coronavirus pandemic. “Covid cases in Pune are rising and there is a growing demand for oxygen from hospitals for critical patients. To ensure adequate supply to them, I have asked manufacturers and suppliers to reserve 80 per cent oxygen supply for medical use,” Deshmukh had said. As on Sunday, Pune district’s progressive positive tally of Covid cases stood at 2,03,468 with 4,470 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/teams-deployed-to-oversee-oxygen-supply-in-pune-district/story-g0VNtNeSoqlGSgt2BjKskM.html
08-09-2020||Pune||PMC has abandoned contact tracing, allege Covid-19 positive patients||Covid-19 cases are rising in the city and the Pune Municipal Corporation seems to have abandoned contact tracing, allege Covid-19 positive patients who spoke to HT on the condition of anonymity.The patients allege that there has been no attempt from private agencies or the PMC health department to seek their contact details and trace them. The patients claim that they called up people who had been in contact with them and asked them to get their Covid tests conducted voluntarily as a precautionary measure. However, the civic administration refutes all charges. “We think our current contact tracing rate is satisfactory and we are going to increase it further in the coming days. We also have dedicated teams to trace patients with co-morbidities and senior citizens,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. According to Rao, there are 540 such teams in Pune city and 2,700 teams in rural areas to trace co-morbid patients and senior citizens. As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, the administration should ideally track down 15 contacts of any person who tests positive for Covid-19 . PMC’s contact tracing stands at 11.20 for every Covid positive person while for Pimpri-Chinchwad, it is 10 and 13 for rural areas, as of September 8.Shraddha Shinde , a housewife, said, “I tested positive for Covid-19 on August 29 and PMC doctors asked me to opt for home isolation. The administration did not take any details (names, phone numbers or addresses) of who I had met, or contacted over the past week. The PMC health department has, since then, not called me even once to check up about my health status or contacts.”Another 55-year-old woman lawyer, who is Covid-19 positive, lamented that the PMC was least interested in contact tracing. She said ,“The PMC health department staff ask questions like where are you staying , who is your care taker, who is your doctor and what is your address. All they do is sanitisation and that too after a lot of coaxing . They do not seek information for contact tracing. I tested positive on September 3 and the civic officials called me thrice seeking information about my residence- where I stay, if I have an independent staying arrangement or not. The officials came to visit me personally on the fifth day. First, they should trace all the people I had met. I must have come in contact with 15 people, but none of them have been traced by PMC till now. I contacted them and asked them to be alert about their health. If PMC conducts contact tracing properly, it can help in containing the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection.”Calls to PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar were unattended and a text message, which was delivered and read, went answered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-has-abandoned-contact-tracing-allege-covid-19-positive-patients/story-o43aHd7M0yH0g9DH3sitbP.html

Till all these issues are addressed, the struggle shall continue till those hiding behind the MC, Jammu Development Authority (JDA) and National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) are exposed,” they said.Referring to the recent communications and blame-game between municipal commissioner Avny Lavasa, JDA vice-chairperson Babila Rakwal and Jammu DC Sushma Chauhan, the Congress leaders said, “They strengthened the belief that there was a conspiracy to usurp the prime land of the historic temple in an illegal manner which got exposed and the same has been stopped, but not shelved completely. There is apprehension that the mode shall be changed for the exercise for which all those concerned must unite and come forward.”They asked the stakeholders to save the interests of the devotees and the historic temple. The signatories included Dharampal Sharma, Madan Lal Sharma, Raman Bhalla, Mula Ram, Ravinder Sharma, Jugal Kishore Sharma, Kanta Bhan and many others.Amid public outrage, L-G Manoj Sinha on Monday visited the ancient temple and offered prayers there.

I have directed Health Minister this morning that Doctor’s prescription shud not be asked for testing. Anyone can get himself tested,” Kejriwal said in his tweet. Delhi govt has increased testing multi-fold. I have directed Health Minister this morning that Doctor’s prescription shud not be asked for testing. Anyone can get himself tested.According to the high court order, people will need to carry Aadhaar card as Delhi address proof and fill a form as prescribed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for Covid-19 testing.The testing will be done on a trial basis and 2,000 tests would be allowed for the asymptomatic patients out of the total 14,000 RT-PCR tests conducted daily in the city, the court said.The ICMR form specifies the category of patient as per the testing guidelines.The high court noted there was a sharp increase in the number of cases in Delhi and asked private laboratories to allow 2000 Covid-19 tests per day for those who voluntarily wish to undertake it.The case was heard by a bench comprising justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, who observed that there is a sharp rise in cases of Covid-19 in Delhi between August 31 till date and the figures are “rather alarming”. It also directed the Delhi government to set up testing centres including closer to the prominent metro stations so that the commuters can easily get themselves tested.So far, a doctor’s prescription or symptoms was a prerequisite to get tested for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-prescription-needed-for-covid-19-testing-in-delhi-says-kejriwal/story-gSOP04x47aFwNlvCz5Ia3N.html

JD (U) leader K C Tyagi has done us a favour,” the LJP said in a statement. “In fact, the JD (U) has done us a favour. The party will only join hands with those who support its president Chirag Paswan’s agenda to make Bihar the leading state in the country,” it said.Tyagi made it clear that any party, which is a part of the NDA in the state, will have to accept chief minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership. “Even top BJP leadership, including Amit Shah and J P Nadda, have announced this,” he had said. His statement came after the LJP authorised party president Paswan to take a decision on whether the party would fight against Kumar’s JD(U) in the forthcoming assembly polls and decided to prepare a list of candidates for 143 constituencies. What has peeved the JD(U) is that the LJP leadership has continued to criticise Kumar on several fronts. “How can a party, which is a part of NDA, make a statement which is contrary to what NDA leaders have said. LJP’s comments will not affect JD-U in Bihar. However, it could affect the NDA alliance, especially of LJP with the BJP,” Tyagi said.Bihar has 243 assembly constituencies and elections in the state are due in October-November as the tenure of the current assembly will end on November 29.The JD (U) had on earlier occasions snubbed LJP following its national president assertion that his party was ready to contest on all 243 assembly seats and his demand for a common minimum programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ljp-hits-back-at-jd-u/story-nlLZ3liK78PoVXhQzD2SRI.html
08-09-2020||City||Tej Pratap likely to contest from Hasanpur||PATNARJD chief Lalu Prasad ‘s elder son and sitting MLA from Mahua, Tej Pratap Yadav, is said to be scouting for a new constituency, which could likely be Hasanpur in Samastipur district, where the 32-year-old leader held a road show on Monday.Tej Pratap posted pictures of his road show on his official Twitter handle on Tuesday, with captions thanking the people of the constituency for showing great support. Sources said the former health minister is not very keen to contest from Mahua this time amid speculation that his estranged wife Aishwariya Rai could be fielded by JD(U). Tej had won the Mahua seat in Vaishali district in 2015 assembly polls.“Tej Pratap, in all probability, will contest from Hasanpur instead of Mahua. There have been ground reports about the poll mood there,” said a senior RJD MLA, wishing not to be quoted. Tej Pratap had filed a divorce petition from his wife Aishwariya in November 2018 and the matter is in court. The relationship between RJD’s first family and Aishwariya’s family later turned bitter. Rai’s father, Chandrika Rai, has already given hints that his daughter will contest against Tej Pratap from any seat he contests. Chandrika has left the RJD and is now with JD(U), which is likely to field him from Parsa seat in Saran district, which he currently represents. Hasanpur has a sizeable Yadav and Muslim electorate, the traditional vote bank of the RJD, and has been a party stronghold since 90s. The seat was won by RJD in 2005 and October 2015 polls, while JD(U) won the seat in 2010 and May 2015 polls. RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh, for the record, said the party had not taken any decision on official nominees from seats as yet. “ We are working on all 243 constituencies and candidates list will be finalised later.” Tej Pratap refused to comment when reached on phone. Meanwhile, JD(U) state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said it indicated that people of Mahua were not happy with their MLA. “Tej Pratap has realized the prospect of losing from Mahua. This is why, he is looking for a new constituency. But that would not help as he would lose from any seat he contests because the poll mood is not in favour of the RJD,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tej-pratap-likely-to-contest-from-hasanpur/story-JOF89Hxsybh170jF4AFzVK.html
08-09-2020||City||JMM eyes 7-12 seats to contest in Bihar under GA, Cong says no clue||PATNAThe Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which leads the ruling alliance also consisting of Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal in the neighbouring state, is looking to fill up the void following the departure of Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) in Bihar’s Grand Alliance (GA). HAM-S leader and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi opted out of GA on August 20 citing and later cast his lot with the NDA. A delegation of JMM leaders is likely to meet RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is serving his jail sentence in Ranchi, next week for formal talks on the alliance. The RJD and Congress are already having a hard time in accommodating left parties, apart from allocating seats to allies like the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Vikassheel Insan party (VIP) ahead of the Bihar assembly polls, due in October-November. Headed by former Jharkhand CM Shibu Soren, the JMM hopes to field its candidates in seven to 12 constituencies with significant presence of tribals. The state’s public health and engineering department (PHED) minister Mithilesh Thakur has been authorised to hold formal talks with the RJD chief next week, said JMM spokesman Manoj Kumar alias Bablu Pandey. The Congress, however, pleaded its ignorance about the development, saying the RJD could be planning to spare seats from its own quota. “Right now, the Congress does not have any proposal from JMM,” said Bihar Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha. However, the JMM is expecting ‘reasonable’ returns from the RJD for its ‘generous’ gesture in Jharkhand. JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said it was not unreasonable as RJD was given seven seats to contest and the lone legislator was allotted berth in the cabinet. In 2015, JMM leader Hemant Soren, who is now Jharkhand CM, was left high and dry when his plans to contest the Bihar polls under the GA was turned down by Prasad and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. Soren had visited Patna and met GA leaders and reportedly agreed to limit his party’s fight on three seats, which was not allocated to any of the allies till then. Later, the three undecided seats were shared equally among the GA constituents, RJD, JD(U) and the Congress. Left out, the JMM fielded its candidates on 32 constituencies, mostly in areas bordering Jharkhand. However, it did not fare well and lost security deposits, polling only about 2% votes in the constituencies it had contested. Till 2015, the JMM had one legislator in Bihar assembly. Sources in the JMM said they had identified seats in Jamui, Banka, Purnia, Katihar, Kisanganj, West Champaran and Kaimur districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jmm-eyes-7-12-seats-to-contest-in-bihar-under-ga-cong-says-no-clue/story-xYwQXZNeNyIXAsvlpOA45N.html

Earlier, two B2V programmes were held in June and November last year.For the past two weeks, Sinha has been visiting various districts meeting delegations of people and students as part of his public outreach programme.MP from South Kashmir and senior NC leader, Hasnain Masoodi, said B2V is only a slogan to portray it as an alternative to traditional politics.“We have seen that B2V programmes have not delivered at the ground level. If we go from place to place there is no imprint at all. We find people of marginalised sections have same problems. Affordable housing is not implemented at all and safe drinking water is available for less than 40 percent of the population,” Masoodi said.“People have become increasingly conscious of the absence of a political system. The whole exercise is to marginalise the political workers at the grassroots level. It is bureaucracy trying to create an alternative parallel to the conventional politics, but they are not able to do it,” he said.The third phase of B2V programme, scheduled in two steps from September 10 to 20 as pre-B2V and October 2 to 20, would be held at a time when the daily number of Covid-19 cases has been showing a sharp spike in the UT.Since September 3, the number of daily infections has been hovering above 1,000, a new trend since the pandemic began. On September 8, as many as 1,355 persons tested positive in the highest single-day spike in J&K so far. The total number of positive cases has reached 45,925 till September 8,of which 32,722 are in Kashmir and 13,203 in Jammu. Not only that, the region has recorded 815 deaths – 112 of them in first eight days of September, 326 in August and 276 in July.Notwithstanding the grim Covid-19 statistics, information director Syed Sehrish Asgar chaired a preparatory meeting of her officers to discuss the arrangements for the conduct of the third phase of B2V programme. It was decided in the meeting that to raise awareness, cultural officers of both the divisions of Kashmir and Jammu shall organise Nukad Nataks at block, district, divisional and UT levels by strictly adhering to SoPs and Covid-19 guidelines, a government spokesman said.Earlier on September 5, Rohit Kansal, principal secretary of power development and information departments, who is also government spokesperson, had claimed in a press conference that the programme has “generated huge interest” among people and the administration has decided another version of the programme in the form of B2V-III.“We are confident that the entire next month will be a festival of public grievance redressal, public service delivery and development at the panchayat level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/political-workers-in-valley-second-guess-impact-of-back-to-village-programme/story-y5xT3JB6dB6Yt06ZHbD1SK.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||Cat goes missing at Delhi airport, reunited with pet parent after four days of hectic search||Few people, or for that matter animals, have been able to dodge the eagle-eyed security personnel at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and roam about at will. But that’s exactly what eight-month-old Nala, a cat who was put on an Air India flight from Bengaluru, did on reaching Delhi on September 1. She deftly slipped out of the carrier, kept in the aircraft’s cargo belly, and disappeared into the cavernous expanse of the airport, leaving her pet parent Astha Shah worried and the Delhi airport staff flustered.And while Nala went about her adventure, airport personnel searched high and low for her, finally locating her on Friday, four days after she went awol, and reuniting her with a relived and happy Shah. Wildlife SOS, a Delhi-based non-profit organisation that works for rehabilitation and rescue of wildlife, helped Shah relocate Nala to Delhi. An NGO official said Shah was travelling with her two cats to Delhi from Bengaluru on the Air India flight.“Both cats were being transported in certified pet carriers. When the plane landed in Delhi, the passenger was informed that one of the cats went missing from her carrier during transit at the IGI Airport. Our enquiries revealed that the pet carrier in which Nala was put had come undone in the aircraft’s cargo compartment.The cat had slipped out and gotten lost on the vast Delhi airport premises,” a spokesperson for the Wildlife SOS said. When Shah was informed about Nala going missing, she cancelled her onward journey to Ahmedabad and stayed back in Delhi to help find Nala. “The airport authorities immediately launched a search for the missing feline. Wildlife SOS also assisted with the search operation by placing food baits at several locations inside the airport to lure Nala out. After four days of tracking the cat, she was finally located in the airport’s cargo hold area,” the spokesperson said.As Nala looked terrified and hungry, it took the Wildlife SOS team hours to ease her out from the cargo facility before being reunited with Shah, the spokesperson said.Shah, who lives in Bengaluru, said the cats are her family and the incident had left her in tears. “House cats struggle to survive on their own for long. I thank Wildlife SOS for reuniting my beloved Nala with me. The past few days have been extremely stressful, but I received a lot of support from the animal community, the Air India staff, airport authorities and the airport operator. This incident showed me that compassion is not dead and people will still go the extra mile to help a stranger desperately searching for her beloved pet,” Shah told Wildlife SOS.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder & CEO, Wildlife SOS, said they are glad they could help find the missing feline and reunite her with her family.Air India also said the airline is happy that Nala is now safe in the warm embrace of her pet parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cat-goes-missing-at-delhi-airport-reunited-with-pet-parent-after-four-days-of-hectic-search/story-lQ1DvNNTIbVSr8L9N70C9K.html

08-09-2020||City||Himachal assembly monsoon session: Corona crisis debate continues on Day 2||Fireworks continued on the second day of Himachal assembly’s monsoon session as the ruling BJP and the opposition countered each other on the issues of corona crisis and corruption.The adjournment motion moved by the opposition Congress was also debated on Tuesday.Opening the deliberations, BJP legislator from Bilaspur, Subhash Thakur, said the state government had done a commendable job in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. He said 39,200 packets of ration and 55,000 masks were distributed, while community kitchens were organised at six places in Bilaspur during the lockdown.He said the 25 quarantine centres set up in Bilaspur district were well-equipped with all the facilities.Thakur also raised the case of suicide by young man in Bilaspur who had released a video holding a former MLA responsible for his death. He demanded an inquiry from the chief minister so that the victim’s family could get justice.Countering Thakur’s claims, the opposition’s Kinnaur legislator Jagat Singh Negi alleged that during the lockdown, the government acted as if there was an emergency in the state. “This would be the first government to have failed on all fronts and messed up things during pandemic,” he rebutted.He said the lockdown was imposed when the disease had already spread. On the other hand, Negi said, the CM took a decision that added to the people’s sufferings while sitting at his home.Responding to Negi’s remarks, CM Jai Ram Thakur said the words the opposition member was using will not be tolerated. “Had there been a Congress government today, the country and the state would have been ruined,” he said.The angered chief minister told the opposition members to choose their words wisely. “Whenever he (Negi) wants, he jumps up to speak,” he said.On this, the opposition members started sloganeering.Meanwhile, the CM said the lockdown was announced in the entire country as per the Disaster Management Act, and that the opposition should not vitiate the atmosphere of the house using inappropriate terminology.Negi also raised the issue of appointment of non-Himachali candidates in Class-III and Class-IV jobs in government departments, accusing the ruling party of betraying the youth of Himachal in the guise of Covid-19 pandemic.The Kinnaur legislator also hit out at the CM for participating in a religious event where, he alleged, Covid norms were thrown to the wind. “However, no case was registered against the chief minister,” said Negi asking if the state head was above the law.Forest minister Rakesh Pathania, who participated in the discussions next, counted the works of the BJP government to tackle the corona crisis. He said in the previous Congress regime, leaders only took rounds of court. During the pandemic, the BJP distributed masks and fed the people.“What did Congress do?” he asked adding that the opposition was not serious about the discussion and only wanted to take political advantage.Congress legislator Nand Lal demanded white paper on the Covid-19 Response Fund received by the state government through donations.He said there were no ventilators in the hospital in his constituency in Rampur, but the CM didn’t want to hear anything. The Covid care centres were in poor shape and there was no proper arrangement of food, he argued.Congress stages walkoutMeanwhile, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri led a walkout from the assembly stating that the ruling party was trying to throttle the opposition’s voice, after the latter were restrained from debating on the Covid crisis issue by assembly speaker Vipin Singh Parmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-assembly-monsoon-session-corona-crisis-debate-continues-on-day-2/story-gismWImaMQpAKoFIFTtsaJ.html

HPCC president Kuldeep Singh Rathore said instead of providing relief to people during the pandemic, the state government hiked bus fares, petrol and diesel rates and its ministers were involved in corruption in purchase of sanitisers, health equipments and ventilators. “Their ministers are busy in land deals which shows the state government’s insensitivity towards public issues,” he added. “Fake degrees are being sold in the state and jobs are given to outsiders whereas unemployed youth of Himachal are still waiting for creation of two crore jobs per year as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The administration has totally failed, employees are being transferred on political affiliations and some officers are behaving as if they are political agents of the BJP,” Rathore said.“The Congress is keeping strict vigil on all these issues and we will not allow the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to sell properties of our state,” he added.Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the Congress workers are fighting outside the assembly against the anti-people policies of the government while the party MLAs are fighting inside for the same cause. “This fight will continue until the present state government is booted out of power in 2022,” he added.Later, a deputation led by Rathore also submitted a memorandum to the CM in his chamber in Vidhan Sabha regarding the issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-congress-protests-against-corruption-increasing-unemployment/story-Trp8Rex6pymBhsTLwObziK.html

08-09-2020||Pune||Jumbo rescue: new mgmt at Pune’s COEP; video conference facility for patients||The Pune district administration on Monday roped in ‘Medbros,’ an agency looking after Annasaheb Magar jumbo facility, to improve the services at the College of Engineering, Pune (COEP) facility.The decision was taken on Monday after a series of complaints about its mismanagement and death of critical patients.“During the meeting, we decided that now the functioning g of COEP jumbo facility will be handed over to Medbros. The agency is also handling the operations at Annasaheb Magar facility,” said Rao.“They are doing a good job at Pimpri-Chinchwad. So, they will take the charge now, today (on Monday) the formal work order is given to them,” said Rao.The steering committee meeting was attended by Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioners, Sassoon Hospital dean and all other senior officials.Meanwhile, Lifeline Services which was served a notice by the district administration said it has opted out from the management of the COEP facility given the “political pressure” and interference of multiple agencies.Sujit Patkar, director, Lifeline, said, “There is a lot of political pressure and interference. For the safety of our doctors, we had deployed bouncers as they are working under tremendous pressure. Some doctors left the facility due to the same reason and we didn’t want to compromise on the services. Our staff was also reduced, so before anything adverse happens we have already taken the steps to leave.”Last week, two patients died in the absence of immediate treatment at the jumbo facility. This was followed by a journalist Pandurang Raykar’s death as he could not get cardiac ambulance in time to shift from facility to private hospital. Following these incidents, patients and their relatives complained about lack of coordination, shortage of staff and medicines and unruly behaviour of bouncers, who refused relatives to meet their patients.Apart from replacing the agency, other major changes planned at the COEP jumbo facility include putting in place a robust communication system between the treating doctors and the relatives of the patients. “We are going to start it on two channels, one would be proactively giving phone calls to the relatives of the patient. Second is that if a relative of the patient comes to the facility, he/she can have video interaction with the patient through the audio-visual system. This system will start functioning from Tuesday here,” said Rao.During the meeting, it was also decided to change treatment protocol, with the decision to rope in expert doctors from private hospitals of Pune. “We are ready to pay them appropriate fees as they will be guiding and treating critical patients. they will provide guidance related to the treatment protocol of critical patients,” said Rao.While the COEP facility was made functional on August 23, the Annasaheb Magar facility started functioning a week later. Both facilities have a capacity of 800 beds each.Inquiry report of journalist’s death to be submitted todayThe inquiry report of into the death of journalist Pandurang Raykar is likely to be submitted by Tuesday by the Sassoon Hospital doctors team. Last week deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had ordered to do a detailed enquiry about the facility after many issues were raised by the relative of the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/jumbo-rescue-new-mgmt-at-pune-s-coep-video-conference-facility-for-patients/story-yj0VOLWD3w6eEBQqO3vmRK.html
08-09-2020||City||Uttarakhand BJP MLA rape case: Survivor says being pressured for compromise||A rape survivor has written to the Dehradun Police alleging that the investigation officer (IO) in the case was pressuring her for a compromise after she had filed a complaint against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from Uttarakhand’s Dwarahat constituency Mahesh Negi and his wife Rita.Last week, police had booked Negi and Rita for rape and criminal intimidation on the basis of the rape survivor’s complaint.Now, Dehradun Police authorities have handed over the investigation to the Special Investigation Squad (SIS) after the rape survivor filed her latest complaint.The rape survivor’s lawyer SP Singh submitted the application to Arun Mohan Joshi, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Dehradun, on Monday evening, alleging IO Neema Rawat, a sub-inspector (S-I) of Nehru Colony police station, was pressuring the complainant to go for a compromise.Earlier on Saturday night, Nehru Colony police station authorities had booked lawmaker Negi and Rita at the direction of a sessions court order.The woman had filed a petition in the court demanding a case be registered by police on the basis of her complaint in which she had accused legislator Negi of raping her for the past two years and also fathering a child. She had also accused Rita of framing her in a false case after threatening her to keep mum about the alleged crime.SSP Joshi said police have received the rape survivor’s latest complaint. “We had received the application on Monday in which she had requested us to change the IO. We accepted the demand and immediately handed over the investigation to the SIS,” said the police official.“Now, the case will be probed by the SIS while examining all the facts and evidence,” he added.Lawyer Singh said, “We had demanded that the IO be changed because she was pressuring her to go for a compromise with MLA (member of the Uttarakhand legislative assembly) Negi.”He said: “In a separate case, the woman was booked for allegedly blackmailing and extorting ₹5 crore from Negi, on the basis of a complaint by Rita. S-I Rawat had taken her (the rape survivor) to Nehru Colony police station on the pretext of filling a form for home quarantine for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In the police station, she asked my client to settle the case by talking to MLA Negi. She didn’t expect a fair probe in the rape case after what the IO told her.”Rita also submitted an application to the SSP on Monday night, accusing the rape survivor of threatening an eyewitness in the extortion case.Negi’s advocate Sanjiv Kaushik said, “We have given the application to police, requesting for a probe. The woman had tried to threaten an eyewitness in the extortion and blackmailing case, who was also her room-mate.”He added: “The eyewitness had recorded her statement before the police and in court against her (the rape survivor) in the extortion case following which she received threat calls on her mobile phone on Sunday and Monday. She was threatened with dire consequences, if she didn’t withdraw her statement.”SSP Joshi said, “The application has been taken into consideration in the ongoing probe of the extortion case.”The alleged crime had surfaced in August when Rita had lodged a complaint against the rape survivor accusing her of blackmailing and trying to extort ₹5 crore from her lawmaker husband by threatening to frame him in a false case.Initially, police had booked the rape survivor on the basis of Rita’s complaint.Later, the rape survivor filed a counter case against MLA Negi for raping her for two years and also fathering a child.She has also been demanding a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test of Negi and her daughter in a bid to prove her allegations. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-rape-case-survivor-says-being-pressured-for-compromise/story-mtAOa6tlXUDCExsw3loF1N.html

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana’s comments amounted to insult of police: Devendra Fadnavis||Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday condemned the remarks made by actress Kangana Ranaut about the Mumbai Police in the context of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, which he said amounted to “insult” of the police force.Ranaut had recently said that she feared Mumbai Police more than the “movie mafia”, and would prefer security either from Himachal Pradesh or the Centre.Speaking on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, the Leader of Opposition said he knew the capacity of the Mumbai Police since had served as chief minister of the state for five years.“But, the police can come under political pressure,” he said.Fadnavis also said since handling of Rajput death case was “wrong”, the probe was entrusted to the CBI.“What had been happening? 40 days of inquest? This was a perfect case of ‘aa bail mujhe maar’ (inviting trouble),” he said referring to the probe of the case by Mumbai Police.Seeking to dismiss allegations raised by the Shiv Sena and other ruling parties the the BJP’s demand for a CBI probe had demoralised the police, Fadnavis said many legislators had passed adverse remarks against the police at different points of time.“Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, during a rally in Kalyan, had said the police were capable of only washing utensils,” he said.Ranaut’s recent remark comparing Mumbai to Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) has drawn ire of the ruling Shiv Sena whose leaders are targeting the BJP for defending her.Fadnavis further said any reference to the CM without respect was wrong.“Even though we are in opposition, but Uddhavji is our chief minister,” the senior BJP leader said.Citing the arrest of a Marathi news channel reporter over a report on partial resumption of train services during the initial phase of lockdown, Fadnavis said the state government wanted to stifle the voice of journalists who are critical of its functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-s-comments-amounted-to-insult-of-police-devendra-fadnavis/story-osP6G1lDHhm4s1z3x30RtO.html
08-09-2020||Pune||Tulshibaug app, social media pages on the way: Secretary of shop owners assn||It is not business as usual at the city’s small business retail hub, Tulshibaug market, one of the oldest markets in the city. Covid-19 norms in places the shops and registered hawkers, 800 in all, are open for business. Except, the mode of business, has undergone a drastic change. Nitin Pandit, secretary, Tulshibaug market shop owners association speaks to Dheeraj Bengrut about the new normal for Tulshibaug traders. What is the day-today business operations like, after lockdown? When the market first started in the first week on June, there were restrictions - P1 and P2 (odd-even) - due to which, only a few shops used to open daily. Then, after August 5, all the shops opened, every day. August was the festive season, but due to fear of infection, very few people turned up at the market. Only 25 per cent of business is happening. Public is shopping only for essentials and clothes, if needed. General shopping which used to happen earlier is not taking place. Last month, traders decided to boycott ‘Made in China’ goods. How is that panning out? We are all firm on boycotting Chinese goods; the reason is obvious, the India-China border issue. This will not happen overnight. It is a movement and it has begun. To substitute the Chinese products, some of our traders are now manufacturing their own goods with the help of big manufacturers in Ulhasnagar and Gujarat. What are the guidelines or instructions given by the association to shop owners and hawkers for safety? There are already guidelines issued by the PMC and the state government, which we have made compulsory for all traders. Face masks are compulsory; sanitisers in every shop; thermal checking of customers when they come inside the shop. Now, some have also kept oxymeters to check oxygen levels. Social distancing needs to be maintained, so we have instructed to all the shop owners and hawkers not to allow crowding. We request and appeal to citizens to please not bring children and senior citizens to the market. How do you plan to increase business at the market? Due to the Covid-19 pandemic most of our regular customers and public have turned to online shopping. So, we are also now getting into it. Some of our traders have already started online business. We are now going to make our own mobile application in which details of all the shop owners, their products and rates will be given. We will not use other private commercial shopping apps. People can choose and book their order online and we will give home delivery to the customer. Online platform of shopping will now remain constant and also increase in coming days, and we will also do it for our business development. All social media platforms - WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram – will have a Tulshibaug market page soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tulshibaug-app-social-media-pages-on-the-way-secretary-of-shop-owners-assn/story-liW9Ch2rsXaCnPxraCxtiP.html

Most of these migrant workers lost their jobs and savings during the lockdown. The plan is to involve around 3,000 families of migrant workers with the fisheries sector in these districts. We provide training and technological help to these workers. They can use this to set up successful businesses,” said NBFGR director Kuldeep K Lal.Also read: Pradhan seeks special trains for migrant workers to return to places of workAfter poultry, fisheries is the second fastest growing meat industry in the country, according to experts and migrants could make the most of this upward trend.NBFGR experts will provide training to cultivate a variety of fresh water fish and crustaceans like prawns and crabs. “Easy availability of space and fresh water in the area will make it easier for migrant workers to start their business. We will also take help of the district administration to provide help in starting the business or taking loans from banks for the same,” said the director.The districts that will benefit through the initiative include Ballia, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Mau, Sonbhadra, Gonda, Basti, Jaunpur and Azamgarh.Dharmendra Verma, a migrant worker in Gorakhapur, is looking forward to the programme. “Around 50 people in my village have returned from different states.

08-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid tests cross 45,000-mark; highest single-day spike in cases in 76 days||The Delhi government administered a record 45,797 tests for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a day and the city registered 3,609 new infections—the highest single-day spike in 76 days— according to a government bulletin on Tuesday.The boost in numbers comes after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had, on August 26, announced that testing in the city would be doubled to 40,000 a day with the city seeing a resurgence of cases since mid-August. On Tuesday, the Delhi government achieved its target of administering 40,000 tests in a single day. The gradual increase in testing had begun from August 31. As testing increased, 3,609 new cases were reported in Delhi on Tuesday—the highest single-day case count since June 24, or 76 days—in keeping with the trend of the resurgence of daily infections in the city. There were 3,788 new cases on June 24. Also Read: No. of containment zones in Delhi over 1,000 likely to increase with more testing: OfficialsThe total number of cases in the city is 197,135, according to Tuesday’s health bulletin. The positivity rate stood at 10.66% as on Tuesday. The death toll from Covid-19, meanwhile, touched 4,618, with 19 new deaths lodged on Tuesday. As many as 170,140 people have recovered from the disease so far.With Covid-19 cases on the rise, the Delhi government has also launched an intensive awareness campaign wherein pre-recorded audio messages are being sent to Delhi residents through phone calls and the radio. The government aims to call at least 1 crore phone numbers of Delhi residents in the next few days. Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine latest developments: Russia releases Sputnik V, India candidate in final phaseThe message in all medium of communication is focused on ‘testing’. In his pre-recorded messages, Kejriwal is heard reiterating what he said in his press conference on Saturday (September 5). “Some people are not getting tested. They say, nowadays everyone is recovering on their own, so there is no need to get tested. No, please do not do this. Please go and get tested. Please also do wear masks when you step out and follow physical distancing,” the chief minister had said.Kejriwal had also attributed the spike in Covid-19 cases to increased testing in the city.“From 18,000-20,000 tests per day, we are now conducting around 40,000 tests. So, more people are getting identified, treated and isolated to prevent them from spreading the infection to others. Today, if I decrease the number of tests, the number of daily cases will also come down and everyone will be happy. The only way to defeat Covid-19 is aggressive testing. There is nothing to be scared of, but there should be no scope for complacency,” he had said.On September 2, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in a meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, had discussed the rising infections in Delhi. “Some probable reasons for the increase in positivity rate in Delhi could be lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, the impact of festivals in August, late testing, cross-infection, the return of migrants and unlock measures,” a DDMA official, who did not wish to be identified, said.Testing was ramped up in the city by opening camps in all interstate bus terminals (ISBTs), railway stations, construction sites, weekly markets and some mohalla clinics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-tests-cross-45-000-mark-highest-single-day-spike-in-cases-in-76-days/story-iNHjRFabjx8Qk0zHKhDIyI.html
08-09-2020||Pune||Unlock Pune:Shops open at Tulsibaug, but no customers||Starting with the “new normal” guidelines, all market places in the city have resumed backed operations. One of the oldest, and a bell-whether for small business operations in the city - Tulshibaug market – has 800 shop owners and registered hawkers lining Bajirao road, in the heart of the city. The market first opened on June 1 under the odd-even rule, but since has gradually resumed operations in full. Haribhau Kavare, owner of Kavare ice-creams, a landmark for shoppers visiting the area, said, “Traders, shop-owners and hawkers in the market are still suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Business has dropped drastically, for us it has almost gone down by 90 per cent. Earlier, daily we used to earn between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000. Now it is Rs 1,000. We had 10 workers at our shop, but as there are no customers, we only have two.” Jewellery, cosmetics, clothes, children’s wear and household items are the Tulshibaug staples. The market is closed on Monday. Jewellery shop owner, Jeetendra Ambasankar, said, “Since the market has opened, there are no customers, as such. We only allow one person in the shop at a time to maintain social distancing. We are focusing on the online trading option, as we have our customer data and send them our items on WhatsApp. We do delivery as well. There is hardly 25 per cent of business happening, as compared to before the lockdown.” Pravin Patil, owner of a women’s clothes shop, said, “Tulshibaug is famous for a variety of products available at a cheap rate. So people, especially women, used to come from far here for shopping. All this has stopped now. Only people from the area come for shopping and that too, for basic items. The market is open, but the business has not grown. There are very few customers, even on weekends.” HT visited the market on a Sunday and Patil’s testimony to “not much crowd”, bears witness. The once-was-no-space-to-walk era in Tulshibaug seems long gone . Dhanashree Khole, 30, a resident of Sadashiv peth, out on a Sunday, said, “I have never seen Tulshibaug market so empty. It is all due to Covid-19. Even we were afraid to come to the market, but as we had to purchase clothes for my son I had to visit the market, taking all the safety precautions.” Another shopper, Jeetendra Bhagwat, aged 42 came in from Swargate. He said, “As we get many varieties of household products and that too, at an affordable price, I always prefer to come to Tulshibaug for shopping.” Both the shoppers wore face masks and were ensuring a social distance while in the market. Tulshibaug market – Covid rules 300 shop owners, 300 registered hawkers claimed to have suffered a loss of Rs 40 crore during lockdown from April to June Five entrances to the market: from Bajirao road, Laxmi road and from the Mahatma Phule mandai No entry to customers not wearing face masks All shop owners and workers wear face masks Each shop owner has sanitisers, thermal checking A few shops also have oximeters What HT saw… HT visited Tulshibaug on Sunday afternoon from 12 noon till 2 pm. Public coming to the market, shop owners and workers, were all wearing face masks; some of them also sported gloves. While talking to customers workers kept a proper social distance and in most of the shops, customers were allowed to enter only one at a time. In some shops, thermal checking of customers was undertaken before they entered. Overall, social distance was maintained and safety precautionary measures were in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unlock-pune-shops-open-at-tulsibaug-but-no-customers/story-j3VNpROVnhZlLsMt6gyyKN.html
08-09-2020||Pune||3-member committee formed to probe Bhosari MSEDCL transformer blast||Indrayaninagar in Bhosari, on Monday, resembled a crime scene, with the yellow ticker tape surrounding the site where the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) transformer blew up on Saturday, killing two persons. A team of MSEDCL and police officials inspected the site, where a five-month-old infant Shivani Kakade, and her maternal grandmother, Sharda Kotwal, died in the explosion. The mother of the infant, Harshada Kakde, was also seriously injured in the incident and is currently under treatment at the Sassoon General hospital. For all the trappings of a crime scene at the site, the fact is, on Monday, no FIR had been registered as yet. Rajendra Kunte, senior police inspector, MIDC, Bhosari, said, “The treatment of the mother is still going on at Sassoon hospital. No FIR has been registered in the case till now.” The police will wait for the MSEDCL report to establish what the cause of the transformer explosion was. A junior MSEDCL team of eight officials did a basic inquiry and then later in the day, the three-member committee formed to investigate the blast, came on site. Photographs of the blast debris were taken as well. When asked for early details of the inquiry, the officials said, “Until the investigation is over, we cannot speak.” However, neighbours of the deceased were not impressed. “We had seen sparks emerging from the transformer and complained to MSEDCL, but they took it lightly. After the blast on Saturday, officials from MSEDCL came to repair the transformer, but we did not allow them. Now our demand is for them to remove this transformer,” said Aruna Retwade, a neighbour of the Kakde-Kotwal family. “The death of our neighbours has only happened because of negligence of MSEDCL,” alleged Madanlal Chaudhari, who runs a grocery shop in the Rajwada, Indryaninagar, Bhosari . The transformer is located 10 feet from the society. Harshada Kakade was giving bath to her 5-month old daughter Shivani at a small courtyard in front of the house when the incident happened and hot liquid from a transformer spell on them and grandmother Sharada Kotwal.Statistics provided by MSEDCL shows that 19 persons were electrocuted in 2017-18 due to accident involving MSEDCL equipment. In 2018-19 that number as 21. PCMC mayor Dhore visits family; calls meeting today On Monday, the mayor of Pimpri-Chinchwad, Usha Dhore, visited the family of the deceased at Charoli, Mulshi, where the family is currently staying after the incident. “Such incidents should not happen in the future. I have called a meeting with the officials of MSEDCL and civic body on Tuesday,” said Dhore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/3-member-committee-formed-to-probe-bhosari-msedcl-transformer-blast/story-9M7m3wu4Z10xmBlQyOWIoJ.html
08-09-2020||Pune||Pune first district in India to cross 2 lakh Covid-19 cases||Driven by a surge in Covid-19 cases in the last few days, Pune has become the first district in the country to record more than two lakh cases.As per data of the Maharashtra government’s health department, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Pune district reached 2,03,468 on Monday after 4,165 more people tested positive for the disease.Officials here said increased testing was one of the main reasons for the surge in cases in the district.Pune crossed the one lakh-mark on August 5 and in a month’s time, the cases have doubled in the district, according to official figures.Compared to Pune, Delhi reported 1,93,526 Covid-19 cases till Monday, while Mumbai recorded 1,57,410 cases.The Covid-19 positivity rate in Pune is around 22 per cent, Collector Rajesh Deshmukh told PTI on Tuesday.“Currently, Pune district is on top in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The reason behind thesurge in cases is the aggressive testing strategy adopted by the district administration,” he said.Not just recently, but Pune has been doing aggressive testing for the last two months and the number of cases is bound to increase, he said.“In fact, no other district is conducting tests the way Pune is doing,” he claimed.Effective contact-tracing, tracking of co-morbid people and isolation of patients have been possible due to the large number of tests, Deshmukh said.“Testing, tracking and tracing are the main factors behind the surge. Even the results of sero survey (conducted on nearly 1,500 people) found out that 50 per cent people had antibodies,” he said.Despite the number of Covid-19 cases being high, the recovery rate in Pune is encouraging as it is now about 78 per cent, he said.According to the district administration records, over 1.57 lakh patients have so far been discharged or have recovered from the disease.Till Monday, 4,651 deaths due to Covid-19 were reported in Pune as against 7,897 in Mumbai.Deshmukh said the fatality rate in Pune is around 2.3 per cent, which is better compared to Mumbai.“Our aim is to further bring down the fatality rate by detecting co-morbid patients at an early stage,” he said.District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar saidthe number of cases will further rise in the coming days.“From today, we are setting up camps in 65 villages where more than 15 cases have been reported. Rapid antigen tests will be conducted on a large population there and as a result, the number of cases will go up,” Pawar said.Deshmukh said besides aggressive testing, the administration is stressing on awareness, strict implementation of social distancing norms and use of masks.“Considering the rise in cases, there is an emphasis on strengthening healthcare facilities in Pune city and in the district, and medical teams have also been set up to screen people aged above 60 having co-morbid conditions,” he added.While the district administration has claimed that health care facilities have been strengthened, there have been complaints about unavailability of beds in hospitals and other medical aids.Two jumbo facilities in Pune city and neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad industrial area were opened last month.But, the functioning of the facility in Pune came under scanner after allegations of lapses and mismanagement there.Pune-based Congress leader and former MLC Mohan Joshi blamed the BJP-led Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the increase in number of Covid-19 cases in the city.“The BJP is in power in the PMC with a strength of 100 corporators. Besides, Girish Bapat of the BJP is a Lok Sabha member from Pune and five MLAs in the city are from the saffron party.

Naik, in his suicide note, had named a few persons, including a news channel’s editor, who allegedly did not pay his dues worth several crores of rupees, according to the deceased’s kin. Also Read: Mumbai civic body asks Kangana Ranaut to take corrective measures against illegalities in her Bandra officeReplying to the point raised by Shiv Sena legislators Pratap Sarnaik and Sunil Prabhu, Deshmukh told the Maharashtra legislative assembly on Tuesday that the Mumbai Police would be asked to probe into the claims made by Suman, the son of actor Shekhar Suman. Deshmukh said that Mumbai Police would look into Suman’s three-year-old statement.“Sena lawmakers Prabhu and Sarnaik had raised the issue about the revelation against Ranaut that she was on drugs. Suman was in a relationship with her and he had said that she used to force him to do drugs as well. Mumbai Police will look into the allegations,” Deshmukh said.He also made a statement in relation to the tweets by Ranaut, where she likened Mumbai with the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). He said that such a statement was unfortunate and is an insult to Mumbai and Maharashtra and its proud people. “Mumbai and Maharashtra have given Ranaut everything, but in return she has played with the sentiments of the people. At least, 106 people had laid their lives for a unified Maharashtra. Not only the ruling parties, but even the opposition BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) must also condemn her statement,” he said.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut warns ‘movie mafia’ against harming her: ‘Trust me it will hurt you even more’Earlier on Monday, Maharashtra assembly’s deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal directed Deshmukh to make a statement within 24 hours. Deshmukh made the statement in response to a letter written by Sena legislator Sarnaik seeking unanimous resolution must be passed by the assembly against Ranaut for her anti-Maharashtra rants on social media.State food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal and energy minister Nitin Raut have demanded a bid to expedite the probe in the Naik death case. They said that the interior designer and his mother had died by suicide three years ago while holding the editor of a news channel responsible for non-payment of their dues against the construction of the channel’s studio in Mumbai. “The case has been registered. Mumbai Police will be ordered to conduct a probe into it,” Deshmukh said.Ranaut is yet to react against Deshmukh’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-home-minister-announces-probe-into-the-adhyayan-suman-s-allegations-of-drug-abuse-against-kangana/story-2DJNt2uvirW7IVacjNpx0H.html

The state, however, submitted that while it can rationalise rates being charged by hospitals, it could not nationalise the private hospitals as sought by the petitioner. As per the notification private hospitals can recover only Rs 600 per PPE kit per day and can charge Rs 600 for a normal bed and Rs 1,200 for a bed in the ICU from patients admitted to the reserved beds. The notification does not apply to charges for treating patients admitted to the remaining 20% unregulated beds.Also read: Mumbai recorded 24% more deaths in the first seven months this yearA division bench of justice A A Sayed and justice S P Tavade, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Abhijeet Mangade, was informed that he had approached the high court after being presented with a bill of Rs 4 lakh for the treatment of his mother. Mangde told the court that of the bill, Rs 72,000 was charged for PPE kits and gloves used by the hospital while treating his mother over a period of six days. This, Mangade said was exploitation of patients and in the interest of the masses, the court should direct the state to regulate the price of PPE kits. While responding to the plea, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the state had through a notification on August 31, the rates of PPE kits and bed charges recovered by private hospitals for the 80% regulated beds was capped. Kumbhakoni said there was no cap on charges that the private hospital could recover from patients admitted and treated on the remaining, unregulated beds. “We can rationalise the rates but cannot nationalise private hospitals as sought by the petitioner. Private hospitals have to adhere to the rack rates prescribed only for the regulated beds. The rack rates of regulated beds do not apply to unregulated beds and hospitals can recover charges as per their own rack rates,” said Kumbhakoni. He added that the only restriction on the hospitals was that they should recover charges for the unregulated beds as per the rack rates existing on December 31, 2019. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the petitioner to file his response to the additional affidavit within a week and posted the matter for hearing thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-rationalise-rates-not-nationalise-private-hospitals-maharashtra-tells-high-court/story-A0TVSNSNpGbp0lLKBAelnI.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai recorded 24% more deaths in the first seven months this year||The number of deaths in Mumbai has increased by 24% in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data. Between January and July 2019, 51,972 people died in Mumbai. The number increased to 64,349 during the same period this year. The BMC plans to analyse the reason behind the rise.The highest number of deaths were recorded in May when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak. In 2019, 6,832 people died in May while the number surged to 14,085 in the same month this year. This marked a 106% rise in mortality rate. Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine latest developments: Russia releases Sputnik V, India candidate in final phaseDr Ravikant Singh of NGO Doctors For You said with all focus on Covid-19, other patients were neglected. “In May, almost all hospitals were either converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals or partially so. Also, vehicles were not available to ferry patients in emergencies. So, there is a possibility that a large number of non-Covid-19 patients died during this period.”Dr Lalit Anande, superintendent of Sewri TB hospital, said despite the initial fear that a large number of patients with Tuberculosis (TB) with compromised lungs would succumb to the infection, the death rate is far lesser. “It is a known fact that Mumbai has the highest number of TB cases but thankfully, the virus has not affected the patients. The Covid-19 death rate among TB patients is much lesser than 1%. So certainly, the figure does not include TB patients.”Also Read: Maharashtra tyrannizing doctors instead of consulting them, says IMASuresh Kakani, BMC’s additional commissioner, highlighted that almost 40% of the people who died in Mumbai were non-residents. “Firstly, a large number of serious non-Covid-19 patients who visited Mumbai for treatment got stuck due to the lockdown. So, when their condition deteriorated, they died. Also, in the initial stage of the pandemic outbreak, we got a large number of Covid-19 patients from Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Palgarh. Even though they were not residents of Mumbai, the BMC had to provide the death certificates.”Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said they would audit the reasons behind the rise in deaths. “We will case-wise study the cause of deaths among the deceased. Until we do that, we do not have a valid answer on the reason for the rise in fatality rate in Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-recorded-24-more-deaths-in-the-first-seven-months-this-year/story-yBplr5P9c6mbHA3M6f5ujN.html

08-09-2020||Chandigarh||National Achievement Survey put off by a year due to Covid pandemic||The Centre has decided to postpone the National Achievement Survey (NAS), 2020, by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The NAS, which was scheduled to be held in November 2020 to assess the learning levels of students, will now be held around the same time next year. “Due to the prevailing pandemic, it has been decided to postpone NAS to 2021,” according to a recent communication from the director, school education and literacy, JP Pandey to all principal secretaries, school education, of states and union territories. The Union ministry has tentatively scheduled the survey for Classes 3, 5, 8, and 10 in the first week of October or second week of November 2021, asking the states and UTs to convey their preference by September 18. “As the survey involves all states and UTs, early finalisation of dates will help stakeholders and agencies involved in the conduct of the NAS for seamless and timely planning,” reads the letter. The postponement came as India’s Covid-19 tally raced past the 40 lakh mark. EVALUATING LEARNING COMPETENCIES The exercise will be conducted jointly by the Union ministry of education and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to evaluate class-appropriate learning competencies of students in state-run and aided schools, understand educational health of schooling, diagnose maladies, and institute measures to fill them. In the last survey in November 2017, the learning levels of 25 lakh students of 1.1 lakh schools across 701 districts in all states and UTs were assessed. PUNJAB ACHIEVEMENT SURVEY HELD ONLINE A senior official of Punjab’s school education department said there is no other option as all schools are closed. “There is no plan to reopen schools for now as Covid-19 cases are rising across the country. Whenever any decision is taken, primary and middle schools will be the last to be reopened,” he said. Punjab held the Punjab Achievement Survey (PAS) online last month for students of Classes 6 to 12 to check the learning outcomes to prepare the teachers and students for the national achievement survey. In the 2017 survey, Punjab students had not fared well, particularly in mathematics even though they did better in languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/national-achievement-survey-put-off-by-a-year-due-to-covid-pandemic/story-QCgJh2PNgHpdd8MOe3iEeL.html

A report citing all illegalities of the structure is being prepared.The actor has been involved in a bitter war of words with Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena, which also controls BMC, over her remarks likening Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The Maharashtra government has accused Ranaut of carrying forward the political agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP-led Central government provided Y-plus category security to Ranaut on Monday two days before she was expected to return to Mumbai from her home state of Himachal Pradesh. Around a dozen armed commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will protect the actor round the clock in three shifts wherever she travels. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has called the Centre’s move to provide security “to people who insult Mumbai and Maharashtra” surprising and sad.Ranaut on Monday shared on Twitter videos purportedly showing BMC officials at her office premises in Mumbai and added the Sena-ruled civic body may demolish the property on Tuesday.Also Read: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut appointed party’s chief spokespersonRanaut has said she felt unsafe in Mumbai after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. On September 3, she put out a tweet asking why Mumbai felt like it was PoK in response to Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut advice to her not to visit the city if she was afraid of the city’s police.The Shiv Sena has accused Ranaut of insulting Mumbai and its police force. Ranaut earlier said she may require security from Himachal Pradesh police or the Centre, but will not accept protection from the Mumbai police to expose an alleged “drug mafia in Bollywood”.Ranaut is the first Bollywood celebrity to be guarded by CRPF, which protects about 60 dignitaries, including Union home minister Amit Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-asks-kangana-ranaut-to-take-corrective-measures-against-illegalities-in-her-bandra-office/story-kiTgJEKbdG6atuzsAly70J.html

Maharashtra recorded 15,765 cases, 17,433 cases, 18,105 cases, 19,218 cases, 20,489 cases, 23,350 cases and 16,429 cases on September 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.

The average number of fresh cases in a day has increased to 18,684.Also Read: Mumbai local trains unlikely to resume before DiwaliState authorities have been worried about the rising number of Covid-19 cases over the past few days. “We were expecting the spurt in the number of cases after permitting interdistrict movement and allowing more workforce in private and public offices immediately after the Ganesh festival. The number will keep rising at least for two more weeks. Our mechanism for tracking and tracing high- and low-risk contacts is resulting in the rapid rise in number of cases. The lack of coordination between public health and medical education department has resulted in hindering the ramping up of infrastructure in a few districts where there is a surge in cases,” said an official from the public health department.Maharashtra has also reported 2,444 deaths between September 1 and 7, an average of 349 deaths a day. The state is concerned abou the high number of deaths, as it is yet to reduce. There have been 320, 292, 391, 378, 312, 328 and 423 casualties on September 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 respectively.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains unlikely to resume before Diwali||Mumbai’s lifeline, the suburban local railway network that has been suspended for the public since March 22 because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, is unlikely to resume before November. The suspension of train services has led to the passengers getting angry and staging protests outside railway stations. Around 300 angry commuters staged a protest outside Virar railway station on Monday afternoon, demanding permission to travel by local trains. The incident occurred at around 11 am when office-goers gathered outside the station and demanded the resumption of suburban train services.Also read: Hi-tech ideas pour in to boost last-mile link for Metro linesThe protest petered out within half an hour after the agitators were pacified by the Railway Protection Police (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP) and local police personnel.Earlier on July 22, angry commuters at Nalasopara had demanded that they be allowed to travel by local trains. The protesters had broken barricades and stood on tracks to disrupt train services.At present, frontline essential service workers, who are battling the Covid-19 pandemic, are only allowed to commute by suburban trains in Mumbai. Railway officials said train services, which were suspended on March 22 due to Covid-19, are unlikely to resume in their full capacity until Diwali in mid-November. On June 15, a limited number of local train services resumed for employees working in essential services. Nearly 700 train services are being operated daily on the Central and Western Railway routes.“There has been no discussion regarding the resumption of suburban train services for the public. A trial-based system of a quick response (QR) code is being tested in a bid to control crowds on the railway stations. Train services in full strength are not likely to resume before Diwali.” said a railway officialThe delay in the resumption of train services has angered passengers. Passenger associations have sought Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s intervention to resolve the crisis. “We met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who assured us that the issue would be taken up. There has been no communication from the state government so far. People are angry because under the unlock guidelines, Mumbai is being gradually reopened, but local train services are still shut. Passengers’ commute is greatly inconvenienced. We have written to CM Thackeray for his immediate intervention. If he doesn’t respond, we will start an agitation on railway tracks,” said Madhu Kotian, president, Mumbai Rail Pravasi Sangh.A report, prepared by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) on the Covid-19 situation and submitted to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities, has stated that train services in Mumbai can be resumed from November 1. Dr. Sandeep Juneja, dean, School of Technology and Computer Science, TIFR, said that the civic authorities would have to remain vigilant after the train services resume. He also pointed out that by November 1 a major chunk of the population in Mumbai and its suburbs would have been directly or indirectly infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease.“By November 1, a significant section of the population in Mumbai and its suburbs will be infected by the virus. Local train services can resume if we take the following measures such as wearing of facial masks, introducing staggered office timings, and maintaining social distancing norms inside compartments. We do not expect that the resumption of train services will lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. The current occupancy in truncated suburban train services is 30%, which can be increased to 50% over the next two months. We will also have a clearer picture about the contagion before the suburban train services become fully operational,” he said. Railway experts have stated that the train services in the city should resume immediately because Metro rails have started operating. “Metro rails and aircraft are air-conditioned, where the risk of the spread of virus is much higher. Precautions are being taken and the services have started. Similar precautions, including crowd control, should be undertaken and suburban train services should be thrown open for the public. Operating select train services for a few people will be discriminatory,’’ said Subodh Jain, ex-general manager, Central Railway.Railway officials pointed out that partial train services were started on the request of the state government. “We had started select suburban services from June 15 for essential staff on the request of the state government. On July 1, we added a few more services for additional categories permitted by the state government . We are taking every possible step to ensure social distancing norms are maintained by way of QR code-enabled contactless checking, etc. This will definitely help us to streamline the system even after more services are added.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer (cpro), Central Railway.State government officials stated that the situation is being monitored and a decision on the resumption of suburban train services would be taken at an appropriate time. “Now, employees working in pharmacy have also been permitted to travel by local trains. The situation is being monitored. A final decision on the resumption of train services will be taken at an appropriate time,” said a state government official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-unlikely-to-resume-before-diwali/story-e71IGhm62TrWnjXCo3EdXM.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Former Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini faces arrest after high court dismisses bail petition||Former Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini faces arrest with the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday dismissing his anticipatory bail petition in the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case of 1991. The bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh also dismissed his second petition that sought the quashing of a first information report (FIR) in the case or the transfer of investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “Both petitions of the former DGP have been dismissed by the high court,” Punjab Police special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula said. Saini can appeal against the judgment before the Supreme Court. The bench had heard the case for nearly four hours on Monday. TWO JUDGES HAD RECUSED FROM HEARING CASE Earlier, two judges had recused from hearing this case. Justice Suvir Sehgal recused from hearing the bail plea on Friday, while on September 2 justice Amol Rattan Singh recused from hearing the petition seeking the quashing of the FIR that was pending in the high court since August 19. On September 1, a Mohali court had dismissed Saini’s anticipatory bail plea. EX-DGP’S WHEREABOUTS NOT KNOWN The former DGP, whose whereabouts are not known at present, was booked in May for the alleged kidnapping of Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) in 1991 and the son of a bureaucrat. Multani had been picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh senior superintendent of police. Initially, the case against him was registered for offences of causing disappearance and abduction at Mataur police station in Mohali. Section 302 for murder was added in August after two policemen, initially named as accused, turned approver. SAINI ALLEGES CONGRESS HAND In his plea, Saini had argued that the FIR was the result of a mala fide act for launching probes against Congress leaders and their relatives to unearth scams. He had also argued that he was granted bail in the case when it was registered for kidnapping, hence, he should be granted anticipatory bail on addition of the murder charge, too. For the same incident, the CBI had registered an FIR in 2008, but the Supreme Court had set it aside. Hence, the second FIR in the same offence is not maintainable, he had argued. FRESH EVIDENCE AGAINST EX-DGP: POLICE Punjab Police cited fresh evidence of Saini’s involvement in the case and denied any political victimisation. When the accused was granted bail in the kidnapping case, investigation was at its initial stage and there was hardly any evidence collected by the special investigation team (SIT), police said. Now, there is sufficient evidence on record to prove Saini’s indictment, the police told the court. The police had argued that custodial interrogation was required to find out about involvement of other officials in the illegal abduction, detention, torture, and disposal of the body of Multani. The government had roped in two Supreme Court senior advocates Sidharth Luthra and Harin Rawal to argue its case before the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-punjab-police-chief-sumedh-singh-saini-faces-arrest-after-high-court-dismisses-bail-petition/story-ytV5zMajskQSEPxyIoClJL.html

Dwivedi, whose bail application was rejected by the first additional chief metropolitan magistrate court on Monday, has been remanded to police custody till September 11.The police have named Shivaprakash, who reportedly produced some of Dwivedi’s movies, as the main accused in the case. Apart from the producer and Dwivedi, the FIR also names Viren Khanna, Prashant Ranka, Vaibhav Jain, Abhiswamy, Aditya Alva, Simon, Prashant Babu, Ashwin, Rahul Tonse, Vinay and a Senegalese national, Loum Pepper. According to officials, Pepper was the main supplier of the drugs.“All these persons from accused number-1 to accused number-12 people including Dwivedi used to connive together to hold (Rave) parties at different parts of Bengaluru and call many clients,” ACP Gautham has stated in his complaint, according to PTI.“They used to obtain drugs from the drug peddlers to supply them to businessmen, celebrities, some film actors and actresses, disk jockeys, software engineers and others and make money through illegal means and indulged in unlawful activities,” he added.All the 12 accused have been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 120b (criminal conspiracy), and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985 under sections 21, 21C, 27A, 27B, and section 29.Besides these 12 people, a separate case has been registered against BK Ravishankar, a clerk in the Road Transport Office, a close acquaintance of Ragini Dwivedi, police said.As the war of words continued between the Congress and BJP over the case since Dwivedi campaigned for some of the candidates of the ruling party during elections, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has said that there was “no question of protecting anybody”.“Our goal is to put an end to the (drugs) business which is having a bad impact on students and youth. We are doing whatever is necessary (to fight the drug menace),” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bengaluru-drug-probe-kannada-actor-sanjana-galrani-s-home-searched-by-central-crime-branch/story-ZmJw2QY7Dr6z1MTnynNY9N.html

Last week, 81 employees of two dhabas, namely Amrik Sukhdev dhaba and Garam Dharam, had tested positive. The food outlets were sealed and a sanitisation drive was carried out. The health department got down to collecting samples from more dhabas in an 8km stretch in Murthal and found five workers of Pahalwan Dhaba, three from Kubair Hotel, one each from Jhilmil and Aahuja dhabas besides four others tested positive on Monday evening. A health official said these outlets and hotels would be sealed for sanitisation. “We have collected 950 samples from various dhabas over the past week and nearly 100 workers have been found to be infected with coronavirus,” the official said. Set along the highway that connects Delhi with Haryana, Punjab and beyond, the dhabas of Murthal are popular halt points for travellers. Samples of employees were collected after videos surfaced on social media recently, showing Covid-19 guidelines being flouted at these eating joints.NO CASE AGAINST OWNERS The Sonepat district administration is yet to register a case against the owners of these dhabas for violating social distancing norms.

08-09-2020||Delhi||5 things Delhi-2041 Master Plan will have special focus on||The new Master Plan of Delhi-2041, the vision document for the city for the next 20 years, is likely to focus on a range of issues which were not addressed in the current plan (Master Plan of Delhi-2021). It will stress on critical urban development policies, such as, Transit oriented Development, which was mentioned in MPD-2021 but couldn’t be implemented. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has roped in the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), an advisory body on urban development to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, for the preparation of MPD-2041. The two organisations are currently holding public consultations regarding the plan.Also read: Planning a green future for DelhiHere are the five issues which the new MPD-2041 is likely to address or have special focus on:1.Air pollution: To address this issue, officials involved in drawing up MPD-2041 are looking at pollution and traffic data, and comparing it with advanced geographical information to get the bigger picture on what factors could be affecting air quality. The solutions could include planning for more green areas, encouraging walking by making better pavements and transit networks, and making changes that could limit or re-route the entry of heavy vehicles – one of the most prominent sources of pollution.2.Walkability: DDA had notified the policy for ‘enhancing walkability’ in the city last year. The key features of the draft policy include time-bound implementation of area specific ‘walk plan’, a centralised city-wide monitoring system, and a ‘walk Delhi’ coordination, monitoring committee, among other measures. The focus will be on making the city, especially areas around residential neighbourhoods, markets etc, pedestrian friendly.3.Unauthorised colonies: Last year, the Centre had initiated the process to give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi. Close to four million people living in these colonies have been out of the planning ambit. The new MPD is going to focus on development of infrastructure in these colonies. DDA and NIUA recently held public consultation with the residents of these colonies to know their problems.4.Pandemic resilience: The Coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we live; social distancing and protective gear are the new normal now. The pandemic has put the spotlight on disaster management strategy in the master plan, which was largely about earthquakes and floods so far. Based on the learnings from Covid-19, urban planners are looking at provisions to make the city resilient.5. Blue green policy: The plan is to revive water bodies and clean the drains and integrate it with the green areas around it so that it can be used as recreational space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/5-things-delhi-2041-master-plan-will-have-special-focus-on/story-qZnbU2ZMqzXxDIJ6kmhJPJ.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Army, ITBP start joint exercise along China border in Himachal Pradesh||A day after Indian soldiers thwarted a bid by Chinese troops to intrude into Indian territory along Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, the Indian Army and the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) started a joint exercise along the China border in Himachal Pradesh. Barring a few incidents of air incursion, no suspicious movement of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been noticed in the Tibetan region that borders Kinnaur district of the state. This border stretch has been peaceful despite heightened Chinese activity along Ladakh after the clash between soldiers of the two nations in the Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian army personnel died in the line of duty. The army and ITBP joint exercise is aimed at thwarting any incursion bid and is underway near Hurling and Gayu villages in the Kaurik sector, a senior Shimla-based intelligence official said. Himachal Pradesh shares a 260-km porous border with China. Of the total length, 140 km is in tribal Kinnaur district, while 80 km is in the tribal Lahaul and Spiti district. Military sources said that vigil is up at all posts in the Kaurik region to prevent any night incursion bid. China has accelerated construction activity on its side of the border, while India has also stepped up building infrastructure at its forward posts of Lepcha and Murmi Dogri, which are manned by the ITBP.

The lynching took place in the presence of policemen who arrived at the scene after the teacher’s murder.A video clip on social media showed policemen in riot gear failing to stop about 30 people from beating the man with sticks. The motive for the teacher’s murder is yet to be established, the police said.“The incident occurred at Rampur Bagra village under Tariya Sujan police station. The accused was beaten severely by a violent mob before he could be rescued by the police team that reached there,” Kushinagar’s superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Mishra said . “The team took him to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.”According to the police, the man reached the house of a resident of the area, Sudhir Singh, on a scooter at around 8am and claimed to be a friend of his elder brother. Singh was a teacher at a government school in Bihar, according to locals. The man was asked to wait inside the house by family members because Singh was having a bath.“He waited for him (Singh) and had tea. As soon as Singh came out, he shot him dead,” the SP said.“The man tried to run out of the house after killing Sudhir Singh, but he saw people from the neighbourhood gathering outside. So, he went inside and climbed onto the roof. He fired a few shots with his pistol to scare away the crowd. Our police team reached the spot within a few minutes. While they were trying to apprehend him, the crowd turned violent and started attacking him, which resulted in his death,” the Kushinagar SP said.Tariya Sujan station house officer (SHO) Harendra Mishra said the man was aged around 25 and his brother told the police over the phone that his name was Aryaman Yadav, a resident of Nanda Nagar Dargahi in Gorakhpur district. The pistol used by him in the crime has been recovered, the SHO added.The bodies of both the man and Sudhir Singh have been sent for a post-mortem examination. The police registered a complaint in the matter. A first information report (FIR) of murder was lodged by Singh’s family, the police said.(WITH AGENCY INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mob-lynches-man-in-police-presence-in-up/story-r3VqVAuDdoEKjjl5Z1lsIJ.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||Special day-long Delhi assembly session to be held on September 14||A special day-long session of the Delhi legislative assembly will be held on September 14, the chief minister’s office said on Monday. Since Covid-19 cases are once again on the rise in the Capital, the Delhi Assembly secretariat said a number of precautionary measures would be put in place during the one-day session. “First, all legislators and Vidhan Sabha employees will have to undergo Covid-19 tests, the results of which will have to come latest by Sunday -- a day before the session begins on September 14. A testing van will be deployed at the assembly premises to test employees. The MLAs will have to undergo tests either at the assembly or they may get tested at some hospital or health centre on their own and submit the report to the Vidhan Sabha secretariat,” said a senior Delhi Assembly official on condition of anonymity. This will be the second session of the assembly to be convened during the Covid-19 pandemic. A one-day session was held on March 23 to present the budget. But no such precautionary measures were taken in that session, except for members of the House being seated at a distance from one another. For the September 14 session, assembly officials said, the entry of media persons is likely to be restricted this time and they would be allowed only in the press room. “Sitting in the press gallery during the session, as is the practice, is unlikely to happen this time, although a final decision on this is yet to be taken,” a second official said.To maintain social distancing, additional chairs will be kept in the House. Usually, two MLAs sit in one seat inside the House. But the rule now will be one person per bench in order to maintain a six-feet distance, the official added. Mask wearing, and thermal screening will be mandatory inside the assembly premises.Senior officials in the chief minister’s office said it is likely that there will be no question hour this time mainly because it is a one-day session and only important issues and legislative matters will be taken up. The question hour session was removed from the recent Parliament session as well. The decision to hold the one-day session was taken by the Delhi cabinet led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 5 after the law department tabled the proposal for approval.Delhi’s Covid-19 management strategies are expected to be discussed during the sitting. Some AAP legislators are expected to discuss the Delhi Model of management during the session, people aware of the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/special-day-long-delhi-assembly-session-to-be-held-on-september-14/story-wUHfFAPL0duTVQDbVpJytN.html

The Haryana government had last week decided to run demo classes for board students at this school, along with the Government Senior Secondary School at Karnal’s Nigdhu village.The school, on its part, left no stone unturned to ensure their safety of students amid the Covid-19 infection fears. Headmaster Chand Kishor said, “All students underwent thermal screening at the gate itself. As soon as they reached, the teachers apprised them of the social distancing norms and other safety guidelines. We made sure that there was adequate spacing in their seating arrangements.”“Fifteen students sat in one room (five students each in three rows) and three others were seated in a different room. The other students joined the class through online mode,” he added.FOUR-HOUR CLASSESThe headmaster further said that they organised four classes of one-hour each for Science, Mathematics, English and Hindi. “We will call other students also this week once these students become familiar with the safety guidelines. Teachers have made videos of the students entering the school and attending the classes. These videos will be sent to other schools by the education department,” he added.Sonepat district education officer Joginder Hooda said the students were advised to observe distancing with their family members for a few hours after they return home. “The students were very excited to join the school after a gap of nearly five and a half months. We will not compromise with the students’ health while running the classes. I want to thank the parents of the students for agreeing to send their kids to the school for demo classes,” the DEO added.The students claimed that the teachers and other staff helped them on the first day.“Seating arrangements were made in the classroom in accordance with the safety protocols. The teachers told us that our school timing will be increased after the success of demo classes. Finally, our life seems to have come back on track and we will just focus on studies now as this is our board year,” the students said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demo-classes-for-board-students-start-at-sonepat-s-govt-school/story-5iHEaeKYIeAEP4glnYoBnK.html

The direction came after the court was informed that monkeys not only damaged the tender branches but sometimes uprooted the saplings.The NDMC counsel submitted photographs to Justice Najmi Waziri -- who was hearing a bunch of pleas on tree plantation -- showing that 500 amaltas saplings had been planted in various parts of the Central Ridge.The counsel told the court that the saplings have been interspersed with trees of other varieties, ensuring that there is no mono-culture. However, she said monkey menace was a threat.“To safeguard these young vulnerable trees, it will be worthwhile for the council to install appropriate tree guards wherever deemed necessary, so as to prevent tree-attrition due to monkey menace. Affidavit of compliance be filed before the next date,” the court said.Noting that more than 100,000 trees had been planted all over Delhi in the last two years under its directions, Justice Waziri said many of these were contributed by litigants in hundreds of cases as costs or fine.He said the endeavour to create and augment the green cover with indigenous deciduous trees, both in the heart of the city and on its periphery, is a collective exercise for the enrichment of Delhi’s ecology.“What will the trees grow up to look like? What will be their contribution to better health and psychological well-being of the residents of Delhi? What will be their overall contribution to Delhi’s ecological improvement over the years? How many a heart will be cheered, by the scores of street-aligned amaltas in full bloom? These are answers only nature can give,” the judge said in his order dated August 25.Quoting from environmentalist Pradip Krishen’s book, Trees of Delhi – A Field Guide, the judge said, “Trees will not, of course, solve Delhi’s ecological problems. But while we search the will and means to undo what we have done, trees are balm and salve to our mistakes. They are witnesses to our foolish tinkering with nature, embellishments of our dour cities, symbols of renewal and growth, our reasons for hope and for keeping the faith. That is reason enough.”During the hearing, the Delhi forest department filed an affidavit, detailing that of the planned 74,781 trees, roughly 60,000 saplings were planted in the Southern Ridge and they were in good health. It said 20 check-dams were constructed and the videography of the area shows collection of a large quantity of rainwater which would not only recharge the water table, but also help in the growth of vegetation and the newly planted trees.“The small water reservoirs will abet rejuvenation of the earth. There is a proposal to create 40 more such check-dams. For the moment, a total of 60 check-dams will be created. The forest department is exploring the creation of many more. Let such proposal be shared with the learned court commissioners,” the court said in its order.Justice Waziri has been passing orders from time to time in the last two years, directing litigants and parties to plant tree saplings throughout the city as costs or fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/install-tree-guards-to-protect-saplings-from-monkeys-delhi-hc-to-ndmc/story-kcCqz4cFQWNg3LnlXQAUVL.html

08-09-2020||Chandigarh||GST compensation shortfall: Haryana opts for special window borrowing||The Haryana government has decided to opt for borrowing through a special window to make up for the shortfall in compensation arising out of Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation. A proposal in this regard will be communicated to the Central government soon, top officials said. Officials said the state government chose the special window borrowing, also known as Option 1, because the state will not be required to service the debt or repay it from any other source. “The principal amount and interest will be paid by the Central government. The interest on the borrowing under the special window will be paid from the cess as and when it arises until the end of the transition period. After the transition period, principal and interest will also be paid from proceeds of the cess,” said an official. A cess is levied by the Central government for providing compensation to the states for the loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the GST. However, due to revenue shortfall owing to Covid-19 lockdowns, the Central government has expressed its inability to pay the GST compensation to the states. The matter was discussed threadbare during the 41st meeting of GST Council headed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on August 27. It was discussed that on account of the prevailing economic situation, the Central revenues were under greater strain than the GST revenue. Moreover, central expenditures were also stretched due to the pandemic response and needs of national security. The only practical way forward is by borrowing and then repaying the borrowing by extension of cess beyond the fifth year, it was discussed. The Central government said they were facing large borrowing requirements this year and any additional borrowing would influence the yields on central government securities and impact borrowing costs for the states and the private sector. Since yields on state government securities do not have the same type of macroeconomic repercussions, borrowings should be done at the state-level. The two borrowing options were formulated keeping in mind the fact that borrowings by state governments incurred a higher interest cost, officials said. The advantage of Option 1 Speaking about the advantages of special window borrowing option, Haryana officials said the special borrowing permission will be over and above any other borrowing ceilings eligible under any other normal or special permission notified by department of expenditure. Also, the special window borrowing will not be treated as debt of the state for any norms prescribed by the Finance Commission. The GST compensation cess will be continued after the transition period until all arrears of compensation for the transition period are paid to the state. “The first charge on the GST compensation cess each year would be the interest payable. The second charge would be the principal repayment. The remaining arrears of compensation accrued during the transition period would be paid after the interest and principal are paid,” said an official. Also, the Central government has committed to keep the cost of borrowing at or close to the government bonds. If the cost gets higher, the Central government will bear the margin between central government securities and average of state development loan yields through subsidy, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gst-compensation-shortfall-haryana-opts-for-special-window-borrowing/story-B2HefTWN8YEHr6J6pN9y9M.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana has investor-friendly image, will bounce back: Dushyant||In the latest rankings on ease of doing business index, Haryana has slipped from third to 16th position. The sharp slide has dealt a setback to the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government’s hard sell to woo investors and also lent ammunition to the opposition. In an interview with HT on Monday, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the industries portfolio, promised to take corrective steps . Excerpts: Haryana has slipped from third to the 16th position. What went so wrong suddenly? It seems the primary reason behind the dip in Haryana’s ranking is due to major changes incorporated in the criteria adopted by Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) in its Business Reform Action Plan 2019 (BRAP-2019). Haryana’s new industrial policy will focus on the new grading system that the DPIIT has adopted to decide rankings. How genuine do you think the findings of this survey are? I won’t be able to comment much on it because it relates to the period before we joined the state government and I took over as the industry minister. I can assure you that the present team of officers is working hard to make state a big corporate and manufacturing hub. Has introduction of new parameters in the survey gone against Haryana? The revised parameters of the survey need to be looked into. Barring a couple of big states, these rankings reveal jump for mainly small and very less industrialised states and Union Territories. Major businesses hubs such as Karnataka, Gujarat, Orissa, Haryana, Kerala have slipped. Who is responsible for this poor performance? Is it bureaucracy? The detailed findings of the survey will be discussed among the officers and required reforms will be implemented. Haryana will bounce back. What are the challenges this adverse ranking has posed? Is this a wakeup call? This is an opportunity to revisit the state’s industrial policies and come up with more attractive plans for investors. For the purpose, we are finalising Haryana Enterprises and Employment Promotion Policy this month. It will be a game changer. We not only plan to provide better environment for industry in the state, but also boost employment avenues. Our focus will also be bringing investment to areas where there is no industrial growth. What is your message to the business community? Haryana has an investor-friendly image. Despite the pandemic, big companies have expanded their manufacturing units in the state. Coca Cola has added three new units. In the past one year, six mega projects, with investment of Rs 8,607 crore, have been cleared and they will come up in Rohtak, Sonepat, Jhajjar, Nuh, and Rewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-has-investor-friendly-image-will-bounce-back-dushyant/story-nLKFS5ePChMkLVUcmH74uL.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||AAP protests for pending salaries of MCD workers||Councillors of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by senior leader Durgesh Pathak, on Monday joined employees of the three municipal corporations (MCDs) outside Civic Centre building to protest against non-payment of pending salaries.Pathak, who is AAP’s MCD in-charge, along with a bunch of other party members and councillors, was later detained by Delhi Police. “We demand that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) release the salaries of MCD workers within the next week. If you (the BJP) cannot run the MCD, then please resign and hand it over to the AAP. The Arvind Kejriwal-led party will run it better in the same budget. It has been about six months that the employees of the corporation have not got their salaries,” Pathak said. He further said that the AAP will continue to protest until the BJP-ruled MCDs settle the salaries of all its employees.The BJP, however, denied AAP’s allegations and said the Kejriwal led party was making baseless claims to garner support from the people of Delhi ahead of municipal elections. MCD elections are scheduled some time in April, 2022. The BJP had managed to win a majority in all the three civic bodies during the last polls held in April 2017. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the AAP government had not given MCD its dues till now.“As per the Delhi municipal corporation act, 2012, the Delhi government is bound to release annual municipal funds by June 30 every year. But till date, the AAP government has not even released 26% of the allocated funds for 2020-21,” he said.‘SANJAY SINGH DETAINED TO SUPPRESS AAP’S VOICE’AAP chief spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj on Monday said the Uttar Pradesh government detained AAP Raya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh on Sunday, when he went to meet the family of former UP MLA Nirvendra Mishra, who died after allegedly being beaten up in the presence of police officers.“The YogiAdityanath government has registered 13 different FIRs against Sanjay Singh to terrorise him and yesterday (Sunday) they detained him. This is just to terrorise him and to stop his voice, because he is talking about the rights of Dalits and Brahmins in UP,” Bhardwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-protests-for-pending-salaries-of-mcd-workers/story-qnOFbFexangvUMlSMAEmHI.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||To pay for PUBG, boy transfers₹2.3L from grandad’s pension account||A 15-year-old boy in North Delhi’s Timarpur transferred money from the pension account of his grandfather to an online wallet to fund his PUBG game for months, Delhi Police said on Monday after cracking the case. Over a period of two months, the boy transferred Rs2.34 lakh from his 65-year-old grandfather’s account until the man was alerted of the transfers, Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said. While the boy managed to scale ace levels, largely due to his ability to pay, he couldn’t take full advantage of the game. “He told us his PUBG account was hacked after he reached a particular level,” the DCP said. No legal action is likely to be pursued against the boy since his grandfather has decided to let go of the matter on getting to know who was withdrawing his money, said another investigator. On May 8, he received a message on his phone, informing him of withdrawal of Rs2,500 from his bank account, leaving him with just Rs 275 in his account. “He visited the bank to realise that a total of Rs2.34 lakh had been transferred from his account to a PayTM account in multiple installments in over two months. He then approached us,” the DCP said.The police didn’t make much progress in the probe over the next few months, but on September 1, the case was transferred to the cyber branch of north Delhi police district. “We contacted PayTM to identify the man into whose account the money was being transferred. The account holder told us his minor friend had requested him to lend him his PayTM ID and password. Soon, we got to know that the boy was the complainant’s grandson,” the DCP said. When the police spoke to the boy, he allegedly said he had been playing the game for months, but wasn’t enjoying it since it needed payments for certain advantages. “One day, he found his grandfather’s debit card lying in the house. He began using it to make payments. Whenever a one-time password (OTP) would arrive for the payments, he would take his grandfather’s phone, see the password and delete the message,” the DCP said.The game was banned in India by the Union government earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-pay-for-pubg-boy-transfers-2-3l-from-grandad-s-pension-account/story-cmVfNYdOub9b9hxeV8vhqN.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Is this the world’s prettiest rickshaw?||Embroidered jootis. Cracked CDs. Artificial grass. Paper jhoomars. Just some of the elements that make up this extraordinarily unusual rickshaw.This evening, the eye-catcher is parked by a Lodhi Road pavement. No sign of the puller. Perhaps that doesn’t matter, for his very persona seems to be diffused in the aesthetics of his rickshaw. The jhoomar hanging from the roof is made of coloured papers, golden laces and tiny brass bells. It is of a kind that school students are required to produce for their craft assignments, (and which are inevitably made by their parents). The footwear dangling at the bottom of the rickshaw is not unusual, for many pullers hang them at the same place for good luck. But here the shoes are ethnic types with Maharajah-style pointed tips, usually worn by a man on his wedding day.Even the tyres are decked with coloured ribbons, the spokes studded with shiny sitaras (sprinklers). The rickshaw’s handle-bar is a dense thicket of unruly plastic flowers, with a single real marigold in the center. Red bridal ornis (veils) are falling down from both sides of the handle.The floor under the passenger’s seat is carpeted with a mat of plastic grass. Broken CDs are fixed on the back wheels as showpiece. Indeed, the rickshaw has most unexpected objects doubling up as decorations. The front wheel is fitted with bunches of green and blue plastic straws. The rear has a dozen drinking glasses stringed into a row.The only part of the rickshaw that’s ordinary is the puller’s seat—wrapped in a simple mashed-up gamcha. Meanwhile, the tasteful puller still hasn’t appeared. A painted board on the rickshaw’s back announces in yellow and red—Muhammed Taufiq loves (represented by a heart pierced by Cupid’s arrow) Bilori. And just below is a phone number. “Yes, I’m Taufiq and that’s my rickshaw. Yes, Bilori is how I call my wife,” the voice says on picking up the phone. “I’m having chai. I will return later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-is-this-the-world-s-prettiest-rickshaw/story-aRLnnZxyt9zmgW7neSKsZI.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||BJP leaders, mayors hold protest against AAP for not releasing full funds to civic bodies||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is the ruling party in all three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs), on Monday alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government has not released even 26% of the funds allocated for the financial year 2020-21.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta along with mayors of the three civic bodies on Monday held a protest against the Delhi government at the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the North and South corporations. The BJP leaders and mayors marched from the Civic Centre to the Central Secretariat as part of their protest.Gupta said the Delhi government is supposed to pay East, South and North corporation ₹1,677 crore, ₹892 crore and ₹1,568 crore, respectively, this fiscal. These are to be paid by the Delhi government under various heads such as health, education, etc.“But the Delhi government has not even released 26% of these amounts to the three corporations. It has released just ₹157 crore to the East corporation till September 7. The South corporation got ₹232 crore while the North Corporation received ₹612 crore so far. This clearly shows that the Delhi government is trying to cripple the municipal corporations,” Gupta alleged.Gupta said the corporations are unable to pay salaries to employees, especially to sanitation workers who have been risking their lives cleaning the city during the times of the pandemic. He said the corporations need this fund more than ever as their revenue from other sources has significantly dropped.“The revenue from other sources such as property tax, conversion charges etc is not coming in as people are unable to pay due to the slump brought about by Covid-19. Instead of supporting the corporations, the Delhi government is indulging in petty politics,” he said.The AAP hit back and said the BJP should resign if it can’t fulfil its primary responsibilities. An AAP spokesperson said, “If the BJP cannot run the MCDs, it should resign and hand them over to the AAP. The MCDs have failed to deliver its primary responsibilities be it sanitation, fighting vector-borne diseases, and management of MCD schools due to rampant corruption. Last year, th AAP government significantly reduced deaths due to dengue y making honest efforts and running a very successful awareness campaign. BJP should stop misleading people, release the salaries of employees immediately or resign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-leaders-mayors-hold-protest-against-aap-for-not-releasing-full-funds-to-civic-bodies/story-Qm84YzbuXurg5VnybhtYMM.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt launches awareness campaign to step up Covid-19 testing||The Delhi government has launched a fresh intensive awareness campaign as part of which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s pre-recorded appeals will be played over phone and on radio, apart from billboard advertisements, urging people to get tested and follow Covid-19 safety measures. The move comes five days after lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on September 2 directed officials to launch an intensive information, education and communication (IEC) campaign to promote community engagement as an integral part of the Covid-19 management strategy of the city administration.To start with, the government has started making calls to every Delhi resident in which a pre-recorded message from the chief minister is played.Click here for full covid-19 coverage“We have started playing the chief minister’s recorded message over the phone and on radio. Soon, we will also be putting out TV and print advertisements. This is going to be a 360-degree campaign. We plan to cover at least one crore phone numbers in the coming days,” said a senior official from Kejriwal’s office. The messages across all mediums will be focused on increased testing. In his pre-recorded messages, Kejriwal is heard reiterating what he had said in his press conference on Saturday. “Some people are not getting tested. They say, nowadays everyone is recovering on their own, so there is no need to get tested. No, please do not think like this; please go and get tested. Please also wear masks when you step out and follow physical distancing,” the CM had said on Saturday.The chief minister also emphasised that the Delhi government provides free Covid-19 testing at all its dispensaries and seed PUHC (Primary Urban Health Centre). Testing is currently available for free at 265 dispensaries and clinics, in addition to major government hospitals in the city. The campaign comes at a time when Delhi, after becoming the first major region to register a sustained fall in cases, is now seeing an uptick in Covid-19 cases since mid-August. The spike in cases has prompted chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to hold an emergency meeting on August 26 where it was decided that the rate of testing will be doubled from 18,000-20,000 a day to nearly 40,000 a day.The Capital recorded 32 deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, the most fatalities in a single day in the city since July 24. Monday’s rise saw the death toll go up to 4,599, as per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. Further, 2,077 new cases of the disease were logged in Monday’s bulletin.Accordingly, the government has so far increased its daily testing numbers to 38,895 as on Saturday, the highest single-day testing figure in the capital so far.

Delhi’s current CFR stands at 2.38%, a decline from the 2.47% reported on average during the last week. The week before that, Delhi’s CFR stood at 2.61%. However, this is still much higher than the national average of 1.72%. “Delhi’s case fatality rate might be higher than the national average because of the people who travel from neighbouring states to avail treatment from Delhi,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in Safdarjung hospital’s pulmonology department. “Doctors now know more about the disease and treatment protocols have been standardised. This is why there was a decrease in the number of deaths in July, and even now the numbers are unlikely to go too high,” Dr Gupta added. The number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 has also gone up in the city, with over 5,000 people hospitalised with the infection, the data shows. The number of people admitted dipped to its lowest on July 28 when 2,775 people were in hospitals. It has increased over the past few weeks, and as on Monday, 5,218 were hospitalised in the city. Delhi also recorded more recoveries than new cases on Monday, when testing dipped to just 22,945 from the peak of 38,895 recorded on September 5. According to the data, 2,411 people recovered from the infection on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-32-new-covid-deaths-highest-since-july-24/story-AWAjgECFWQCC33In0TkDeL.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||Smooth but slow on Day 1 as Delhi Metro comes back to life||Delhi Metro services came back to life at 7am sharp on Monday, more than five months after being shut down as part of anti-Covid measures. The first line to be opened for passengers in Delhi was the 48.8km Yellow Line — connecting Huda City Centre in Gurugram and Samaypur Badli in north Delhi — which operated in two shifts of four hours each in the morning and the evening. The line recorded a ridership of over 15,500 on Monday (till 8.30pm). Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAround 7,500 passengers used the line between 7am and 11am, and more than 8,000 between 4pm and 8.30pm. Along with this, the Rapid Metro in Gurugram, spanning 11.7km, was also reopened.Delhi Metro’s estimated average daily ridership on the Yellow Line, before Covid-19 forced it to shut down, was around nine lakh on weekdays.On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet lauded the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) arrangements. “I am glad that Metro services are starting from today (Monday). The [Delhi] Metro has made good arrangements. We all should not be negligent in taking precautions,” Kejriwal tweeted. The Metro sputtered back to life amid a thin footfall, with teams of DMRC officials, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and civil defence volunteers stationed across stations to ensure distancing norms were followed. While crowds picked up by evening, ample space was available in stations and inside trains. To help passengers get used to the new functioning of the system, regular announcements were also made on how to go about their journey. Metro officials were also present to guide passengers through the process. “We got complete cooperation from commuters, who availed the services for the first time in 169 days,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. At entry gates, passengers were rationed into queues by security staff, who also made commuters sanitise their hands before allowing them to enter. Upon entering the gates of the metro stations — where entry and exit have been limited to one or two gates depending on the size and footfall of the station— passengers were screened for their temperatures after which they were asked to go through another round of sanitization through automated hand sanitizer machines. Further, passengers with baggage were also asked to get their luggage disinfected, before being allowed to proceed for security checks — the entire process adding five to six minutes to the normal check in time for passengers during non-rush hours . While this detailed process led to queues forming outside some stations in the evening office hours, passengers ensured that there was no crowding and ample space was left between them as they waited in lines. While most stations had proper floor markings to tell people where to stand while waiting for trains, some — like Guru Dronacharya, Arjangarh, Adarsh Nagar and Patel Chowk —the platform area did not have positions marked on the floor for passengers. Senior DMRC officials admitted that a few stations, where passenger footfall was not high, might have been missed. They, however, assured these things would be resolved as operations picked up. Some passengers who paid using UPI methods said the payment process required a longer waiting time, which also led to crowding at counters. “Top-ups for cards using debit cards were done instantly, but if a person was paying through UPI, the server was not responding immediately,” said a DMRC official at the ticketing counter at the Rajiv Chowk Metro station. Rajesh Ranjan, director-general, CISF, also reviewed the operational preparedness of the Metro operations on Monday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/smooth-but-slow-on-day-1-as-delhi-metro-comes-back-to-life/story-GfLGV4IxC7Braz5IjThXvK.html

The accused fled the spot with her jewellery after the murder. The accused, Irfan Nisaar Shaikh, is a resident of Chirag Nagar, Ghatkopar (West). According to the police, the victim – 60-year-old Zarina Anwar Shaikh – lived alone at Varsha Society in Jagriti Nagar, Kurla (East). Her daughter Rihana Yasim Shaikh, 32, lives in the nearby area, while son works in Gujarat. On Sunday night, Rihana called her mother, but the latter did not respond to her calls. Rihana then went to Zarina’s home and found the door locked. Rihana opened the door with a spare key and found her mother lying in a pool of blood. She then informed her neighbours and they rushed Zarina to a hospital, where the latter she was declared dead. After the police were informed, they began the investigations. “The killer managed to hide his face from the building’s CCTV camera. But the other CCTV cameras near the building captured some of his movements. After probing the victim’s relatives and based on details given by our informers, we discovered that Shaikh was behind the crime and arrested him from Ghatkopar within 15 hours after the crime,” said senior inspector Vilas Shinde of Nehru Nagar police. The accused visited his aunt’s home on Sunday night and locked the door from inside. He then switched on the television and turned the volume high and attacked his aunt with a knife, the police said. “Multiple injuries on the victim’s hand indicate that the duo had a scuffle for sometime, following which Shaikh slashed her wrist. She bled profusely and likely died of excessive bleeding,” said Shinde. The accused then took gold ornaments of around 221 grams of gold jewellery from her wardrobe and escaped from the window after locking the room from outside. “He was in dire need of money and decided to target his aunt as it was easy. We suspect that he has some addiction and must be needing money for the same,” Shinde said. Shaikh is booked under sections the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. He will be produced in the court on Tuesday. The police are in the process of recovering robbed valuables from him. The knife used in the crime was also seized by the police from the crime scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/22-year-old-arrested-for-murdering-aunt-in-mumbai/story-UYeNEh5OKbqQZqGfdEZicN.html

08-09-2020||Mumbai||CBI court rejects Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor’s anticipatory bail plea||The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail application of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor in connection with the case related to the purchase of property at Amrita Shergill Marg, New Delhi. The property belonged to Avantha Group companies and was later purchased by the company in which Kapoor’s wife is a director. As per the case registered by CBI, Kapoor entered into a criminal conspiracy with his wife, Bindu –director of M/s Bliss Abode Private Ltd (BAPL) – and Gautam Thapar, who is the promoter of AG Companies for the purpose of obtaining illegal gratification. It is alleged that the property – a lavish bungalow spread over an area of around 1.2 acres – was under mortgage with two banks for a loan of Rs350 and a loan of Rs30 crore, respectively. The agency claimed that Kapoor sanctioned a loan of Rs400 crore to Avantha Reality Pvt Ltd as lease rental, discounting for a period of 10 years, in March 2016. “For this, Avantha had entered into an agreement with M/S BILT Graphics Paper Pvt Ltd (Avantha group of company) for a yearly rental of Rs65 crore, payable by the former. The agreement was signed on March 22, 2016, two days prior to the sanction of the loan of Rs400 crore by Yes Bank to Avantha,” reads the first information report (FIR) registered by CBI. The agency claimed that the property was earlier leased on the rate of Rs1.02 crore per annum. The agency claimed that the lease rent was inflated to make the loan approval look justifiable. “This appears to have been done with an intention to get the loan account become stressed for justifying sale of the property by the Avantha Group,” CBI claimed. It was alleged that the valuation of the property at the time of the sanction was at Rs550 crore. Further, as per Yes Bank Ltd sanction Credit Appraisal Memorandum (CAM), the estimated value of the property was shown as Rs500 crore. The agency claimed that Kapoor was also head of the management credit committee (MCC) of the bank, approved the said loan of Rs400 crore to Avantha Reality Ltd as well as release of property against repayment of loan. “Though the account had started showing signs of stress from April 1, 2017, onwards, the unpaid interest and principal liability as on June 1, 2017 was only Rs12 crore approx. This amount does not appear to be high enough to justify sale of the collateral, either at the instance of the bank or the borrower. ln furtherance to the said conspiracy, it was however decided to sale the charged property against the said loan,” the CBI claimed. The agency further said that M/S Interglobe Enterprises Ltd had made the first offer to buy the property for Rs375 crore in April 2017. However, it was withdrawn without citing any reasons on August 31, 2017. Later, Avanta received the offer from Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd to buy the property for Rs378 crore. The deal materialised in September 2017. However, The CBI claimed that a total amount of Rs375 crore had been received by M/S Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd from lndia Bulls Housing Finance Ltd (IBHFL), including above Rs90 crore, taken as a loan vide agreement dated July 13, 2017. “Loan agreements were, however, executed between M/S Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd and IBHFL, much later on October 5, 2017, showing a balance amount of Rs285 crore out of above Rs375 crore also taken as loans. Kapoor is shown as a co-borrower in all these subsequent loan agreements dated October 5, 2017 as well,” the CBI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-court-rejects-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-s-anticipatory-bail-plea/story-0E2UBzjfY0VohR4Gpqzc7I.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Tunnel boring for Mumbai coastal road project to begin on October 25||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will begin the tunnel boring work for the Mumbai Coastal Road Project by October 25, the timeline prepared by the civic coastal road department stated. Following the commencement of the work, it will take eight to 10 months to complete the boring through the 3.4-kilometre (km)-long twin tunnels between Priyadarshini Park at Malabar Hill and Girgaum Chowpatty. BMC has completed about 16% of the work for the Coastal Road Project, and has set a deadline of July 2023 to complete the entire project, a senior civic officer from the department said. The civic body is now re-assembling the parts of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) it purchased from China last year at the work site in Priyadarshini Park. The machine arrived in April, and was taken to the site in many dismantled parts in 17 trailer trucks. The TBM will drill the 3.4-km-long twin tunnels partially running under the sea, between Girgaum and Malabar Hill, as part of the 9.98-km-long Coastal Road between Priyadarshini Park, and the Worli end of the Bandra Worli Sea Link. As there will be two parallel tunnels of 3.4-km length each, the total length of the tunnels will be 6.8 km. They will run 25 metres below the surface at Girgaum and 75 metres below the surface at Malabar Hill. The width of each tunnel will be 12 metres, with two lanes – each 3-3.2 metres wide – one emergency lane. A senior civic official from the coastal road department said, “We are re-assembling some parts of the TBM above ground at the worksite. Pilling and excavation work at both ends of the proposed tunnel is complete. Parts of the TBM will then be lowered into the ground through the shafts and assembled underground. End-to-end boring will take four-five months per side. It will start from Priyadarshini Park and bore through the length of one side of the tunnel to be pulled out at Girgaum Chowpatty. Then it will be taken back to Priyadashini Park to bore through the twin tunnel.” As per BMC’s original estimate, the TBM is to complete the tunnel boring work in 276 days. As the machine will be able to drill through a minimum of 3 metres each day, it will need roughly 276 days to complete the entire planned length of the tunnel. While expertise from the manufacturer will be required at the time of boring, BMC is in a fix now owing to the ongoing tensions with China. Another civic official said, “Chinese experts who are already working on the Mumbai Metro project and the Bengaluru Metro project will help the civic body with this work. Besides, the general consultant for the coastal road project, AECOM, has experts on its panel who will be called to help the civic body.” Earlier, BMC aimed to complete the coastal road by 2022. However, the Bombay high court put a stay on the work, which was later lifted by the Supreme Court. Following this, work resumed on December 18 last year after 154 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tunnel-boring-for-mumbai-coastal-road-project-to-begin-on-october-25/story-w248d4doyz6aAnRztK8bMK.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Second Doppler radar in Mumbai by December: Ministry of Earth Sciences||The city’s second Doppler radar will be installed and ready by December, the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) said on Monday.A Doppler radar provides long-range weather surveillance, detection and forecast for rainfall, cloud formation, thunderstorms and other weather conditions such as tropical storms. There are different types of Doppler radars. The one currently installed near the Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba is an S-Band radar that provides surveillance up to 450-500 km. A C-Band radar can provide surveillance up to 250-350 km while surveillance by an X-Band radar is up to 100 km.On Monday, MoES secretary M Rajeevan, during a virtual press conference on the current status and forecast of southwest monsoon 2020, said the installation of a C-Band Doppler radar is expected to be completed by December.“The radar is being installed by the Indian Space Research Organisation on MoES’ request. This would be Mumbai’s second radar and would enhance weather predictions and long-range surveillance immensely,” Rajeevan told HT.He added that but for the Covid-19 pandemic, the installation of this radar would have been completed at Dindoshi, Goregaon around this time.“Due to the pandemic, there were delays in purchases, basic formalities such as travel, electric work and final physical installation atop a hill in Goregaon. All these works are being undertaken at the moment and the installation will be completed by December,” said Rajeevan.Meanwhile, Rajeevan highlighted that before next monsoon, Mumbai is likely to have the largest weather network across any city in India.“Four X-Band radars would be strategically set up in different locations in the city to have spatial coverage of hyperlocal weather changes. Combined with this, we will be adding 30 more rain gauges (instruments to measure rainfall) along with the existing 160 to build infrastructure that will provide weather information for every 500 metres, every 15 minutes,” said Rajeevan. “After delay in shipments from the United States due to the pandemic, we expect four other radars to reach Mumbai early next year,” he added.In June, Mumbai received the integrated flood warning system (iFLOWS-Mumbai), the second one for any urban city in the country after Chennai. Though the system has provided warnings and made public its predictions a few times this monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), after the extremely heavy rain event on August 5-6 that led to 331 mm rain over 24 hours, said the system was not of much help.“We have got good responses from the municipal corporation and other state bodies working on this system. We must realise it is being used on an experimental basis and further fine tuning will be done as we progress,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-doppler-radar-in-mumbai-by-december-ministry-of-earth-sciences/story-ertzr4Wv1XznW49qWIko4I.html
08-09-2020||Delhi||New education policy lacks action plan to implement: Sisodia||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 ’lacks the action plan to implement it’, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said during a video conference organised by the Union ministry of education on Monday.The Delhi government, in a statement detailing Manish Sisodia’s feedback on the NEP 2020 conference, quoted Delhi’s education minister as saying that “The implementation of this policy should be carefully planned so that it is not limited to just a wonderful idea.”Monday’s NEP videoconference was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by governors, lieutenant governors, education ministers of various states and union territories. The education ministry had on July 29 released the NEP aimed to completely overhaul the existing education system in the country.Sisodia said that NEP doesn’t talk about giving equal status to vocational degrees like any other undergraduate degree in other subjects. “At present, about 80% youth having a degree are not considered employable. This needs our attention. Even after completing 20 years of education, if our students are not employable then where does the fault lie? It is inappropriate to treat vocational degrees differently from an undergraduate degree in any other subject. These courses should be given equal importance, then only we will be able to reap their benefits,” he said.The education minister reiterated that a law should be made to implement the promised amount from the GDP on the education sector. “This policy talks about spending 6 percent of GDP on education. This was said in a similar1968 policy as well, but never implemented. Thus, a law should be made so that successive governments are bound by it and necessary resources needed for effective implementation of the policy can be guaranteed,” Sisodia said.Citing a newspaper report about growing trend of suicides among students, he said, “We need to think about the lapses in the education policies which cause immense pressure on students resulting in a situation where someone commits suicide. It is very important to get out of the slavery of rote learning and examination-oriented education.” Expressing apprehensions over the two models of Early Childhood Education-- Anganwadi model and the pre-school model proposed in the NEP , Sisodia said, “We have to compete with developed countries through education. However, if trained teachers teach young children there but in our country we assign the same role to Anganwadi workers, the foundation will remain weak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/new-education-policy-lacks-action-plan-to-implement-sisodia/story-mvJEXMD798XuK5pUEuDbyK.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Two accused retract statements that led to arrest of actor Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik||Two arrested accused in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death retracted their statements on Monday. Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar, arrested on charges of drug peddling, retracted their statements to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), claiming they were recorded under duress. “We filed applications when they were produced before the court, where they retracted the statements given before NCB officers, and we sought bail for them. This is a bailable offence. Also, the amount of narcotic substance involved is in small quantity which entitles the accused to bail,” said advocate Taraq Sayyed, representing Vilatra and Parihar. NCB has opposed their bail plea. The next hearing will be on Thursday. Vilatra was arrested and produced before the magistrate court on August 3, while Parihar was arrested on August 3 and produced in court on August 4. NCB arrested actor Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik and two members of Rajput’s domestic staff, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant, on the basis of Vilatra and Parihar’s statements. The magistrate court had rejected the bail pleas following which Vilatra and Parihar, through their advocate, moved for bail before a special court constituted to try cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Independent lawyers said that the evidentiary value of a retracted statement may be compromised. “Once the statement given by the accused is retracted the evidential value of what is stated becomes questionable. The court will have to see independent evidence, other than the statement, which can support prosecution case,” said lawyer Rizwan Merchant. Avdhut Chimalkar, who has appeared as special public prosecutor in high-profile cases involving NCB, said there are circumstances in which retractions may not be accepted. “The accused gives a statement after their arrest and later, retract their statement after consultation with their lawyer. Such retraction may also not be accepted by the court. Of course this has to be proved by leading evidence,” said Chimalkar. Meanwhile, chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) ST Dande issued a circular on Monday, stating the hearings of remand applications in connection with NCB’s probe into Rajput’s death would be conducted through video conferencing. The circular dated September 6 reads: “In the present day’s situation of pandemic and past experience and to maintain law and order and administration of justice, with immediate effect, any accused related to the Sushant Singh Rajput remand will be carried [out] through video conferencing only.” The CMM’s office also directed NCB to ensure the accused are tested for Covid-19 at its office. Meanwhile, Anuj Keshwani, who was arrested on Sunday night for allegedly drug peddling and his involvement in Rajput’s case, was remanded in NCB’s custody till September 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-two-accused-retract-statements-that-led-to-arrest-of-actor-rhea-chakraborty-s-brother-showik/story-sEEq3AyvEMjY4fZVBpS7TM.html

From selecting colleges in less crowded areas as examination centres to maintain social distancing and asking students to bring their own sheets of papers to write the exams, the university is endeavoring to make the entire process “contactless”.Before entering the examination centres, students will be asked to submit an undertaking declaring themselves free of any symptom of Covid-19. They have been asked to carry their own paper sheets to write the exams; gadgets such as mobile phones or laptop to download the question paper, sanitisers, masks, gloves, and a transparent water bottle.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDU will conduct the second phase of the open-book exams for those who could not appear in the first phase held online between August 10 and August 31. This time, the exam will be conducted both online and offline (candidates can visit the university centre to attempt the exam). Also, students who failed to upload/submit the scanned images of the answer scripts during the first phase of exams, persons with disability (PWD) students and those who wish to improve their score in select exams can also sit for the second phase of exams.DU dean of colleges Balaram Pani said the varsity has decided to choose around 10 to 12 colleges in less crowded areas as examination centres. “As per a preliminary estimate, a majority of students have opted for the online mode in the second phase of OBE. So, the university has decided not to turn each and every college into an examination centre. But we will make sure to have at least one centre in all districts of Delhi. We are trying to avoid examination centres in on-campus colleges as that can lead to gatherings and compromise social distancing norms,” he said.In a detailed advisory issued to all colleges/departments late Sunday evening, DU has asked them to be ready with thermal scanners, sanitisers and masks before the exams commence. “We are yet to finalise all colleges. The registration for the second phase of exams will be complete by Tuesday evening. We will analyse the number of students opting for the offline exams and then finalise the exact number of colleges required. That’s why all the colleges have been asked to be ready with all the essentials,” Pani said.The exams will be conducted in two shifts -- 9 am to noon and 3pm to 6pm --- between September 14 and October 1. Colleges have been asked to sanitise the seating area before and after every shift. The seating arrangement will be made keeping a distance of 5 to 6 metres between seats, in accordance with guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC). “The seating plan will be communicated to the students a day in advance on their registered email/WhatsApp,” the advisory read. Among the colleges which have already been selected as exam centres is Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women in Vasundhara Enclave. College principal Payal Mago said they will have to procure more sanitising lotion as they estimate a usage of at least 10 litres a day. “We already have a few thermal guns but we will need more. We will need at least 10 litres of liquid sanitiser a day. Also, everything will be contactless. Students will put their answer copies in a drop box or tray. We will keep those trays or boxes in lockers for the next two or three days and sanitise them before sending them to the university,” she said.Another prospective college that can be turned into a centre is Rajdhani College in West Delhi’s Raja Garden. College principal Rajesh Giri said, “We are planning to have multiple entries and exit points to avoid crowding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sanitisers-masks-thermal-scanners-du-readies-for-contactless-open-book-exams-from-sep-14/story-QE186jYncbGOacTbNukivL.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Actor Rhea Chakraborty alleges Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister gave him banned drugs, files complaint with Mumbai Police||Actor Rhea Chakraborty was questioned for nearly eight hours by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday, as part of their probe into allegations of drug abuse in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Chakraborty also filed a complaint against Rajput’s sister on Monday, alleging she procured “unlawfully prescribed drugs” five days before Rajput died. Chakraborty is an accused in the case of Rajput’s death. She lived with Rajput till June 8, when he allegedly asked her to leave following a disagreement. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14. His father, KK Singh, alleged Chakraborty had abetted Rajput’s suicide in a complaint filed in Patna on July 28. Subsequently, NCB is probing allegations of drug abuse in the case. So far, the agency has arrested nine people in connection with this case, including Chakraborty’s brother Showik. On Monday, Chakraborty reached NCB’s office at 9.30am and left at 6pm, after being questioned for nearly eight hours. Deputy director general, NCB, Ashok Jain said, “Rhea has been sent home after today’s inquiry and we have asked her to join again tomorrow. She has been cooperating with the investigation. We are verifying and examining the information that we are receiving from the accused.” Chakraborty was questioned for nearly six hours on Sunday. On Monday, Chakraborty also filed a complaint against Rajput’s sister Priyanka Singh and Dr Tarun Kumar of New Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.In her complaint, Chakraborty has alleged Dr Kumar’s prescription for Rajput contains medication prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Deputy commissioner of police Manjunath Singe confirmed the receipt of the complaint. Chakraborty’s legal counsel Satish Maneshinde said the six-page complaint was submitted to Bandra police station on Monday, to register a first information report against Priyanka and Dr Kumar. The complaint states Rajput had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in addition to other mental health issues, and that he had “abruptly” stopped medication. It further alleges that Priyanka, who has no medical training, was sending Rajput medication, which Chakraborty discovered on June 8 after Rajput showed Chakraborty messages he had been exchanging with Priyanka. Chakraborty said she and Rajput had a disagreement when Rajput insisted he would only take the medicines Priyanka was sending him. Rajput then allegedly told Chakraborty to leave the house on June 8 and told her his other sister, Meetu Singh, was coming to live with him. The complaint goes on to state that Chakraborty found some messages exchanged between Rajput and Priyanka Singh to be “extremely disturbing” because they indicated that Priyanka had sent Rajput “a prescription by one Dr Tarun Kumar, an associate professor of cardiology from Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi”. The prescription was for “various medication controlled under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act”, alleges the complaint. Chakraborty has also said in her complaint that the prescription may be forged as it claims Rajput to be a patient in Delhi even though he was in Mumbai at the time. The prescription also suggests Dr Kumar had prescribed medication to Rajput without any consultation as mandated by law. Dr Kumar did not respond to HT’s calls or messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/actor-rhea-chakraborty-alleges-sushant-singh-rajput-s-sister-gave-him-banned-drugs-files-complaint-with-mumbai-police/story-e3BUMUByxqYLM4nxl2ETOK.html

From training staff members on verification of documents online to conducting video meetings with students and running them through the process, colleges in the city are doing it all.At Mulund’s VG Vaze College, authorities started preparing for the process three weeks before the first merit list, which was declared on August 30. “We told our staff members the whole process and ensured that document verification was smooth for them as well as for the students. If all staff members try to check documents on the portal, it can crash. So we decided to allot 20-25 students for each staff member. Our staff took contact numbers of students, called them and asked them to send a single PDF [of documents] on WhatsApp, which could be verified easily in a few minutes. This way, we completed admissions under the first round without any glitch,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, VG Vaze College. At Jai Hind College in Churchgate, the institute organised various online sessions with students to guide them through the process. “We did this even for degree college admissions. Students who faced difficulty in uploading documents or had any queries regarding the admission process, could get them solved without having to visit,” said Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind College. He said that in many cases, students had not uploaded the necessary documents. “Sometimes when we ask them about a certain document, they show it to us on camera but failed to upload it. So we guide them to upload them,” he added. This year, the entire FYJC admission process – from college application to confirming admissions and fee payment – is online. “The transition from offline to online was not so easy for college staff. During the day, I get at least a dozen calls from my staff members who are stuck either due to bad network or have some queries about the process. Everyone is working very hard to make sure students don’t suffer,” said the principal of a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-year-junior-college-admissions-in-mumbai-institutes-adapt-to-online-mode/story-cWZUem2harzJTk3WndNugM.html

08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Day 1 of Himachal’s monsoon session: Congress, BJP spar over corona crisis||Himachal’s monsoon session commenced on a fiery note on Monday with the ruling BJP and the opposition sniping at each other over the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the state. After the House paid tributes to departed leaders, the CM informed the House of the business for the day. However, speaker Vipin Singh Parmar asked the CM to tell the assembly about the government’s handling of the corona crisis. Objecting, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said his party had already given notice under Rule 67, demanding suspension of business to discuss the Covid crisis and that the matter was not being raised in a correct manner. He was supported by other members of the opposition. Pandemonium prevailed in the House as the opposition raised slogans for over 15 minutes . Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj tried to pacify the opposition, to no avail.When Bhardwaj said the opposition had nothing concrete to contribute to the discussion, they started raising slogans.Later, the speaker agreed to suspend business, which pacified the opposition. However, then BJP members resorted to sloganeering, which provoked the opposition , who started raising counter slogans. When forest minister Rakesh Pathania repeatedly came to the CM’s defence, a heated exchange ensued between Agnihotri and the minister. In response to Agnihotri’s charge that the government had abjectly failed in handling the Covid-19 crisis, the CM said the government had done an excellent job on that front. Agnihotri said the government’s actions were reminiscent of the emergency and that people were booked for sedition during the period. The CM, in turn, accused the opposition of resorting to ‘cheap politics’ over the pandemic. All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and Dalhousie legislator Asha Kumari targeted the government over wasteful expenditure during the crisis.Agnihotri raised the issue of Rajeev Bindal’s resignation from the post of BJP state president after a corruption scandal came to light. He asked why Bindal was forced to resign. “A scam took place in the health department under the nose of the CM. Raincoats were distributed instead of personal protective kits,” the Congress leader said. The CM said Bindal had resigned because of his moral values after the opposition created hullabaloo. He said Bindal had set a precedent for others. Referring to the allegations against social justice and empowerment minister Sarveen Chaudhary, he said there was an ongoing investigation against the minister and as such the government should reveal how much land was purchased by her. He also demanded that the entire cabinet, including the chief minister resign. Thakur said the opposition had earlier sought resignation from Bindal and when he resigned, they started gunning for his resignation. Thakur said he had never spoken about the vigilance bureau probing the land deal. “I had only said that a complaint was received, which is being examined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/day-1-of-himachal-s-monsoon-session-congress-bjp-spar-over-corona-crisis/story-waumRqcjXsI77PAsBIgAGO.html

The government has made an additional provision of ₹2,028 crore for health infrastructure in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The supplementary demands for public health services are over and above the annual budgetary outlay of ₹14,784 crore. Supplementary budget refers to additional expenditure required for the year for unforeseen expenses over and above the annual budget. The supplementary demands tabled by deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar also made a provision of ₹10,500 crore for farm loan waiver announced by the MVA government soon after assuming power last year. The state is expected to disburse ₹21,467 crore to 32.90 lakh farmers, who have been identified as eligible for waiver of loan up to ₹2 lakh. The global pandemic has put the burden on the state exchequer since its outbreak in March. The state has already spent more than ₹7,000 crore of the outlay of ₹14,784 crore of the public health and medical education department. The supplementary demands of ₹2,028 crore (₹1665 crore for public health and ₹363 crore for medical education) raised on Monday are for purchase of ambulances (₹50 crore), premium of mediclaim, staple food in primary health care centres in rural areas (₹69 crore), among others.

A total of ₹129 crore has been earmarked for it; also ₹300 crore have been budgeted for purchase of equipment in medical colleges and ₹50 crore for primary health centres. The state has also announced ex-gratia to policemen who died due to Covid-19 and ₹30 crore has been earmarked for it. “The allocation done for the public health and medical education department is over and above the budgetary outlay,” said Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance department. The two departments were excluded from the 67% cut initiated to the budgetary outlay by the state owing to the revenue losses amid lockdown. The government has also made allocation of ₹12,000 crore towards the payment of overdraft from Reserve Bank of India during the lockdown. The supplementary demands also have provision of ₹825 crore for rural development, ₹500 crore for urban development, ₹856 crore for social justice, ₹441 crore for agriculture and ₹305 crore for water resources department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-session-of-maharashtra-assembly-mva-government-seeks-29-084-crore-for-extra-expenses/story-sQcV8WIb8Ls9FzRSlQaOJM.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon session of Maharashtra Assembly: Ruckus over gram panchayat administrator||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Opposition Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) locked horns on the first day of monsoon session over tabling a Bill to appoint a “suitable person” as administrator on close to 15,000 gram panchayats, whose term is ending by this year-end. The Opposition objected to the Bill saying that the Bombay high court has clearly said that a public servant can be appointed on the position and not any private person as intended by the state government. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis alleged the state was misusing its power by pushing the Bill when the matter is pending in the high court. He also said it is a sort of contempt of court. The politically significant gram panchayat, functions as local self-government at village level and is headed by a sarpanch. The term of 1,566 gram panchayats ended till June, while the term of the remaining 12,668 end in the July-December period. Elections to these gram panchayats could not be conducted due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. The Bill empowers the state to appoint a suitable person as administrator in case elections cannot be held after completion of five-year term of a gram panchayat following unavoidable condition. As soon as the rural development minister Hasan Mushrif tabled the Bill, the opposition leader raised his objection. Mushrif said that they are tabling the Bill and discussion will be held on Tuesday. On Monday, the state government tabled a total 13 Bills in the state Assembly. Meanwhile, former allies Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party will come face to face in the poll to elect the deputy chairman of the legislative council on Tuesday. Sena’s Neelam Gorhe is the MVA candidate, while the BJP has fielded Vijay (Bhai) Girkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-session-of-maharashtra-assembly-ruckus-over-gram-panchayat-administrator/story-ivezhDpCc5jVylWiRpSYSN.html

Everyday, sampling begins before 11am and caters to 20-25 people.The initiative was planned keeping in mind the increasing number of cases and the subsequent increase in demand for testing. Anyone with mild or moderate symptoms can get themselves tested at this drive-through facility.Dr Manohar Singh, senior medical officer, said the initiative was being appreciated widely. “People line in front of the testing window while seated in their vehicles, give their samples and drive out of the hospital. We request the people to register for the test in advance, maybe a day before, to minimise time in the hospital. Although people without prescriptions can also come directly to the Flu Corner and get registered for testing.”Dr Ishan Sharma, nodal officer for Covid-19, Kharar, said, “A 15-minute time slot is allocated to each vehicle, but the entire sample collection process lasts for not more than 5 to 6 minutes. We have kept a buffer period to avoid overcrowding and overlapping. Also, we need sufficient time to sanitise the place.”Kamal Tiwana of Kharar said, “Earlier, we were scared to get our test done anticipating rush in one room. With the drive-through facility, I got my family tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharar-civil-hospital-now-offers-15-minute-drive-through-covid-test/story-hev2EJzlLchNfU08P6vOMO.html

Nearly 80 people attended the gathering.Sheth NKTT College in Thane had organised a lunch programme on Monday morning inviting nearly 100 people including teachers and non-teaching staff of the college.As per the guidelines issued by the Central and the state government, gatherings of over 50 people are not permitted currently. Teachers said that the programme was organised by the college principal. “All the staff members were asked to attend college. Many had to attend because they were asked to and had to travel with a lot of risks. The college has also been asking us to come every day and conduct online classes from the college thus putting our lives at a big risk,” said a staff member. Dilip Patil, principal of the college said that it was a personal and private event. “We have not broken any rules and it was an internal event. Our staff has been coming to work as the university has asked us to do so,” he said.The state government circular dated August 30, which is based on a circular by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), has reiterated that all schools, colleges and educational institutes including coaching classes will remain shut till September 30 and that classes shall only be conducted virtually.In a circular issued to affiliated colleges on September 2 however, the University of Mumbai stated that ‘only Class 1 and 2 officials of colleges have to follow the 100% attendance norm. “Class 2 and 3 employees should consider 30% attendance or 30 people at most, whichever is greater,” it states. MU had issued a different version of the same circular on September 2, after Mission Unlock was announced by the state government.While repeated calls and messages to MU pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni went unanswered, a spokesperson said that the university circular is in line with the state government circular. Recently, the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU) wrote to the joint director of higher education highlighting the confusion.“The University of Mumbai, in their recent circular has mixed up these two sections and made it look like teachers and staff need to be present even though colleges being private institutes do not have any concept of Class 1 and 2 officers,” said Madhu Paranjape, general secretary, Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU).Paranjape said in the absence of clear guidelines, colleges were calling teachers and non-teaching staff regularly.“Colleges are also confused and insisting on teaching and non-teaching staff attendance without understanding that as per the government, teachers are not part of essential services, hence they are not even allowed to travel by trains,” Paranjape said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-college-conducts-gathering-with-80-people-violates-covid-19-lockdown-rules/story-Akv4CCrKO5amxMYJO2wCvN.html

08-09-2020||Delhi||DERC announces 50% reduction in fixed power charges for commercial consumers for April and May||The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on Monday announced the reduction of fixed charges by 50% on unused sanctioned load for non-domestic consumers in the Capital. The order, a temporary relief valid for two months, will benefit over 1 million industrial and commercial consumers in Delhi. The power regulator’s order means that those industries, shops and offices which were completely shut during the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May will now be charged only 50% of the fixed charge for the two months. The DERC directed the private distribution companies to adjust the refund value for the two months in the upcoming next two bills of beneficiaries.The order comes just three days after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 4 assured representatives of trade and industry associations that his government would provide relief on the fixed power charges that commercial and industrial units are obliged to pay despite economic losses due to Covid-19. Responding to the DERC’s order on Monday, Kejriwal tweeted: “The Delhi government stands with the people of Delhi in this hour of crisis. This relief in fixed charges will help lakhs of people to face the hardships caused by Corona.”A senior DERC official explained that the benefit will not be limited to just those who consumed zero units in April and May. “The Commission has divided the cost into two parts. The first part is the maximum demand indicator (MDI) which the consumer will be charged at the prescribed rates. The second part is the sanctioned load, the cost of which will be charged at 50% - Rs 125/kVA/month instead of Rs 250/kVA/month,” the official said on condition of anonymity.This means if a factory has a sanctioned load of 100 kVA and it consumed only 5 kVA in April during the lockdown, then it will be charged Rs 13,125 for that month instead of Rs 25,000.Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain said the impact of the fixed charge waiver is expected to be around Rs 160 crore. “This will benefit around 44,000 industrial consumers and around 10 lakh non-domestic/commercial consumers. The total un-utilised power capacity in Delhi during the lockdown months was 80%, out of which 84% pertained to non-domestic consumers and 75% for industrial consumers,” Jain said.Of the three power discoms, maximum industrial units fall under the Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) which supplies power to 35,000 industries. Trade and industry associations welcome the move, even as residents welfare associations (RWAs) rued that some relief should have been granted to domestic consumers as well.Sandeep Khandelwal, chairman, Delhi hotels and restaurant’s owner’s association (DHROA), said the decision will provide relief to 3,000 budget hotels in the city, which recently got permission to resume business. “Waiving off fixed charges in electricity bills was our main demand during our meeting with the chief minister. We are glad that the DERC and the Delhi government have been receptive to our problems,” Khandelwal said. Saurabh Gandhi, secretary of United Residents of Delhi, an umbrella body of RWAs which is active in matters related to power in the city, said fixed charges should be subsidised for domestic consumers as well for the lockdown months. “Instead, the DERC and the Delhi government increased the burden on domestic consumers by increasing the pension surcharge from 3.8% to 5% in the latest power tariff order. Ideally, the government should bear the cost of payment to the Delhi Vidyut Board pensioners. Nowhere else does it happen that citizens directly pay for the pension of a company. This is unfair. Also, the DERC did not pay heed to our request of reducing fixed charges,” he said. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta questioned the independence and autonomy of the DERC. “DERC is a quasi-judicial and autonomous body. The Arvind Kejriwal government is trying to distract the people of Delhi to derail the agitation of domestic consumers against the fixed charges. With this order, the Kejriwal government and the DERC have taken care of the interests of power companies. Fixed charges should be waived off even for domestic consumers and for a period till June at least, since in Delhi, the lockdown continued till then,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/derc-announces-50-reduction-in-fixed-power-charges-for-commercial-consumers-for-april-and-may/story-WTnOEPITcALr1fgKeWSQxI.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: NIA arrests two members of Kabir Kala Manch||The National Investigating Agency (MIA) on Monday arrested Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor, both members of Kabir Kala Manch which allegedly organised Elgar Parishad in December 2017. The two were named in the original first information report (FIR) registered by Pune Police against the organisers held at Shaniwarwada on December 31, 2017. According to the FIR registered on January 8, 2018 based on a complaint lodged by real estate developer Tushar Damgude at Vishrambaug police station, members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) incited violence by disrupting communal harmony. According to Damgude, members of Kabir Kala Manch spread hatred through provocative songs, plays and speeches delivered at Elgar Parishad which led to wide spread violence followed by the Bhima-Koregaon incident.Senior counsel Mihir Desai, for Gorkhe and Gaichor, said, “The two are falsely arrested by NIA. They were named in original FIR registered in 2018 and their houses were raided in April 2018. Nothing was found against them. Now after two years, they have been arrested.” Desai called the action by NIA highhanded and alleged this was a move to scare the people. The two will be produced before the special NIA court on Tuesday where the probing agency will seek their custody for interrogation. After their arrest, Kabir Kala Manch released a recently recorded video of Gaichor and Gorkhe in which they alleged that NIA pressured them to admit their links with maoist outfit and turn approver in the case. “Despite NIA’s threat that they would arrest us if we do not turn approver, we refused to accept it saying we have stated facts. Today, the agency has once again called us for inquiry and they may even arrest us,” Gaichor was seen claiming in the video.Gorkhe and Gaichor along with nine other members of Kabir Kala Manch were earlier arrested in 2011 by Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad for alleged maoist connection. The duo were later granted bail by the Supreme Court in January 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-arrests-two-members-of-kabir-kala-manch/story-YEfniTnpdB6lWpqRVms68O.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||City may see 2,000 cases daily for the next 30 days: Mumbai civic chief||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expects to detect around 2,000 Covid-19 cases daily for the next 30 days, as it has planned to increase the number of tests to up to 14,000 a day amid the surge, civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Monday. Chahal, however, appealed to the citizens not to panic, as the rise would be a result of increased testing. He also said the civic body will conduct more RT-PCR instead of rapid antigen tests for accurate results. Chahal said Mumbai has the capacity to conduct up to 15,000 tests daily. BMC had started to conduct 9,000 cases from the last week of August. An addition of 2,000 cases daily would mean the city could hit the 200,000 mark by October 10. “The strategy of BMC to substantially ramp up the tests from an average testing of 7,619 daily in August to 10,000-14,000 in September, will result in an increase of average number of positive cases from 1,000-1,300 to 1,700-2,000 daily. We will effectively utilise the large number of vacant Covid beds available in the city of Mumbai. It will help accelerate the arrest of the spread of the virus in Mumbai. Therefore, it is humbly submitted that there should not be any panic created by sudden increase of positive number of cases in Mumbai,” said Chahal. Over the past 10 days, the city has been reporting between 1,100 and 1,900 Covid-19 cases daily. The number of active cases has also gone up to over 23,000 cases from up to 20,000. BMC had earlier attributed the spike to festivals coupled with relaxations in lockdown restrictions norms and aggressive testing. “We expect Mumbai to report around 2,000 Covid-19 cases daily for the next 30 days. I have given targets to my officers. Our focus will be detecting patients using the RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Rapid antigen detection test kits will be used for more focused testing such as those who are suspected Covid-19 patients because of their pronounced symptoms,” said Chahal. RT-PCR tests are considered the golden standard for Covid testing and the results come in 24-48 hours. In case of rapid antigen tests, the results are out in 30 minutes. According to BMC’s protocol, every negative symptomatic patient has to go through RT-PCR test. He added: “We cannot use rapid antigen test kits randomly on the public or on frontline workers battling the pandemic. The positivity rate is 4% and 25% for rapid antigen and RT-PCR test, respectively. We will follow the latter. We have the capacity to conduct around 15,000 tests daily that include both the testing methods.” BMC officials said over 820,000 Covid-19 tests have been conducted till date, including antigen tests that account for less than a lakh. Currently, the civic authorities are conducting up to 2,000 antigen tests daily. Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the consistent low-testing figures led to high positivity and Covid-19-related fatality rates in the state and Mumbai. He cited the Delhi model in a bid to tackle the outbreak. Putting this in context, Chahal said, “There are times when I am told that Delhi is doing more tests, as compared to Mumbai. Delhi has conducted over 16 lakh tests, including over five lakh via the RT-PCR method. So far, Mumbai has conducted over 800,000 tests, including over 90,000 rapid antigen tests. RT-PCR is giving more positivity rate. Simultaneously, we will also do antigen tests. But RT-PCR rates will be done in a more focused manner.” The civic authorities said they are prepared for the surge. Chahal said, “We will be able to handle up to 4,000 Covid-19 cases daily. At least 60% to 70% positive cases are asymptomatic, requiring home quarantine only. The availability of beds for symptomatic positive cases in Mumbai will not be an issue at all, even if the number of positive cases, on an average, goes beyond 2,000 every day. It is also important to submit here that BMC is adding 250 additional ICU beds on the dashboard in next three days to ensure that at least 350+ ICU beds remain vacant every day, as an assurance to the citizens of Mumbai.” Meanwhile, experts said increasing testing is the only way forward. Dr Kedar Toraskar, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said, “The way forward is testing, tracing, isolating and treating. We will have to keep doing this even after vaccine is out in the market. We also have to conduct more aggressive contact-tracing.” Subhasree Ray, clinical nutritionist and public health professional, said, “Incremental testing is crucial to find all possible infections in a community. A five-day analysis from Mumbai revealed the average test positivity rate for Covid-19 was 17.96%. Increase in testing might lower this test positivity rate, will facilitate effective contact tracing, and allow the infected to get early treatment, thus decreasing the mortality rate. Currently, Mumbai’s fatality rate is 5.05%, whereas the national fatality rate is 1.7%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-may-see-2-000-cases-daily-for-the-next-30-days-mumbai-civic-chief/story-SfU0v70dErw1ymn5zwLWyH.html

As part of the project, they will publish a list of registered plasma donors online. “A bank of plasma donors is the need of the hour. People keep searching for donors, which wastes their time during treatment. The list will help them find a donor easily and get the treatment on time,” said Prashant Patil, secretary of IMA, Kalyan chapter.Once a donor who recovered from Covid infection and is willing to donate their plasma registers online, doctors will contact them, check all the criteria and ask them to donate the plasma with the respected blood banks. The donor will have to share their name, blood group and address so that they can be contacted. The entire process of donation will be free of cost. The details can be registered at the link https://forms.gle/t3pBb6kTrZCj87b8A. For any other queries related to the plasma donation, one can call the KDMC war room at 0251-2211373.“These plasmas will be frozen at the blood banks and will be used for the treatment of Covid patients when in need,” added Patil. Those who require the plasma can approach designated Arpan and Sankalp blood banks and get it from there. “This is one of the needs of the hour as people don’t know where to get the plasma. Treatments often get delayed due to the endless search. This single platform for plasma donors will help solve the troubles,” said Rupesh Naik, 37, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan (West).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-civic-body-initiates-plasma-donation-drive-to-make-list-of-donors-available-online-for-covid-19-patients/story-CFpvDCooORf08J0BuyB8yK.html

Last year, during the same period the civic body managed to collect only ₹42.05 crores of property tax. The highest property tax was collected from Majhiwada-Manpada ward office at ₹46.08 crores. A special team under additional commissioner Sanjay Herwade was formed at ward levels to collect property tax. This team started collecting tax from July 16 onwards, “Initial few months all our efforts were towards controlling the spread of the virus. But July onwards, we divided our focus and residents have also supported and paid tax with all honesty. We shall focus on increasing our tax collection amount every year henceforth,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-municipal-corporation-collects-152-crores-of-property-tax-within-1-5-months/story-YCYgO2nrAc5l4MQv1AGnbJ.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to add 350 ICU beds as Covid-19 cases rise again||With the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to add 350 intensive care unit (ICU) beds over the next three days to ensure patients get timely treatment.At present, the civic body has around 1,400 ICU beds in their hospitals which will increase to 1,750.The dashboard of BMC shows that till Sunday, of the 1,399 Covid-19 ICU beds in the city, 1,247 were occupied and only 154 beds were available. Private hospitals have 528 ICU beds, of which only 38 were vacant. In case of ventilator beds, only 43 of the total 931 are vacant. With the pandemic curve rising again in the city after cases having plateaued for two months, the civic body is gearing up to add more beds in its facilities. Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said since the civic body has been gradually increasing the number of beds, patients are not facing hurdles in finding ICU beds in emergency situations, unlike at the beginning of the outbreak in March. “There is a certain crisis of beds in private hospitals, but enough beds are available in public hospitals. To ensure patients do not face any crisis, we are starting with 350 additional ICU beds in the next three days,” he said. The jumbo Covid-19 facilities in Mahalaxmi and Goregaon will get 30 and 220 new ICU beds, respectively. The inauguration is likely to be done in a few days.According to BMC’s data, the city has reported 11,035 Covid-19 cases in the past seven days, following which the number of active cases increased to 23,930 on September 6 from 20,554 on August 31. The city is currently the second worst-affected district in the country after Pune. In terms of active cases, Mumbai is in the fourth position after Pune and Thane in the state.Health experts have attributed the sudden rise in cases to lack of adherence to social distancing norms during Ganpati festival. “For almost two months, the pandemic curve in the city had flattened. On an average, daily Covid-19 cases were below 1,000. But now, it has increased to over 1,900 cases daily. There will again be a demand for hospital beds. So, it is better to stay prepared and keep the beds ready,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-add-350-icu-beds-as-covid-19-cases-rise-again/story-Y2qgKdSMS5UuJUcJNaWZGL.html

There was a lack of monitoring from the varsity officials.Since the lockdown began, the single-window enquiry is the only place that assists students with queries related to documents, admissions, examinations and fees. In the last few days, an increase in the number of students visiting the window has been witnessed.According to an official at the window, on an average over 100 students arrive here with their queries. There are proper markings made for social distancing but most visitors do not follow the norms. Superintendent of the PU’s single window inquiry Kiran Rani said, “We have been constantly asking visitors to follow the norms.”Chief of university security, professor Ashwani Koul, said, “I request all the visitors to maintain social distancing and other precautionary norms in order to save themselves and people around them including officials who are serving during these tough times.

The Panvel city police have booked 19 party workers following the incident.The group led by local MNS party worker Yogesh Chile entered the Virupaksha temple in Panvel and opened the temple by allegedly breaking the lock, said police.After forcefully entering the temples, the group of party workers, with masks strapped under their chin and without following social distancing norms, performed an elaborate ritual in the temple.Addressing the media present at the temple during their ‘agitation’, Chile said, “In the unlock phase, there is a crowd at malls and bus stops and even at wine shops. The government does not see this crowd, but they fear opening temples will spread coronavirus. Our leader Raj Thackeray had called for the opening of temples and we are following it.”The Panvel police have booked 19 persons under section 188 of Indian Penal Code for violating orders and the MNS workers have been issued notices.“Devotees are not allowed inside the temple as per the government notification.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccine trials in Mumbai’s KEM Hospital likely by Friday||The King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, will start phase II and III trials of Oxford-AstraZeneca, a promising vaccine for coronavirus, mostly by September 11. This will be followed by the other civic-run hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central. As HT reported earlier, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in the third week of August, sent two queries to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), asking about the budget and insurance of the volunteers who will participate in the trial. Finally, after over two weeks of delays, on Monday, the ICMR responded to queries from KEM Hospital. But Nair Hospital is yet to get a response from the council. “On Monday evening, we received a response from ICMR. I am yet to go through the details of it. But we will tentatively start the trial at KEM hospital by September 11. Then, in the second, we will initiate it in Nair Hospital,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The Nair Hospital has selected 100 volunteers for the clinical trial, but cannot start the process until the council responds to them. “We have been sending them reminders everyday, but no one responds. Despite having the volunteers, we can’t start the trial,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. All the volunteers have been tested for Covid-19 through rapid antigen test (RAT) to overrule the presence of the virus. Also, they have been examined for Covid-19 antibodies to check if they were ever exposed to the infection in the past.Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume, and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca partnered together to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been named as Covidshield in India.Already phase I of the trial has been completed in July, which has received promising responses. This will be the II and III trial of the vaccine. After the completion of the II trial, the reports will be submitted to the Data Safety Monitoring Board, to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization for the III stage of the trial.In the earlier trials, it has been observed that he volunteers injected with two dosages induce a strong immune response. It provoked a T-cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the coronavirus) response within 14 days of vaccination, and an antibody response within 28 days. The study was published in science journal Lancet.Along with that KEM Hospital from August 21 has already started the other clinical trial on anti-tuberculosis vaccination—Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) — to treat Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-vaccine-trials-in-mumbai-s-kem-hospital-likely-by-friday/story-wi0Ol9z3uHpkW9pdeLQ0eI.html
08-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra accounts for over 25% of India’s active Covid-19 cases||A day after the state went past 900,000 Covid-19 cases, it breached the 27,000 mark for deaths with the highest number of deaths, 423, reported in a day, taking the count to 27,027. With 16,429 new cases, a relative drop from the past few days, the state tally stood at 923,641. However, more importantly, the active caseload of the state is 236,934, which is more than a fourth of the total (882,542) across the country. With 14,922 patients having recovered in the past 24 hours, the total number of recovered patients touched 659,322, translating into a recovery rate of 71.38%. The national recovery rate is (77.31%).State government has, in its fourth revision, slashed the RT-PCR rates to bring them down to ₹1,200-₹2,000, from the earlier rates ranging between ₹1,900 and ₹2,500. Of the new fatalities, 217 were from past 48 hours, 96 from past week, while the remaining 110 were from the period before it, the health department stated. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stood at 2.93 %, much above the national rate of 1.72%. Over the last week, the positivity rate has been hovering around 24-25%, which stood at 28.23% on Monday, as 16,429 tested positive from 58,190 samples. On Monday, Mumbai reported 1,788 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 157,410. It also recorded 31 deaths, taking the toll to 7900. Pune district continued to be on the top in terms of new daily infections with 4,165 new cases on Monday. Pune city clocked 2,037, Pune rural logged 929, while Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 1,199 new infections. Nagpur district added 152 fatalities, including 149 in the city alone, while Pune district reported 41 deaths, including 27 in Pune city. Mumbai reported 31 deaths, while 30 fatalities were reported in Panvel. State authorities are wary about the rising number of cases over the past few days. “We were expecting the spurt in cases after opening up interdistrict movement, allowing more workforce in private and public offices immediately after the Ganesh festival. The number will keep rising at least for two more weeks. Our mechanism for the tracking and tracing of high- and low-risk contacts is resulting in the rapid rise in number. The lack of coordination between public health and medical education department has resulted in a hindrance in ramping up infrastructure in a few districts, where there is a surge in cases,” said an official from the public health department.The officer said that they expect the aggressive tracking and more number of testing through the ‘chase the virus’ drive being launched across the state.Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said, “The number is growing because of the aggressive testing in Mumbai and reset of the state. We should not be worried about the spike until the fatality rate is steady or decreasing. If you see, in Mumbai, when there were 10,000 cases reported in a week in May, the deaths per week were 350, against about 200 a week now, when the cases have again increased to 10,000 a week. Elsewhere in Maharashtra, the number is rising because of the high number of cases, but it should be supplemented with aggressive tracking and isolation of the infected.”Dr Supe said that the rising number cannot be called a second wave. “We will have to carefully study the pattern for few days before coming to any such conclusion. I think the number of cases will keep rising till Diwali or early December. In Mumbai, if we could manage well, the number could come down below 1,000 cases a day in next few days. In peripheral areas, weak infrastructure could be one of the reasons for the spike in cases,” he said.The state government has once again reduced the rate of Covid-19 test to Rs1,200 from Rs1,900 revised exactly a month ago. The rates will be applicable for the samples taken at the collections sites. The test rate has been slashed to Rs1,600 from Rs2,200 for sample collections from Covid Care Centres, hospitals. The rates for the home collection of samples have been reduced to Rs2,000 from Rs2,500. The rates are inclusive of all taxes and necessary consumables like PPE kits, RT-PCR kits, VTM among others.The rates were revised four times so far, on June 13, July 4 and August 7, to bring them down to from the initial rates ranging between Rs4,500 to Rs5,200. The rates were revised on Monday after the standing committee of experts and officers submitted its fresh report on the revision. “‘After the unlocking measures and more manufacturers started operating the equipment and consumables required for the tests, they have become cheaper. The number of laboratories approved by the ICMR and NABL, too, has increased. In this backdrop, the revision of the rate was necessary, which has been done using the powers conferred under Epidemic Diseases Act,” the circular issued by the public health department has stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-accounts-for-over-25-of-india-s-active-covid-19-cases/story-QQB5v9NMUZqyw0XE6ISHeO.html
08-09-2020||City||Haryana Police inspector shot at: FIR registered; police probe gang rivalry||Gurugram: A day after a Haryana police inspector was allegedly shot at by unidentified assailants outside a real estate office in Palam Vihar, the police registered an FIR in the case after the statement of the victim, inspector Sonu Malik, was recorded Monday evening. Police said an FIR was registered against unidentified persons under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Palam Vihar police station.The shooting, police said, could be linked to a gang rivalry involving the police officer’s uncle’s murder in Rohtak in 2017. In December 2017, Malik’s uncle, Satyawan, was shot dead by gangsters in Rohtak allegedly in retaliation to the killing of gangster Sandeep Badwasni and his two associates in Sonepat. In Badwasni’s murder, which took place in February 2017, Satyawan was one of the accused persons. Police said the suspects could be members of the Badwasni gang, who had allegedly issued multiple threats to the victim in the past. Malik is presently posted in the commando complex in Newal, Karnal. He was earlier posted in the Special Task Force (STF), Haryana police. In the police complaint, Malik said that around 8pm on Sunday, he was walking to his car after meeting a relative in Dharam Colony market when two men walked up to him and allegedly opened fire with the intention of killing him. He suffered one gunshot wound. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “According to the complainant, he grabbed a gun from his car and fired at least three shots in the air in retaliation. The accused managed to escape. Several crime branch teams and teams from the local police station are working to solve the case. Prima facie, a family dispute is suspected. The accused must have conducted a recee and were aware of the officer’s movements.” Police said the probe revealed that the accused had allegedly parked a Maruti A Star car near the spot and they had trailed him earlier in the evening. At least three gunshots were fired by the accused, but two misfired. Police have recovered cartridges of 7.62 mm from the spot. Malik had courted controversy in 2017 and a departmental enquiry was initiated against him after an audio clip, in which he was purportedly talking to a gangster in jail over the phone, surfaced on social media. He was in-charge of the crime branch in Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar at the time. Subsequently, he was suspended and sent to police lines. He was also accused of harbouring criminals and booked under section 216 of IPC in Gohana in the subsequent murder probe Badwasni. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-police-inspector-shot-at-fir-registered-police-probe-gang-rivalry/story-d6KWlTpwWUJJNj9lYv7CmJ.html

The meeting regarding constituting of the city’s drainage plan was held at the MCG’s Sector 34 office and was chaired by Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG. “The first step by the committee would be to identify all the waterlogging prone areas for which all the councillors and RWAs have been requested to provide information on all such points in their area along with solutions, if any, by September 14. The committee will also take suggestions from local residents as they may have important inputs to share which can be incorporated into the final plan,” said Kaur. Once such points are identified, site visits will be conducted by the committee as well as the officers of MCG along with the ward councillors to assess the feasibility of proposed solutions, Kaur said.“Detailed discussions were done on all kinds of solutions such as repairing and construction of rainwater harvesting structures (RHS) and storm water drains, channelizing water to nearby ponds,” a release issued by MCG stated.Another decision taken by the committee members was to take voluntary services of experts and engineers having experience in dealing with the drainage issues in urban areas. MCG officials said that the committee will meet twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays until a final detailed report of the drainage plan is submitted to MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and mayor Madhu Azad on September 30.A matter on the adverse waterlogging across Gurugram, especially Golf Course Road, sectors 27 and 28, during August 19 and 20 rains was raised during the MCG House meeting on August 28.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid impact in Maharashtra: Environment situation better, but biomedical waste surged, says MPCB||Maharashtra witnessed an improvement in all environmental parameters during the four complete lockdown phases enforced by the Covid-19 pandemic between March 21 and May 31 this year, except for an unprecedented rise in biomedical waste (BMW). A study by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) through Pune-based environment consultant Technogreen Environmental Solutions, ‘Impact Evaluation of Covid Pandemic Conceptualized by on Environmental Attributes’, published on July 31, was recently released on its website. It evaluated and quantified improvements under three umbrella parameters of air, water quality and solid waste management due to restricted activities across sectors during the four pandemic-enforced lockdown (L) phases — L1 (March 25 to April 14), L2 (April 15 to May 3), L3 (May 4 to 17) and L4 (May 18 to 31).“Though the virus has acted as an invisible enemy, the lockdown gave us the opportunity to investigate and understand environmental sustainability during nature’s corrective process. Our results can be beneficial for the scientific community and policy makers to not only assess impacts of the lockdown, but develop a corrective action plan using results as baseline or data for future research,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.The only negative impact during lockdown restrictions saw BMW rise to an average of 90.6 tonnes per day (TPD), an increase by 45% from the average 62.5 TPD before Covid-19. “It posed a challenge to the managers, transporters as well as facility handlers with almost 70,000 Covid-19 patients by May 31,” the report said adding that the quantity of BMW (including Covid-19) waste doubled from L1 to L4. “Even though BMW may have increased, corrective steps were taken to ensure there is proper collection, segregation, and treatment at every level across Maharashtra. Any incidental issues are monitored closely and being reviewed to ensure immediate resolution,” said Amar Supate, principal scientific officer and head of BMW management, MPCB. The report identified 60% average improvement in air quality (particulate matter and gaseous pollutants) during the four lockdown phases, and 80-90% reduction in industrial emissions. Overall pollutant load across Maharashtra saw an 86% reduction during L1, 73% reduction in L2, 64% by L3 and 58% L4.Air pollution sources studied included industries, thermal power plants, transport sector, and combined pollutant load from area sources (hotels, bakeries, street vendors and construction activities). With 92,000-odd industries in Maharashtra, only 2,362 were functioning during L1 which was scaled up to 76,300 by L4. Industrial activity took a hit due to reduced use of fuel consumption from 9.5 lakh tons per day to 80% decline in L1 and by 53.8% in L4, the report said. This led to an average reduction of 83% particulate matter (PM10) and 90% for gases (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide). Similarly, thermal power plants were generating 21,176 megawatt-hour electricity using coal at 3.55 lakh TPD prior to lockdown with emissions ranging from 1,000TPD for PM10, 1,100TPD for SO2, and 600TPD of NOx, which fell by 27%, 24%, 15% and 11% during four lockdown phases.The transport sector, which witnesses 472 crore km per day travelled by vehicles usually (prior to lockdown) on a road network of about 3 lakh km in Maharashtra witnessing tailpipe emissions of 667 TPD and 4,962 TPD emission from re-suspended dust, fell by 5%, 22%, 24% and 23% during the four phases. Lastly, area sources saw a decline of 98% during lockdown 1 and even by lockdown 4 was 86% for PM10 and 45% for other gases.Meanwhile, an 80% improvement in biochemical oxygen demand (primary water quality parameter) for major river basins such as Tapi, Godavari, and other west flowing rivers was recorded. The observed improvement in water quality saw limited activity wherein 1,656 tons of BOD load was avoided during lockdown, of which 75% was reduced in rivers, 15% in seas, and remaining 10% in ponds, lakes etc. Residential solid waste was the only major contributor towards waste management whereas a total shutdown of commercial activities and restaurants reduced overall waste burden by 58% during L1 to 35% by L4. “It can be conclusively stated that the slowdown with restrictions of activities has had a direct positive impact on almost all essential environmental attributes, except for the BMW parameter,” the report concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-impact-in-maharashtra-environment-situation-better-but-biomedical-waste-surged-says-mpcb/story-UsyGEQFPRX1tZ9aGFZ92DI.html
08-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Test positivity rate increases to 11.4 % after almost two months||Gurugram: Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in the district, the test positivity rate (TPR) touched a high of 11.4% on Monday, said officials from the district health department. It is after almost two months that the positivity rate has climbed above 10%, they said.The average daily TPR was 7% in the last week of August, according to the health department data.  The data shows that the new positive cases have almost doubled in the first week of September when compared to the week before. Between September 1 and 7, at least 1,551 new cases were reported, while 869 people were found positive in the district from August 25 to 31. With 147 new Covid-19 cases reported on Monday, the total tally of positive cases in the district has reached 13,468. Gurugram currently has 1,682 active cases. Two deaths were also confirmed on Monday, taking the toll due to Covid-19 in the district to 139. With the increase in the cases, the positivity rate has too climbed up. The uptick in the positivity rate is an indication of higher transmission in the district, the officials said. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The district health department has been conducting nearly 2,000 tests every day, while private labs are doing over 600 tests. The overall testing has increased from 2,000 to 2,500 a day. The strategy is to further increase the testing to 3,000 per day. The current positivity rate is 11.4%.” “Testing is the only tool to identify new cases at the earliest. It would impact the daily growth rate of the cases which is presently 2.29%. Till August, the daily growth rate was almost or below 1%,” Yadav added. Between June 30 and July 20, Gurugram’s positivity rate declined from 13.05% to around 8.48%. With rapid antigen tests being conducted in large numbers as compared to RT-PCR tests, an overall dip in the positive cases was detected. On August 18, the TPR stood at 6.95%. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a positivity rate of less than 5% indicates that the epidemic is under control. According to the district health bulletin, 2,673 tests were conducted in both government and private labs on Monday. Till now, 1,83,903 tests have been done in the district, out of which 1,67,762 tested negative and 13,468 were positive. The positivity rate of the RT-PCR tests is 12-14% and almost 3% for rapid antigen test. At least 183 people infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus are currently undergoing treatment in hospitals, while 11,647 have recovered from the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-test-positivity-rate-increases-to-11-4-after-almost-two-months/story-MI4HxN9Qiq2XeFy91GgrMN.html
08-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Residents of sectors 82 to 84 complain of long power cuts||Gurugram: Residents of sectors 82 to 84 said on Monday that they have been facing unscheduled power cuts lasting between six and eight hours every day for the last one month. The 66 KVA transformer in their area is not enough, they claimed, adding that regular faults are reported from underground cables. The residents alleged they have complained to Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), the state-run power distribution company, and the developer, but did not get a positive response. Whenever there is a breakdown, the DHBVN team takes at least two days after receiving the complaint to find the root cause of the problem and two more days to rectify it, they claimed. In private localities, DHBVN supplies electricity but the bill is raised by the developers, while Huda sectors, municipal areas and villages get direct power supply. Around 15,000 residents live in the three sectors, according to the facility management company engaged by Vatika Group that has developed the residential areas in these sectors. Yashesh Yadav, a resident of Vatika India Next, a residential society in Sector 83, said, “The demand has grown by leaps and bounds and we need uninterrupted power supply. Regular faults are reported from the transformer, either it should be replaced or the load has to be increased for the area.” As the area comes under newly developed sectors, DHBVN is still working on plans to increase capacity in the area. At present, Vatika India Next is getting electricity from Garhi Harsaru substation, said discom officials. The power backup facility is optional in these sectors and the residents alleged that they have not taken the connection from the developer due to high charges. The residents have to pay Rs 375 as rental charges each month for the power backup and Rs 20 per unit for using the facility. Anand Saxena, a resident of Vatika City Homes in Sector 83, said that the developer had given assurance that power supply will be uninterrupted. “The newly laid cables often cause fault due to which the main power supply is interrupted. Many people are working from home, while children have to attend online classes. So, it becomes difficult to manage without power for six hours daily,” he said. AK Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), Enviro (management wing of Vatika Group), said that the power cut at sectors 82, 83 and 84 is due to the fault arising at DHBVN side. “Last week there was a problem in the Daulatabad line, which feeds into Garhi Harsaru substation, which in turn supplies to these sectors. We have provided adequate supply for our township, Vatika India Next, from the substation. If there is a disruption in power supply (overload or breakage) at the substation, it affects the entire township. We are maintaining our line constantly and have apprised DHBVN of these cuts,” he said. DHBVN officials said that they are trying to resolve the issues reported from cables at the earliest. Manoj Yadav, superintending engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram 1, said that the sectors are developing and the new infrastructure is coming up. “The road widening work is also in progress due to which many times the cables are damaged and it takes time to locate the fault. We have to dig the area for at least six-foot-deep to repair and the entire process takes time. Once all the infrastructure work is complete, the power will be supplied uninterrupted,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-residents-of-sectors-82-to-84-complain-of-long-power-cuts/story-gwR6GsDpW1KwpTbqHin58K.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||Government colleges in Haryana start online admission process for UG courses||After months of delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the state higher education department started the centralised online admission process for admission to undergraduate (UG) courses in government colleges across the state on Monday. Unlike the past year, when the admission process was a combination of online and offline modes due to technological challenges, this year the admissions will be held completely online. Depending on the number of merit lists, the process is expected to be over by the first week of October. While the entry of students on the college premises for admission-related work remains prohibited, the department of higher education issued directions to colleges, emphasising Covid-19 protocols, after it received complaints that some colleges had been calling students for admission. “Some colleges have been calling students to colleges for filling up admission forms. This is against the state government’s orders. There will be absolutely no human intervention this year due to Covid-19 protocols,” the department stated on Monday. Vijay Adlakha, principal, Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that while the college had restricted entry of students, a help desk had been set up for parents. “We have created a help desk for parents since they have been making the rounds of the college to make inquiries. Visits from students are, however, strictly prohibited,” said Adlakha. Colleges across the city said that the process went ahead without any glitches and demo videos were shared with students who needed assistance. For the first time, the department has also introduced an academic WhatsApp chatbot called ‘Aapka Mitra’ to facilitate the admission process and provide information pertaining to universities, colleges and students. Students can send messages on the number, 7419444449, for any admission-related queries that will be answered by the bot. The initiative was launched by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“The department has created 15 digital help desks. Besides, there is a chatbot service, toll-free number, and email. If a student encounters issues during the registration process or gets stuck at any phase, the admission teams will reach out to the students and resolve issues,” said Gyan Devi, the nodal admission officer for Government Girls College in Sector 14. She said that the college had not received any direct queries from students on Monday. The number of students who have registered for admission so far is expected to be out by Wednesday. “So far, we have not received access to the registration numbers. Since the National Informatics Centre is conducting the admission process for the first time, certain changes are being incorporated. We should be able to get the numbers of students who registered for different courses by Wednesday,” said Devi. The nodal admission officer from Dronacharya Government College, who did not wish to be named, said that due to changes in the online portal, the admission process had been simplified and was going on smoothly. “Besides the online help desks, we circulated the admission link across WhatsApp groups so that it reaches all students,” she said. Kajal Raghav, 18, who is applying for BCom (honours), said that she did not face any glitches while initiating the process. “I surveyed the admission portal and the list of required documents. The demo videos have given a fair idea about the various steps. I am researching the colleges offering my course and will complete the process soon,” said Raghav.

The police have filed an inquest report under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The police have recovered a note, purportedly written by the woman, in which she stated that she was taking the extreme step due to issues related to her old age. According to the local police, the incident was reported to them at 7am by the control room. The police said at the time of the incident, the woman’s son had gone out for a walk while her daughter-in-law was in another room in the house. “Prima facie, probe suggests that she died by suicide. We have recovered a note, allegedly written by the victim, in which she mentioned that she was upset due to her old age as she often faced difficulty in walking. We received a call from the police control room and a team was rushed to the spot,” said a police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, adding that the police had initiated inquest proceedings. The police said the woman’s body was handed over to her family after the post-mortem examination on Monday. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/94-year-old-woman-jumps-to-death-in-gurugram/story-O1qtFP3iQVPllglQW18NlI.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: What made commuters take the Metro||A significant majority of the people who travelled on the Yellow Line and Rapid Metro in Gurugram on Monday did so for work, while a few were simply using the opportunity to experience the National Capital Region’s most preferred mode of transportation in its ‘new normal’ avatar. While all were satisfied with the safety protocols in place, a few struggled with cashless transactions as they did not have access to online modes of payment. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) resumed its Metro services after a hiatus of 169 days due to the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. A senior DMRC official, stationed at Huda City Centre, said there were far more people travelling from Gurugram to Delhi than vice versa.Satyavir Binauli, 31, who works in Gurugram and was visiting his family in Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar area for the first time in two months, said, “I would have liked to visit my parents more often but it is very expensive to hire a car. Since the Metro is now open, I am taking the chance to go and see them. I will be able to travel between my rented house in Gurugram and my family home more often, although I will restrict myself to once twice a month because I am afraid of infecting my parents.”Also read: Smooth but slow on Day 1 as Delhi Metro comes back to life A few others took the Metro ride simply out of curiosity. Subarna Dutta, a college student from Delhi who was travelling between Rajeev Chowk and Huda City Centre on Monday evening, said, “I’m just here to see what the situation is like today. You rarely get to enjoy the comfort of an empty Metro. That is why I am here. I don’t suppose it will remain this empty once all the lines start.” A large majority, however, were travelling due to work-related commitments and compulsions. Lakhan Singh Khirkira, 45, who alighted at Huda City Centre Metro station on Monday morning, having travelled from Vishwavidyalya station in north Delhi, said, “My in-charge has been asking us to start coming to work in staggered shifts. I have been unable to do so since I don’t have my own vehicle and I live far away. This is the first chance I have got to go to work. I will take the Metro back before 8pm.”Things were not so smooth for all commuters though. Beena, who provides domestic help services to a family in Gurugram, for example, was not aware that cash transactions are no longer being accepted in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I was really hoping to go to Delhi and meet my husband. He works there. They are saying I need to buy a Smart Card, but even for that they are not accepting cash. I do not know how to make payments over the phone.”A senior DMRC official, who was overseeing implementation of the new security protocol at Huda City Centre — seeking anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media — said, “All customers should either have a Smart Card already or should have access to a mobile payment service, which we are accepting. We will provide new Smart Cards. However, we are not allowed to take even ₹10 in cash. I cannot speak for those who don’t have smartphones or phone banking services.”Other than cashless transactions, the DMRC has advised commuters to travel light, and carry metallic items in their hands to speed up security checks. As part of their advisory to commuters, issued last week, the DMRC also emphasised on the need to maintain alternate seating arrangements in train coaches, and avoid touching any high contact surfaces (such as hand and guard rails). Travellers have also been requested to adjust their travel times so as to not coincide with peak hour traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-what-made-commuters-take-the-metro/story-4cD1fI8ae2dyhtNumxBYLJ.html
08-09-2020||City||Maharashtra government fumes as actor Kangana Ranaut gets Y+ security after row with Raut||The Centre on Monday provided Y-plus category security cover to actor Kangana Ranaut, following her spat with the Maharashtra government, after her remarks likening Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The decision to provide 24X7 security comes two days before Ranaut, who is in her home state Himachal Pradesh, plans to return to Mumbai on September 9. The Centre’s move was slam-med by the state’s three ruling parties. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an apparent jibe at the actor, said “some people from other states were grateful to the city. but some were not, despite getting livelihood and fame here”, while home minister Anil Deshmukh said it was surprising that people who criticised Mumbai and Maharashtra were being given protection by the Centre. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said Ranaut was “the parrot in the hands of BJP”.The actor will be guarded by 10-11 armed commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) round the clock in three shifts wherever she travels in India, said officials, adding that as per a threat assessment report by Central agencies, Ranaut may face danger to her life from narcotics syndicates and other hostile elements for speaking against them. Amid the raging row, Ranaut on Monday accused the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) of harassing her office staff in Khar by alleging that an illegal construction has been carried out and that her office would be demolished.Sena and Ranaut have been locked in a bitter war of words since the actor said she didn’t trust Mumbai Police after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said, “We kindly request her not to come to Mumbai. This is nothing but an insult to Mumbai Police.” Hitting back, Ranaut tweeted, “Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?”, evoking strong reactions. She also spoke out against drug use in section of the film industry.After the decision to provide her a security cover was taken, Ranaut tweeted “This is proof that no fascist forces will be able to suppress nationalist voices. I am indebted to Amit Shah Ji, who could have asked me to visit Mumbai later, but he honoured the words and self-respect of India’s daughter. Jai Hind”. On Sunday, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur had said that the state government will provide her security as she is the daughter of the state.The Centre’s move has heated up politics in Maharashtra with ruling parties accusing the BJP of supporting Ranaut. “The decision is serious, surprising and anguishing for us as the actress has insulted Mumbai and Maharashtra. Not only ruling parties like Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party or the Congress, but the insult to state is insult all the parties including Bharatiya Janata Party and the people of Maharashtra. All should condemn the decision of providing security to such a person,” said Deshmukh.“The decision of extending her security is politically motivated. The Centre has endorsed her comments, which are are an insult to Mumbai and Maharashtra. I would not be surprised if the actor is given Rajya Sabha or a legislative Council seat by BJP in the future,” Wadettiwar said.Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in a letter to the state Assembly speaker over Ranaut’s statements equating Mumbai to “PoK and Taliban”, demanded strict action against her. “If Kangana Ranaut is equating Mumbai to Pakistan or Taliban, then that is extremely wrong. I have written a letter to the Assembly speaker with regards to her comments. Ranaut had claimed that several film actors consumed drugs, and some actors have in turn alleged that Kangana too did it. I have requested police to investigate the same,” he said.Sarnaik, in the letter, said that an actor from another state came to Mumbai, earned fame, money and defamed Mumbai, but so far no action has been taken against her, which has pained public representatives like him. He added that the speaker has taken cognisance of the letter against the actor and has ordered Deshmukh to conduct an inquiry into the matter. A report on the Ranaut issue has been demanded in the house within 24 hours, according to Sarnaik.Calling the Union home ninistry’s move to provide Y-category security to Ranaut a ‘political decision’, the Sena MLA asked if underworld don Dawood Ibrahim would also be provided protection if he speaks out against the Maharashtra government. “If Dawood speaks against Maharashtra then Central government may give Y or Z plus security to him, it’s all happening due to political interest,” Sarnaik said.“Those who are insulting Maharashtra and Mumbai should be thrown out of the state,” said Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Asim Azmi.Leader of Opposition in legislative Assembly and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday that although the statement by Kangana was wrong, it is the responsibility of the government to protect her in the land of law. “Even terrorists have to be provided security to ensure that they are not attacked, whereas Ranaut is still an artist. We do not support what Kangana Ranaut said and nobody will support it, still it is the responsibility of the government because we are not living in Banana Republic,” he said outside Vidhan Bhavan.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday took a jibe at actor Kangana Ranaut over her tweet related to Mumbai city. He, however, didn’t name her, but it was obvious whom he was talking about. “Many people from other states come to Mumbai, work here for livelihood and get fame. Some of them are grateful, but some aren’t,” Thackeray said, while speaking on a condolence motion related to former Shiv Sena MLA Anil Rathod who died on August 5. He also added that Rathod, too, had come from Rajasthan, but lived the rest of his life for Maharashtra.Meanwhile, a team of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials visited the actor’s production house office at Pali Hil in Bandra to check alleged illegal construction. In addition to this, the BMC may also quarantine Ranaut when she arrives in Mumbai. However, the BMC is yet to confirm if Ranaut will be home quarantined. The civic body has 14-day home quarantine rule on arrival of domestic passengers. On Monday, Ranaut took to Twitter to share a video clip of the civic staffers visiting her office and accused the BMC of “forcefully taking over” her office and said that the BMC is going to demolish her property on Tuesday. A team of civic staffers from building proposals department inspected her office to check for alterations, comparing with approved plans.BMC officials said that they were acting on a complaint submitted to them for illegal alterations. A senior civic official said, “There was a complaint against the office. During the inspection, there were some deviations, including an illegal extension of the office. Also, this property was converted from residential to commercial. Measurements of her office were taken and a report will be submitted in the next two days to the top officials in BMC.” There is no confirmation over the demolishing of her office property.Parag Masurkar, deputy municipal commissioner of H west ward (Bandra), said, “This was part of an inspection drive that the local administrative ward office carried out. The structural inspection was done in neighbouring row houses adjacent to the actor’s office. I am yet to receive the report of the inspections. Further action will be taken based on the details corroborated during the inspection.”In a series of tweets, Ranaut said, “I have all the papers, BMC permissions and nothing has been done illegally in my property. BMC should send a structure plan to show the illegal construction with a notice. Today, they raided my place and without any notice tomorrow they will be demolishing entire structure.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-fumes-as-actor-kangana-ranaut-gets-y-security-after-row-with-raut/story-IWuK1gLvYtjmXrlZgbXR7K.html
08-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Lukewarm response to Yellow Line on first day as Metro resumes operations||The Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line and the Rapid Metro line in Gurugram, which partially resumed operations on Monday after a five-month hiatus, saw a lukewarm response from commuters on day one. The trains were sparsely populated, with no more than 15 to 20 passengers occupying the coaches nearest to the platform exits, while coaches toward the centre of the train were nearly empty. Despite thin crowds, social distancing and other safety measures were being stringently followed, HT observed.Morning and evening both saw a nearly equal passenger volume, as per the ridership numbers released late on Monday by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). While the morning run serviced 7,500 passengers, the total ridership for the day stood at close to 15,500 people at 8pm. DMRC officials did not provide ridership figures specific to either the five stations in Gurugram, or separately for the Rapid Metro line. The ridership numbers on Monday stands in stark contrast to the pre-lockdown days, where the Yellow Line saw an average daily ridership of nearly 2, 80,000. Anuj Dayal, spokesperson, DMRC, said,”Monday’s operations have been smooth. The DMRC received complete cooperation from all its customers.” In addition to temperature checks and sanitisation of handbags and luggage, security guards were seen enforcing physical distancing in queues. Commuters were also seen to be wearing face masks and practising social distancing, even those travelling in groups of two or three. At the security check counters at Huda City Centre station Monday morning, a security guard was also heard seeking verbal confirmation from passengers, saying: “Are you feeling okay? Do you have a cough?”The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) staffer, on condition of anonymity, later said: “If the patient is feeling any discomfort, we have been told to coordinate with the nodal officer and send them to a nearby health clinic.” These refer to three primary health care centres (PHCs) — in Chanderlok, Nathupur and Sikandarpur — where travellers will be diverted to for medical help and testing, should they show any symptoms while entering the Metro premises. However, the staffer and health department officials were unable to clarify how the patients will be transported from the stations to the PHCs.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram, had said on Saturday: “The passengers who show flu-like symptoms and high temperature will not be allowed to enter the Metro stations and will be directed to go to these health centres. On Sunday, we will put up sign boards at the entry and exit points of these five stations mentioning addresses and contact numbers of the PHCs.” He had added that details of other PHCs will also be shared so that people can visit them later.Signs in two languages, Hindi and English, had been put up at the designated entrances of each Metro station, providing not only the numbers and addresses of nearby PHCs but also privately run Covid-19 hospitals in the area, along with the contact numbers of the responsible nodal officers. The Rapid Metro, which connects with the Yellow Line at Sikanderpur and services the city’s key business localities (such as Cyber City), bore an even more deserted look with no more than two to three passengers per coach in the morning. The footfall remained low as many professionals working in the offices located along the Rapid Metro line continue to work from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.Metro personnel, however, said they expect more passengers to show up in the coming days. “As of Monday, no issues were seen in enforcing safety measures. However, the timings on Monday were staggered and only the Yellow Line in Delhi has started. We don’t know how things will be in a week,” said a senior CISF official stationed at Sikanderpur Metro station, on condition of anonymity. Until September 10, the Yellow Line, run by the DMRC, will ply from Huda City Centre to Samaypur Badli in north Delhi in two shifts, between 7am and 11am and then between 4pm and 8pm. Normal services are expected to resume on September 12.The Yellow Line, which serves as the only Metro connection between Delhi and Gurugram, became operational in June 2010. It’s five stations in Gurugram — Guru Dronacharya, Sikanderpur, MG Road, IFFCO Chowk and Huda City Centre — would see a cumulative ridership of at least 2,80,000 per day, according to a 2019 survey by the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi that was conducted as part of research for creating Gurugram’s ‘comprehensive mobility plan’. The Huda City Centre station alone saw an average daily footfall of about 104,000 people, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak. Going by the same survey, the Rapid Metro saw a daily average ridership of about 61,000 people before the Covid-19 struck. “It is definitely a little strange to see the Metro this empty. I intend to use it regularly to come to work. For the last two months I have been taking a cab from south Delhi twice a week, but will prefer to take the Metro now. It will be much cheaper,” said Swaran Singh, 28, who works as an executive with a private firm in Gurugram.Several commuters expressed relief at the safety measures being enforced. “I was a little worried because in public places you can always see someone or the other not taking precautions such as wearing masks and keeping distance. Other than the fact that it took a little more time than usual to get to the platform, it was a smooth ride,” said Bhawna Srivastava, who rode the Yellow Line from Delhi’s Rajeev Chowk to Huda City Centre in the morning to meet her family in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-lukewarm-response-to-yellow-line-on-first-day-as-metro-resumes-operations/story-WL96hdWZa1BNVp7JjIMBcM.html
08-09-2020||Noida||45-year-old cab driver killed in Greater Noida; kin says hate crime, police deny claim||A 45-year-old cab driver who was attacked allegedly by some unidentified passengers succumbed to his injuries on Sunday at a private hospital.According to the police, the victim, Aftab Alam, was found injured in his cab in Badalpur area in Greater Noida, following which he was admitted to a nearby hospital where he died during treatment.Police said on Sunday night, Alam, who lived in Delhi’s Trilokpuri area, had first picked up a passenger from Gurgaon through a ride hailing mobile application. The drop location was somewhere in Bulandshahr, and while returning was attacked in Badalpur, the police said.“A patrolling vehicle that was passing by found the Delhi-registered taxi parked along the Badalpur-Dadri bypass road. When checked, the victim was found severely injured on the seat adjoining the driver’s seat. The police rushed him to a hospital where he died during treatment,” deputy commissioner of police, central Noida, Harish Chander said in a statement to the press.According to the police officers, prima facie, it appears that upon dropping the passenger in Bulandshahr, Alam, without any booking, had picked some other passengers for Delhi. “En route, they seem to have had a fight and the driver was attacked. The suspects are on the run, and the mobile phone of the deceased is also missing,” the officer said.An FIR has been lodged at the Badalpur police station under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), the police said. They added they have identified the suspects and a search is on to arrest them.Meanwhile, Alam’s kin have alleged that he was lynched by three suspects while returning.His elder son, Mohammad Sabir, said “my father had dropped a client in Bulandshahr and he was returning at 7pm. He talked to me from Luharli toll plaza at 7:57pm and asked to make a FasTag recharge. The recharge was not successful and he paid Rs 120 as toll fee,” he said.Sabir said that on the way, three people had boarded his taxi. “My father noticed something unusual with the activities of the three. He made a phone call to me and placed his mobile phone by the side without uttering a word,” he said.Sabir, on the other side, was listening to the conversation. “I recorded 41 minute audio. At 8:39 minutes, the three persons asked my father to utter – Jai Shri Ram,” he said.Later, Alam’s mobile phone’s battery was exhausted and it switched off. Sabir said his family rushed to the Mayur Vihar police station and informed the police.“The police traced my father’s last location, as per his mobile phone, to Chithera village in Badalpur police station area in Greater Noida. We rushed to Greater Noida and found the vehicle parked while my father was not there, at 11pm. “The police informed me that he has been rushed to a private hospital in Ghaziabad. We went to the hospital where my father was already dead. He had received injuries in his head and body. We suspect he was lynched by those suspects in a hate crime,” Sabir said.Sabir said that he had asked the Badalpur police to mention the content of audio in the FIR but the police had assured that they will investigate the audio and add it later.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, however, said this is not a case of lynching. “The suspects were asking some vendor to chant Jai Shri Ram, and not to the taxi driver. We have identified the suspects through CCTV cameras from a toll plaza and launched a search to arrest them. The suspect had boarded the cab from Bulandshahr. Later the case will be transferred to the concerned district,” Chander said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/45-year-old-cab-driver-killed-in-greater-noida-kin-says-hate-crime-police-deny-claim/story-dmYy5JJa2D7M0dNU9POe7J.html
08-09-2020||Chandigarh||Rain pours misery for residents of Panchkula’s Sector 8||Residents of Sector 8, Panchkula, have complained that water enters their houses whenever it rains, resulting in heavy damages. They added that the issue has been taken up with the municipal corporation, but no action has been taken so far.HC Gera , general secretary of Sector 8 welfare association, said, “Residents of houses 536 to 527, 556 to 547 and 540 to British School have been dealing with the waterlogging issue for the last 15 years.”Gera added that even MLA Gian Chand Gupta has also only given assurances, but nothing has been done so far.“These houses get flooded whenever it rains.

08-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Aqua Line restarts metro; ridership low on first day||The Noida Metro Rail Corporation’s (NMRC) on Monday put in place arrangements for contactless frisking, thermal scanning and sanitisation at all metro stations as it resumed services five months after they were suspended as part of efforts to check the Covid-19 spread. The day began with just two to four passengers on each train from 7 am to 11 am.Metro staff and security personnel were deployed, with safety gear in tow, to guide commuters at the stations. At the Sector 51 metro station which HT visited, NMRC had placed a contactless hand sanitiser and temperature checking machine at the entry gate. Once the temperature is checked, commuters need to sanitise their hands and display the Aarogya Setu app’s green status, after which they are guided to get tickets. People can use smart cards, or get tickets using the NMRC’s mobile app, or from ticket counters, after which commuters are guided to the frisking/checking booth. The commuters are now required to put all their belongings such as bags, mobile phones or any other metallic objects, like keys, in trays for checking, much like the checking counters at airports. There is no manual frisking anymore.Also read| Gurugram: What made commuters take the MetroMeenu Singh, a commuter who boarded the metro from Sector 51 said: “The metro is always a more suitable option for me to get to Pari Chowk. I am happy that the service has resumed, but I feel there is still a sense of fear with regards to Covid. Hence, many people hesitate to use public transport, including the Metro.”Constant announcements were made at the stations and inside the trains to remind passengers about precautionary measures and to urge them to follow guidelines. The stations and trains were constantly monitored at the control centres with the help of CCTV cameras.Shekhar Upadhyaya, another commuter, said he had been eagerly waiting for the metro to come back to life. “I live in Greater Noida and work in Noida. In absence of metro services, I had to ride my scooter to and from work but it’s not feasible to ride a two-wheeler for such a long distance every day. I am satisfied with the safety arrangements by NMRC. It is as if we are checking in at an airport,” he said. The corporation has also started the parking facility at some metro stations which also few customers utilised on Monday.In the morning up to 11am, the Aqua Line recorded a ridership of 200. Around 400 passengers used the Aqua Line between 5pm to 9pm, a NMRC spokesperson said.Praveen Mishra, NMRC’s executive director, said the commuter response was satisfactory on Monday. “This is the first day of resumption of services and hence the number of passengers is less. We hope the situation will improve and more people will prefer to travel in Noida metro,” he said.Metro officials said people will gradually feel confident to travel on the Metro again. They said businesses and offices have not resumed functioning fully and that is why they expect lesser footfall initially.The corporation, in association with an NGO - Ranganathan Society for Social Welfare - has also set up a stall at the Sector 51 Metro Station selling masks made by women who have lost jobs due to the pandemic. The price of these masks range from Rs 5-50. Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC’s managing director, said all the passengers were screened at the entry points for temperature. “Their hands were also sanitised at the entrances, post which they were allowed to enter the metro premises. The passengers maintained adequate social distancing and stood on the floor markings made at the stations, platforms and inside the trains. The NMRC trains were also fully sanitised after each trip. The stations, platform and other “contact areas” such as call buttons of lifts, AFC (automatic fare collection) gates, handle belts of escalators and staircases, etc., were also sanitised at regular intervals,” she said.As per current plan, the Aqua Line is going to run in the peak hours in morning –7am to 11am – and in the evening – 5pm to 9pm – with a frequency of 15 minutes from Monday to Saturday, at a frequency of 15 minutes. On Sundays the services will start from 8am to 11am and from 5pm to 9pm, . The Aqua Line (29.7 km) has 21 metro stations and it connects Noida Sector 51 station to Greater Noida’s Depot Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-aqua-line-restarts-metro-ridership-low-on-first-day/story-LTdvhJ3VCaHbZRC7RdVCoN.html

According to official figures, the district till September 6 had less number of category 2 containment zones than category 1. But more fresh cases are emerging from category 2 zones. The district till September 6 had 336 containment zones, which include 196 in category 1 and 140 in category 2. The category 1 zones are confined to a 100-metre radius in case there is one fresh case. Category 2 zones are in a radius of 200 metres when there is more than one case. It is further supplemented by a buffer zone on the periphery, which is defined on local assessment. “Fresh cases are coming in and multiple cases in category 2 zones. It is so because activities have opened up and people are mixing. There are instances when one person from a family gets infected and others also get infected in return. To keep a check, we are planning that there should be 100% testing in containment zones as directed by the Indian Council for Medical Research,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “We will make use of rapid antigen kits to ensure there is 100% testing and positive cases are isolated from the population,” he said.According to officials, an estimated 100-150 houses are present in Ghaziabad in 100 metres while 200-250 houses in the 200-metre radius zones.

The list indicates that the category 2 zones are witnessing high multiple Covid-19 cases, ranging anything between five to 26 cases. “With activities opening up, it is now imperative that there should be focus on containment exercises. People will move out but there has to be control. It is advisable that 100% testing should be taken up in containment zones and those found positive should be immediately sent to isolation. This will help prevent others in the area from getting infected,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad.

In the meantime, the funeral of Lal’s body was performed by the family of the other deceased, Yash Pal, 55, at their native place at Kankarkhera in Meerut. Following the goof-up, Meerut officials constituted a committee, which submitted its findings on Monday evening. It said there was negligence on the part of a staff nurse and other 10 contractual staff, including six nurses and four cleaning staff deployed at the medical college. “The resident of Meerut had died at 1pm on Saturday and his body was to be shifted to the mortuary within 45 minutes to one hour. In between, his family asked not to shift it to the mortuary as they were on way. So the staff nurse did not shift the body to the mortuary and kept it at a holding area. The other victim from Modinagar died at 6pm on Saturday and his body was shifted to the holding area,” said Dr Gyanendra Singh, principal of LLRMMC. In between, the duty of the staff changed. “When the other staff came for duty, they put up tags on the bodies, which mentioned names, address, etc. However, they swapped the tags. This resulted in the wrong bodies being sent to their respective families. We admit that there has been negligence on our part. We have written to the director general (medical education) to take action against the staff nurse and asked the contractor company to replace the 10 contractual employees,” Dr Singh added. On Sunday, at the funeral ground in Modinagar, the son of deceased Lal opened the body bag to see the face of his father for the last time but he was shocked to see another person. He immediately informed the medical college after which the body was taken to the original family at Meerut and ashes of Lal were handed over to his family. “After this incident, we have issued strict instructions to our doctors and staff to take up all procedures as per defined norms, especially in cases related to Covid-19,” Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/action-against-11-after-bodies-of-covid-19-swapped-at-meerut-medical-college/story-DxKHUeYblOEzkXh2Gs7IWJ.html
08-09-2020||City||Test positivity of rapid kits spikes in Ghaziabad, officials expect surge in Covid-19 cases||The positivity rate of Covid-19 tests done through rapid antigen kits in Ghaziabad has been on the rise since the past two weeks which, experts said, could indicate that the infection could be spreading at a faster pace. According to official records of the district health department, the overall positivity rate of the tests through antigen kits— which accounts for more than half of the tests conducted in Ghaziabad after their introduction in the district on June 26— is about 2.83%, however, during the past two weeks the positivity rate first increased to 3.91% (between August 21 and August 27) and then reached 4.5% (between ween August 28 and September 3). The positivity rate for antigen tests, whose sensitivity is considered to be poor, was 2.19% for the test conducted between August 14 and August 20 and 2.40% for August 7-13 week.Till September 3, nearly 205,584 tests were conducted in Ghaziabad of which 8,897 samples turned positive for Covid-19 (positivity rate 4.32%). Out of the total tests conducted, around 57.49% of tests were done through rapid antigen tests (118, 206). Till September 3, 3,349 positive cases were detected with them. The overall positivity with the help of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test—considered the gold standard method for detecting Covid-19—is about 6.34% (till September 3). “Although, the positivity rate of antigen kits is less than that of RT-PCR tests, the latest spike indicates that the spread of the infection has not declined at all, and more positive cases will emerge at a faster pace. In past fortnight or so, there has been a steady rise in number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad at a growing pace,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association(Ghaziabad chapter). According to the state control room figures, Covid-19 cases have been on a steady rise. Between August 7 and August 13, 628 cases were recorded and in the following week, from August 14 to August 20, 802 fresh cases were reported. While 850 cases were reported between August 21 and August 27, the week between August 28 and September 3, 991 new Covid-19 cases were reported in Ghaziabad.Except, for first week of the antigen tests being introduced in the district, their positivity rate has stayed below 3%. According to health department officials, the rise in the positivity rate of antigen tests denotes that number of persons acquiring infection is fast increasing. Rapid antigen kits are widely used for testing in containment zones, static sampling booths, and mobile vans besides by sample collection teams working on ground. “The positive rate through test by rapid antigen kits is high and there is also a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district. We are already doing focused testing with rapid kits for persons showing symptoms and people who are over 65 years of age and have comorbidities,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “So, the rise in positivity could be resultant of focused testing and wide use of rapid antigen kits,” he added.Meanwhile, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also directed the health department officials to make a workplan so that the recent guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) can be implemented fully in Ghaziabad.In its ‘Advisory on Strategy for Covid-19 Testing in India,’ the ICMR has suggested that all people living in containment zones should be tested by rapid antigen test, particularly in cities where there has been a widespread transmission of infection. For routine surveillance in containment zones and screening at points of entry, the ICMR has listed rapid antigen tests, RT-PCR or TrueNat to be used in order of priority. It is also suggested that all symptomatic cases including health care workers and frontline workers; all asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a laboratory confirmed cases are to be tested once between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact. “Based on availability of workforce and also the stock of rapid antigen kits, we will soon be implementing the directions in the district ” CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/test-positivity-of-rapid-kits-spikes-in-ghaziabad-officials-expect-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-ROdlrDhldEM6YTaKdYoroO.html

However, the first case of fatal drink driving was reported on Sunday from Balewadi when retired police inspector Sanjay Nikam mowed down a worker under the wheels of his car in an inebriated condition. Also read: Drink driving: One-day police custody for retired inspector for killing one in PuneThe accident which occurred at Mamata Square in Balewadi left four others injured. Nikam (58) was arrested by Chatuhshrungi police and charged with culpable homicide. Nikam during his service with the city police has worked with the Social Security Cell (SSC) and traffic control branch. According to the data available with the traffic branch, as many as 752 drink driving cases have been lodged across different divisions between January and March this year, however, this stopped as soon as the lockdown was invoked. Joint commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Shisve said, “No action has been taken in relation of drink driving cases since the Covid outbreak.” In 2019, a total of 13,239 cases of drink driving were reported in the city. Last year, six traffic divisions - Koregaon Park, Wanowrie, Aiport, Hadapsar, Warje and Bharati Vidyapeeth emerged at the top with the highest number of drink driving cases between January 1, 2019 and December 22, 2019. As many as 13,239 cases have been registered in 2019 in all the 24 traffic divisions under Pune police commissionerate. The highest number of cases - 2,702 - had been registered in April 2019. The city traffic police had booked offenders after they were found driving under the influence of alcohol through various methods, like breath analysing tests, nakabandi at various spots and surprise checks outside pubs and hotels. In a drive launched by the traffic police, drivers of heavy vehicles were also checked. Action was taken against offenders under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Act, which states that alcohol content legal limit is 0.03% to 30 micro litre in 100 ml blood. Traffic experts expect the same type of crackdown in 2020 to prevent incidents of fatalities which have started after reopening of the city. Pedestrian First convener Prashant Inamdar, said, “Enforcement is on the lower side due to the Covid crisis and police presence is also less which was not the case in the past. With CCTV, there is surveillance, but physical presence of police officials is missing. The presence of policemen is the need of the hour as we are going back to normalcy and strict enforcement on all counts has to be restored to prevent incidents like drink driving which cause fatalities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-bars-restaurants-closed-due-to-lockdown-no-drink-driving-cases-since-april-in-pune/story-FmIXPsL2Hpc4ssr6DAm3lJ.html

The BMC attributed the spike to the festival season such as Ganesh Chaturti and Muharram coupled with relaxations in lockdown restrictions norms and aggressive testing.The civic body has decided to conduct up to 14,000 tests daily from the existing 9,000 that had started from the last week of August. The BMC authorities are confident of detecting more cases daily because of its aggressive testing mechanism.“We expect Mumbai to report around 2,000 Covid-19 cases daily for the next 30 days. I have given targets to my officers. Our focus will be on detecting patients by using the RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). Rapid antigen detection (RAD) test kits will be used for more focused testing such as those who are suspected Covid-19 patients because of their pronounced symptoms.”“We cannot use RAD test kits randomly on the public or on the front-line workers battling the pandemic. The positivity rate is only 4% and 25% for RAD and RT-PCR test, respectively. We will follow the latter. We have capacity to conduct around 15,000 tests daily that include both the testing methods.”BMC officials said over 820,000 Covid-19 tests have been conducted to date, including RAD tests that account for less than a lakh. At present, the civic authorities are conducting up to 2,000 RAD tests.The leader of opposition in the Maharashtra legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis had said that the consistent low-testing figures led to high positivity and Covid-19-related fatality rates in the state and Mumbai. He had cited the Delhi model in a bid to tackle the viral outbreak.Chahal put Fadnavis’s comparison in the context.“There are times when I am told that Delhi is doing more tests, as compared to Mumbai. Delhi has conducted over 1,600,000 tests, including over 500,000 via the RT-PCR method. So far, Mumbai has conducted over 800,000 tests, including over 90,000 RAD tests. RT-PCR is giving more positivity rate. Simultaneously, we will also do RAD tests. But RT-PCR rates will be done in a more focussed manner,” Chahal said.The civic authorities said there would not be any shortage faced by the public, despite a spike in Covid-19 cases of late. “We will be able to handle up to 4,000 Covid-19 cases daily. In a couple of days, a 230-intensive care unit (ICU) bed facility at NESCO jumbo centre in Goregaon and 30 ICU beds at Mulund jumbo centre will be thrown open to the public,” Chahal said. “Our focus is on our jumbo centres. If a need arises, private hospitals can also be looked at. All Covid-19 patients don’t require hospitalisation. In that light, a daily spike in Covid-19 cases should not be a huge cause for concern,” he added.However, Chahal appealed to the citizens to not panic. He said, “The strategy of BMC to substantially ramp up the tests from an average testing of 7,619 everyday in August to 10,000-14,000 tests everyday in September, resulting in an increase of average number of positive cases from 1,000-1,300 to 1,700-2,000 everyday by effectively utilising large number of vacant Covid beds available in the city of Mumbai will help to accelerate arrest of the spread of virus in Mumbai. Therefore, it is humbly submitted that there should not be any panic created by sudden increase of positive number of cases in Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-mumbai-administration-expects-nearly-2k-cases-daily-for-next-30-days/story-XzwqRb1Yt6alO5dQIgrnXJ.html
08-09-2020||Lifestyle||Teachers’ Day 2020: Thanking the gurus for always inspiring, guiding and leading||On the occasion of Teachers’ Day today, we speak to eminent personalities from different walks of life who dedicate the day and share finest memories with their gurus, mentors, parents and friends. While some express gratitude towards their school teachers for imparting the best of knowledge and education, others credit their parents and friends for the incredible learning experiences.Life-long mantras“The Guru leads you from the visible to the invisible, from the material to the divine, from the ephemeral to the eternal. My parents have been my first teachers and gurus too. For as long as I can remember, the first mantra taught was to be a good human being and to be a symbol of the etiquette and manners (tehzeeb and tameez). In spite of being the monumental icon of music that my father is, he continues to be an individual full of humility and a complete simpleton. In recent times, I often question his imparting of humbleness to me and my brother especially in the world that we live in. It’s almost become normal for people to walk over you or take you completely for granted. However, the principles imbibed say that God watches every individual in this world and takes care of everything. I follow mantras which are ‘Have patience and tolerance’, ‘We make our future in this world’ and ‘God is within us.’ These have been my motivating factors at every stage, and yes, taught by my parents. Salutations to all teachers on the occasion of Teachers’ Day.” — Ayaan Ali Bangash, Sarod maestro.Read: Teacher’s Day 2020: From Aamir Khan to Amitabh Bachchan, these teachers will forever stay in our heartsDedicating to dancing gurus“Dad and Radha mom are probably my biggest inspiration and mentors when it comes to all things dance (profession) and just life in general. I’m able to talk to them and take advise from them on just about anything. I have seen first-hand what it means to be focused no matter the drawbacks one faces. I have seen what blind passion is, I have seen what hard work is in my moms. I am thankful to my Carnatic music guru Dr K. Vageesh for his warm but strict outlook to teach singing. My husband Dennis inspires me each day to a systematic practice regime and on another count to be patient, polite and sincere. I am lucky to be surrounded by wonderful mentors who inspire me every day.”— Bhavana Reddy, Kuchipudi dancer.To fathers who lead by example“My greatest teacher has been my father. He is able to be happy and content under all circumstances and has the ability to hold an engaging conversation with absolutely anyone, regardless of their age, nationality or background. I’d like to believe that I have been able to imbibe this attitude and ability from him. He is a great adventurer and at 71, rode his motorcycle to Ladakh. His method of teaching is leadership by example and from him I have learned both dignity of labour and that every human being deserves to be treated with respect. Thanks dad. Love you.” —Papa CJ, comedian and author.Notes from the classroom  @sitharakrishnakumar , You have my heart for having sung this song ❤️ Big ummahs to all those who said I didn’t butcher your language haha - thought I’d commemorate this moment for good. #bhakshanamishtamayi #kumbalanginights #cherathukalA post shared by  Sanjeeta Bhattacharya (@sanjeeta11) on May 6, 2020 at 7:02am PDTMy music teacher in school, Siddharth Das, always pushed our limits musically and asked us to listen to Manhattan Transfer, Alicia Keys, Joni Mitchell. He said genre is no bar; music is music. There is the same number of notes in music no matter where it comes from or what language it is being sung in. He taught me to not just listen to music, but to experience it. That’s something that I have kept in mind while making music myself. He will remain my favourite teacher and somebody I will look up to forever.” — Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, musician.Striving for perfectionThe teacher I remember most, is my English teacher Ms Uma at KVIIT Chennai. She was one of the best I’ve had. She would settle for nothing less than perfection. Wren and Martin was our Bible and, and every rule in that one, we diligently applied. When I topped the board exams in English, scoring the highest marks CBSE had ever granted for English that year, my joy knew no bounds. I think Ms Uma would be even more proud to see the number of books I have written now.” — Preeti Shenoy, author.An inspiring note to a dear friend“Marijke deSouza, the producer of my film Sheer Qorma is not only a dear friend but a guide who has inspired me tremendously. Sometimes she is my mother, there are days when she is my best friend but on all days she continues to inspire me with her wisdom, her fiercely independent spirit that I associate so much with and her unconditional warmth that remains unscathed. It is such a thing of joy to find a mentor, a guide, a teacher in Marijke and to unlearn so much and begin from a place of awareness, independence and utmost love. Marijke has really given me wings to fly. Her diligence to tell stories that will hopefully change our world for good is such a force of nature — it’ll change the world and I am so grateful to be a part of her tribe. Marijke — my teacher, my mentor, my guide, my best friend — I love you very much. Happy Teachers’ Day to you.” — Faraz Arif Ansari, filmmaker.Read: PM Modi tweets on Teachers’ Day, says grateful for their contributionRecalling the good ol’ school days“Modern School, Vasant Vihar was a school that I feel most lucky to have found myself studying at for the better part of my schooling. Not a day goes by when I, 47 years old today, am not grateful for the tutelage given me by the teachers that touched my life. I am hard pressed to think of one name that stands out more than others. My teachers, the teachers at our school, they were our gurus, guides and even friends. Sabiha Hashmi, my first Guru and my most steadfast pillar of strength and grounding, was art teacher for all that sailed through class 6th through 10th at MSVV. For me she also happened to be the person who made me feel comfortable in my own skin, who saw in me some restlessness that she knew she could harness into creativity. She nurtured my artistic talents, gave me freedom to create art with mediums that often were relegated for students taking art in 11th and 12th grade, when I was in 9th grade myself. Teachers educate us and inspire us, they inform us and lead us, they make us more complete and often more fulfilled versions of ourselves at an age when we ourselves have no clue as to who we are and who we might be wanting to become. Ms. Hashmi saw a certain something in me and invested a good 8 years in me and helped me come to peace with myself and see honesty around me, that which was ugly, and that which was brilliant in beauty. To her I bow today on Teachers Day, and as I do so, also to all my teachers who have endured the agony young minds, and yet had the patience to stand by us through all the vicissitudes that growing up for kids means.” — Suvir Saran, Michelin-star chef Follow htcity for more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/teachers-day-2020-thanking-the-gurus-for-always-inspiring-guiding-and-leading/story-UYeKYNGNqbT1QLv7lQJfpK.html
