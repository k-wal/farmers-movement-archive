The 32-year-old mobile robber who was evading arrest since the past three years was arrested from Titwala. According to the GRP special task force officers, the accused Naimuddin Mehmood Alam has many mobile robbery and pick-pocketing cases registered against him across the Harbour and Central railway lines. API Hemraj Sathe from STF crime branch said that on Saturday they had received a tip off that Alam who had fled to his village after a lockdown was announced by the State government, had returned to Mumbai. “When the railway services were stopped owing to the pandemic, several robbers and criminals had fled the city,” said Sathe. The STF officers said that they had got Alam’s address in March, however, when they reached his house in Kalyan, they learnt that Alam who is a native in Uttar Pradesh had left Mumbai as he was unable to continue robbing commuters. Since the past year, officers of the STF had been tracing Alam. Sathe said that they had approached their informers at various places and asked them to keep an eye on robbers who were wanted and had left the city. On Saturday, Sathe said that they were informed that Alam had returned to the city anticipating that the lockdown would be over in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/serial-mobile-thief-on-the-run-for-three-years-arrested-in-mumbai/story-3fT7q24BVxRcDWnL2U6wqM.html

Their bodies were fished out of the lake by night.The duo was among the group of 10 men, all in their mid-20s, who went to a lake in Shirgaon Khumbarpada in Virar (East) from Jogeshwari for a picnic. “Rane and Suvarna entered the lake, but misjudged the depth of the water.

13-09-2020||City||Dombivli foot overbridge opens for commuters, CR bars connectivity to platforms||After almost a year, the Kalyan-end foot overbridge (FoB) at Dombivli railway station was opened to the commuters on Saturday. However, the FoB will only allow commuters to connect between east-west of Dombivli station as the Central Railway (CR) has barred its connectivity to the platform due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. The FOB was shut in April 2019 as it was declared dangerous in an audit by the CR. It was dismantled in October 2019. After the collapse of the Himalaya FoB near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on March 14, 2019, in which six were killed and 31 were injured, CR had ordered an audit of all its railway bridges. Many bridges were shut for repairs including the 40-year-old Dombivli FoB.The Dombivli station sees a footfall of almost four lakh commuters every day.“The commuters have been complaining about the delay for a long time. Now since the FoB is open, once the railway services resume, commuters can have better connectivity,” said Rupesh Singh, 30, a daily commuter.An officer from Dombivli railway station, requesting anonymity said,” The FoB was opened for commuters on Saturday to connect from east to west. The connectivity to the platform has not yet resumed, and it will be done only after the directions from the superiors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dombivli-foot-overbridge-opens-for-commuters-cr-bars-connectivity-to-platforms/story-LtnuzMrc1cvuRpH80OKq8I.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||September set to be Maharashtra’s worst Covid month||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 22,543 Covid-19 cases and 414 deaths, taking the tally and toll to 1,060,308 and 29,531 respectively. The state’s struggle to control the infectious virus is getting more difficult as numbers are climbing up rapidly. The average number of daily infections is marching towards 21,000 as 267,695 cases were recorded in thirteen days of this month. This also indicates that maximum cases in a month are likely to be recorded in September, as against 371,238 reported in August and 247,392 in July. In March, April, May and June, total cases reported were 30; 10,196; 57,157 and 102,172 respectively, according to state health department data.Sunday’s figures have pushed active cases in the state to 290,344, which has increased to a record 27.38% of total cases With the spike in cases, the positivity rate of the state continued to rise at 20.18% on Sunday with 88,836 tests conducted by the state. It was 18.82% a month ago on August 13 and 16.3% on June 13. Positivity test is an indicator of the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in the community. It also reflects the proportion of people who were found positive among those tested. The total number of tests conducted till date are 5,072,521.Officials said people need to follow precautions seriously and a careless attitude would bring more difficulties for the state, which was indicated by the chief minister. “We have been observing most of the people have stopped taking the pandemic seriously and don’t care about social-distancing norms. This is concerning as they are not only endangering their lives, but also of their families,” said a senior bureaucrat, wishing not to be named.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said there is no evidence that presence of antibodies guarantees protection from Covid-19 for a long time. “So far, those having antibodies are being claimed as protected, but it is yet to be proven and the new studies coming in are changing this perception.“A recent study says that antibodies that are developed after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t guarantee long term protection from the virus as protective antibodies reduce in the body gradually. Thus, it is difficult to say that those who have developed antibodies are long-term immune to coronavirus,” Dr Salunkhe said.He also said that dependence only on vaccines cannot be called a wise step. “People should follow all the guidelines issued by the state in public interest as we cannot completely depend upon vaccines. It would be unwise to do so as we yet don’t know when it is actually going to be available and the level of protection it will give. We are only hoping the best,” he said.Pune city continues to contribute the highest number of infections to the daily caseload as it recorded 2,294 cases on Sunday. Its tally stood at 128,892 cases.Mumbai on Friday recorded 2,191 cases as the second-highest contributor, taking its tally to 169,741. Of them, active cases are 30,016.Nagpur city has occupied third position in the list with 1,534 cases and its tally went up to 39,077.The surge in infections is a result of getting new hotspots with a significant number of cases being reported in semi-urban and rural areas.Currently, the major hotspots in the state are Pune district, Pimpri-Chinchwad city, Jalgaon district, Satara district, Nashik city, Raigad district, Sangli district, Solapur district and Ahmednagar district where fresh cases recorded were 1,126, 1,004, 981, 912, 713, 682, 646, 630 and 620 respectively.Maharashtra also continued to report the highest casualties across states in the country. Figures show that the state’s contribution in total Covid casualties is around 37.57% if compared with 78,586 deaths reported across the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 2.79% on Sunday and comes at third position after Punjab and Gujarat. The CFR of Punjab and Gujarat were 2.97% (with 2,288 deaths) and 2.85% (with 3,195 deaths) on Saturday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.As many as 740,061 patients have been recovered and discharged from various hospitals across the state till date. On Sunday, 11,549 recoveries were reported and the recovery rate recorded was 69.4%, against the national average of 77.88%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/september-set-to-be-maharashtra-s-worst-covid-month/story-Nxaw1Xho8NEy9HfXBIyO5J.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||2020 monsoon is Mumbai’s second wettest in 10 years||This year’s monsoon is already the city’s second wettest over 10 years (2011-2020), according to weather bureau data, and there is still around a month left for the season to end. Mumbai recorded 3,219mm rain between June and September 13 this year, crossing the 3,154.8mm of 2011 (and close to 2010’s 3,327.9mm). Last year, the four monsoon months recorded 3,670.4mm, the second highest all-time seasonal rainfall. The all-time seasonal rain was recorded in 1958 at 3,759.7mm, according to rain data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) collated from the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of Mumbai and the suburbs. Monsoon spans from June to September, but withdrawal from the city has been extending to the second week of October over the past five years. This year, monsoon onset was declared on June 14, followed by deficient rain of 395mm, making it the lowest June rain in five years. However, over the next two months Mumbai witnessed above average rain with 1,502.7mm rain in July, the highest since records began being collated by the weather bureau (1944), followed by highest August rainfall since 1959 at 1,247.6mm. The IMD said several local weather systems ensured active monsoon conditions during July, while the formation of five low pressure weather systems in the Bay of Bengal led to extremely heavy rainfall during the first week of August, followed by moderate to heavy spells through the month. “The formation of another low pressure weather system is expected over Bay of Bengal in this coming week, which may further increase rain activity over the west coast, including Mumbai, between September 16-20,” said IMD director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra. The first 11 days of September saw only light showers. However, the city and suburbs recorded moderate rain with a few intense spells between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Overnight showers made it the strongest rain spell so far in September. So far, Mumbai has recorded 81.8mm rain from September 1-13 (5.30pm), against the monthly mean 341.4 mm. IMD had predicted a revival of active monsoon conditions over Mumbai over the weekend. Between 8.30am Saturday and 8.30am Sunday, the suburbs recorded 25.7 mm rain and 16.4 mm was recorded at south Mumbai. Of this, the majority of rainfall was recorded between 12.30am and 5.30 am Sunday. Thane recorded 22.8mm rain. Many areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) recorded 20- 40mm. The area around the international airport recorded 55mm, while Chembur recorded 47.2mm and Navi Mumbai 41.2mm. However, no rain was recorded on Sunday with sunny weather between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. The weather bureau said light to moderate rain with the possibility of occasional intense spells was likely between Sunday night and Monday morning, but only light to moderate rain has been predicted from Monday to Thursday for Mumbai. “Factors such as the formation of a low-pressure weather system of west central Bay of Bengal off Andhra Pradesh coast, an upper air cyclonic circulation over Maharashtra coast and associated systems such as an offshore trough from north Maharashtra to Kerala have allowed revival of active monsoon conditions for Konkan and interior Maharashtra,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. Overall, Maharashtra has recorded 13% excess rain from June 1 to September 13, with 59% excess rain for south Mumbai and 57% excess rain for the suburbs, highest for any district along the Konkan coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2020-monsoon-is-mumbai-s-second-wettest-in-10-years/story-dnnX39lUVGjByx1JLcDXVK.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Review petition or fresh ordinance for Marathas? Maharashtra government to discuss with Opposition||The Maharashtra government is mulling on two options - review petition or fresh ordinance - to ensure the state retains the Maratha quota in jobs and education. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government has decided that it will take the Opposition in confidence and take a call based on political consensus. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of his senior ministers to review the situation on Sunday.“We have decided to discuss the issue with Opposition parties, several organisations and legal experts and only then make a decision. We have an option to file a review petition, some have also suggested issuing fresh ordinance,” said Ashok Chavan, public works department (PWD) minister after the meet.The Apex court had stayed the reservation even as it referred the matter to the larger bench. The interim stay is a political setback as it has halted ongoing admissions and upset the Maratha community that makes up for nearly half of the state’s populace. “Last week an unexpected decision came on Maratha reservation. The state didn’t fall short in arguments because our demand for transferring the case to the constitutional bench was accepted by the court, but while doing so, it stayed the implementation of reservation which was not expected. As per my information, no such act for providing reservation above 50% cap was stayed by the court earlier,” Thackeray said in his address to the state. He also requested the community to not hold protests, as the state was backing them completely. Thackeray also said that he had already spoken to the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on the issue and would consult him again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/review-petition-or-fresh-ordinance-for-marathas-maharashtra-government-to-discuss-with-opposition/story-lIQ1CWK2SrzbjunQkMXDsI.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Pillion rider gets knocked down by falling barricade at WEH in Mumbai, gets run over by truck; driver booked||Samta Nagar police on Sunday arrested a truck driver Bablu Yadav for negligent driving for a mishap on the western express highway (WEH) at Kandivli which claimed one life and other sustained grievous injuries. According to the police, the incident occurred in the evening on September 12 at around 5pm at Kandivli when a barricade suddenly fell on a moving motorcycle. The barricade was very heavy due to which the rider lost his balance and the pillion rider was thrown on the road and was subsequently crushed under the wheels of a truck that was driving alongside the bike. The truck driver identified as Bablu Yadav was remanded to police custody. Raju Kasbe senior inspector from Samta Nagar police station said, “We have arrested the truck driver and have written to MMRDA asking them to give us the name of the person responsible for the barricade, so that we may take legal action against that person.” The 28-year-old deceased identified as Manoj Pawar, was a computer hardware expert and resided at Kranti Nagar in Kurar Village, Malad (East) while the 26-year-old injured rider is identified as Prashant Ambekar, who was admitted to Shatabdi Hospital where his condition is said to be critical. Kashiram Pawar, Manoj’s father said, “He told me that he is going to Borivli to collect bike parts from someone. Prashant was riding the bike and while they were returning, this unfortunate incident occurred. I lost my son due to the negligence of the people hired by the MMRDA.”Satish Jadhav, Prashant’s friend said, “I got to know that the police have arrested the truck driver which is wrong. They should arrest the actual accused due to who’s negligence we lost our friend.”“We have booked the truck driver and an unknown person under section 304-A (causing death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code and are investigating the case,” said Kasbe.When contacted, MMRDA in an official statement said, “This is a sad and unfortunate incident. The barricades were of the subway contractors on WEH at Akurli. We will investigate the matter. This is not Metro work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pillion-rider-gets-knocked-down-by-falling-barricade-at-weh-in-mumbai-gets-run-over-by-truck-driver-booked/story-N0mMphVQ22AaIVEXvRvRtI.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Can weather political storms and coronavirus, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||I can weather the coronavirus battle and political storms, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday, in his over half-an-hour address to the state through social media. Focussing on the worsening Covid-19 scenario, the CM warned people to take precautions and follow social-distancing norms as coronavirus could take a “monstrous form”. He also warned citizens that the state would have to start penalising those violating social-distancing norms, like in other countries, so as to curb the virus’s spread. While he did not make a political speech, Thackeray said that attempts were being made to defame Maharashtra and his silence should not be taken as a weakness or failure to respond. Thackeray, otherwise, gave a wide berth to the week-long political drama involving actor Kangana Ranaut by making no mention of the actor. “Right now, I won’t talk about politics but attempts are on to defame Maharashtra. I don’t talk, that doesn’t mean I don’t have answers. I am sitting on the chair of a chief minister and have to act accordingly,” he said. Senior Sena leaders said Thackeray had decided to not give any importance to the actor and had asked all leaders to follow suit by ignoring her. Recently, Ranaut had compared Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), after which BMC had demolished illegal portions of her office in the city. “The scenario that I was afraid of is before us now. Cases of coronavirus are rising and will continue to rise. Cases have again started increasing in Mumbai and they are spreading to rural areas as well. There is a concern that it can take a disastrous form. The World Health Organisation (WHO), too, has stated that this can be an indication for another major crisis,” Thackeray said. “Like other countries, the state will have to start penalising people for violating social distancing. For instance, people will be fined for not wearing a mask at a public place; action against people for crowding a public place, etc. We will have to take such steps as people are not following norms seriously,” the chief minister added. He said that the state government doesn’t want to re-impose lockdown restrictions, but this can be avoided only when people start taking all precautions, he warned. Thackeray also challenged the Opposition’s charge that he was missing in action on the ground. He said, “They make allegations that I don’t go on field, but with the help of video-conference technology I have already reached remotest areas where they are yet to reach.” The CM also asked people to share responsibility, while reiterating the government’s new initiative of a house-to-house survey starting from September 15. The survey called ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ aims to identify each and every citizen for influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and citizens with comorbidities. A team of health workers will conduct house-to-house survey and inspect every person of a family and suggest available services for the diseases. Those having Covid-19 symptoms will also be recommended for swab test, etc. On the issue of Maratha reservation, he asked the community to exercise patience and not to organise protests as the state government is taking all the efforts to ensure they will continue to get benefits of reservation in jobs and education. The Apex court, last week, while referring the state’s decision to grant Maratha quota to a larger bench, had stayed the ongoing reservation process. This is being seen as a political setback for the Thackeray-led government as it will stall ongoing admissions, leading to chaos, and antagonise the Maratha community that makes up nearly 50% of the state’s populace. The state’s BJP unit criticised the CM’s address, saying that Thackeray said nothing on how they were going to control the pandemic and bring the economy back on track. Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye, in a statement, said, “The situation of coronavirus has become worse. There is a shortfall of oxygen supply due to which a few patients died in Pune. We were expecting an effective policy to be declared by the chief minister, but he chose to repeat basic norms and precautions to be taken at public places,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-weather-political-storms-and-coronavirus-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-5gbbYaFb9omy6zOAvMY50M.html
13-09-2020||City||Fight against Covid-19: Citizens in Mumbai to be fined ₹200 for not wearing a mask from today||While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) last week reduced the fine for those seen without masks to ₹200 from ₹1,000, it will enforce the rule strictly from Monday, amid the steady spike of Covid-19 cases. The civic body has also decided to examine if de-listed private hospitals need to restart taking in Covid-19 patients. The decision will be taken in a meeting of civic health officials on Monday afternoon. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the civic body’s public health department said on Sunday evening: “On Monday morning, I will convey to all officers in writing that the fine of ₹200 for not wearing a mask should be strictly enforced, so that there is no confusion. Powers will be delegated to field officers to fine citizens. These include staff of the solid waste management department, and any official from any department who is doing field work.” These include employees from the licence and health department. Kakani also said on Saturday, “In a meeting on Monday, we will take a call on whether we need to activate some private hospitals to increase bed capacity. Currently, the bed capacity we have is sufficient and we have many vacant beds at the end of each day.” In mid-May, when Mumbai witnessed a similar spike, the state had decided to reserve 80% of beds in private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. However, with the curve showing an improvement in May, over 70 such private hospitals and nursing homes were delisted. For the past two weeks, Mumbai has seen a steady spike in daily Covid-19 cases, with Thursday recording 2,371 new cases in a single day, the highest spike so far, and a significant number of days recording over 2,000 fresh cases. The number of active cases in Mumbai crossed the 30,000 mark on Sunday, with a total of 30,316 active cases. According to figures from BMC, the last time active cases in Mumbai crossed 30,000 was June 23, with 30,063 active cases, after which they had steadily declined, and did not cross the 30,000 mark again until Sunday. On Sunday, Mumbai recorded 2,089 new cases, taking the total to 169,741. Mumbai also recorded 41 deaths, taking the toll to 8,150. Mumbai’s recovery rate has dropped to 77% from the 80% recorded by the end of August. The doubling rate has dropped to 56 days, and the overall growth rate is 1.2%. According to the civic body, the bed capacity available is sufficient to cater to patients in the present scenario, even with a high number of cases daily. As of Saturday, Mumbai has 37% of its 16,063 total beds vacant, which include hospital beds, beds in jumbo facilities and in quarantine centres for asymptomatic patients. While 19% of its 6,879 beds available for symptomatic patients are vacant, 5% of the 1,417 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are vacant, and 36% of the 7,852 oxygen beds are vacant. Kakani said on Saturday, “The maximum number of cases coming up now are asymptomatic, and continue to come from high-rises in the suburbs. As BMC has allowed home quarantine for asymptomatic patients, if they have a separate room and an attached toilet, people are opting to stay at home. This is why, so far, we have not seen a shortage of beds.” Kakani said, “The trend in new cases shows more cases are coming from high-rises. We noticed even those are among domestic help and drivers working for the residents. The occupants are taking care.” BMC has attributed the spike to high number of daily tests. As per BMC data, on September 9, 15,701 tests were conducted in the city, 15,119 on September 10 and 15,827 tests on September 11, as opposed to August’s highest of 8,000-9,000 a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fight-against-covid-19-citizens-in-mumbai-to-be-fined-200-for-not-wearing-a-mask-from-today/story-hjiyN3IaLJHBUa1NBmqksL.html

Ranaut, accompanied by her sister Rangoli, spent 20 minutes talking to Koshiyari at Raj Bhavan.“A short while ago, I met His Excellency the Governor of Maharashtra Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari Ji. I explained my point of view to him and also requested that justice be given to me it will restore faith of common citizen and particularly daughters in the system,” tweeted Ranaut, after the meeting.Ranaut has been in a running battle with the Shiv Sena, which was further aggravated after the Sena ruled BMC partially demolished her Bandra office, citing illegal construction.Commenting on the meeting, Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut said, “Anyone can meet the Governor.” He further said though the party will not speak about her, all her statements will be noted. “We will just listen to what she says but will not react to her. We will, however, take note of all her statements,” he added. Earlier this week, it had been reported that Koshyari was unhappy with the demolition drive by BMC on Ranaut’s bungalow. However, on Friday the Governor had clarified that he never expressed discontent over the civic body’s decision or intervened in the issue. The Ranaut-Sena verbal spat started when the actor responded to a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ram Kadam slamming the state government for not offering her protection. In reply, Ranaut said she does not trust Mumbai Police. Reacting to her criticism in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut asked Ranaut not to return to Mumbai since she had no faith in the Mumbai Police. This provoked Ranaut to compare Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which provoked all-round condemnation of her. The Central government then provided Y+ security cover to Ranaut, which angered the state government further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-complains-to-maharashtra-governor-koshiyari-over-ill-treatment-by-state-government/story-TCS9kLvnI4fBb8yttmjA8I.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||NEET conducted at 32 centres in Chandigarh amid precautions||In view of the Covid pandemic, the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) was held amid strict precautions for 15,931 candidates at 32 centres here on Sunday. The exam began at 2pm however, staggered entry started at 11am. Boys and girls were made to line up separately outside the centres. Only 15 students from each line were allowed to enter the centre at once. However, a rush of parents and students could be seen outside some centres. Parents could be seen lined up outside Sri Guru Gobind Singh Senior Secondary School in Sector 35, on the other side of the road. Shubham, who had come from Karnal to appear for the exam, said that no social distance was maintained by this crowd and that he was afraid of standing in the queue outside the school. Another candidate, Deepak Kumar of Chandigarh, said that parents’ crowding right outside the gate was making the applicants anxious while they were going through their notes for the last time before the exam. Around six to seven candidates here had a higher body temperature than normal. However, after 15 minutes their temperature was checked again following which they were allowed to take the exam. Outside Guru Gobind Singh Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School in Ratwara Sahib, Mullanpur, the situation was the same. Manas Prabhu, who gave his exam here, said, “While inside the centre all safety protocols were followed, outside, large crowds of students awaiting their turn and parents had formed.” Officials confirmed that the city didn’t witness any case where a student had to be shifted to an isolation room or had to be checked by health authorities. EXAM EASY AND NCERT-BASED Most students remained cheerful after the exam. Satyam Chaudhary, who had come from Yamunanagar, Haryana, said, “The paper was based entirely on the NCERT books. The answers to most questions were straightforward. Physics was mostly formula-based. I will score the most in biology.” Satyam added that all SOPs were followed and that 10 students were present in his class while two remained absent. Karanvinder Singh from Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab, also found the exam easy. “The pattern was similar to that of the 2019 paper. It was very scoring. The extra vigilance owing to the Covid situation didn’t make students lose their focus.” Arun Gandhi of Chandigarh said, “Although the exam was easy I found it a little lengthy. After it ended, I still had around 10 questions left to answer. Physics was surprisingly easy, even compared to last year, and was very scoring.” Devinder Singh, principal, Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 22, said that attendance at his centre remained over 90%. Kunal Singh, who provides coaching for NEET in Sector 34, said this year around 13 questions had been repeated from the previous year papers.He said, “Around 34 out of the total 45 physics questions were simple two-step questions. Some questions on practical experiments were also asked. Cut offs for colleges are likely to go high this year as the exam was highly scoring.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/neet-conducted-at-32-centres-in-chandigarh-amid-precautions/story-L8gCinPZyiYd3GLPOnxrpL.html

PK Chhuneja, head, department of entomology, PAU, said incidences of fall armyworm in timely sown grain maize has been rare, and at this stage, it has further diminished. He added that based on last year’s experience, incidence in the coming days on fodder maize is also imminent. So, farmers have been advised to regularly survey their fields, especially the crops sown late, and take up immediate management measures as soon as the pest is observed on the crop.During the regular survey, egg masses and younger larval instar can be collected and destroyed. Weather conditions in September-October are favourable for the infestation by this pest, Chhuneja said.He added that the pest is easier to control in the initial stage, while the grown larvae cause more damage, making round to oblong holes in leaves along with large amount of faecal matter. The larvae can be identified from four spots in square pattern at rear end and white-coloured inverted Y-shaped mark on the head. Pest management Fodder maize should not be sown after mid-August. Avoid staggered sowing of maize especially in adjacent fields Incidence of the pest is higher in high density planting of fodder maize while it is lesser in mixed cropping, for example, when sown along with bajra Use recommended doses of fertilisers Collect and destroy egg masses of fall armyworm from leaves. Egg masses are covered with hairs and are easily visible In case of higher pest attack, spray Coragen 18.5 SC (chlorantraniliprole). Use 120 litres of water per acre for up to 20 days old crop and increase the quantity by up to 200 litres as per crop growth. Direct the nozzle towards the whorl of the plantObserve a waiting period of 21 days (after spray) before harvest to ensure safety of animals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-agri-varsity-issues-advisory-against-pest-infesting-maize-crops/story-xprF4x8jS0Dj6WNHFcTOaJ.html

13-09-2020||Chandigarh||Tribune flyover: Expert panel to review fresh objections||The expert committee constituted by the UT adviser last year has taken up for review fresh objections raised against the Tribune flyover project , which has been marred by controversies ever since its conception.The move comes in compliance with an order of the Punjab and Haryana high court. In December 2019, the HC had asked the administration to respond to a representation of petitioners Jagwant Bath, an army veteran, and Chander Prakash, a city-based environmentalist, who had raised objections to the construction of the flyover.Notably, after their multiple reminders remained unanswered for nearly eight months, the petitioners filed a contempt petition against UT adviser Manoj Parida, chief engineer Mukesh Anand and executive engineer Rajesh Bansal. On September 10, the day their petition was listed for hearing in the HC, the administration finally called them for a meeting.The technical committee was setup on the directions of the HC in a petition by Run Club in October 2019. Staying the cutting of trees for the project, the court had directed the UT adviser to consider public and expert suggestions and objections to the project. The committee has already submitted its report to the adviser. The UT administrator later decided that his advisory council views will also be taken on the issue before the adviser submits the report to the HC.AGAINST MASTER PLANIn their representation, the petitioners have termed the project a result of “ad hocism” on the administration’s part and “antithetical” to the planned nature of the City Beautiful. “The project is in violation of the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031 and this has also been categorically stated by the UT urban planning department multiple times in their official communications,” they contended. They also highlighted in their submission that the approval of the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee was elicited by calling a meeting of only its subcommittee.Arguing that it is a single-point project, they stated, “To support it, several such projects will be needed in the tricity. This is not the solution to traffic congestion and pollution, and will result in unacceptable levels of pollution in the entire tricity.”They have also raised objection on the project being private vehicle centric. “It is against the National Urban Transport Policy 2014 and a report of Inter-Ministerial Committee of Union Government. Flyovers merely push congestion to the next intersection and lead to increased traffic and congestion in the long term. Also, the Tribune junction was chosen arbitrarily for the flyover project.”The committee is yet to respond to the petitioners’ objections.PROJECT SO FARJune 2016: Centre approves the projectMarch 2019: Foundation stone laid by UT administrator VP Singh BadnoreNovember 20: High court stays removal of trees on a petition by NGO Run ClubDecember 23: UT adviser holds public hearing on project as per HC directionsFebruary 2020: Adviser’s technical committee submits report rejecting all alternatives to projectMarch 2020: UT administrator decides report to be tabled before advisory council||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tribune-flyover-expert-panel-to-review-fresh-objections/story-dxV6VK2GxjVztCDgqPkKOM.html

13-09-2020||Chandigarh||Wild growth, stagnating water: Mohali smart schools in bad shape||Overgrown weeds and shrubs and a haven for drug addicts – a number of primary and middle government schools converted a few months back to smart schools by the Punjab government are in bad shape due to neglect as they remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.With no gardeners visiting, many buildings are covered by wild growth. Flies are breeding in some places where water has collected after rain.A visit to Majri block of Mohali district revealed that the gate of a school had been left open. Addicts gathered there in the evening to take drugs, locals complained. Some of the teachers HT contacted said they had contributed to making the schools smart and were trying to get maintenance work done. Surinder Kaur, who is in charge of the Government Smart Middle School at Kasauli village in Majri block, said: “We have requested the village to get it cleaned under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). We don’t have any gardener or peon in the school. We have spent Rs 45,000 to make it a smart school and have received only Rs 15,000 from the education department. Most of the money has been contributed by the teachers and panchayat.”Commenting on the matter, district education officer (secondary), Himmat Singh said, “due to Covid-19, we are not getting the labour to clean the grass and carry out maintenance work in the school. The staff sometimes visits, but we will get it cleaned soon.“Most of the government schools are in a state of neglect as staff members don’t come in... even during the unlock period,” said former zila parishad member and resident of Majrian village, Chaudhary Sham Lal.“The school has become the den for the drug addicts, especially in the evening as main gates have not been locked,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wild-growth-stagnating-water-mohali-smart-schools-in-bad-shape/story-58pRpN91wtTSJwSFFKzDxI.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s poor show in ease of doing business rankings no surprise: Industrialists||For the industry insiders, Chandigarh’s poor show in the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) rankings last week has come as no surprise. The parameters on which the city failed to score high are good indicators of tardy industrial and business growth in the city, they say.The city’s industrial base had already been contracting before the Covid-19 pandemic hit hard. “In the last five years, the number of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) decreased by nearly 35% and industrial workforce shrank by around 20%. Nearly, 40% space in the twin Industrial Areas remains vacant,” says Naveen Manglani, president, Chambers of Chandigarh Industry.The IT industry, which saw quick growth after the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park was set up in 2005, is also facing similar challenges in growth and expansion.“Chandigarh in the past had taken the lead in the IT industry in the tricity. We worked hard to propel the city on the technology map of India. By 2010, 25,000 jobs were created but now it has plateaued out. There is no additional land available for expansion,” says Vivek Atray, former director, IT, UT administration.LAND ISSUESWith the Industrial Area concentrated in a small area of 150 acres, land availability remains a major problem. “The demand for affordable conversion of leasehold property to freehold property is pending for more than a few decades,” says Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh.High collector rates (minimum value of sale or transfer set by local development authorities) of industrial plots are a hurdle to growth too as Mohali and Panchkula offer much cheaper land rates.“Effectively, the FAR (floor area ratio – ratio of a building’s total floor area to the area of the land on which it is built) in the city’s industrial area is 0.75. In Mohali, it nearly three times higher,” says Manglani.The inspector raj too is still prevalent, industrialists complain, asking for lower misuse and violation charges.SINGLE WINDOW SYSTEMAnother factor for the city’s poor industrial growth is lack of an online single window system.Highlighting the problem, the EODB 2019 report states: There is no “online single window system with functionality for online application submission, payment and approvals system.” Anyone setting up a business here cannot expect a one-time response to all queries/clarifications related to applications, reads the report. Services like labour, water, electricity, etc are also unavailable through a single window.ACCESS TO INFORMATION“For smaller businesses and entrepreneurs trying to set up their units, access to information from one single source is required. This enables quick and easily accessible information on all approvals and other requirements needed,” says Munish Jauhar, founder CEO of GrayCell Technologies and former president of TiE, Chandigarh.Commenting on the matter, Harjit Singh Sandhu, director, Industries, says, “Most of the UT departments, including the municipal corporation, estate office, etc have either already made many of the services available online or are in the process of doing it. This will improve the city’s EODB rankings.”Referring specifically to the industry, Sandhu, adds, “Paucity of land for starting new projects is a big impediment to industrial growth and expansion in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-poor-show-in-ease-of-doing-business-rankings-no-surprise-industrialists/story-prx5idc4KPs3MN7Am4G7gJ.html

Fund crunch and layoffs can also be a reason that many residents have not been able to opt for this scheme.”A resident Sukhwinder Singh said, “I opted for this scheme in 2017 for a better future of my daughter and decided to open another account for my eight-month-old daughter, but due to Covid-19 outspread, I was unable to open the account.”Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is a government-backed savings scheme as part of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana’ for the benefit of the girl child. A parent or a guardian can open only one account in the name of one girl child and a maximum of two accounts in the name of two different girl children.Sukanya Samriddhi Account can be opened up to the age of 10 years only from the date of birth. To open the account, one has to fill the Sukanya Samriddhi Account opening form and submit it in any one of the authorised bank branches or a post office.One needs to submit identity documents including the birth certificate of the girl child, address proof of the guardian or parents of the girl child, and identity proof of the guardian or the parents of the girl child.The parent or guardian can deposit a maximum of ₹1,50,000 in a financial year. The scheme fetches an interest rate of 7.6% per annum. The scheme is completely exempted from income tax under Section 80 C and any amount deposited under this scheme will be exempt from tax at the time of investment, accrual of interest and payout of returns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-1-436-opt-for-sukanya-samriddhi-scheme-against-8-076-last-year/story-FtDhqI2wwy0VGnpZYUcEBL.html

13-09-2020||City||Save dairy animals from hyperthermia: GADVASU professor||Like humans, animals too suffer from heat intolerance, particularly when they are left in the direct sun and do not get adequate water.Domestic animals and poultry birds are particularly vulnerable to the heatwave. Hyperthermia (heat intolerance syndrome) is one of the commonly encountered problems among dairy animals in Punjab. The problem is most common in exotic and crossbred animals as said by Dr Charanjit Singh, professor-cum-head, department of veterinary medicine, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana.The condition occurs due to high environmental temperature and humidity. During the weather conditions, heat loss is reduced leading to an increase in body temperature called hyperthermia. Panting (marked increase in respiration rate), reduced appetite and milk production are the common manifestations.The most common initiating factor is poor ventilation and also sometimes in animals that have suffered from foot and mouth disease in the past as a result of damage to the heat regulation system in the brain. This condition is cannot be treated with antibiotics.Senior scientist in the department of veterinary medicine, Dr Sushma Chhabra said that hyperthermia is mostly observed during months of May to September with maximum cases recorded from July to September.Farmers remain cautious in July and August, while in September as the heatwave begins to recede, it has been observed that farmers become casual in their approach which triggers the problem, she said.During humid weather, the ambient temperature and relative humidity frequently exceed the critical comfort level of the temperature-humidity index (72), resulting in elevated body temperature and panting. The temperature-humidity index describes the effect of the environment on the animal’s ability to lose heat.Dr Charanjit Singh revealed that a study conducted by Dr Sushma Chhabra, and Dr SNS Randhawa, on dairy animals, showed that subcutaneous administration of 5 ml iodized oil ( containing 750 mg of elemental iodine) for three consecutive days may prove helpful in its management.More than 95% of the hyperthermic dairy animals recovered with this therapeutic regimen and no relapse was recorded during the post-treatment period of two months. He advised farmers to provide an ample quantity of water to animals, keep them away from direct sunlight in well-ventilated places, and give bath to dairy animals 2-3 times a day.He said that often farmers treat such animals with antibiotics and other drugs (diminazene or buparvacone). “This is absolutely not required unless the tick-related diseases have been confirmed by blood tests. If high fever persists or there is a loss of appetite and milk yield, get the blood of your animal examined at GADVASU for tick-borne diseases or other infections. Self-medication should be avoided by farmers. Contact only qualified veterinarians for treatment,” he added.BOX:Hyperthermia occurs due to high environmental temperature and humidityIt is one of the commonly encountered problems among dairy animals in PunjabPanting, reduced appetite and milk production are the common manifestationsThis condition is cannot be treated with antibioticsExperts advised farmers to provide an ample water to animals, keep them away from direct sunlight||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/save-dairy-animals-from-hyperthermia-gadvasu-professor/story-Z5GiaQ01CUlhvFQ1l0AsfM.html

13-09-2020||Delhi||Phase-4 stations will accept ‘One Nation One Card’, mobile phones to also work for entry: DMRC||The automatic fare collection system in the upcoming Phase-IV lines of the Delhi Metro will be fully compliant with the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), and commuters will also be able to use a mobile phone to enter or exit a station on its corridors, DMRC chief Mangu Singh has said.Asserting that Delhi Metro is a “modern metro system” comparable to the best in the world, he also said that these two facilities might be rolled out at the Airport Express Line by the end of this year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2019 had launched the indigenously-developed NCMC to enable people to pay multiple kinds of transport charges, including for metro and bus services across the country, through a common card.Dubbed as ‘One Nation One Card’, the inter-operable transport card would allow the holders to also pay their toll taxes, parking charges, retail shopping and even withdraw money.Singh said the facility to use mobile phones to enter or exit automatic fare collection (AFC) gates, are available in major modern modern systems in various countries, including in the Seoul Metro.“We are working to continuously improve our system, with better technological and other interventions, to improve our rolling stocks and energy efficiency. In Ph-IV, our AFC system will fully accept the national common mobility cards, which can be used in any cities,” he told PTI.“Also, a mobile phone will effectively work as smart card, and riders will be able to use to enter or exit the AFC gates, in Ph-IV lines,” Singh said.The managing director of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, however, underlined that e-payment system and technology are fast-evolving and by the time the Ph-IV work is complete, new technologies may emerge.“But, we have been working on it for quite some time, and the facilities of NCMC and entry and exit using mobile phones might be available by the end of this year on the Airport Express Line” he added.Currently, riders on the Airport Express Line can also enter or exit AFC gates using a QR code on mobile phone that has to be collected from a mertro counter, but the future plan is to have a system whereby commuters can generate their own QR codes on phones and enter through AFC gates using that facility, the top official said.The DMRC chief said, these two facilities will be first available on the brand new lines to be built under Ph-IV, and hopefully by the time the construction is over, the corridors to be built under this phase as extensions of existing lines, would “also be upgraded” for compliance.Asked if old smart cards will work in Ph-IV lines, he said, “Yes.” The Union Cabinet, in a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister, in March last year had approved three out of the six corridors of the Delhi Metro’s proposed phase IV.Under approved segment of Phase-IV, 61.679-km of new metro lines shall be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 metro stations. These new sections shall provide interconnectivity among the already operational lines of the Delhi Metro. According to the government, the Mukundpur-Maujpur, R K Ashram-Janakpuri West and Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridors were approved by the Cabinet.The other three proposed corridors of Phase-IV which have not yet been approved by the Union Cabinet are Rithala-Bawana-Narela, Inderlok-Indraprastha and Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block.After a long wait, work had begun on the construction of Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV project with a groundbreaking ceremony held at Haider Badli Mor here on December 30 last year.And, with that piling work had begun for construction of 10 stations of 28.92-km Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, which is an extension of the Magenta Line and will have a total of 22 stations. Asked about the status of construction of stations under Ph-IV, Singh said, tenders have been floated and finalised for all the major elevated sections.The DMRC chief said Ph-IV work has been affected by the COVID-19 situation but the ongoing project will get delayed only by a couple of months and the therefore “won’t entail much cost escalation”.“Individual projects have longer timelines, so impact wouldn’t be much. And, construction work has not been affected really as funding for such projects comes from JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) loans. Also, 80-90 per cent labourers are back after they had moved back to their native places due to the pandemic,” he said.“So, work is going on in full swing now,” Singh asserted.On the status of three remaining corridors of Ph-IV, he said, “currently there is a setback to all new projects, as far as central government is concerned, so we expect some delay in getting the sanctions”.“If sanction happens in a year’s time say, but we are keeping ourselves ready by then with the design and detailing. Also, from time of approval, work will begin in one-and-a-half year time, and completion time likely to be two-and-a-half years from then,” he said.The Ph-4 project will see many highs and several firsts for the DMRC, including the first-ever metro bridge over Yamuna to be built using the cantilever construction technique, and the highest point in the DMRC system, at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the viaduct level is going to be at 28 metre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/phase-4-stations-will-accept-one-nation-one-card-mobile-phones-to-also-work-for-entry-dmrc/story-RUvTeNB6ayeB1pzIswL0JJ.html

13-09-2020||City||Haryana’s terminated PTIs protest in Karnal, demand Ordinance for reappointment||Demanding continuation of their services, hundreds of terminated physical training instructors (PTIs) in Haryana organised a state-level protest rally at Karnal on Sunday. The sacked PTIs found support from the Haryana Sarv Karamchari Sangh, the members of which came out in large numbers to join their protest. Alleging that the government had taken away their employment due to the fault of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC), the PTIs demanded an Ordinance to reappoint them. It is pertinent to mention that the Supreme Court had set aside the recruitment of 1,983 PTIs, made in 2010 by the then Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government, after some irregularities were found in the recruitment process. On August 23 this year, the HSSC had conducted a fresh recruitment exam for about 7,500 candidates, who had applied against the vacancies in 2006. Most PTIs had boycotted the fresh exam that was conducted over a decade after the posts were first advertised. The agitating PTIs are now demanding that the government should not declare the result of the fresh recruitment exam. The agitators planned to hold a protest march but called it off after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar agreed to meet their representatives on October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-s-terminated-ptis-protest-in-karnal-demand-ordinance-for-reappointment/story-tNW3nTczzDfeXvqpJa3IUM.html

The announcement comes days after protesting farmers were lathicharged by the police during their statewide protest in Kurukshetra. In a meeting in Jind, Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said the farmers’ unions have decided to hold protests in all district headquarters on September 15 and block roads across the state on September 20 for three hours, if their demands are not met. “If the government remains defiant on this issue, we will start a statewide yatra from September 27,” Chaduni added. The BKU state chief also alleged that the government is trying to start another parallel agitation against them to weaken their fight against the three ordinances. “A few political parties are trying to gain mileage from our agitation, but we will not allow them to pull the protest from our hands,” he added. Chaduni hits out at Vij, Dalal for calling protesters ‘Cong workers’ Hitting out at Haryana home minister Anil Vij and agriculture minister JP Dalal, Chaduni said all protesters were farmers fighting for their rights. “Our protest is only associated with farmers. BJP ministers and other political parties should refrain from dividing us,” the BKU chief said. He added, “Vij is lying that the police did not resort to lathicharge on farmers. The videos are in public domain to expose his claim. The farmers were thrashed by policemen in civvies, who were deputed with an advance planning to thrash agitating farmers in Pipli,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bku-threatens-to-block-roads-in-haryana-on-sept-20-against-central-ordinances/story-1vDUatWwqsEVjO0Kn5SbAN.html

The bravado is only for Kashmiris. The might is only for Kashmiris. Wonder where the muscle-flexing disappears when it comes to species like the Taliban or for that matter the PLA,” responded People’s Conference president Sajad Lone to Akhtar’s tweet.Kashmir has been in the throes of militancy since 1989 over demands of ‘Aazadi’. Though the violence has come down considerably, every year hundreds, majority of them being local and foreign militants, die in gunfights with the security forces.Akhtar and Lone, both former ministers in PDP-BJP government, were among nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders who were detained for months when the central government effectively nullified Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/taliban-afgan-peace-talks-india-s-muscle-flexing-only-for-kashmir-say-valley-politicos/story-lWRi8bcvlfocXjIaDkjvMJ.html

Prachi Bari speaks to Amit Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), to understand the dynamics behind opening up the busiest marketplace in Camp amidst an ongoing pandemic. What prompted you to finally open up Shivaji Market?We have been in talks with the newly formed Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Traders’ Association, who have been relentless in their demands to reopen the market and hence, we gave them permission to open all 550 shops. It is their responsibility to maintain social distancing, have sanitiser stands and also wear masks and gloves. What kind of precautions have been taken at the market?The responsibility of taking care and maintaining social distancing among the customers lies with the shop owners. It will be their responsibility to follow the directives of wearing masks, installing santiser stands and wearing of gloves by the staff members working inside the market. We opened the market in a staggered way to see a response to it. A shopkeeper or vendor will be penalised Rs 1,000 if PCB finds social distancing norms being violated. For the next two counts, he/she will be fined Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 and if they are still found flouting norms, the shops will be closed.How are you checking if the norms are followed or not?We have PCB guards manning the gates, but they are only to keep vigil. I have directed the police to take necessary action and keep a squad to watch the movement of customers and stall owners and penalise violators.The market association claims that there is no electricity at the market. Why is it so?The stall owners owe the PCB Rs 50 lakh in lease. Besides, we have requested the chicken and beef market to be moved to Kondhwa, but these stall owners refuse to move and some of the stalls are using illegal electricity connections, from the main junction for streetlights which has been identified by MSEDCL. Thus they have imposed a penalty on the Cantonment board of Rs 4 lakh. Once the stall owners pay the lease, only then can we work on giving full electricity supply inside the market. Which other areas are still under lockdown in Camp?We are keeping places like Kumbhar Bavdi, Ghorpadi market and Fashion Street closed. When the cases are under control, we will look at reopening. 447 fined for not wearing masks properly inside marketEver since Chhatrapati Shivaji Market in Camp restarted business on September 1, shopkeepers were happy to see customers trickling in. However, last week, footfall diminished as police squads made their way into the market alleys to check for violations of Covid-19 norms. Customers who did not wear a mask were penalised by the police squads.Even the stall operators were not spared. Moin Sheikh, who works at the mutton stall inside the market, had worn his mask, but did not cover his nose with it. The police squad clicked his photo and penalised him (Rs 500). Senior police inspector Chandrakant Bhosale of Lashkar police station, who with his team, was keeping vigil at the market, said, “We are following the directives given by the Maharashtra government to penalise those who don’t wear a mask or don’t cover up their nose. In the past week, the police have fined 447 people for not wearing masks properly. I urge the people to consider this as a serious offence and follow the rules if you are outside your home and maintain social distancing at markets and on the roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/onus-of-implementing-covid-precautions-on-shivaji-market-traders-violators-to-be-penalised-pcb-ceo/story-VTbhRJIzxpzYvUGOleG59K.html

Initially, the art gallery will open only on the weekends and start operating regularly when the Covid situation improves.Visitors will be able to see some added artifacts and belongings of the artist at the refurbished museum. During the lockdown, the old roof of the complex was repaired, while the cracked floor was re-laid with tiles in addition to the painting work.For the first time, an additional exhibition hall displaying the artworks of other artists will be accessible to the public. With this, the visitors will be able to visit Sobha Singh’s studio, gallery, museum and artist residency and souvenir shop ‘Prampara’.The gallery attracts a large number of art lovers, artists, tourists and visitors from all over the country and abroad. Sobha Singh Art Gallery has around three dozen original works of the legendry artist. In 2011, Sobha Singh Museum was added to the complex.

13-09-2020||Pune||Not a ‘fish market’ anymore: Camp’s Shivaji Market fails to rev up business, draw in customers post lockdown||The iconic Shri Chatrapati Shivaji Market in Camp, which has been serving Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) residents, with fresh fruits and vegetables over the years, is missing its typical buzz. The pandemic has caused the booming business at the British-era heritage structure lose its lustre. After all vendors were allowed to operate from September 1, the business still hasn’t picked up pace. A place which was the quintessential ‘local fish market’ with all its bearings of loud sale calls by vendors and bylanes brimming with customers making their way to get fresh produce, is now a dull, silent place. However, residents say that the market area has become cleaner with all the Covid-19 protocols in place and they do not see muck on the market floors and there are santisers everywhere. Residents also like the slightly empty alleys of the marketplace as it helps them manoeuvre through the area while maintaining social distancing, which would have been impossible in pre-Covid times here.The empty lanes, however, paint a sorry picture for the 550 traders who had been waiting for four months to restart their business. Despite being part of ‘essential services’, one of the oldest marketplaces in the city, is facing huge losses as customers now look at home deliveries and do not want to step out. The market, with lower stalls and upper stalls for fish, chicken, mutton, vegetables, fruits and provision stores, runs between 7am and 7pm. Traders say they get a glimpse of the bustling life between 9am and 12pm, when most of the footfall is registered now. However, despite implementing all Covid-19 precautions, the footfall is too low to help the market survive.“We reopened our shops after four months. There are no good signs of business here as customers do not want to come because of the fear of spread of the virus,” Abdul Wahid Momim, a committee member and chicken stall holder of the newly formed Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Traders’ Association.The shops in the market were open for 12 days in July from July 1-12 followed by a 10-day lockdown. On July 22, PCB allowed reopening of 33% stalls with the odd-even formula. This shutdown has hit the traders hard. “We are facing a 70 per cent loss in business and ever since we opened up, we are doing only 25 to 30 per cent of our earlier business volume,” added Momim.As per Manzur Shaikh, president of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Traders Association, constant vigilance by the police officials from the nearby Char Bawdi police chowky, has contributed to keeping customers at bay. “The fear of being caught inside the market without a mask is affecting our customers. We often get calls from them asking if it is safe for them to come in. Some of them relay their orders over the phone and then, we deliver them, thus maintaining social distancing, but it only works on certain days and on large bulk orders in terms of meat and fish. Sadly, it is not the same for vegetable vendors.”The vegetable and fruit market are empty inside the market. “We have followed all the protocols set by the PCB- from masks to sanitisers. However, the pandemic has managed to kill our business, which has been running for the past 55 years. We are facing 70 to 80 per cent loss in business as we are paying rent (which is hiked every three years, this year by 30 per cent), electricity, as well as our staff salary. We had to remove most of our staff and now family members are managing the stall,” said Sharad Borate, owner of Jai Bharat vegetable suppliers, which has been a part of the market since 1965. Meanwhile, there are some who live close to the market and cannot resist the call of fresh produce. Manali Thopte, a regular customer, said, “When the lockdown was announced, the market shut down and it was a problem for us as we usually stock everything from the market because the produce is very fresh. When I heard that the market is open again, I came back. Initially, I was hesitant to enter the market as I have an infant at home and was worried about the virus, but I come equipped with gloves, mask and sanitiser.”Similarly, a student of Azam Campus, and resident of Bhavani peth, Achumi Lhosheto, has been coming to this market for the past three years. “The vegetables are sold at a higher price elsewhere, while here it is quite reasonable and fresh.”Adding to the traders’ woes is no electricity and water supply to the market. Although the stall owners are paying for electricity and water within the market, the electricity has been cut due to non-payment by PCB , leaving the streetlights inside the market shut for almost a year. Also the stalls dealing with meat, need running water, which too has been shut off. “We are all using our personal connection of water and electricity to run the business,” said Dhanajay Varad, a member of the association. “We completed 100 days of keeping the fish market closed, and are bearing a loss of Rs 16 lakh. I have seven freezers and all of them were stocked with fish when the lockdown was announced. I had to throw all the produce as the electricity supply to the market was cut off. Currently, only 5 per cent of the sale is happening as compared to the sale earlier which was around Rs 1.5 lakh before the lockdown. We are selling fish at the cheapest rate possible, for example, Bombay duck which usually would cost Rs 300 per kg this season, is being sold at Rs 100 per kg,” said Ashwin Pardeshi, Aatish Seafood, stall owner.For Khushnuma Daruwalla, a resident of East Street, fish is a staple diet of their family. “ I am a Parsi and we love to eat fish. Earlier, I would come here twice a week to pick up the freshest produce that was available, but ever since the lockdown, we pick up in bulk and store it. With the market open, I come here twice a week and take enough produce to last a week. The place is very clean and is sanitized.” Aasma Shaikh, a resident of Taboot Street, said, “ I have pets at home and I have to buy chicken for them. During the lockdown it was difficult to manage, but now that they have opened the market, I am happy to see that they have sanitizer stands and the place is cleaner. The staff wears gloves and masks. Earlier, I used to come here thrice a week, now only twice, if need be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/not-a-fish-market-anymore-camp-s-shivaji-market-fails-to-rev-up-business-draw-in-customers-post-lockdown/story-dRMZu0gFljcLjyUWNVZNtJ.html
13-09-2020||City||Kerala: Parents of minor girls found dead 3 years ago stage protest||The parents of two minor girls, who were found dead under mysterious circumstances at Walayar in Kerala three years ago, staged a sit-in protest in Kochi on Sunday seeking justice. The mother of the deceased girls said she is under tremendous pressure to withdraw the case and the official, who had allegedly weakened the case, was promoted to the rank of Indian Police Service (IPS) in August. The siblings, aged 12 and eight, were found dead at their home within a span of 52 days at Walayar in Palakkad district when their labourer parents were out for work. The incident, which had occurred in 2017, had hit national headlines after many compared it with the rape and murder of an eight-year-old in Kathua in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). Also read: Telangana man kills 5-year old daughter of a woman he was stalking“Three years have passed and we are yet to get justice. We feel sad when the people who committed the heinous crime roam freely. The official, who weakened the case, was recently promoted to the rank of IPS. We are forced to hit the street again,” said the mother. The elder girl had died on January 13, 2017, and the younger sibling 52 days later. The autopsy report had revealed that both the girls were subjected to sexual assault.The mother had named a few accused after the death of her elder daughter, but police allegedly failed to take any action. “There were many attempts to sabotage the case. If the government was sincere, the poor parents would have got justice long ago,” said Justice Kamal Pasha, a retired Kerala high court (HC) judge. He said only an independent probe could ensure justice to the poor parents. Kerala was rocked by protests last year when a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) court in Palakkad had set free the four accused and passed serious strictures against the investigating team. Many witnesses turned hostile during the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-parents-of-minor-girls-found-dead-3-years-ago-stage-protest/story-vmQs0WtteUZpeVcvrRMJuO.html

The yatra was a month-long affair last year.The Chhadi Yatra in Uttarakhand is almost similar to the Chhadi Mubarak event carried out in Jammu & Kashmir prior to the opening of the revered Shri Amarnath shrine. It is believed that the Bageshwar-Haridwar Chhadi Yatra pilgrimage dates back to one thousand years and was stalled only for a brief period during the British rule.On the banks of the sacred Gomti and Darati rivers in Bageshwar at Bagnath temple, the mace is worshipped. Shri Panch Dashnami Juna Akhada revived this pilgrimage last year after a hiatus of seven decades. It is now being carried out under Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad banner. While on Sunday the yatra reached Bageshwar, on Monday, it will return to the revered shrine of Mayadevi and special rituals will be held at Shri Daksheshwar Mahadev temple here. Ganga Sabha will also hold special Ganga prayers for the holy mace at the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri. Also Read: New landslide zones activated on Char Dham road: ExpertsShri Mahant Prem Giri, national chairperson of Juna Akhada, said initially the Chhadi Yatra was to be held for a months’ duration but due to the Covid pandemic, the pilgrimage is being done symbolically with full rituals. Sub divisional magistrate, Haridwar, Gopal Singh Chauhan, said the pilgrimage holds immense significance and providence of facilities to the saints accompanying the mace has been put in place.

Akhada Parishad office bearers said that earlier the plan was to start the Chhadi Yatra prior to commencement of Char Dham pilgrimage but due to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent restrictions, the pilgrimage got deferred this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-s-ancient-chhadi-yatra-cut-down-to-72-hrs-due-to-covid-19/story-Fgs1QoVtmVVzcyKMgWvGqI.html
13-09-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Grateful to staff at Covid-19 care facilities||Even as the administration claims to take measures to ensure Covid patients are provided medical attention; patients and their relatives and private caregivers have mixed responses. Readers share experiences…Civic official arranged hospital bed facility My elder daughter and I were tested Covid-19 positive. As a medical officer said that it was asymptomatic cases, we decided to follow the home quarantine guidelines. However, after three days, my daughter and I became restless. Our struggle to get hospital beds began. Despite willingness to pay for medical facility, beds were unable in private hospitals. We were told that government hospitals are already facing bed shortage. Finally, a Pune Municipal Corporation staffer arranged a semi-private room in a private hospital for us. Though the hospital administration was indifferent when we inquired for bed availability, the staff took care of my daughter and me after admission.NATreatment at Naidu hospital is commendableI tried to get admitted at the jumbo Covid care facility that came up at the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) grounds, but was denied admission citing bed shortage. Later, with the help of a corporator and one of the PMC officials, I got admitted at the PMC-run Naidu hospital, one of state’s first dedicated Covid hospitals in Pune. I was given proper medical care at the hospital and even the food provided was satisfactory. Despite being a government hospital, staff were cooperative and helpful.ASWorst experience of my life I went through a worst phase of my life during the present coronavirus situation. Our family was on panic mode when my father and I were detected positive. Being an asymptomatic case, I preferred to stay at home and followed the guidelines for Covid-19 patients issued by the authorities. However, my father had to be admitted at the Covid jumbo facility at COEP grounds because of his age. Initially, there was no means of communication as my father’s mobile was not charged and the reception was not giving proper information. We were clueless about his health before we were able to contact him. Later, I got a message that my father passed away. PRDelay in ambulance serviceAfter being tested Covid positive with symptoms, the medical officer directed for hospital quarantine. The symptoms included difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation, pain/pressure in chest and numbness in limb. My family tried to contact ambulance operators, but were unable to get any ambulance despite calling many people for three to four hours. Many said that they have few ambulances and are facing heavy rush. Later, we visited three private hospitals, but were told that all beds are occupied. Finally, we decided to stay put in front of a reputed private hospital. We requested them to allow us to wait at their premises and give us admission when there is bed vacancy. Later, with the help of a hospital staff and after waiting for a few hours, I was given a bed in the general ward of the private hospital. Post admission, the experience was good as they provided good medical care and food. I was also able to communicate with my family under hospital quarantine.SDStaff deputed at Covid care centres are working hardThe medical treatment given to me as a coronavirus patient has been an eye-opener and I appreciate the work done by all stakeholders in checking the virus spread. I was admitted to a PMC Covid care centre after being tested Covid-19 positive. Initially, I was unhappy with the facilities, mainly food quality. Later, when one of my co-patients showed me news on mobile that many Covid positive cases are unable to get hospital beds and ambulance facility, I was grateful to the given medical treatment. The experience increased my respect for civic staff. I realised that the Covid care facility is not a home or hotel that I would get everything I want. My priority should be to get well and this positive thought helped me a lot to improve. It also helped to have friendly relations with the staff working at the facility. The staff deputed at Covid centres are working hard and risking their lives to provide treatment to patients.RPFollowed home isolation norms strictly I was advised home isolation after a health official confirmed that I was an asymptomatic case. I was monitored by a field staff and was told to give daily update to a dedicated call centre contact. My medical health was recorded by the centre, including body temperature, pulse rate and oxygen saturation. The field staff guided me on measuring these parameters. My family was also informed on what all steps to be taken as per quarantine norms. I adhered to the home isolation norms as guided by the medical staff strictly. Even my details were updated to senior medical staff. I completed the quarantine period and later was tested negative after undergoing a few tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-grateful-to-staff-at-covid-19-care-facilities/story-bcBpx1eFsIbgPgRnzYqJHO.html

The forest department aims to train 750 locals from 250 villages, considered high-risk from the human-snake conflict point of view, under the project named “Community based human-snake conflict mitigation in Kumaon Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India” Tejaswini Patil, chief conservator of forests (CCF) Kumaon region said that the state government had been spreading awareness about human-snake conflict, but with this project, the department will also be able to learn more about the different types of snakes found in the region. “A lot of different kinds of snakes are found in the Kumaon region, but not a lot is known about them. Every year, we conduct awareness generation programmes due to which people now, do not kill snakes but rather inform quick response team for rescue, but still as the awareness level is low, people always feel a threat. With this project, we will be studying different types of snakes found in this region and map the areas where they are found, to find conflict hotspots,” said Patil. Also Read: 5,000 Himalayan streams to be rejuvenated under MGNREGA in UttarakhandShe added that the project aims to assess the abundance, intensity of human-snake conflict and awareness level in communities for snakes and mitigation of human-snake conflict. As part of the project, the status of the conflict will be studied division and species wise. It will also study the mitigation measures currently employed, status of compensatory measures and public opinion on this issue.

According to the office of Inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR), revised RR rates for Pashan and Bibvewadi have seen a rise of 20 per cent while Lohegaon has witnessed a rise of 17.5 per cent. Bhavani peth and Pune Cantonment areas have witnessed a rise of 15.25 per cent respectively. The RR rates are standard value of immovable property assessed by the state on the basis of which stamp duty is charged. This means, the higher the RR rates, the higher will be the stamp duty. The revised RR rates have come into effect from Saturday across the state. The revision in RR rates has come at a time when the state government has slashed stamp duty in Maharashtra. According to the IGR note, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, areas which have witnessed a maximum fall in RR rates are parts of Narayan and Budhwar peths (5 per cent). The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) Pune chapter has protested the revision in the RR rates saying it will have a negative impact on the economy as a whole. “Though the government claims that the average increase is only 1.74 per cent, it is misleading the public. In certain cases, the increase is as high as 10 per cent. Since there is no improvement in the situation, the sector needs a booster rather than such an uncalled upward revision. The increase is adhoc and has no scientific base,” said Suhas Merchant, president of Credai-Pune Metro. According to Ashwin Trimal, managing committee member of Credai-Pune Metro, the rates of residential properties have increased across the board in developing areas, including 23 villages merged recently. However, the rates in old city limits are untouched which can be termed as developed areas, since there is not much development and hence, no sale happening in those areas, observed Trimal. Besides 1.56 per cent increase in PMC limits, there has been an increase of 3.41 per cent in Pimpri-Chinchwad. The, IGR however, has not increased rates for Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pashan-bibvewadi-in-pune-see-highest-ready-reckoner-rates-revision/story-H8EIBHo1eHEAJxbM9OpQbL.html
13-09-2020||Pune||National highways traffic passing through Pune back to 95% of pre-Covid level||The traffic on national highways passing through Pune region is back on track to at least 95 per cent of its normal levels during the pre-Covid period. The three national highways passing through Pune include Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, Pune-Solapur road and the Pune-Ahmednagar road. Post lifting of movement of goods and people with e-pass - traffic had increased to 50 per cent. However, after the Maharashtra government abolished e-pass system from September 2, highway traffic has resumed almost 95 per cent of its level compared to pre-Covid levels on three national highways, according to highway police. Police have noted that after e-pass was abolished, there is an increase in private passenger vehicles with people travelling more and numbers growing on weekends. According to the highway police, the expressway is seeing traffic at an average between 35,000 to 40,000 vehicles passing through daily while the other highways passing through the city are seeing an average of 8,000 vehicles passing through all and it the same. Highways superintendent of police for Pune region, Pritam Yawalkar, said there have been traffic jams at toll posts and lane cutting incidents have increased in number. “With all restrictions on travel removed, the vehicular movement has increased considerably. Traffic is almost normal and returned to 95 per cent of normal levels and will become completely normal in the next few days.”Similar observations were noted by regular commuters and toll collection staff. The traffic had come to complete standstill during the lockdown and even after reopening, the traffic moved at a slow pace. However later, as the demands of the markets increased, it put pressure on the transport operators to ensure that their entire fleet was on the roads for supplying essentials and goods to the nook and cranny of the country. Santosh Jondhale, who works at the Khed Shivapur toll post, said, “During the past one month, we have seen a significant increase in the number of heavy vehicles, goods carriers and cars passing through the area. Sometimes, traffic jams take place at the toll post and we have to ensure that the commuters follow lane discipline and adhere to Covid-19 norms.” Vanshika Patil, who was travelling along with her husband to Satara, said, “It is the fourth time during the past two months that I had come to Pune to meet my ailing parents who stay in Baner. During my first visit, the traffic on the highway was sparse and few heavy vehicles and passenger vehicles were seen. However, as of today, there is regular traffic and it seems that we have already inched towards normalcy on the highway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/national-highways-traffic-passing-through-pune-back-to-95-of-pre-covid-level/story-ReAntvaqbEDGIbcLZpheuK.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||HP tourism has no money for employee salaries||The Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC), which has suffered losses of ₹36 crore due to the Covid-19 pandemic, has no money for employee salaries or benefits for retired workers. The Jai Ram Thakur-led government had sanctioned a relief amount of ₹20 crore to support HPTDC, but because of bureaucratic bungling only ₹11.60 lakh was released. The situation is so grave that even though the middle of September is approaching, Class-III and Class-IV employees of HPTDC are yet to get their salaries. Many of them say they have been paid only up to July.The corporation’s coffers emptied out after all hotels closed as tourists stayed away from the state due to the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. And now, most hotels are running empty during the unlock phase.The government’s decision to convert some HPTDC hotels into institutional quarantine centres, however, helped generate Rs 5 crore. But losses continue to mount as the corporation has to spend ₹5.30 lakh on salaries and allowances every month. The government also has to pay ₹ 8 crore to HPTDC for losses it suffered due to Himachal Bhawan and Sadan remaining closed in Delhi and Chandigarh, respectively. Meanwhile, it has been learnt that CM Jairam Thakur has issued instructions to the secretary, tourism, and top officials of the finance department to resolve the matter of salaries.Congress MLA Sukhvindra Singh Sukhu has also asked that the employees be paid immediately.Bleak future for 60,000 taxi operators Over 40,000 taxi operators in the state are on the verge of losing their livelihood while 20,000 are without any work.Many operators have sold their vehicles to repay bank loans for the taxis. Many of them have also demanded waiving of road taxes for a year if there is no business.“I had three taxis. I sold two to pay my monthly installment. Over 20,000 operators are jobless,” says Narendra Thakur, general secretary, Devbhoomi Taxi Operators’ Union.

13-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt directs 33 pvt hospitals to reserve 80% of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday the city government has instructed 33 big private hospitals in the national capital to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, amid a shortage of such beds at some facilities. Delhi has been witnessing a surge in novel coronavirus cases from the last week of August. Delhi recorded its biggest single-day jump of 4,321 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the city’s tally to over 2.14 lakh, authorities said. It was for the fourth day in a row that over 4,000 fresh cases were recorded in Delhi. “Yesterday, we instructed 33 private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of their ICU beds for coronavirus patients. This has been done since issues were being faced with regards to ICU beds in some private hospitals. I also held a video conference over this and an order has been issued in this regard,” he told reporters here. Jain said there are sufficient number of ICU beds in state-run and Centre-run hospitals, and also said there are sufficient number of other beds in hospitals. “We have also instructed hospitals to increase bed strength by 30 per cent for coronavirus patients, in case they want to. More than 50 per cent beds are available in hospitals. Out of the total 14,372 beds available for Covid-19 patients, 7,938 are vacant, according to live status on Delhi Corona app,” he added. Asked if there can be another lockdown amid a spurt in coronavirus cases, the Health Minister ruled out the possibility. “The time for enforcing a lockdown has ended. We have gained enough experience through the lockdown and know that wearing masks is an effective way to fight the infection. We are creating awareness to wear masks,” he said. Jain said the national capital has ramped up testing, which is why an increase in cases is being observed and stressed that it will help in containing and isolating cases of the infection. On Saturday, over 60,000 Covid-19 tests were conducted. “If you test positive without symptoms, we will be able to isolate you in time and prevent the infection from spreading. The number might be increasing at this point but this will help in containing the virus,” he added. Sharing numbers, he said the positivity rate in the national capital is 7.19 per cent while the death rate in the last 10 days has been 0.68 per cent, “which is a good sign”. The overall death rate is 2.23 per cent, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-directs-33-pvt-hospitals-to-reserve-80-of-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-hlzSz4eBQwdufbXVjDOmYL.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||2 more doctors get Covid, Mohali Civil Hospital staff strength down by 50%||Two more doctors of the Civil Hospital in Phase-6 tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the total count of infected staff to 20. As it has 40 employees on its rolls, the hospital, a designated Covid-19 centre, is now running with just 50% employees.Only one doctor is managing 100 patients, it has been learnt.The hospital’s list of doctors infected in the past one week include Dr Sandeep Singh, Dr Shivani Chuchra, Dr Meena, who has resigned, Dr Megha Makkar and Dr Charan Kamal. All of them were on Covid-19 duty for sampling, treatment and shifting of patients. With this, staff is struggling to cope in a hospital that has 400 persons visiting every day for Covid-19 tests in addition to over a 1,000 persons seeking treatment for other ailments.Bolstering staff strength looks unlikely at the moment as just one of seven new doctors appointed last month has joined work.Dr Areet Kaur, senior medical officer of the hospital, said though things were not comfortable, “we are managing. We will be asking field staff to join the hospital. As far as seven new doctors are concerned, only one has joined. We have the authority to hire staff and we have done it,” she said.Staff struggling to cope “There is only one doctor per shift to attend to more than a 100 patients. It’s easier to handle the rush in the morning, given that a number of students are interning with us, but a lone doctor has to handle 50-odd patients at night,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity.Though a 200-bed hospital requires at least 10 nursing sisters (head nurses), this hospital has been making do with just one since its primary health centre days before it was upgraded to a hospital.The lone nurse has to take care of her duties and oversee the work of safai karamcharis as well. “Only one nurse has remained, it’s just that the beds have increased from 20 to 200,” said the doctor.Also, though the hospital has 27 authorised posts of Class IV employees, it has only 15 with one away on deputation. “Sometimes we have to ask for help from a gardener or a safai sewak to do a patient’s dressing during an emergency,” said a staff member requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-more-doctors-get-covid-mohali-civil-hospital-staff-strength-down-by-50/story-P5O9wJYfTqDMoUXi4VgvAP.html
13-09-2020||Bhopal||MP farmer arrested for causing brother’s death, hiding corpse||A farmer was arrested in Bhopal district of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday night for causing his brother’s death by electrocution earlier this month and hiding the corpse. The man died after coming in contact with an illegal electric fence laid by the accused to save his crop from stray pigs, said police. The accused, Pooran Silawat, 48, a resident of Raipur village of Bhopal district, surrendered at Eintkhedi police station on Saturday. An FIR has been registered under section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Pooran and three others. Sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP), Bairasiya, Bhopal, Manak Mani Kumawat said, “Ganesh Silawat, 50, went missing on September 2 from the field where he was last seen. His brother Suresh lodged a missing person’s report with Eintkhedi police station. On September 9, Suresh informed the police that his other brother Pooran had also gone missing.” “While police were trying to locate Ganesh, Pooran surrendered at Eintkhedi police station. He told the police that he was farming on a piece of government land in his village Raipur where he laid the electric fence to protect the crop from pigs. His brother Ganesh didn’t know about the fence, came in contact with the live wire and was electrocuted on September 2,” said Kumawat. “The accused said when he saw his brother’s body in the field, he got scared of possible police action. So he tied the corpse to a heavy stone and flung it in a river near the village,” said the SDOP. He was helped by three of his friends in doing so, said the police.However, his guilt forced him to surrender. Police have fished out Ganesh’s body from the river and sent it for a post-mortem examination. Pooran’s accomplices are yet to be arrested, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-farmer-arrested-for-causing-brother-s-death-hiding-corpse/story-lNyItbnR1MexfmkLKGU24O.html
13-09-2020||Kolkata||Crisis-hit tourism industry pins hope on festive season||The tourism sector, crippled by the Covid-19 pandemic, hopes to see some businesses in the upcoming Durga puja and Diwali seasons with queries from interested travellers coming in, officials of the industry bodies said on Sunday.In the domestic and short-haul segments, people are showing interest, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) eastern region head Anil Punjabi said. “There is interest and queries are coming in about destinations and safety measures, but these are yet to be translated into bookings,” he said, adding that people have changed their priorities amid the Covid-19 crisis. “There will be businesses in the Durga Puja and Diwali seasons with interest growing among people, though it is likely to be much less than what it used to be in the previous years,” Punjabi told PTI.With people starting to learn to live with the pandemic, at least some of them are likely to start travelling with requisite safety measures, he said. The TAFI eastern region head said the tour operators are providing people with all kind of information regarding tourists’ destinations and the safety of the places.A lot depends on how the Covid-19 situation emerges in the next few days as people would not want any cancellation. “Bengal is a value-for-money destination and is safe also,” he said, expressing hope that domestic tourists would travel during the holiday season.The reopening of Darjeeling hills to outsiders has led to tourists making queries about bookings in different destinations there for the Puja season, according to Raj Basu, convenor of the Association for Conservation of Tourism.“Many destinations in Darjeeling hills and Dooars forest in North Bengal are in village areas, which have around 70 per cent share of tourist footfalls,” Basu told PTI.Since these places are spread across villages and are not like hotels or resorts in urban centres, operators of tourism clusters are being informed about safe practices.“Each cluster comprises around 12 to 15 villages. At the meetings in each cluster, sensitisation is being done so that the tourists, the operators as also the villagers stay safe while livelihood is also earned,” Basu said. He said safe practices and how to deal with any kind of emergency situation are being described through workshops to the village tourism operators in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Dooars areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/crisis-hit-tourism-industry-pins-hope-on-festive-season/story-vK4XIkfmtFWWPNGeYYjSMM.html

13-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 hospitals allowed to increase bed capacity: Jain||All dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hospitals in the national capital have been allowed to increase their bed capacity by up to 30% and 33 major private hospitals have been asked to reserve 80% of their intensive care unit (ICU) beds for patients suffering from the viral infection, said Satyendar Jain, Delhi’s minister for health and family welfare, during a press conference on Sunday. The move comes at a time when Delhi is seeing a record surge in Covid-19 cases. On Friday, 4,321 new Covid-19 cases were reported --- the highest single-day spike in the national capital to date.Jain attributed the spike in Covid-19 cases to aggressive testing mechanisms undertaken by his government. He also said the uptick in Covid-19 cases is because of unlocking restrictions in a bid to revive the economy. “It is very much on the expected lines. This surge in Covid-19 cases will stabilise within 10-15 days,” he said. Jain ruled out further lockdown restrictions in Delhi. He said lockdown is no longer a solution to Covid-19 and the public should wear masks. Also read: Venkaiah Naidu undergoes Covid-19 test ahead of monsoon session Jain said around though 50% Covid-19 beds in the city are lying vacant, the availability of ICU beds in a few major private hospitals is scarce as most patients are preferring private healthcare facilities to government-run ones. “I held a meeting through a video conference with all private hospitals on Saturday. They have agreed to our plan. Orders have been issued to allow all Covid-19 hospitals in the city to increase their bed capacity by 30%, if required. While 33 major private hospitals have been asked to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. If some of these ICU beds are occupied, then the figure must be updated in a common pool after Covid-19 patients are discharged,” Jain said. The minister explained that if a Covid-19 hospital has 100 beds, it would be allowed to increase its capacity to 130 beds, according to the latest orders. At present, Delhi has 14,372 hospital beds, of which 7,924 are lying vacant. Of these, 489 ICU beds with ventilators and 277 ICU beds without ventilators are unoccupied.The Delhi government’s decision came after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 9 had asked officials to draft a plan to increase Covid-19 bed capacity in Delhi, especially ICU beds.The situation is worse in multi-speciality private hospitals in the national capital. Over 89% of ICU beds with ventilators in 11 private hospitals were occupied until Friday. While 82% of ICU beds without ventilators in eight private hospitals were also filled on that day.Delhi recorded the highest-ever total hospitalisation due to the contagion in a single day on Friday after 6,294 people were admitted. The previous record was 6,264, which had occurred during the Covid-19 surge in Delhi in June-July.“Wearing masks reduces the chances of spreading and contracting Covid-19 significantly. The public should wear masks. The government is also running an intensive awareness campaign on the importance of masks. Everyone should wear mask and follow strict social distancing norms. We have moved far away from the times of lockdown. That (lockdown) is not going to happen again,” he added. Over 60,000 Covid-19 tests were conducted in the city for the second consecutive day on Friday. Hospitals and mohalla clinics are also testing asymptomatic people. However, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) count continued to remain low, as compared to the less accurate rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests. Data showed 9,182 swab samples — 15% of all the tests — were conducted using the RT-PCR method, according to Saturday’s health bulletin. Jain said the results of the third serological survey, which was conducted in Delhi between September 1 and 5, would be announced in a few more days as the study of the samples is still in progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-hospitals-allowed-to-increase-bed-capacity/story-hfrijn0xBMpg2LvPI9mBVP.html
13-09-2020||City||BJP worker’s body found hanging from tree in Bengal’s Hooghly district||Tension prevailed in Goghat town in West Bengal’s Hooghly district on Sunday morning after the body of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker was found hanging from a tree near the local railway station. Relatives of Ganesh Roy, the deceased, alleged that he was murdered by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers. “Roy was our active worker and he was murdered. If he had died by suicide, the body should have been hanging. Roy’s feet were touching the ground,” alleged Biman Ghosh, BJP’s Arambagh organisation district unit president. Talking on the condition of anonymity, an officer from Goghat police station said police personnel were stopped from taking the body to the morgue for autopsy. “A crowd created disturbance and blocked the Kamarpukur-Kolkata highway. We had to chase them away,” the officer said.The body was later taken to Burdwan Medical College for postmortem. Additional police force was deployed at Goghat.“Killing our workers, leaders and hanging their bodies has become a routine in Bengal. Our legislator from Hemtabad was killed in a similar manner,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. He met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to complain about law and order situation in the state. Reacting to the BJP’s allegation, urban development minister Firhad Hakim said, “BJP is doing politics with every death that takes place. Whenever there is an unnatural death, they charge the TMC with murder.”Meanwhile, the criminal investigation department (CID) of the West Bengal Police on Saturday submitted charge sheet in the mysterious death of Debendranath Roy, the BJP legislator from Hemtabad in north Bengal. Roy’s body was found hanging outside a shop on July 13. The CID has charged two acquaintances of Roy with criminal conspiracy, cheating and abetment to suicide. The accused were arrested after Roy’s death. “We had said Roy was murdered and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). We will move the Supreme Court with our demand,” Ghosh said in Kolkata while talking about the Goghat incident. In August, the Calcutta high court turned down the BJP’s petition for CBI probe into the MLA’s death. Subsequently, a Kolkata resident filed a petition in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-worker-s-body-found-hanging-from-tree-in-bengal-s-hooghly-district-kin-blame-tmc/story-Daep1kj4lDkWxzt0ufeWiJ.html

The incident took place at Khanda village under Naxal-hit Bandgaon police station in West Singhbhum district, police said.The incident took place on September 4, however, the matter came to the fore only after family members of the deceased youth, identified as Nungu Barjo, informed the police on Thursday.Police said they were investigating all angles, including a failed love affair, after exhuming Nungo’s body from his grave in forests near Khanda village on Friday.“We exhumed the body of Nungu Barjo from the grave inside the jungles near Khanda village in the presence of a magistrate. The villagers had buried him instead of informing the police. They had, however, informed his family about the incident, who later informed the police on Thursday. Khanda village being in the remote and deeply forested Naxal-hit area, and the legal obligation of exhuming the body from the grave, led to the delay in police action,” Nathu Singh Meena, Porahat sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), said.Meena said a preliminary investigation has revealed a love angle. “The deceased had a love affair with a girl from Khanda village and the couple’s families had even discussed their marriage about a year ago. We have, however, not yet found any instance of human trafficking in the village or adjacent areas. We are interrogating the villagers in Khanda and other nearby villages and further investigation is on,” said Meena.Some locals allege that Nungu had gone to Khanda village on September 4 and was allegedly trying to lure some village girls with job offers. This information somehow reached PLFI extremists, who shot Nungu. The ultras returned to the forests after the killing, while fearful villagers buried the body.Man held in Chaibasa for trafficking minorA man was arrested from Gandhi Maidan in Chaibasa on charges of trafficking a minor girl, who was being taken to Tamil Nadu along with 50 other girls and boys on the pretext of providing them jobs at one Loyal Textiles Mills Ltd, Tamil Nadu police said on Saturday.The man, identified as Jawahar Das (38), was arrested following a tip-off on Friday and in coordination with the district child welfare committee (CWC).“Chaibasa-based agent Jawahar Das was arrested and sent to jail on Friday, while a case was lodged against three accused, including Das, at anti-human trafficking unit police station under Sections 370(1), 370(4), 34 of the IPC and 14 (1A) of Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016.

13-09-2020||Mumbai||After overnight moderate showers, Mumbai likely to see more rains today||Mumbai and its suburbs received moderate showers with intense spells recorded in isolated areas between Saturday night and Sunday morning.Overnight showers made it the strongest spell of rainfall in September. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted a revival of active monsoon conditions over Mumbai over the weekend. Between 8.30 am on Saturday and 8.30 am on Sunday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of Mumbai and its suburbs, recorded 25.7 millimetres (mm) of rain and 16.4 mm was recorded at Colaba, which covers south Mumbai. Intense rainfall was recorded between 12.30 am and 5.30 am Sunday. Neighbouring Thane district recorded 22.8 mm of rain.Over 24 hours, a location-wise distribution showed many areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) recorded between 20 mm and 40 mm of rainfall. The highest rainfall was recorded in parts of the western and eastern suburbs. The area around the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport recorded 55 mm of rainfall, while Chembur and Navi Mumbai received 47.2 mm and 41.2 mm, respectively.The IMD said light to moderate rain with the possibility of occasional intense spells would continue on Sunday. “Factors such as the formation of a low-pressure weather system of west-central Bay of Bengal off the coast of Andhra Pradesh, an upper air cyclonic circulation over Maharashtra coast and associated systems such as an offshore trough from north Maharashtra to Kerala have allowed the revival of active monsoon conditions for Konkan and interior Maharashtra. Moderate to heavy rain is likely to continue for the next 24 hours,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.Over the past 24 hours, the highest rain was recorded in Ratnagiri at 40 mm, followed by Vengurla in Sindhudurg (30.4 mm), Matheran (28.4 mm), and Mahabaleshwar (26.2 mm).Maharashtra has recorded 13% excess rainfall between June 1 and September 13.South Mumbai and suburban Mumbai received 59% and 57% of excess rainfall, respectively. The rainfall received by suburban Mumbai is the highest for any district along the Konkan coast during this monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-overnight-moderate-rain-mumbai-likely-to-see-downpour-on-sunday/story-JJB9F7XPOAd1j02O8mrCgO.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||1993 Mumbai blasts: HC refuses emergency parole to four convicts||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has refused to grant emergency parole to four convicts in the March 1993 serial bombings in Mumbai.The four convicts, Sardar Shahwali Khan, Mohammed Moin Faridulla Qureshi, Niyaz Ahmed and Shaikh Ali Shaikh Umer, are serving life term at Harsool central prison at Aurangabad. They had moved the court after their applications for emergency parole, following a May 8 notification by the state for decongesting prisons in view of Covid-19 pandemic, were rejected by jail authorities on July 7 on the ground that they were convicted under provisions of a special statute -- the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) (TADA) Act -- and therefore, were not entitled to the benefit.The bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar upheld the decision and held that the TADA convicts were not entitled to emergency parole. The bench said the notification states that those convicted for serious economic offences or bank scams or for offences under special Acts etc. were not entitled to emergency parole, and that these categories also included convicts under the TADA Act.Two hundred and fifty seven people died and about 1,400 others were injured when a series of 13 high-intensity bombs exploded in Mumbai on March 12, 1993. Sardar Shahwali Khan, a civil contractor and aide of prime accused Tiger Memon, was convicted for conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1993-mumbai-blasts-hc-refuses-emergency-parole-to-four-convicts/story-5lpqci6sEAxPWXaPG96D6M.html
13-09-2020||City||Chhattisgarh anganwadis keep doors open; turnout yet to pick up||Leela Sahu, an aganwadi worker in one of the six anganwadi centres of Birkoni village in Mahsamund district of Chhattisgarh, reaches the centre at around 8.30 am and starts cleaning the premises with phenyl and sanitises the rooms. Waiting for children to come to the centre, she starts preparing food for them. But the turnout is very low. Out of 63 kids enrolled at this centre, only six who are severely malnourished come and are served a hot meal. For the rest, the centre sends Take Home Ration (THR) every week. While the Chhattisgarh government is the first state that decided to operate the anganwadi centres from September 7, which were shut mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is not like earlier days. Parents are living in fear. I go door-to-door, convincing them to send their kids to the anganwadi but most of them are reluctant,” said Sahu, who was busy in the kitchen of the two-room centre. She said that Birkoni, with a population of around 5,000, has five aganwadi centres. Of them, three are closed because they fall in containment zones and local opposed their reopening. “My anganwadi centre caters to 38 kids between six months and three years of age, 25 kids between three and six years of age, 12 pregnant women and 16 lactating women. Many of them are not coming but we are sending THR to them,” said Sahu. “Apart from the six malnourished kids, four lactating women, who are anaemic, come to the centre. We are advising them to come here for better nutrition. The anganwadi centres were earlier opened from 9 am to 3 pm for physical and education activities of kids and now we only open for providing hot, cooked meal,” said Aprana Shrivastava , supervisor of women and child department for Birkoni village. Mahasamund Project of Women and Child Development Jyoti Chatur says things are not easy. “During the lockdown, we were providing THR to kids and mothers but for better nutrition, we have to provide hot, cooked meal hence the government started operating the anganwadi. Some people are not willing to send their kids but our workers and employees are trying hard. Only some sarpanchs have cooperated with us thus far,” Chatur said, adding that all the guidelines for the opening of angwanwadi centres are duly followed. In Chhattisgarh, there are 51,455 anganwadi centres and the National Health and Family Welfare Phase 4 survey put the malnutrition level in the state at 37%, said a senior government official. “The anganwadis were closed since March 14 and workers had been delivering dry ration to beneficiaries’ homes. Even international agencies like WHO and UNICEF believe Covid-19 might result in rise in malnourishment and have suggested that effective steps be taken to check it. Keeping that in mind, we have opened the centres for a limited period every day to provide freshly-cooked food to children and pregnant women. Besides, immunisation of children and health check-up of pregnant women can also be done,” the official added.However, the centres don’t still have thermal screening facility. “Thermal screening equipment has not been given to us till now . As far as personal hygiene and physical distancing is concerned, we are taking care and continuous monitoring is going on,” said Chatur. Nandini Dhurv (24), a lactating women and resident of Birkoni village, believes that the opening of centre is helpful for people like her. “ I come here for hot, cooked food every day,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhattisgarh-anganwadis-keep-doors-open-turnout-yet-to-pick-up/story-d1vmXjwXUAm9O7PTFlyE7L.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers protest in Haryana and Punjab: What has happened so far||Farmers in Haryana and Punjab have been protesting against three ordinances passed by the Centre. The protests began on Thursday when the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) staged a rally and blocked National Highway 44 near Kurukshetra. The farmers were charged by the Haryana Police for not following Covid-19 prohibitory orders and damage of property. Farmers expressed their outrage over the passage of these ordinances by the Centre which they called “anti-farmer”. They believe that the ordinances will lead to destruction of the peasants and will expose them to the whims of the market forces, said BKU leader Gurnam Singh, as quoted by news agency PTI.What are the three ordinances that have been passed by the Centre?The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 are the three ordinances that the Centre had passed during the lockdown period.Haryana farmers protest against three agriculture ordinancesThe farmers are more concerned with the first one - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020. The ordinance seeks to “provide for barrier-free trade of farmers’ produce outside the markets notified under the various state agricultural produce market laws (state APMC Acts). The Ordinance will prevail over state APMC Acts.”Farmers fear that this ordinance will end the Mandi system of selling of agricultural products and will lead to sale of their products below the Minimum Support Price or the MSP.SAD appeals to Centre not to enact laws on farm ordinances till redressal of farmers’ fearsThe ordinance states that farmers are allowed to trade products outside, “ the physical premises of market yards run by market committees formed under the state APMC Acts” and such trade “can be conducted in any place of production, collection, and aggregation of farmers’ produce including: (i) farm gates, (ii) factory premises, (iii) warehouses, (iv) silos, and (v) cold storages.”Congress supports farmers in their demandsAccording to PTI, former Haryana chief minister and Congress leader Bhupender Singh Hooda said in a statement, “These ordinances are against the interests of farmers. If the government wants to implement them, then it should ensure that no purchases are made below MSP.”Three-member panel meets Haryana farmers to hear grievancesBJP’s Haryana unit chief Om Prakash Dhankar, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and Hisar MP Brijendra Singh met the farmers on Saturday and claimed that farmers were being misled about the ordinances. They also said that the Centre aims to bring structural reforms and allow the farmers better access to a larger market. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday while addressing a virtual press conference said that they will support the farmers’ demands. He said that the ordinances passed by the government will adversely affect the farmers as well as the foodgrain procurement processes. He also highlighted that the ordinances will disrupt “the agrarian foundation that has been laid carefully in the past 50 years.”The central government seeks to bring this ordinances in order to bring structural reforms to the agricultural sector.Farmers still feel that MPs should raise these issues in the Parliament’s monsoon session beginning Monday and clear any confusion regarding these ordinances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-protest-in-haryana-and-punjab-all-you-need-to-know/story-PU4HE2qXkvFViaNeDCTpeN.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Rise in Mumbai cases prompts rethink, BMC mulls roping in more private hospitals||With Mumbai seeing a steady spike in the number of Covid-19 cases reported in the past two week, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to examine if de-listed private hospitals need to restart taking in Covid-19 patients. The decision will be taken in a meeting of civic health official s in BMC on Monday afternoon. Also read: AstraZeneca resumes trial, China develops nasal sprayMid-May, when Mumbai witnessed a similar spike, the Maharashtra government had decided to reserve 80% of beds in private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. However, with Mumbai’s covid curve showing an improvement by the end of the month, over 70 such private hospitals and nursing homes were delisted. For the past two weeks, however, Mumbai has seen a steady spike in daily cases, with Thursday recording 2,371 new cases, the highest single-day spike in Mumbai so far, and a significant number of days recording over 2,000 fresh cases. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the civic body’s public health department, said, “In a meeting on Monday afternoon, we will take a call on whether we need to activate some private hospitals to increase bed capacity.”According to the civic body, the current bed capacity is sufficient to cater to patients, even with the high number of cases thrown up each day. As of Saturday, Mumbai has 37% of its 16,063 total beds vacant, which include hospital beds, beds in jumbo facilities and in quarantine centres for asymptomatic patients. While 19% of its 6,879 beds available for symptomatic patients are vacant, 5% of the 1,417 ICU (intensive care unit) beds are vacant, and 36% of the 7,852 oxygen beds are vacant. Kakani said, “The maximum number of cases coming up now are asymptomatic, and continue to come from high-rise buildings in the suburbs of Mumbai. Since BMC has allowed home quarantine for asymptomatic patients if they have a separate room and an attached toilet, people are opting to stay at home. This is why, so far we have not seen a shortage of beds even though cases are rising. Many private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients have vacant beds, and even Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals have 25% less occupancy as compared to earlier.” From Monday, BMC will begin strict enforcement of reduced fine for not wearing a mask, that has been brought down to Rs 200 from Rs 1,000. The rise in Covid-19 cases is partially attributed to people not following Covid discipline, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, according to BMC officials. Kakani said, “The trend in new cases after the spike continues to show more cases are coming from high-rises. But we noticed even those are among domestic helpers and drivers working for families living in high rises. The occupants are taking care.

13-09-2020||Kolkata||In 2021 polls, TMC prepares to regain its lost ground in ‘Jangalmahal’||The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, which appears to have lost ground in ‘Jangalmahal’ in the western parts of the state, is eyeing to regain it in the coming assembly elections slated to be held in the middle of next year.The TMC is preparing a three-pronged attack in a bid to take on the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has made deep inroads into the tribal-dominated areas over the past few years and also swept all four seats there in last year’s parliamentary polls.TMC chief and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is banking on her development card, has introduced a raft of organisational changes to bring young and honest faces in the ruling party. There are also reports of alleged Maoist activities in ‘Jangalmahal’, once a Communist Party of India (Maoist) stronghold, after a gap of almost a decade.The counter-insurgency force (CIF) is being reactivated to nip Maoist activities, if any.However, Banerjee has claimed that the news of alleged Maoist activities was fake and that the truth would be uncovered soon. The TMC announced a structural overhaul in Bankura and Purulia districts last week.“The party is calling it the ‘great purge’. Local leaders and workers, who received poor feedback from the grassroots, have been removed from key roles. Instead, new and honest faces have been promoted,” said an I-PAC functionary, the company owned by election strategist Prashant Kishor, who has been roped in by Banerjee for her bid to win the next year’s assembly polls.Earlier in July, the TMC had inducted Chhatradhar Mahato and appointed him as a secretary of the state unit. Mahato used to be the poster boy of the Maoist-backed tribal movement at Lalgarh in ‘Jangalmahal’. Political analysts said that Mahato’s induction was an attempt to use his image by the TMC to curtail the BJP’s influence in the tribal-dominated belt.“People didn’t vote for the BJP in Jangalmahal on the basis of the party’s ideology. They just voted against a section of the grassroots TMC workers as they were peeved with their corruption and high-handedness,” Mahato recently told media persons.The BJP’s influence in ‘Jangalmahal’ started growing since 2014. The TMC suffered a blow in the area in the 2018 panchayat elections. In Jhargram district, of the 780 gram panchayats, where elections were held, 373 and 329 seats were won by the TMC and the BJP, respectively. Similarly, in Purulia district, of the 1,921 seats, where voting was held, the TMC and the BJP won 754 and 528 gram panchayat seats, respectively. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP gave the ruling TMC another jolt after it won all the seats that fall under ‘Jangalmahal’ (Purulia, Midnapore, Bishnupur and Jhargram).‘Jangalmahal’ has been one of the focus areas of Banerjee since the TMC came to power in 2011. The party can also hope to play the development card to counter the BJP’s growing influence.“The region has seen a sea change since Banerjee came to power as far as development is concerned. The government can speak of significant achievement in almost every sector whether it is education, health, tourism and infrastructure,” said Shantiram Mahato, minister for pashimanchal unnyan affairs department. Over the past few weeks, posters allegedly written by Maoists have resurfaced in ‘Jangalmahal’, prompting Virendra, director-general of police (DGP), West Bengal, to rush to the area in August to take stock of the security measures. Banerjee has sought a report on the ground reality and has also asked the police’s stop brass to reactivate the CIF, which was formed in 2010 to tackle the Maoist insurgency in ‘Jangamahal’.“It appears that Maoists are trying to regroup and have also held some meetings, including one attended by a TMC state committee leader. The TMC government has failed as most of the people in ‘Jangalamahal’ still live below the poverty line. It will be difficult for the ruling party to regain its lost ground,” said Amal Mukherjee, a political commentator and a former principal of Presidency College, which has since been upgraded to a state university, in Kolkata. The organisational changes came after the TMC’s survey and feedback from the people through the Didi ke Bolo campaign hinted at ominous signs that the public were unhappy with the local leaders and workers.“If the TMC thinks that it can regain its lost ground then it is living in a fool’s paradise. The party’s efforts to create trouble in Jangalmahal by reactivating the Maoists will boomerang. It will expose them further,” said Rahul Sinha, national secretary, BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/in-2021-polls-tmc-prepares-to-regain-its-lost-ground-in-jangalmahal/story-DIKvKGGln9hsklRFEDomxI.html

13-09-2020||Kolkata||‘Political conspiracy’: Bengal Congress hits streets to defend ‘victim’ Rhea Chakraborty||The Congress party in West Bengal took out a rally in Kolkata on Saturday in support of Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty and to protest against the alleged victimization of the actor in the drugs-related case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. A few hundred party workers took part in the rally that was brought out from the West Bengal pradesh Congress committee’s headquarters in central Kolkata. Similar rallies were taken out by the party in West Midnapore and West Burdwan districts. The activists shouted slogans opposing the alleged ‘vilification campaign’ against the ‘daughter of Bengal’ in the name of investigation, and held placards that read “we will not stop till she gets justice”. This comes three days after Congress Lok Sabha leader and West Bengal party unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury termed Chakraborty as a “Bengalee Brahmin”. Also Read: Rhea Chakraborty has revealed names of 15 Bollywood celebrities involved in drug use“Political conspiracy and vindictive behaviour against Rhea Chakraborty, the daughter of Bengal, will not be tolerated,” the West Bengal Congress tweeted a few hours ago. On Wednesday, Chowdhury had said Rajput was an Indian actor, but the “BJP turned him into a Bihari actor” only to score electoral brownie points. The BJP has lashed out at the Congress.

Whatever the investigating agencies do, ultimately the matter would reach the court,” said Rahul Sinha, national general secretary of BJP. “She was victimised even before she was proven guilty in court. The vilification campaign once again proves the sheer hatred of the BJP towards the Bengalis,” Saugata Roy, TMC lawmaker had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/political-conspiracy-bengal-congress-hits-streets-to-defend-victim-rhea-chakraborty/story-Vlpe1sC66QCONr1qNb78dN.html

The man was also booked for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old boy on the same day. The SIT recovered Akhlaq Salmani’s hand from the railway track near Kishanpura locality of Panipat city where the man was allegedly attacked by a few residents on August 23. Panipat deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Satish Kumar Vats, who is heading the SIT, said, “We have found crucial evidence in the case. Akhlaq’s hand and some blood samples have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination and matching DNA”.“We have also issued notice to Akhlaq to join the investigation as he was also accused of sodomising an 11-year- old boy on the same night,” the DSP said. The first FIR was registered on September 7 after a resident of Kishanpura locality accused Akhlaq of kidnapping and sodomising his son.The complainant said when the local residents found the minor with Akhlaq, they beat him up and forced him to disclose his identity. Subsequently, Akhlaq managed to flee the scene and enter the railway track. Police say there is a possibility that his hand was chopped off by a train as the government railway police spotted him on the railway track the next morning. As per the zero FIR filed by the GRP, Akhlaq accused the area residents of beating him up and chopping his right hand with a sawing machine. Akhlaq said he was dumped on the railway track by his assailants. His brother, Ikram, However, told the local media that Akhlaq’s hand was chopped off after the assailants spotted the number 786 tattooed on his right arm. The number has a holy context in Islamic scriptures. Police say the man who accused Akhlaq of sodomising his son has a sawing machine at his house but there is no evidence to prove that the machine was used to cut his hand. “We have issued a notice to the boy’s father to join the investigation, too” said the DSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-man-s-hand-chopped-panipat-sit-starts-investigation/story-10KlWdS7LYEzJxzEIwCj9H.html

But we have briefed the farmers about the benefit of these ordinances. We are taking suggestions from farmers and will discuss the same with Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar,” said MP Dharambir.Hisar MP Brijendra Singh said the main objective of bringing these ordinances was to bring structural reforms in agriculture.“There are efforts being made to spread confusion regarding the three ordinances. The reality is that these ordinances will neither abolish the existing Mandi system nor abolish the minimum support price,” he added. BJP state president Om Prakash Dhankhar had formed a committee on September 10 after farmers protesting against the Ordinances at Kurukshetra were canecharged by the police.Kisan Sabha opposes OrdinancesThe five-member delegation of All India Kisan Sabha that met the three MPs demanded the withdrawal of these three ordinances. Inderjit Singh, vice-president of the delegation, said these ordinances are against farmers and the MPs should raise this issue in the Parliament.“The Haryana government should pass a resolution to withdraw these ordinances, otherwise farmers will be destroyed. We have submitted our grievances in the written to the three members MPs committee,” he added. Another farm leader Preet Singh of Kisan Sabha said they don’t think the three-member panel will be able to help revoke these ordinances. “The committee formed by Dhankar is an eyewash. The BJP government has become arrogant and we are surprised how a state president of the ruling party can form a such committee,” he added. Govt trying mislead farmers: ChaduniBhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who is leading the farmers’ protest against three ordinances, has termed the three-member panel as an attempt to weaken the agitation. He said the Union government has already proposed to pass these ordinances in the coming session of the Parliament beginning from September 14. Chaduni urged the farmers “not to get misled by such panels” and said that agitation is the only way to force the government to withdraw these ordinances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-member-panel-meets-haryana-farmers-to-hear-grievances/story-HiwMiEd27n54lrQ168L4hM.html

A team from the education department along with experts videographed the proceedings. Teachers and students were allowed to enter the school, following thermal screening and sanitisation of their hands.Principal Dharampal Singh said the school was reopened as per the guidelines of the government and only 15 students, all of whom were wearing face masks, were seated in a classroom.

When contacted by HT, Riberio, who was also the director general of Punjab Police in mid-1980s, confirmed he had written to Shrivastava. “ Yes. I wrote to them. I have written about my opinion of police’s investigation in my column too (in an English daily published in Punjab).”Responding to the email sent by Riberio, a Delhi Police statement said, “Since the officer in whose name the email has been received has not been in touch with Delhi Police in the recent times and especially in the past six months, we are trying to ascertain the veracity and the genuineness of the mail.”Delhi Police have been widely criticised for their investigation of the riot case as they arrested student leaders, activists, local politicians who were prominent voices of the anti-CAA protests on the grounds that the riots were planned at the site of the protests. This has been denied by the arrested persons, who have accused Delhi Police of arresting anti-government voices in the name of investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ensure-north-east-delhi-riots-probe-was-impartial-ex-mumbai-top-cop-tells-delhi-police-chief/story-HrzGGNJJ2KwwTBLUyx6GFL.html

13-09-2020||Mumbai||Thane civic body to maintain roads, flyovers from next year: Minister Eknath Shinde||In an order passed by cabinet minister of Urban Development and Public Works, Eknath Shinde, all roads and flyovers within the limits of Thane Municipal Corporation will have to be maintained by the civic body from next year.The funds for some roads/ flyovers that come under MMRDA, MSRDC, PWD and MIDC will be provided by these planning authorities, but the maintenance, henceforth, will be carried out by the Thane Civic body. Earlier, every agency maintained the roads and flyovers they constructed but this required a lot of coordination.Moreover, most major roads including highways and bypass roads developed craters leading to traffic congestion in the city. There was a long standing demand from the TMC to take up the maintenance of roads in the city.A special online meeting was held by Shinde with all concerned departments on Saturday. “Many of the prominent roads and flyovers within Thane civic body have potholes due to the ongoing monsoon. Most of these are under the jurisdiction of other authorities apart from TMC but the maintenance was not done efficiently,” Shinde said.“Firstly, each one has to ensure that the pending repair work was completed at the earliest. From next year onwards, they will transfer all the funds to TMC, which will be solely responsible to carry out the maintenance,” said Shinde. All departments have been asked to allot funds for the repair work and submit them to the Thane civic body by April next year onwards.Meanwhile, TMC has to begin the repair and maintenance from January onwards and submit the work completed report by May, well before the monsoons begin.  The prominent roads and flyovers within Thane which are currently not under the civic body are Teen Haath Naka flyover, Cadbury Junction flyover, Kapurbawdi flyover, Bhiwandi bypass, Mumbra bypass and flyovers along Ghodbunder Road. These will now be maintained by the Thane civic body.“TMC is often criticised for not maintaining these prominent roads whereas they aren’t under TMC jurisdiction,” added Shinde. Ravindra Khadtale, city engineer, TMC, said, “The potholes that would resurface on these prominent roads and flyovers would be blamed on the TMC despite not being the authority responsible for this. Hence, we are glad that we can manage these roads and flyovers now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-to-maintain-roads-flyovers-from-next-year-minister-eknath-shinde/story-9jFzHP1DWOmK9J8sHzxe4J.html

However, now the civic body chief has asked to seal all the zones again. Our team has sealed some of the zones on Saturday,” said Bhagaji Bhangare, ward officer, KDMC.On Friday, the KDMC recorded 623 Covid cases, taking the total number of positive cases to 37,696. The city also recorded two deaths, taking the death toll to 709 as per the state government records.In July, the average new cases recorded in KDMC limits were around 200-300.“The sealing of borders of the containment zones and hotspots will be strictly followed now as the numbers are rising. There is a need to control the movement of the public in such zones,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/boundaries-of-containment-zones-in-kalyan-dombivli-sealed-again/story-VzD1bOtj7yhopnD1sTY8aP.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Scarcity of oxygen cylinders in Badlapur put families in quandary||Between 20 and 30 patients admitted after testing positive for Covid-19 in Badlapur have been forced to run helter and skelter due to scarcity of oxygen-equipped beds in the town on Saturday.Patients were also asked to get their own oxygen cylinders or shift to hospitals.Amol Parab, 32, Badlapur east resident, admitted his father in a city-based private hospital seven days ago with complaints of breathlessness. He was suddenly asked to shift from the hospital on Saturday early morning as there was no oxygen cylinder left.Parab said, “My 72-year-old father has been admitted in the hospital seven days back, and on Saturday I received a call around 7 am from a doctor to shift him immediately. They informed that the hospital did not have oxygen cylinders. I tried to shift him to another hospital but no beds were available. I looked for cylinder in nine different places including government hospital suppliers but no one had any in stock. Finally, a Ulhasnagar-based cylinder dealer gave me one for Rs 500 with Rs 10,000 as deposit.”In another case, a patient was admitted on Friday evening and on Saturday morning, family received a call to immediately shift the patient.Alok Vichare, 33, admitted his 63-year-old mother for pneumonia and Covid-19 treatment at a private hospital in Badlapur on Friday evening. She was on oxygen supply. Suddenly, at 7.30 am on Saturday, Vichare got a call to immediately to shift the patient. Vichare said, “We felt so scared at the moment as, at a time, 20 to 30 families were searching for hospitals to shift their patients. I called suppliers in Badlapur but there were no spare cylinder. I went all the way to Thane and bought an oxygen cylinder. “District civil surgeon of Thane, Kishor Pawar, said, “There is an issue of scarcity of oxygen cylinders in Badlapur. After checking the issue, we come to know that the refilling agency has not sent the cylinder because of which the issues occurred. We have spoken to our suppliers from Navi Mumbai and now the issue has been resolved. Soon hospitals will get their cylinder refilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scarcity-of-oxygen-cylinders-in-badlapur-put-families-in-quandary/story-9Hj7OC7V4wWy0wZZDUTZ3J.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan civic body climbs to 3rd rank under Centre’s Amrut Yojana||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has managed to improve its ranking under the Central Government’s Amrut Yojana, bagging the third position in August. In July, the civic body ranked ninth among the 15 cities across Maharashtra in which the scheme is being implemented.One of the major reasons for the improvement in the ranking is due to implementation of several projects under the scheme in KDMC vicinity, claimed the officials.“The ranking is declared every month by the government. From ninth position, we have managed to jump to the third position which is a great achievement. We are working on several projects under the scheme and most of them are being implemented,” said an officer of KDMC, who did not wish to be named.In KDMC, total work worth Rs 484cr is being undertaken under the scheme.Under the scheme the civic body has managed to finish the work on three new parks and in developing green belt at Umbarde, Netivali.The civic body has also completed 65 per cent work of phase 1, 50 per cent work on phase 2 that includes work related to drainage line. The progress of work in water supply and management is seven per cent.The KDMC falls under the category of those 15 cities that have undertaken work under the scheme costing more than Rs 200cr.Under the scheme, the civic body has also taken up the water supply project in 27 villages. Although 18 villages have been separated to form a new municipal body, the work undertaken in the villages under the scheme will continue.  “As there is no direction regarding the projects undertaken in the 18 villages from the government as of now, the work which was taken up will continue,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-civic-body-climbs-to-3rd-rank-under-centre-s-amrut-yojana/story-9Z2U8WEKG0V11hfjREzECO.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan civic body suspends licence of hospital for overcharging patients||In yet another crackdown on hospitals overcharging Covid patients, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) suspended the licence of a hospital here on Friday. The civic body has also suspended the permission to treat the Covid patients in this hospital.As per the KDMC squad that monitors Covid hospitals and addresses the complaints against such hospitals in its vicinity, the hospital has overcharged charged patients for beds and PPE kits among other things.“We have suspended the licence of the hospital till September 30 or till the overcharged money is refunded to the patients and other irregularities are rectified by the hospital,” said an officer of KDMC who did not wish to be named.As per the civic body, the hospital charged Rs 1,980 for PPE kit while it is supposed to just charge Rs 1,000.  After the auditing of bills, the civic body also found that the hospital had overcharged around Rs 6.93 lakh from Covid patients through three different bills.“We have served notice to the hospital before the suspension asking it to explain its side.  However, there was no response from its side,” added the officer.After the suspension, the hospital will not be allowed to admit any new patient but will treat the existing patients. The civic body’s medical officer will be deployed at the hospital to keep a track.Owner of the hospital said, “The hospital staff had informed me about the notice. We will figure it out soon.

13-09-2020||Mumbai||Nightmare for motorists along Kalyan-Shilphata stretch continues||The nightmare for commuters travelling along the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch is far from over as merely 25 per cent of the road widening and concretisation work on this stretch has been completed so far.The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) that took up the work in March has claimed that the designated contractor has finished the work at Shilphata and Kongaon patches of the vital 21km stretch.The MSRDC is working on widening the existing four lanes stretch to six lanes and also concretising it for smooth traffic flow. As per traffic police, on an average around 85,000 vehicles take this stretch on a daily basis.Shashikant Sontakke, chief engineer of MSRDC, said,” The work order for the widening and concretisation was given to the contractor in March and the work started immediately. In last six months, 25 per cent of the work is completed. This includes Kon village and Shilphata stretches. The work is under progress and the estimated duration for its completion is 24 months.”The 21-km-long Kalyan-Shilphata route, which connects Kalyan-Dombivli-Bhiwandi-Thane to Navi Mumbai, is a vital link and sees a major congestion during peak hours.  Presently, the work of one lane concretisation of Desai Creek Bridge to Shilphata, which is 2km and the work at Palava junction and Katai bridge are under way. The work of three lanes from Durgadi–Kongaon- Rajnouli chowk is over while the work of fourth lane is being undertaken. A total of 120 labourers are deployed for the work on this stretch.Poor traffic managementCommuters, though, are glad about the work being undertaken. However, there have been complaints about the ordeal they face due to poor traffic management along the stretch and bad roads.Himanshu Joshi, 27, who travels from Dombivli to Thane for work daily claimed that it takes around 1.45 hours to reach his workplace, and around 2.15 hours  from his office to home, while the actual time to reach workplace is 50 minutes. “The roads are horrible and there is a humongous traffic on the stretch on a daily basis. I have tried travelling at different time spans like leaving Dombivli at 8.30 am, 9 am or 10 am but the scenario is same all the time,” said Joshi.He added: “Those portions that are yet to be concretised are not in good condition. There are potholes.  There are multiple crossings near the Bhiwandi side of the stretch leading to congestion as there is no control on two-wheelers.”Several commuters have also taken to social media, slamming the poor management of traffic on this stretch. Commuters taking this stretch have claimed it to be the worst affected stretch in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).   “I think it is the worst affected stretch in the MMR as there is no way out from the traffic snarls. Even though the work has begun, there is no clear picture on when will it get over and ease the traffic. There are no signals on this stretch,” said Manoj Kurlekar, 38, who takes the Shilphata stretch to reach his workplace in Navi Mumbai from Kalyan.The work of Patripool and Durgadi Bridge is also being carried out. In August, the work of laying girders for the Patripool bridge was taken up,  while the MSRDC officials claimed that the bridge shall be ready by another month.Meanwhile, the work of the Durgadi Bridge, which was in full swing before the lockdown, was affected and is now being undertaken at a slow pace. Right now, 50 per cent of the work of Durgadi Bridge is completed. Short-term remedies Thane traffic police claim that they have provided the immediate short-term measures to the authority for ease of traffic congestion.Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of Thane traffic police, said, “We did a survey with the authority and also gave short-term remedies in writing so that they can be imposed. These include filling the gap between the new concrete portion and the old asphalt portion so that vehicle can move smoothly. The MSRDC has agreed to work on these remedies.”He added: “I have even asked the MSRDC to fill the potholes across this stretch as the completion of the project will take time. At the same time both my Kolsewadi and Mumbra traffic police units are deployed for the management of traffic on this stretch. Due to them, at least the traffic can move.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nightmare-for-motorists-along-kalyan-shilphata-stretch-continues/story-T4oIuTkW34JFRbZedDny9M.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai police keep coronavirus in check||More than 800 police personnel in the Navi Mumbai police commissionerate have tested positive for Covid-19 till date. However, the police department has claimed that the city has less Covid deaths among the cops compared to the neighbouring cities.While 18 police personnel have succumbed to Covid-19 in Thane commissionerate so far, the deaths in Navi Mumbai so far are six. This, the department claimed, was possible due to timely testing, extensive contact tracing and regular health check-ups.Last week, former city police commissioner Sanjay Kumar tested positive for Covid-19, only a day after he handed over his charge to the new police chief Bipin Kumar Singh.In May, Kumar was instrumental in starting institutional quarantine facilities for the city police staff after a city police constable’s wife died of Covid-19. A three-storied apartment under Savli Trust in Nerul was converted into a quarantine facility along with a hall at the police headquarters in Kalamboli.Out of a total of 4,800 police personnel, 818 including 100 officers were tested positive for the virus while six policemen have died till date. As of now, nine persons are in ICU, one person is on ventilator and seven require oxygen among the total 182 persons currently admitted.“When Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) procured rapid antigen kits, we requested 5,000 kits for the police force as they are frontline workers. In a phased manner, we conducted the testing drive across departments during which 137 persons were found positive. They were isolated and it helped prevent and keep the further infections’ count low,” said Shivraj Patil, deputy commissioner, headquarters.Officials said a wellness team comprising police officers and constables helped to combat the virus in an effective manner. The team coordinated with doctors to make the required medicines available on time. The team has travelled from Navi Mumbai to Ghatkopar and Dadar on multiple occasions to get the medicines including Remdesivir for severe Covid-19 patients.After taking over the mantle of the police chief from Kumar, one of the first tasks for Singh was to take stock of the quarantine facilities for policemen.“The reason for the low mortality rate amongst Navi Mumbai police is early testing and a strict contact tracing. We have encouraged everyone to get tested at the earliest at the first sign of flu symptoms. Regularly sanitising the workplace has also helped lower the risk of new infections at police stations,” said Singh, adding that a good diet and meal is provided to policemen at quarantine facilities and also the welfare fund is readily made available when required.Ravindra Daundkar, inspector at the Vashi police, tested positive for the virus in June with his family including two children. It came as a shock to him as Daundkar would rigorously follow safety protocols by not mingling with his family after coming from work. He would keep his uniform aside and wash it separately.“For most of us in the department checking vehicles during lockdown to ensure only people with essential service pass, the risk of exposure to the virus was high. We could only practice caution. But eventually the virus got me despite trying to be careful,” said Daundkar.While the officer and his family recovered within two weeks, he was not prepared for the fatigue that followed after he beat the virus. “It was even difficult to walk. But fortunately, with time and proper dosage of vitamins, I was fit enough to join duty again,” he added.How Navi Mumbai police is tackling virusRegular supply of vitamins along with homeopathic and allopathic medicines is being given to the infected persons at quarantine facilities and to even those under home quarantineHealthy diet and timely health update by wellness teamReadily available critical medicines following regular coordination with doctors in Navi Mumbai and Thane Covid Care facilities for Navi Mumbai police Savli: A three-storied building in Nerul for isolationNivara: Covid care facility at Navi Mumbai police headquarters in KalamboliHospital: Reserved beds at DY Patil Hospital, NerulHELP AT HAND On September 4, the day former commissioner Sanjay Kumar tested positive, traffic police constable Sandesh Gaikwad, 39, diedGaikwad was on a ventilator for several days following intense bouts of coughing.Gaikwad’s colleagues at the Panvel traffic police pooled in money and collected around Rs 70,000, which was donated to his family earlier this week.Help was always available for policemen as Sunil Gurav, sub-inspector at Panvel rural police station proved. Gurav recovered a few weeks ago and when his colleague constable was infected, the latter’s family needed plasma donation for his critical wife. Gurav stepped up and donated plasma and it helped the constable’s wife recover.One of Gaikwad’s seniors, sub-inspector Anil Shinde, recovered from the virus earlier this month. He was infected days after he escorted a political leader’s convoy passing through Panvel. He suspected he got infected after he came in contact with the driver, who was found positive a few days later.Shinde’s diabetic wife and three children were subsequently tested positive and were all admitted at DY Patil Hospital, Nerul. In a fortunate turn for the family, Shinde’s wife managed to pull through after she was put on a ventilator for four days.Shinde remembers the calls with Kumar, who enquired about the health of his family and spoke with the doctors.“In my entire career, I have never seen a kinder commissioner. He (Kumar) would regularly call each and every person admitted in the hospital, irrespective of their rank and inquire about their health and treatment. The gesture has touched many. Those calls have kept the morale high among the force,” Shinde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-police-keep-coronavirus-in-check/story-lPHCpbmEYhcXUrjCp79cdK.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Blame game over 100-bed ICU facility at Mumbra Dedicated Covid Centre||A fortnight after the much-talked about 100-bed Intensive Care Unit at the Dedicated Covid Centre (DCC) in Mumbra was inaugurated by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the facility is already facing problems galore.Patients from Mumbra approaching the centre for ICU are being sent all the way to Thane as the ICU facility here is non-operational.The doctors working at the centre claimed that it lacks basic facilities like proper ventilation, non-functioning air conditioners, no power back-up and internet connection.The temporary shed set up at the hospital too has led to inconvenience as the facility gets heated up quickly.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) and the MHADA authorities are now each putting the responsibility of this shed on the other.The facility also does not have enough stock of essential medicines. The Dedicated Covid Healthcare Centre at Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad Stadium in Kausa, Mumbra, has 400 beds including 100 ICU beds, 200 for Covid Care Centre (including 100 for men and women each) and 100 general beds.On August 24, CM Thackeray inaugurated the centre online from TMC office. Set up at a cost of Rs 30cr, it is among the five emergency centres set up recently across Thane.Lack essential medicines The centre, at present, does not have essential medicines to treat Covid patients in ICU while the power supply in Mumbra is also erratic. So, with no power back up, the ICU cannot be operational, expressed a doctor from the centre requesting anonymity.He said: “A list of more than 300 medicines was sent to the authorities but hardly 50 of them had been received. The hospital also lacks proper ventilation, the air-conditioners aren’t working making it difficult for the staff to work, we have repeated cases of nurses vomiting and fainting. There is also no power supply till afternoon on most days, the temporary shed heats up the entire facility making working difficult.”Another doctor informed that there is no internet connection at the front desk, so they cannot get details of the patients or the bed availability across the city.On Monday, a meeting was held on this issue at the TMC. Ganesh Deshmukh, additional municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “The centre was built by MHADA, which is taking care of the problem with the shed.”When questioned about the empty bed in the ICU centres, he said, “We are working to start the ICU facilities as soon as possible.”The issue of lack of medicines, ventilation, printing facility, sonography machine and drainage problems too were discussed in the meeting and the corporation said they would soon be resolved.Bhushan Desai, chief officer, Konkan Region, MHADA said, “We have only built the shed. The other facilities and further operations are taken care by TMC. When the centre started operating, we came to know about the ventilation issues. A meeting was held recently to discuss issues with the centre. We will see that all the problems are sorted out.” Dr Khalid Shaikh, Director of Om Sai Medicare Trade taking care of the medical facilities at the centre, said, “The centre is too hot due to the temporary shed making the patients uncomfortable. We mostly accept asymptomatic patients at the centre, while patients above 50 are sent to Thane Global Hospital. The TMC authorities are making all the necessary arrangements for the shifting of patients. Once all the facilities are available in the ICU, we can start admitting patient.” Over 1,150 asymptomatic patients have so far been admitted in the hospital.Dr Sharmin Dinga, in-charge of the Covid Care Centre, said, “We also treated patients with mild symptoms who have recovered. We have admitted patients from Thane, Diva, Shirdi, Sawantwadi and Mumbra among others who have totally recovered and were given better facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/blame-game-over-100-bed-icu-facility-at-mumbra-dedicated-covid-centre/story-bqjgzyLQpsHIEMCSLoEYmI.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Coastal road project: BMC applies for wildlife clearance to translocate of 18 coral colonies along south Mumbai coast||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has approached the Maharashtra forest department for wildlife clearance to translocate 18 coral colonies at Worli and Haji Ali, for further reclamation for the coastal road project.Since March, BMC has reclaimed over 53 hectare of sea along south Mumbai, for the 9.9-km coastal road, which is to be an eight-lane highway connecting Princess Street flyover to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. BMC had told the Supreme Court (SC) in July that they would commence reclamation only after garnering wildlife clearance. According to the civic body’s proposal, accessed by HT, they plan to reclaim areas with coral presence by October, after receiving clearance. The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, had been appointed to assess the marine biodiversity along the project area. NIO had submitted a report in September 2019 identifying six coral species along south Mumbai. Two species of the Rhizangiidae family (Oulangia and one unidentified species) with 18 colonies documented across 0.251 square metre (almost 3ft) in Worli region of the project site, and another species (Dendrophylliidae family) along with Rhizangiidae across 1.1ft area at Haji Ali.“We have requested the forest department for permission to translocate 18 colonies along the Mumbai coastline itself but outside the project area. Translocation will be done by NIO scientists,” said Niranjan Khanolkar, chief engineer (coastal road), BMC.Corals are marine invertebrates that attach themselves to rocky intertidal regions. They garner the same protection as a tiger or elephant under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972. Permissions are required from the principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF-wildlife) before any translocation of the species.The proposal, dated September 3, was submitted to the state mangrove cell earlier this week, and will be vetted by mangrove cell officials, and finally the PCCF-wildlife before granting final clearance. However, the cell has already called for clarifications from the civic body on the proposal. “We have asked for a map of the location where the corals are present and to elaborate on the project details, to verify whether any areas with coral presence have been missed out,” said DR Patil, divisional forest officer (mangrove cell).On June 10, 2019, HT had reported the presence of 11 coral species along the coastal road route by the Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra.Shaunak Modi, director, Coastal Conservation Foundation, who has documented corals along Mumbai’s shoreline, said that against NIO’s claim of only a few square feet of corals, surveys over the past three years had shown a much larger area of coral colonies across the city’s western seaboard. “Since these corals are small and the colonies are scattered, it may be difficult to find all of them in just a few surveys,” he said.WHAT THE BOMBAY HIGH COURT HAD SAID ABOUT CORALSOn December 17, 2019, the SC had put on hold previous orders by the Bombay high court (from July 2019) that quashed coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearances to the civic body, and allowed reclamation of land but restricted BMC from carrying out any other development work. The HC’s order from July 16, 2019, while staying the project had said, “Notwithstanding the fact that corals presence is minuscule, the same shows that the ecosystem in the area (project zone) is conducive to corals. It establishes that the area is ecologically sensitive...we hold that BMC could not have commenced work without obtaining Wildlife Protection Act permission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-project-bmc-applies-for-wildlife-clearance-to-translocate-of-18-coral-colonies-along-south-mumbai-coast/story-buqrM2aWEH0CTmb6wnCfsI.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Defence minister Rajnath Singh speaks to Navy veteran attacked by Shiv Sena workers in Mumbai||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday spoke to Madan Sharma, the retired naval officer who was attacked by six Shiv Sena workers in Mumbai’s Kandivli (East) area on Friday, after he allegedly shared a cartoon mocking Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. Singh in a tweet said that such attacks on former servicemen were “unacceptable” and “deplorable”.“Spoke to retired naval officer, Shri Madan Sharma who was attacked by hooligans in Mumbai and enquired about his health. Such attacks on Ex-Servicemen is completely unacceptable and deplorable. I wish Madanji a speedy recovery (sic),” the defence minister tweeted on Saturday.Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also condemned the attack on Sharma and termed the incident as “state-sponsored terrorism”. Fadnavis appealed to Thackeray to put an end to the “goonda raj” in the state.Fadnavis, who was in Ara, Bihar, to campaign for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the polls in Bihar, said, “What happened very wrong and was a kind of state-sponsored terror situation. I called upon Uddhav ji through my tweet to stop goonda raj. After we created pressure, the six accused were arrested.”Earlier in the day on Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar, along with Sharma’s family, held a protest outside the office of additional commissioner of police (north region).Darekar and BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Atul Bhatkhalkar demanded that the accused who were released on bail, should be booked under sections 326 (causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and means), 452 and 450 (house-trespassing) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which are non-bailable offences.“Sena shakha pramukh and workers mercilessly beat up Sharma. The accused were released on bail. The police should have booked them under the sections for trespassing and causing harm and for using dangerous weapons. We have been assured by the joint commissioner of police that these sections will be included after investigations. If they do not incorporate it, our protest will continue,” Darekar told reporters.Denying any political interference in the case, joint commissioner of police (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil, who met the protesters, said the bail was granted to the accused in view of the Covid-19 situation. By evening, Samta Nagar police in Kandivli invoked a non-bailable section against the six accused.Senior inspector Raju Kasbe of Samata Nagar police station said that section 452 of the IPC was added in the case.When HT asked Kasbe why the section of house trespass was not added in the case, he said the incident took place outside the society premises. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena parliamentarian and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut issued a statement over the incident and said that nobody is above the law.“Maharashtra is a law-abiding state. Those who take law in their hands, whoever they may be, will not be spared. This is the policy of CM Uddhav Thackeray. Yesterday in Mumbai, a retired naval officer was assaulted. The cartoon circulated by the ex-officer on the CM was defamatory. The attack was a spontaneous and furious reaction. But the attackers were immediately arrested and all the procedure was followed as per law,” he said.Raut also slammed the BJP for making the incident a political issue.“It is unfortunate that the Opposition party is making this a political issue. Patience should be followed by both the sides. People lose patience while criticising those on constitutional posts such as the prime minister, president, governor, chief minister, as there is unrestrained behaviour in the garb of freedom of speech and expression. Therefore, this is the time to respect one another and act responsibly. Maintaining peace in the society is as much the responsibility of the Opposition as it is of the ruling party,” he said.Sharma had forwarded a cartoon of the CM in a WhatsApp group. On Friday, the six accused asked Sharma to meet them at his housing society’s gate in Thakur Complex. After the veteran went there, the accused, including shakha pramukh Kamlesh Kadam, assaulted him.“They punched and kicked me. My right eye has sustained injuries,” Sharma said in the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/union-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-speaks-to-navy-veteran-says-attack-by-shiv-sena-workers-in-mumbai-deplorable-and-unacceptable/story-BWwxaXrJaBHetRCQEnvBHM.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally rises to 1,037,765||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 22,084 Covid-19 cases, taking the overall tally to 1,037,765. The active cases in the state now stand at 279,768. The state also saw 13,489 people discharged, taking the tally of recovered to 728,512.The state continued to record over 350 fatalities for the sixth consecutive day with 391 deaths reported on Saturday. The death toll in the state due to Covid-19 stood at 29,115. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state has improved to 2.81%.Of the fatalities reported on Saturday, 280 were recorded in the previous 48 hours, while 70 deaths were from the previous week. The remaining 41 fatalities were from the previous weeks, health department data said.Mumbai, meanwhile, recorded its second-highest single-day jump in numbers with 2,350 new cases. The city’s tally rose to 167,656, while active cases in Mumbai stood at 29,176. Mumbai’s highest single-day cases was reported on September 10 at 2,371 cases.Besides Mumbai, Pune city and its surrounding areas continued to record a chunk of the fresh cases. Pune district reported 4,706 new cases and 61 deaths. Nagpur city reported 1,495 new cases and 30 fatalities, Nagpur rural saw 404 new cases and 10 fatalities. Sangli, Satara, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, too, had contributed a chunk to Saturday’s caseload.The absolute number of deaths being reported over the past few weeks is a matter of concern. In September alone, the state has added 4,483 fatalities or 15% of its deaths due to Covid-19. The state also saw its highest death toll on September 10 with 448 deaths.According to Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, the CFR has dropped in September. However, state-appointed Covid task-force members, pointed out with higher case count, the CFR has reduced, but absolute count remains high. “The CFR on a week-on-week basis has reduced to 1.7% in September, which is lower than the state’s overall rate,” he said.Subhash Salunkhe, former director of health services in Maharashtra and Covid task-force member, said, “It should not be looked at in CFR; the rate is reduced because cases are increasing. It’s the calculation method adopted by the nation. But the number of deaths has gone up.” He added that there is a need for implementation of protocols, including aggressive tracing and testing so that patients do not admit themselves in hospitals at a critical stage.Districts, including Mumbai, Solapur, Akola, Parbhani, Sangli and Ratnagiri, have a CFR over 3%.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Best measures are being adopted in treatment protocol to bring down CFR. We have started tele-ICUs through which local doctors can get in touch with experts for guidance. We are increasing beds, getting more doctors [to help people get treatment].”The health minister also conceded that the increase in number of Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks is a concern. A day after, Maharashtra surpassed 10 lakh cases, Tope said, “Even if the cases have crossed 10 lakh mark, but it has to be seen that over 7 lakh people have recovered. Now there are around 2.75 lakh active patients. Among them, around 3% to 4% are critical patients. The remaining are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However, cases going up is definitely a concerning factor.”Tope ruled out any lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Pune, and other semi-urban and rural areas. He, however, said that Janata Curfew might be imposed if there is a demand from locals.“Janata curfew is imposed for two things to breach the chain of transmission and to ramp up health infrastructure in the city or district… wherever district administration or the guardian minister feel the need a short Janata curfew is being looked at, but over we are not going to impose lockdown. We are moving towards unlocking in stages,” he said.The minister said that there is a need to increase awareness campaigns. He said that the state is also thinking of imposing fines on people not maintaining physical distancing and not wearing a mask in public places. “Now we have reached a stage where we will have to penalise those who do not wear masks and do not keep physical distance in public places. Till a vaccine comes, we have to live with these measures,” he said.Meanwhile, the health minister has directed all divisional commissioners to keep a reserve stock of 50 dura cylinder and 200 jumbo oxygen cylinders to tackle the need for oxygen for Covid-19 patients. The minister added that a war room has been set up under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner to monitor demand and supply of oxygen in the state. He added the state has adequate quantity of medical oxygen.“The demand from each district will be monitored and supply will be done effectively. We have stationed FDA officials at refilling plants to ensure that oxygen does not go to industries and is supplied to hospitals. In the next eight days, a [oxygen] plant will start functioning in Pune. With that, we will have more cylinders than our demand. We do not have shortage as of now,” he said.So far, the state has tested 5,164,840 samples, of which 92,319 were tested in the previous 24 hours. On September 11, BMC conducted highest single-day tests by testing 15,827 samples. It also crossed the 9 lakh mark of testing Covid-19 samples. As of September 11, Mumbai had conducted 9,03,101 samples and the positivity rate is 18.30%.The state’s overall positive rate has gone over 20%. The positivity rate on Saturday was 23.95%. As on September 12, 16,52,955 people are under home quarantine, while 38,275 people are under institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-case-tally-rises-to-1-037-765/story-TeFFifSbhuzHMOiBTLoqXL.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Kolkata man held for threat calls to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, home minister Anil Deshmukh, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut||The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) along with Kolkata Police, arrested a 49-year-old man who threatened several politicians in Maharashtra and also called on the landline numbers of Matoshri, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s private residence, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s home, and state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s residence claiming himself to be a member of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s gang (D-Company). A case was registered by the Kalachowky unit, ATS after Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut received multiple death threats this week. During the inquiry, police traced the calls and identified the caller as Palash Bose, a resident of Tollygunge in Kolkata. Bose was using international SIM cards to make the threat calls to Raut. Ghose had threatened Raut of dire consequences through calls, text messages and even video calls. “He had made internet phone calls to threaten Raut,” said an ATS officer. “Soon after these calls were made, the number was traced to Kolkata. Police inspector Daya Nayak got specific information and sent his team of ATS officers from Juhu unit to Kolkata, where they arrested Bose with the help of Kolkata Police,” said deputy commissioner of police Vinay Rathod. He was brought to Mumbai and will appear before a court soon. Bose was previously working in Dubai for more than 15 years, and ATS is enquiring if he had any links with Dawood Ibrahim or any other member of D-Company, added ATS officers. Police recovered two mobile phones, one Indian SIM card and three international SIM cards from his possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kolkata-man-held-for-threat-calls-to-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-and-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut/story-zuqop0jBeH2pfRvANgt6IO.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Nagpada man stabbed and buried alive in Thane forest, two arrested||Nagpada police on Friday arrested two persons for stabbing their 46-year-old friend and then burying him alive in a thickly forested area near Bhiwandi in Thane district. The murder case was detected while Nagpada police were investigating a missing complaint. According to Nagpada police, a missing complaint was registered in the last week of August by the family of the victim, after he did not return home for more than a day. His office colleagues were also unaware of his whereabouts. “While analysing his mobile phone location and call records, we found three mobile numbers reflecting at the same location in Bhiwandi. We also came to know that before the man went missing, he had contacted one of the accused, a 22-year-old man,” said an officer from Nagpada police station. “We called the 22-year-old for questioning, and he revealed that he was behind the murder and was aided by his 21-year-old friend. The accused further revealed that after stabbing the victim, they buried him in the forest,” the officer said, adding that the accused said the victim was still breathing when they buried him. The first accused told police that the victim used to allegedly sexually assault him, and he wanted it to end. “Fed up with the abuse, he hatched a plan to kill him and called him to Bhiwandi for a liquor party. The two accused then stabbed him to death, and buried him alive,” said a police officer. “We are verifying the claims made by the 22-year-old,” added the officer. The accused were taken to the spot, and the victim’s body was recovered. The body has been sent to JJ Hospital for post mortem and the accused have been arrested under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nagpada-man-stabbed-and-buried-alive-in-thane-forest-two-arrested/story-lrWx9jrxFsVd7jWMvXXSvI.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Family of deceased patient booked for abusing, threatening doctors at KEM Hospital, Mumbai||Bhoiwada police on Saturday evening registered a first information report (FIR) against family members of 17-year-old boy who died of cardiac arrest at KEM Hospital in the wee hours of September 9, for abusing and threatening doctors at the hospital. Prakash Parmar, father of deceased Jatin Parmar, said, “My son was admitted at KEM Hospital as he had fever. However, during the treatment doctors declared him dead, but he was alive.” Navin Parmar, Jatin’s brother, said, “Jatin was down with fever since September 6. The local doctor advised us to admit him, so we admitted him to KEM Hospital. On September 7, the doctors kept him in the intensive care unit, and in the intervening night of September 8 and 9 they told us that my brother had died. But when we touched his chest we felt that his heart was beating.”“Doctors had taken off the ventilator so we asked them to put him back on ventilator. But instead of listening to us, they called the police. We demanded for a post-mortem but the hospital authority denied. He had tested negative for Covid-19,” Navin added.Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, said, “We did his ECG, which proved that the patient was dead. Doctors put him on ventilator after they [Jatin’s family] threatened them and ventilator pushes air into the lungs which makes a sound. His preliminary post-mortem report states he died due to cardiac arrest.”“After his death, more than 30 people came to the hospital and started threatening and abusing doctors. They even tore government records. On September 10, we spoke to the police regarding this issue. A video of that incident went viral on social media today,” Deshmukh said.Hospital authorities then approached Bhoiwada police and filed a complaint against the persons seen in the video. Senior inspector Vinod Kamble said, “We have registered a case under sections 141 (unlawful assembly), 143 (being member of unlawful assembly), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code, section 6 of Epidemic Diseases Act and section 5 of the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010. We are investigating the case and examining the video to identify the people who were abusing doctors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/family-of-deceased-patient-booked-for-abusing-threatening-doctors-at-kem-hospital-mumbai/story-FFQDKyv4BFoh0E64MplqHP.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority approves two proposals to connect Aarey, Poisar stations on Metro-7 corridor with commercial complexes||What if you could just walk to the nearest Metro station from your home or workplace? With the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) two new proposals, this could soon turn into reality. MMRDA has approved two proposals for establishing direct connectivity between Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) stations and two commercial complexes. It is also open to more proposals. The authority has approved proposals to build a 514-metre (m) foot overbridge (FoB) from the upcoming station at Poisar on the Metro-7 corridor to Sarova properties. It has also approved the proposal for construction of a 1,300-m bridge connecting the upcoming Aarey station to Oberoi Mall, officials said. BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “The work will commence once we approve the detailed engineering design.” Officials also said that the cost of building the connectors will be borne by the developers. As both the routes pass along many commercial complexes, MMRDA said that it is expecting a better response from developers after the lockdown. “Owing to the pandemic, we haven’t received a good response from developers. But we are hoping that they will approach us in the future, as direct connectivity to a Metro station will also increase the property value of a complex,” an official from MMRDA said. The authority is looking to open Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) lines by May 2021. This year in July, MMRDA had approved a policy to enable direct access between Metro stations and the complexes nearby. Direct access is a worldwide concept that will ease the problem of first and last-mile connectivity to the metro stations. The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is executing the 33.5km fully underground Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) corridor, has also been in talks with commercial and residential complexes along the route to enable direct access to its underground stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metropolitan-region-development-authority-approves-two-proposals-to-connect-aarey-poisar-stations-on-metro-7-corridor-with-commercial-complexes/story-tQuzCoZW2ZvPDMPBUdP5IM.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Uncertainty over partial reopening of schools in Maharashtra amid Covid-19 crisis||Though the Centre had on September 8 released guidelines to start schools for students from Class 9 to Class 12 from September 21, parents and teachers in Maharashtra are yet to get clarity on the issue as the state government and education department have not made any official announcement on it.Over the past few days, the state education department has held several discussions with all the stakeholders, including school managements, teachers and parents along with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to get their views on the physical reopening of schools. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not respond to calls and messages. However, an official from the state education department said, “The popular opinion seems to be against the physical reopening of schools anytime soon. With the rising (Covid-19) cases in the state, there seems to be a lot of risk involved in reopening schools. However, the government’s decision is awaited.” The official added that the plan to reopen schools only post-Diwali break is also being considered. The guidelines released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) for partial reopening of schools stated that only those schools which are outside containment zones will be allowed to reopen for Class 9 to Class 12. The guidelines further stated that before resuming classes, schools have to be sanitised and seating arrangements have to be based on social distancing norms. Anyone who develops symptoms in the school has to be isolated, and in the case of students, the school would have to immediately inform their parents. Recently, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ordered the sanitisation of all its schools which were used as quarantine facilities and were later handed back to the civic body. Similarly, other schools were asked to ensure basic cleaning of classrooms and school premises. Teachers, however, said that starting schools, especially in places like Mumbai where the number of cases is growing every day, is not a good idea. Rajesh Pandya, a teacher at Fatima Devi English High School, Malad, said, “Most teachers in Mumbai travel by the train and even if they follow the 50% attendance rule as suggested in the central government circular, it is not possible to do so. Several teachers from private schools have not even got their full salaries for the past few months. They won’t be able to afford transport on a daily basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uncertainty-over-partial-reopening-of-schools-in-maharashtra-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-N0gXWmofMWZxIgyxpEKcUP.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||Andheri, Vile Parle have most active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai at 2.8K||Andheri, Vile Parle and Borivli, all in the western suburbs, have the most active Covid-19 cases in the city, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data. Andheri and Vile Parle have 2,824 active infections, followed by Borivli at 1,972; Kandivli, Ghatkopar, Mulund at over 1,200; Dadar, Dharavi, Mahim at 1,172 and Bhandup, Kanjurmarg, parts of Vikhroli at 1,173, data revealed. According to BMC officials, Andheri and Vile Parle’s tally is due to the areas being near the airport, where there is higher risk of the virus’ spread owing to movement of people. Previous data had also revealed that Andheri had seen the most number of citizens fined for not wearing a mask in public places. In case of Borivli, Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner, R Central ward (which covers Borivli), said, “We are at the peak currently and most cases are coming from high-rises, compared to slums. The reason behind the increase in cases is that we are conducting around 1,000 tests daily and also the relaxations in lockdown measures have resulted in a spike in active infections.” Kapse added, “We are also seeing a trend wherein those testing positive and are home-isolating themselves also see their family members infected when they are tested within 14 days. But we are taking all precautions, and whichever housing societies have multiple active cases, we are sealing them completely, instead of sealing just the floor.” For south Mumbai, D ward, which covers Malabar Hill, Grant Road, Chowpatty, has 1,185 active cases, compared to other areas of south Mumbai having fewer than 600 active cases. A ward, which covers Churchgate, Colaba and CST, has 514 active cases, followed by B ward, covering Dongri, Pydhonie which has the lowest number — 176. C ward, covering Marine Lines, Kalbadevi, has 263 active cases.The city’s Covid-19 case tally was 165,306, including 27,642 active cases, as of Friday. The breakup of active cases is available for 157,662 total cases, of which 22,927 are active ones. As per the data, more than 50% of the cases are from 10 of the 24 administrative wards in the city, which includes the above mentioned areas.The number of active cases in the city has started rising in the city since the past 10 days as the number of tests has increased in the city. Civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told HT on September 6 that, “For the next 30 days, the city will report around 2,000 cases daily as the BMC is scaling up tests to between 12,000 and 14,000, up from around 9,000 tests daily in the last week of August.” This increase in the daily cases has also resulted in an increase of active cases in the city. Active cases are at a two-month high, as per the BMC data. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant, said, “BMC has to analyse the trend and start stricter containment measures in the areas where active cases are rising since the past 10 days. We should consider sealing entire buildings from these areas, instead of only floors.”Meanwhile, as per BMC’s data, there are 7,217 sealed areas in the city, consisting 2.4 lakh households and a population of around 8.6 lakh, followed by 542 containment zones, including slums and chawls, covering 7.8 lakh households and a population of around 34 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/andheri-vile-parle-have-most-active-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-at-2-8k/story-pXIJBZWtzq5Lj3h9vZWE1O.html

13-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body collects 100 voice samples for Covid-19 detection using AI||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has collected 100 voice samples of suspected Covid-19 patients as part of a pan-India study that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify Covid-positive individuals. If the results are encouraging, then AI-based voice tests may be used to screen patients since there is almost no waiting time for these results. The study is being carried out by Vocalis Health, an Israel-based start-up. For the pan-India study, which will be undertaken in two phases, 10,000 samples will be collected of which 2,000 will be from Mumbai. In the first phase, 500 samples will be collected and analysed using AI, which will help formulate a specific voice wavelength to detect Covid-19 patients within 30 seconds. The civic body signed a memorandum of understanding for the study with Vocalis Health on August 21. “First, we will take samples of 500 individuals, then the remaining ones. The researchers will analyse the health condition of suspected patients from their voice modulations. Through this, they [the researchers] will be able to set a specific voice wavelength which might help to detect Covid-19 patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. BMC has collected 100 samples from its jumbo Covid facility at NESCO Ground in Goregaon (East). This study is based on the hypothesis that the infection may affect the voice of individuals, given the interdependence between the respiratory and speech systems in the body. “If the pilot shows promising results, we have plans to use the program in other hospitals as well. It is non-invasive and can deliver results quickly,” said Kakani. The gold standard test for to diagnose Covid-19 is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, it takes over eight hours to deliver results. Though rapid antigen tests give results within 30 minutes, its false negativity rate is higher. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of BYL Nair Dental Hospital and in-charge of the Covid facility at NESCO Ground, said this is the first time that voice biomarkers have been used to identify Covid-19 patients. “We have to wait for the study to get over to gauge the effectiveness of the technique,” she said. Dr KK Agarwal, a cardiologist and former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “This technology may be new but is being widely-used across the globe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-collects-100-voice-samples-for-covid-19-detection-using-ai/story-rONCZ2uV1BSHhexVRuPQjO.html
13-09-2020||Mumbai||NCB arrests 6 more in Sushant Singh Rajput-linked drugs case||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday conducted multiple raids in Mumbai and Goa, arresting six more people as part of its ongoing investigation into allegations of drug abuse and distribution in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. On Saturday, NCB conducted raids at multiple locations in Mumbai. Bandra resident Karam Jeet Singh Anand, alias KJ, was brought in for questioning to the agency’s office in south Mumbai and later arrested. While NCB did not reveal quantities, marijuana and hashish were seized from him. According to officers, Anand is part of the drug syndicate the agency had busted as part of its ongoing investigation. Joint director of NCB, Sameer Wankhede, confirmed the arrest. Later, NCB officers arrested Dwayne Anthony Fernandes and two others from Dadar, and seized 500 gram of marijuana. After a raid in Powai, Ankush Arenja was arrested. NCB recovered 42 grams of hashish and ₹112,000 from him. According to NCB, Arenja used to receive contraband from Anand and supply it to arrested accused Anuj Keshwani. “NCB also arrested one Chris Costa from Goa in the same case,” said deputy director KPS Malhotra. Earlier, on September 6, NCB had seized 590 grams of hashish, 0.64 gram of LSD sheets, 304 gram of marijuana (including imported marijuana joints and capsules) and ₹185,200 and 5,000 Indonesian Rupiah from Keshwani’s residence in Khar. So far, NCB has arrested 16 people as part of its investigation. The other arrested accused are members of Rajput’s household staff, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant; actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother, Showik; and six alleged drug peddlers. Showik’s statement to NCB reportedly mentioned Anand as a “supplier”. NCB traced Keshwani on the basis of information provided by Kaizan Ebrahim, who was arrested by the agency on September 3 and granted bail soon after. In their bail plea, Chakraborty and Showik had contended that they were unfairly charged under section 27A (financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act as their alleged role in Rajput’s death is the same as Ebrahim’s who was granted bail within a day of his arrest. However, the special court instituted under the NDPS Act denied Chakraborty and Showik’s plea on Friday. Chakraborty has maintained she is innocent. On the basis of a complaint she had filed earlier this week, Bandra police registered a first information report (FIR) on September 8, against Rajput’s sisters Priyanka and Mitu Singh, as well as associate professor of cardiology at New Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Dr Tarun Kumar. Chakraborty has alleged Rajput’s sisters had supplied him prohibited medication on the basis of a prescription – that may be forged – from Dr Kumar. On Friday, Chakraborty and Showik were remanded in judicial custody till September 22. Miranda, Sawant and alleged drug peddlers Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar are also in judicial custody. Keshwani is in NCB’s custody till September 14. Three others – Ebrahim, Karan Arora, Abbas Lakhani – were granted bail soon after their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-6-more-in-sushant-singh-rajput-linked-drugs-case/story-rAlywDRM2fmpGH9nIuN3GO.html
13-09-2020||Delhi||Increased vigil, more security as Metro goes back to normal operations||Delhi Metro, six days after its graded reopening and more than five months after being forced shut owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, resumed normal services on all its lines on Saturday.On Saturday, data suggested, at least 152,845 people took a ride on the Metro system — which is 23,959 people more than Friday’s total passenger count.The acid test, Metro officials however said, will be on Monday, when the office crowd pours in during the rush hours and the social distancing and other security norms put in place as part of SoP is tested.Hindustan Times on Saturday travelled through multiple corridors of the system to see if Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was prepared to manage the increase in passenger load, now that all its lines were fully functional. At 6am on Saturday, when the gates were thrown open for passengers, the attendence in many Metro stations was thin. The crowd, however, started picking up within a few hours, resulting in queues forming outside some stations by 10am, as passengers waited patiently to get their temperature checked, their hands sanitised and their baggage sterilised before being allowed entry. By evening, the rush had died down with stations and trains witnessing a steady influx of passengers. Metro and security staff were seen rationing passengers in queues outside station premises to ensure minimal crowding while making sure all social distancing norms were adhered to. Shikha Sharma, a passenger who was travelling from Mayur Vihar Phase-1 interchange station to INA on the Pink Line, said that while there were a “decent number” of passengers waiting for trains on the platform, the crowd inside trains were still thinly spread, which left enough space for everyone to be seated. “I was apprehensive about the safety and the frequency of trains. But the service was regular, which gave passengers the confidence to skip a train or two, which they felt were crowded,” said Sharma. Compared to last week, a larger number of Metro officials and security personnel were spotted on the station premises on Saturday — a move officials claimed was put in place to tackle the expected additional rush. The newly created flying squad of the Delhi Metro was also seen moving in and out of trains to ensure that people were wearing masks at all times. “It is a weekend and since the Airport Express Line, which was opened on Saturday, does not usually have a very large footfall, we anticipated the ridership to be somewhat similar or probably a little lower than yesterday (Friday). The true test will be from Monday and we are prepared,” said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/increased-vigil-more-security-as-metro-goes-back-to-normal-operations/story-JKwF866BUg7pglY9JsJCcO.html
13-09-2020||Delhi||NGT pulls up e-commerce firms Amazon, Flipkart for excess plastic use||Responding to a plea filed by a 16-year-old boy, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on September 4 expressed its displeasure at the use of excessive of plastic in packaging by e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart, and suggested that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conduct an environmental audit and then recover fines from the two companies for violating green norms.The order was uploaded on the NGT’s website on Friday.Hearing a petition filed by the boy, Aditya Dubey, who approached the tribunal through his legal guardians, to stop Amazon and Flipkart from using excessive plastic in their packaging, the NGT said the authorities concerned were not following the dictum of “polluter pays” even as there were statutory norms prescribing this.In environmental law, the polluter pays principle dictates that a party responsible for producing pollution compensate for the damage caused.The NGT then asked the CPCB to take steps necessary in the matter and file an action-taken report by October 14.“A report has been filed by the CPCB on September 4, which again mentions one or other reasons for not enforcing the law but does not mention the coercive measures adopted either directly by CPCB or in coordination with the state PCBs/PCCs (pollution control boards),” noted the tribunal, headed by justice Adarsh K Goel.The green panel also said the CPCB could also consider ordering an environmental audit against the two firms to assess and recover compensation, following due process of law.The plea, argued through lawyers Priya Hingorani and Meenesh Dubey, has pointed out that Plastic Waste Management Rules (2016) defined the duties of e-commerce firms, but because of the lack of monitoring and implementation of the rules, plastic packaging has become a serious environmental challenge.Dubey’s plea in October 2019 had contended that the companies deliver items in cardboard boxes that were much larger than the size of the item being delivered. The plea said that the boxes along with the plastic wraps used to keep these items in place ultimately end up in landfills.Submitting its reply on September 10, the CPCB too had agreed before the NGT that the waste management rules required Amazon and Flipkart to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to the packaging of their products, under ‘extended producer responsibility’.“Amazon Retail India Private Limited and Flipkart Private limited are involved in packaging and selling of other companies’ products and thus introducing plastic packaging in the market. They need to fulfil their extended producer responsibility under PWM Rules and should obtain registration as brand owner after submitting proper documents,” CPCB said in its affidavit.At this, the NGT had asked for a report from the pollution monitoring body derailing the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of the rules and penalties imposed for violations.As the case took up the massive problem of plastic waste generation in the national capital, experts said that Delhi needs an effective ‘extended producer responsibility’ to ensure better take-back mechanism.Tara Roychowdhary, a Delhi-based solid waste management expert, said that while the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change has released a detailed document on the EPR (extended producer responsibility) recently, it was not being implemented effectively.In an email response to HT, Amazon India said, “Amazon India has been working along with industry bodies and has made various representations to the Ministry of Environment to obtain clarity on roles and responsibilities of e-commerce players. While our teams are working to review the orders and await guidance from CPCB in the present matter, we have always been committed to be compliant with Extended Producer Responsibility mandate under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.”Flipkart did not respond to repeated requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngt-pulls-up-e-commerce-firms-amazon-flipkart-for-excess-plastic-use/story-54HxLejVZkCWfUZy6Mbm4K.html
13-09-2020||Delhi||Slum dwellers reach SC against Railway slum eviction order, 11 dwellers file plea to join as parties||A group of slum dwellers affected by a recent eviction order have approached the Supreme Court, seeking to be included in any hearing before demolition of their homes and contending that their relocation could affect their livelihood at a time when the pandemic has made matters difficult.The top court on August 31 ordered that approximately 48,000 slums situated along train tracks must be cleared, affecting an estimated 240,000 people. The matter has also taken a political tone with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for eviction notices issued by the Union railways ministry. The BJP has in turn criticised the AAP for not making alternate residential arrangements for those affected.In their applications filed to the top court, a group of 11 who reside in some of these clusters said: “The impleaders (slum dwellers) work in the markets and industrial areas near their residence. It will be very difficult for them to earn their livelihood if they are removed from the said area in these difficult and unprecedented times of the pandemic.” The affected applicants are residents of Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) clusters of Sarai Rohilla, two camps of Kirti Nagar, and another cluster near Defence Colony.This is the second application filed in the top court – on Friday, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken sought court orders for alternate housing for the affected people under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015, before they are removed. He sought urgent intervention since the Railways has proposed the demolition drive between September 11 and 14.HT first reported about order on September 3.Advocate Lubna Naaz, who filed the application on behalf of the slum dwellers, said, “At present 11 slum dwellers have come but any order by the Court will impact dwellers residing in the 48,000 slums. In the current circumstances of the pandemic, these people need compassion and a little help from the Court for their suitable rehabilitation.”The slum dwellers in their application have annexed two documents that could be relevant to decide the future course of action. The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) began a survey of the JJ clusters situated close to the railway tracks situated on land belonging to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Central government. Out of 196 JJ clusters, the survey covered 158. It was stopped midway after DDA instructed DUSIB on October 23, 2019 to suspend the process due to the Delhi Assembly elections that were held in February 2020. Another document annexed to the application is a communication by director, Railway Board on January 7, 2016 which records a decision with regard to removal of jhuggis situated on Railway land. The document records a decision that no demolition is to be carried out without joint notice by representatives of DUSIB and railways and without a Rehabilitation Plan.A closer look at the proceedings in the Supreme Court which resulted in the order of eviction reveals that at no stage did the court call upon the slum dwellers to be heard. The action had its genesis in a February 28, 2020 order where the court observed: “By the sides of the railway lines in outer Delhi region, heaps of plastic bags and garbage are lying on both sides and people living in the slums. The situation is pathetic.”Accordingly, it recommended an expert body on environmental issues – EPCA (Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority), Delhi government and various Municipal Corporations to chalk out a concrete plan for removal of the plastic bags, garbage and other waste materials lying along the tracks. EPCA, a report on July 9, 2020, asked the court to direct the railways to prepare a time-bound plan. The railways in turn told the court that “predominant presence of jhuggies along 140 kilometre route length of track” was a major hindrance in the process. Such encroachments, the railways said, “are not only adding to the present menace of accumulation of garbage, municipal solid waste, human waste along the railway line but are a safety threat to the day-to-day operation of the railways.” This became one of the factors for the court to order immediate eviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/slum-dwellers-reach-sc-against-railway-slum-eviction-order-11-dwellers-file-plea-to-join-as-parties/story-ZHzf5FOu22nTuh1Hafb8hN.html
13-09-2020||Chandigarh||HC Bar: Council changes poll panel||The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH) has changed the election committee constituted for the Punjab and Haryana high court Bar body polls, which are slated for September 30. The development came after the previous committee — headed by senior advocate KS Sidhu — refused to hold the election as per the council’s directive, citing Covid-19 outbreak. Sidhu in a letter to the Bar council on Friday had said that it cannot force elections on a Bar association. There are no provisions in the Advocates Act or rules which authorise BCPH to suo motu conduct the elections of any Bar associations, Sidhu had stated in his letter, while underlining that many lawyers have gone back to their native places that do not have sufficient infra for online polls. He had also raised doubts over the transparency of online elections. Now, BCPH in a fresh communication has constituted a new committee to be headed by Munish Jolly, directing it to take over and comply with the council’s order on elections with immediate effect. BCPH is a statutory body that regulates entry into legal profession. It has nearly 1 lakh members in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. Its chairman Karanjit Singh in a fresh letter has stated that elections are being held as per the Bar Association (Constitution and Registration Rules) 2015, upheld by the HC in December 2016. BCPH has also reasoned that council rules are applicable to all Bars, including HC Bar, as per a 2018 judgment. It further mentions that there are provisions for holding online elections. The letter states that after Sidhu’s letter, a committee was constituted to examine the issue, which suggested forming a new panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-bar-council-changes-poll-panel/story-v8ycpjXbgvw1GdSu1HPQwO.html
13-09-2020||Delhi||HC to reduce physical benches in view of rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi||With Covid-19 cases on the rise in the national capital once again and several court staffers testing positive for the virus infection, the Delhi high court has decided to reduce the number of benches holding in-person hearings. The new roster is set to be implemented from September 15, sources in the know of the matter said.On Saturday, Delhi reported 4,321 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the city’s overall tally to 214,069. Delhi’s Covid count has risen exponentially ever since the government ramped up testing from the first week of September.On September 1, the high court had started in-person hearings with five benches,which will now be reduced to three.The others will continue taking up matters through videoconferencing, the way they have done since the nationwide lockdown started on March 25. The high court has so far reported 45 cases of Covid-19 from among its staffers, while the seven district courts have reported 192 cases in all. A bank branch situated within the high court complex had to be closed recently after three of its officials tested positive for Covid-19. A recent feedback from advocates had revealed that nearly 84% of them preferred the virtual mode of hearings to physically appearing in court. This had prompted the court to consider reducing the number of benches. “Most of the advocates, whose matters were listed before the benches constituted for in-person hearings, expressed their inability, reluctance or unwillingness to appear in person. We received a large number of requests for taking up matters through videoconferencing,” a high court official, privy to the decision, said. The official pointed out that when physical hearings resumed on September 1, only five benches were holing hearings on a rotational basis. These included two division benches and three single judge benches. “The physical appearances were largely before the single benches...whereas the appearance before the other benches was relatively low,” the official said, on condition of anonymity. After deliberating over the issue, the judges and the chief justice decided that beginning September 15, physical hearings will be conducted only by three benches – one division bench and two single judge benches. “Despite the adverse circumstances, the court has decided not to discontinue physical hearings altogether,” the official said. Chief justice Naranbhai Patel has also directed the district and sessions judges to review the requirement physical courts in their respective districts. However, not all advocates are in favour of virtual hearings. Dhan Mohan, a member executive of the Delhi High Court Bar Association, said there are multiple problems with virtual hearings. “In these financially tough times, novice lawyers are forced to spend on purchasing laptops and other devices to be able to attend physical hearings. The hearings themselves are now of shorter duration and hurried as lawyers are afraid that their internet connectivity will be lost midway through the hearing. Due to network issues, judges are also unable to hear the lawyers completely,” Mohan said. He, however, said once can’t do without virtual court at this juncture . “The pandemic is set to last for many more months and there are senior advocates and others who can’t risk an in-person appearance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-to-reduce-physical-benches-in-view-of-rising-covid-cases-in-delhi/story-LVBPeudzMvHgGNXT6VqlHP.html

13-09-2020||Noida||At this Noida hospital, Covid-19 patients have a humanoid friend for company||In a step towards adapting emerging technologies in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, a private hospital in Greater Noida has deployed robots in the intensive care units to interact with patients. Developed by a Bengaluru-based start-up, the five foot tall artificial intelligence-enabled humanoid named ‘Mitra’ blinks its eyes while interacting with people, is able to recognise faces, manoeuvre using wheels, and has a high-quality touch-screen mounted display. Mitra was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ivanka Trump, advisor to US president Donald Trump, at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in Hyderabad in November 2017. A week ago, two Mitra were put on Covid-19 duties at Greater Noida’s Yatharth Super speciality Hospital, one of the four major hospitals in the district that is treating Covid-19 patients. Deployed to enhance the screening process and safeguard the health care staff, Mitra’s main function for now is to interact with patients, make video calls for them and hold sessions with doctors and psychiatrists, hospital officials said. “We have two such robots which were earlier deployed at the hospital gates for the screening process of visitors. Each costs Rs10 lakh. They can take the temperature and assign a gate pass to those who are fit, and inform the health staff if anyone has a higher body temperature. A week ago, we kind of promoted one of the Mitras to work with the front-line Covid-19 staff of the hospital,” said Yatharth Tyagi, director, Yatharth Super Specialty Hospital. “The robot is operated by a technician through a mobile application, and based on the appointments or need, it charts counselling sessions for Covid-19 patients with the doctor or psychiatrist concerned,” he further explained. Elaborating on the usage of robotics and innovation in the health care sector, Tyagi points out that though a robot or machine can’t replace the a health worker or doctor, it definitely eases their workload and keeps them safe by breaking the virus spread. “For the well-being of patients, we don’t allow phones in wards. That is where the Mitras come to play. If any patient wants to talk his/her family, then Mitra can make a video call for them. Also, the patient who needs counselling get a session with the psychiatrist,” Tyagi said. According to doctors, the Mitra is proving helpful with patients. “Such innovative interactions help stimulate the mind of a patient. For patients who are fighting the virus, seeing a humanoid with whom they can interact brings positivity, generates good hormones and helps with their mental well-being -- all these are things that Covid-19 patients direly need. Apart from that, Mitra also helps out the health staff,” said Dr Rahul Singh, head of the department, Covid-ICU, Yatharth Hospital. Yatharth Hospital currently has 260 active Covid-19 cases, and has successfully treated 1,120 patients so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-this-noida-hospital-covid-19-patients-have-a-humanoid-friend-for-company/story-3B01H8QmW7yRveCsN6L1FN.html
13-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Police trace online marketplace and e-wallet fraud source to Haryana, UP and Rajasthan||Gurugram: Following investigations into many cases of online frauds, the Gurugram police have identified at least three districts -- one each in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan -- where around 200 gangs of fraudsters are operating out of more than 20 villages. According to the police, these gangs are involved in recent spate of fraud cases on an online shopping website and also cases involving e-wallets and debit/credit card transactions. Nearly 3,000 people in Gurugram have been duped this year so far, the police said, adding that most of the fraud cases were reported in the past few months.The gangs have been traced back to Nuh, Mathura and Bharatpur, said the police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that as the number of people being duped by conmen has risen during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have issued an advisory asking people to be cautious while buying or selling vehicles on the portal. “The gangs buy cheapest mobile phones, which hardly cost them ₹500 per phone, and SIM cards in bulk from different states. They use one mobile phone barely for three days and later bury them or damage them to escape arrest,” he said. The police said they have identified the villages but are facing challenges as the locals have not cooperated with the investigation so far. Rao said the suspects cash in on the trust of the victims on the online portals which they gain by offering vehicles and electronic gadgets at throwaway prices. On an average, three complaints of being cheated on these marketplaces are being registered at the cybercrime police stations in the city everyday. “Despite knowing the areas from where these gangs are operating, we are yet to make headways in major cases as the suspects are using latest technology and before the police can trace the location, they flee from the spot,” he said. The Cyber police teams are taking help of locals to crack these cases and teams are visiting these areas regularly to get some crucial leads. The most common modus operandi of these gangs is posting fake advertisements on the website for the sale of second hand vehicles, gadgets such as mobile phones and laptops. “These gangs upload pictures online and put up advertisements by creating an account. When a buyer shows interest in the product, they pretend to carry out the transaction and dupe the buyer after collecting money through online mode,” said Karan Goyal, assistant commissioner of police (DLF). In over 300 cases, conmen shared identity cards of defence personnel, claiming that they were posted in field areas or on borders to gain trust of the victims. A total of 61 people were arrested this year till date. Jasvir Singh Punia, station house officer of Cyber police station, said that they have arrested 38 people in the past two months for duping people. “The suspects said it was easier to dupe people during lockdown as they were busy working from home and easily shared one time password (OTP). We have been time and again asking people not to do so, but to no avail,” Punia said. Meanwhile, representatives of OLX met the police commissioner last week to discuss the measures that they have taken to combat fraud. “We have started capturing the GPS locations of the users, who have consented to the in-app permission for sharing the location. We can collect GPS locations of only such users who have provided their permission to collect their location. Most importantly by next week, we will be implementing verified user tags for the users posting ads in the cars category. For verifying the users, we will collect selfie in real-time and an image of the ID proof,” said Juhi Singh, legal counsel, OLX India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-police-trace-online-marketplace-and-e-wallet-fraud-source-to-haryana-up-and-rajasthan/story-d8CSfWDRPSMFbkVaKfl2JK.html

The Commission had disposed of 16 buyers’ cases out of 85 and the remaining cases will be heard in future. Buyers had booked apartments in 2014 with an assurance of delivery by December 2019 in this housing project, located in Sector 79. Buyers, however, filed cases after they realised that the developer – Lotus Greens – has stopped construction for the past many years. It has completed only 30-50% construction of nine towers, the alleged.“The opposite party (Lotus Greens) shall complete the construction of the allotted flats in all respects, obtain the requisite occupancy certificate at its own cost and responsibility and then offer possession of the allotted flats to the concerned allottees within a maximum period of 12 months from today i.e. on or before 8.9.2021,” reads the order.The Lotus Arena project is spread over 12.5 acres along the Aqua Line metro and part of Noida’s sports city project. The developer had planned to build 1,100 units in this project but failed to finish and deliver as per the scheduled deadline, after which homebuyers moved NCDRC for relief. The NCRD’s presiding member VK Jain, in his order, further said, “If the opposite party (developer) fails to complete the construction, obtain the requisite occupancy certificate and then offer the possession of the flat, complete in all respects, it shall refund the entire amount received from the concerned allottee to him/them, within one month thereafter along-with compensation in the form of simple interest @ 9% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date of refund.”HT tried to contact the developer but the latter did not respond to call or text for a comment on the issue. HT also tried to reach the developer’s advocate representing the firm in NCDRC but the counsel did not take the call.NCDRC further said, “If the opposite party delivers the possession to the complainants in terms of direction (i) above, it shall also pay to the concerned allottee compensation in the form of simple interest @ 6% p.a. from the committed date for delivery of possession till the date on which the possession in terms of direction (i) above is offered. The balance amount, if any, payable by the concerned allottee to the opposite party shall be adjusted out the compensation payable in terms of this order and the balance amount, if any, shall be paid by the concerned allottee within four weeks of the offer of possession in terms of direction (i) above. The opposite party shall also pay the cost of litigation quantified at Rs25,000/- in each case,” said the order.V Sharma, president of Lotus Arena buyers’ association, said that they welcome NCDRC’s order.“I have invested my hard-earned savings to buy a 3BHK apartment in this project. But the developer not only failed to deliver but also stopped the construction and communication with buyers, forcing us to file a case in NCDRC for justice. Now we hope that we will get our apartments after a long wait,” Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/deliver-flats-in-lotus-greens-in-12-months-or-refund-buyers-consumer-forum-orders-builder/story-XW3B1GHBJlMQJadvg2s99M.html
