Hundreds of committees have provided recommendations but the basic structure of public administration has remained unaltered. Therefore, it is no small matter that the government has embarked on an ambitious effort in recent weeks to reform the administration from its roots. A careful observer would have noticed that some of its key elements have already been introduced. Just weeks before he passed away in 1964, Prime Minister (PM) Jawaharlal Nehru had commented that his greatest regret had been his failure to change an essentially colonial administration. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expressed similar sentiments in Parliament in 1966. “What India needs today is a revolution in the administrative system without which no enduring change could be brought about in any field”. The first Administrative Reform Commission was set up in 1966 under Morarji Desai but it became a victim of bureaucratic sloth. Its report of 20 volumes and 537 recommendations would be placed in Parliament in 1977. Desai had become PM by then, but he was unable to implement the recommendations. The reforms of 1991 freed many parts of the economy from direct government control. But the functioning of the bureaucracy went through few changes. Therefore, a second Administrative Reform Commission was set up in 2005 under Veerappa Moily. In the preface of a report tabled in 2008, Moily wrote of the bureaucracy, “It believes that its authority and legitimacy is derived not from the mandate of the people but from an immutable corpus of rules that it has prescribed for itself, without any correspondence to the needs and aspirations of the people”. This brief historical background is important in order to appreciate what is now being attempted. PM Narendra Modi’s government has been experimenting with reforms such as lateral entry and digitisation since 2014. However, the new effort has a totally different level of ambition. Here are measures introduced in the last six weeks: One, a national platform for recruitment. Almost all discussion around government recruitment tends to focus on that of the higher bureaucracy through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examinations. However, this thin layer of gazetted officers accounts for a tiny fraction of the civil service. The rest of the recruitment is done through a bewildering network of agencies and examinations. The lack of transparency not only makes it difficult for candidates but has led frequently to allegations of manipulation. The government, therefore, has announced the establishment of a National Recruitment Agency that will conduct a Common Eligibility Test across the country. For now, it will be a standardised first-level filter that will enable candidates to take things forward for final selection. The scores will be shared, so state governments, public sector and even private sector can use them as they deem fit. Two, compulsory retirement to remove the unfit. The health of any organisation is dependent on systematically weeding out deadwood. Unfortunately, entry into the Indian civil service is seen as a ticket to guaranteed employment till retirement. Interestingly, service rules have long included provisions that allow for civil servants to be compulsorily retired after he/she has completed 30 years of service and crossed the age of 50 (or 55 even if less than 30 years in service). This can be done under the Fundamental Rule 56(j)/(l) and Rule 48 of CCS (Pension) Rules. Around 320 senior officers have already been retired through this route since 2014, but the government reissued the guidelines on August 28 along with supporting Supreme Court judgments. It also provided basic criteria and procedures for using these provisions to remove officials “whose integrity is doubtful” or “found to be ineffective”. Three, rationalisation of autonomous bodies. The central government alone has hundreds of autonomous bodies — think-tanks, industry bodies, advisory boards and so on. These entities have a role in the delivery of public services but, inevitably, there is also a large amount of duplication and redundancy. It is rare that a government body, once established, will be wound up. For the first time, the central government is carrying out a comprehensive initiative to review the functioning of these institutions. In August, the ministry of textiles alone abolished the All India Handicrafts Board, Cotton Advisory Board, Jute Advisory Board, and the All India Handloom Board. Their duties have been transferred to other existing bodies for better delivery. Other ministries are also carrying out similar exercises. Four, taxpayers charter and faceless assessment. An important aspect of administrative reform is to improve the interface with the citizen. The tax department is an obvious place to start. In August, the PM announced a Taxpayers Charter that clearly lays out 14 rights for the taxpayer. The announcement of the Charter accompanied a shift to a system of faceless assessment where cases are to be assigned by an automated system. Together, it is hoped that the measures will significantly reduce persistent complaints of harassment and rent-seeking. The overall direction of the reform effort should be clear — to improve the inflow/outflow of personnel, rationalise processes, weed out redundant bodies and upgrade the interface with the citizen. The momentum is only going to accelerate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/transforming-public-administration/story-PZEGbLXbUIAR9Q3fQ0XmvJ.html
14-09-2020||News||How to reduce food, job insecurity in rural areas||After the Covid-19 outbreak, 66% of rural households fell short of cash for food. About 40% reduced their food intake. Only 7% of the returnee migrants are engaged in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). These are some of the findings of a survey of about 17,000 households in 80 districts (169 blocks) in 11 states, carried out by a coalition of 65 civil society organisations, called Rapid Rural Community Response to Covid-19 (RCRC). This shows that the State has to play a major role to play in reviving and rebuilding the economy.First, only half received the full entitlement of free rations three times — 42% received this either once or twice; 8% got nothing at all. This situation is stark in backward states such as Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Second, 66% reported that they were short of cash for food, and 51% for medicines. This shows the urgent need to revive public systems of service delivery in health and nutrition. Third, 40% of the households surveyed reported that they had reduced food intake — the proportion is higher in Bihar (53%) and Jharkhand (48%). The cumulative impact of this economic insecurity is resulting in widespread mental health issues. Three quarters (73%) of households expressed fear and anxiety about the future,in the case of Dalits, this was 77%. Three fifths of households (63%) are worried about sustained income and support to the family. More than one third (36%) have disturbed sleeping patterns and 33% are without social interactions. The fiscal stimulus provided so far is only a fraction of what was announced. Some specific recommendations that emerge from analysing the survey results are the following. One, launch a massive programme to rehabilitate returnee migrants. A significant proportion of the migrant workers were women (18%) and children (26%) – the rest 56% were male migrants. Almost one third of the rural households surveyed had one or more migrant workers (5,257 out of 17,032). Four-fifths of these households (83%) reported that migrants had returned to villages. Surprisingly, only 7% of the returned migrants are currently engaged in MGNREGS work, 28% are working as casual labour, and two-fifths of the households have no gainful work. When will they go back to their destination states or cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Surat? The survey showed that only one per cent migrants have gone back to cities, 58% were hoping to return by November, and 42% were unsure when they would go back. There is now concrete evidence of the urban economy contracting. The government may not have any option other than to launch a massive programme of village entrepreneurship for returnee migrants. Second, allocate an additional Rs 50,000 crore for MGNREGS. A little less than one third of the households (31%) were engaged in MGNREGS over the last two months, which is a record, even as low participation is reported from Bihar (11%) and Jharkhand (15%). Households were engaged for 10 days a month on an average in the previous two months, with a variation of three to 14 days per month across states, which too is good news. However, it is alarming that 40% of households had not received full payment. There is going to be a huge surge in demand. Almost three-fourths of households (71%) want 15-plus days of MGNREGS work per month, from now on, for the next three months. As the demand for MGNREGS work is going to peak after the kharif season (October onwards), there is definitely a case for increased allocation to be made for the scheme. Third, extend the free ration scheme for six more months. The current effectiveness of the scheme is around 50%, which needs to be improved. Our survey results showed that in comparison to the Public Distribution System (PDS), the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes are far less effective. For example, only 63% women had Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY) accounts, out of which only 45% got Rs 1,500 ie Rs 500 three times. Four, revive and strengthen public systems of service delivery such as the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and the mid-day meal (MDM) programme along with pension schemes. The areas we are talking about are already those with very poor health and nutrition infrastructure and so if these systems are not revived and strengthened immediately, it will have long term consequences in terms of poor welfare outcomes.Five, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should give a directive to banks to extend a top-up loan of Rs 10,000 crore to Self-help Groups (SHGs), for they have once again emerged as a major support for rural households. Nearly one-fourth of households (22%) were seeking loans through SHGs or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs). Given the exemplary high repayment track record of SHGs, they should be a preferred option over individuals seeking loans from banks. According to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, there are 10 million SHGs, half of whom are linked to banks – five million SHGs with an outstanding of Rs 87,000 crore as on March 31,2019. If a top-up loan of Rs 20,000 per SHG at an average of Rs 2,000 per member, is extended to all these SHGs, it could go a long way in initiating livelihood activities at the SHG level. It is only if such measures are undertaken on a war-footing can Prime Minister Narendra Modi hope to win the vishwas (trust) of people in rural India.Binoy Acharya is founder, UnnatiVed Arya, convenor, RCRC Coalition, and director, Buddha Fellowship Program, SRIJANPratyaya Jagannath, research coordinator, RCRC Coalition, and managing director, KPS India Private LimitedPS Vijayshankar, co-founder, Samaj Pragati SahyogThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-to-reduce-food-job-insecurity-in-rural-areas/story-NFpJJLpKdaOBZskJHS7rqM.html
14-09-2020||News||India doesn’t have clear social distancing rules. Citizens must chip in||Compliance with social distancing guidelines is expected to decrease the spread, morbidity, and mortality related to any contagious disease. Social distancing, according to the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), is “a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease-causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community”. As per the unlock guidelines issued on August 29, based on the directive related to social distancing, individuals must maintain a distance of six feet in public spaces. While social distancing is a widely-used term, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization has promoted the term physical distancing over social distancing. According to her, physical distancing is “keeping the physical distance from people so that we can prevent the virus from transferring to one another”. A close examination of all the unlock guidelines show that the need to maintain six feet distance in public spaces, while being an extremely important directive, is directing people to maintain physical distancing rather than social distancing. On May 10, when the total number of cases in the United Kingdom (UK) was 219,183, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a conditional plan to reopen society. Accordingly, the public was allowed to enjoy parks and public spaces, and take unlimited outdoor exercise provided they were done only with members of the same household. Today when the doubling rate in the UK is 129 days, social distancing guidelines, among other things, suggest the following for people living in England: A maximum of six people can meet outdoors and indoors from multiple households; a household of more than six can gather in public or private, but not join members outside the household. While the physical distancing guidelines related to public spaces are well understood by people in India, adherence to the guidelines is another question. The guidelines on large public gatherings and congregations are clear — they are prohibited, as was observed during the Ganesh Charturthi and Moharram festivals. But, with the easing of restrictions and phased reopening, what social distancing rules are people to follow related to their movement to other households for, presumably, avoidable social interactions? One can argue that all are expected to wear masks and practise social distancing, but the definition of social distancing is six feet distance. A recent research study finds that silent transmission of Covid-19 during the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic stages was estimated to be responsible for more than half of the overall transmission. Pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients can transmit the infection, unaware they’re carrying the virus, by leaving their infected droplets on surfaces. Further, a team of researchers from Princeton University and the University of Montpellier, while calculating infection probability during casual conversations in a social setting (across the table over lunch or parties) found that in a poorly-ventilated space, the infection risk of speaking with a superspreader, without a mask, even for less than one minute, is high even with a three-metre separation. A caveat: This paper is yet to be peer-reviewed. So, in the absence of detailed-and-clear social distancing guidelines, can we not make our own citizen-formulated ones? Learning from other nations, can we not, for instance, say we will physically meet members from another household only for essential purposes, like care-giving, and forsake physical interaction for all other avoidable purposes? Access to technology has ensured we don’t get disconnected from our families and loved ones during the lockdown. Maybe our lives, for a few months more, will be dependent on mediated-technology. But aren’t we capable of these small sacrifices? For the numbers to come down, all of us must do our bit.

14-09-2020||News||For a meaningful monsoon session||The 18-day monsoon session, which starts today, will test the robustness of India’s parliamentary system. The government wants to get the legislature to sign off on 40 bills during the session. Its legislative agenda will put pressure on Parliament to pass several bills every day. And with the two Houses meeting in shifts, there will be limited time for discussions. The Lok Sabha can sit late into the evening. But the Rajya Sabha Members of Parliament (MPs) will have to finish their deliberations by lunch to make room for the Lok Sabha.There are no weekend breaks during the session, so the presiding officers, MPs and parliamentary staff are in for a physically gruelling time. MPs will also face the challenge of debating while being seated with their masks on. On the positive side, the session may see fewer disruptions with MPs spread across Parliament. On the other, discussions on audio and video links may reduce the liveliness of the proceedings.The session will begin on a sombre note. MPs will pay their tributes to former President, Pranab Mukherjee, who served five terms in the Rajya Sabha and was elected twice to the Lok Sabha. During his long parliamentary innings, he served as leader of both Houses and chaired several key committees. There will be a moment of silence in memory of three sitting Rajya Sabha MPs and one Lok Sabha MP H Vasanthakumar, who succumbed to Covid-19 last month. His last parliamentary intervention was to declare Covid-19 a national disaster. Parliamentary attention will then shift to the business at hand. In the Rajya Sabha, one of the first orders of business will be the election of the Deputy Chairman. The position fell vacant after Harivansh completed his term as MP earlier this year. He is now back in the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition is fielding Rashtriya Janta Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha against him. While Harivansh is expected to win easily due to depleted Opposition numbers, the election will be an early test of Opposition coordination in the session. In the Lok Sabha, the constitutional position of the Deputy Speaker has been vacant since last year, the longest in the history of Parliament. Opposition parties are demanding an election be held for this position.Since there is no Question Hour and a curtailed Zero Hour, Parliament’s focus will be on law-making. Government plans to pass 11 ordinances and 12 new bills. The presiding officers of the two Houses will have to decide on which bills to take up for debate and which should be examined by a parliamentary committee.The legislative focus will be on four broad areas: Agriculture, labour, health and finance.Four agriculture-related bills will up for discussion during the session. Two of these are ordinances that create a framework for contract farming and a politically-contentious one which allows farmers to sell their produce outside of mandis. Another one is restricting the use of stock limits on farm produce to periods of sharp price rise. And the last one is regulating pesticide usage. Then there are three labour-related bills which were being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. These bills are about the health and safety of workers, their social security and relations between them and their employers. The committee has submitted its report on these bills, clearing the way for their discussion in Parliament.In the health sector, first, there is an ordinance which provides punishment for harming health care workers who are performing their duties during the pandemic. Then there is a bill which prohibits commercial surrogacy that was passed by the Lok Sabha last year. A select committee of the Rajya Sabha gave its recommendations on this legal measure, and it will again come up for discussion before the Upper House. The government is also planning to get parliamentary approval for a bill regulating assisted reproductive technology. Another legislative proposal on the Rajya Sabha’s list is about extending the time limit for terminating pregnancies. During the inter-session period, the government promulgated three ordinances related to finance. The first one extends the time limit for compliances under taxation and other laws. The second provides companies protection from bankruptcy proceedings. And the third brings the management, audit and winding up of co-operative banks under the control of Reserve Bank of India. The government will also be discussing its additional budgetary requirements during the session.While legislative business will be a priority, other items on the agenda for Parliament will be to discuss the government’s handling of Covid-19, the border dispute with China, the plight of migrant labour and the country’s economic situation. The cyclone in Odisha and West Bengal and the floods in different parts of the country are other issues that may come up.The number of bills passed in the session will not be the only measure of its success. The spirit in which the government engages in the parliamentary debate will also be reflective of it. Will it only be defensive of its actions or be open to suggestions and criticism? Will the Opposition play the role of an alternative executive by recommending better ideas, or merely be adversarial? And finally, Parliament’s rigour in scrutinising the government’s legislative proposals will determine the strength of India’s parliamentary system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/for-a-meaningful-monsoon-session/story-NunEesGCrGwsQQi8Lf8DOP.html
14-09-2020||City||Documentary-maker couple questioned by special cell||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Monday questioned documentary filmmaker couple Saba Dewan and Rahul Roy in connection with the Delhi riots, a day after former JNU student Umar Khalid was arrested on charges of allegedly conspiring to trigger violence in north-east Delhi this February. According to a senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified, the couple was sent summons on Sunday to join the probe and they visited the Lodhi Colony office of the Delhi Police’s special cell for questioning. “Saba Dewan and Rahul Roy have been served notice to join investigation,” was the only official statement released by the police. “We are questioning them about their role in the riots, and about whatever else they maybe aware of,” said the officer. Over a dozen people, including Delhi University professor Apoorvanand, have already been questioned in connection with the riots. Apoorvanand had denied allegations of involvement in the Delhi riots. Neither Dewan, nor Roy, responded to HT’s phone calls and text messages seeking their response. Delhi police claimed that investigation showed that the couple was part of a WhatsApp group, Delhi Protest Support Group, which was formed in December to “plan the anti-CAA protests”. Dewan and Roy have been involved in making several documentary films, particularly on the issue of gender justice. Roy’s name was mentioned in an attachment in one of the riots-related charge sheet submitted by police in a Delhi court last year. The attachment had an alleged disclosure statement by an accused, Devangana Kalita claiming that a host of prominent personalities, including Roy, had instigated the protesters. Police had attached her statement (Kalita had refused to sign this statement), in the charge sheet. A disclosure statement made before the police is not an admissible evidence in court. Others, alleged members of the WhatsApp group, who feature in a statement purportedly given by another accused Gulfisha Khatoon were general secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist), Sitaram Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan founder Yogendra Yadav, Apoorvanand, and advocate Mahmood Pracha. All of them have criticised Delhi police for dragging their names at the instance of BJP-led Central government to muzzle dissenting voices. The uproar over these names mentioned in the charge sheet had prompted the Delhi Police to issue a statement that these people were not charge sheeted and that their “names were mentioned in the disclosure statement of one of the accused, which was recorded truthfully”. As for Dewan, it is the first time that her name has appeared in the ongoing probe in the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/documentary-maker-couple-questioned-by-special-cell/story-aFAHANLOJ1JZh7450TAx1H.html
14-09-2020||Chandigarh||CAG report: HP fiscal deficit down by 9.2% in 2018-19||Himachal Pradesh’s fiscal deficit decreased by 9.2% in 2018-2019 financial year, as per the comptroller and auditor general’s (CAG’s) report tabled in the state assembly on Monday. The deficit, which stood at ₹3,870 crore in 2017-18, dropped to ₹3,512 crore , logging a decrease of ₹358 crore. Fiscal deficit, in very broad terms, is the amount an entity has to take as loan. In general, the lower it is, the better it is. The capital expenditure (₹4,583 crore) increased by 22% (₹827 crore) over previous year’s ₹3,756 crore. The share of capital expenditure to total expenditure increased from 12% in 2017-18 to 29% in 2018-19. The primary fiscal deficit of ₹82 crore in 2017-18 was offset by a primary surplus of ₹ 510 crore in 2018-19. In the same duration, the state’s revenue receipts (₹30,950 crore) increased by 13% over the previous year’s ₹27,367 crore.Only 33% of the revenue receipts came from the state’s own resources comprising taxes and non-taxes. Central transfers comprising the state’s share in central taxes and duties (18%) and grants-in-aid from the Union government (49%) brought in the remaining 67%. The CAG report says the total expenditure, ₹34,493 crore, increased by 10% (₹3,181 crore) and revenue constituted 85.3% of the total expenditure. The total expenditure on four components — salary and wages, pension liabilities, interest payments and subsidies — formed 73% of the revenue expenditure.Overall fiscal liabilities at the end of the year 2018-19 were ₹54,299 crore with a growth of 6.4% over the previous year. Fiscal liabilities were 36% of GSDP and 1.75 times the revenue receipts.PUBLIC DEBT INCREASESThe total public debt increased from ₹25,729 crore in 2014-15 to ₹36,425 crore in 2018-19 registering annual average growth rate of 9.6%. The share of market borrowings in total public debt went up from 59%. During 2018-19, the total public debt increased 5% over previous year.In the next ten years, of total outstanding market loans and Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bonds of ₹26,573 crore, the state has to repay the principal of market loans and UDAY bonds of ₹ 25,005 crore (94.1%) and interest amounting to ₹12,521 crore.Revenue surplus (the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure) increased from ₹314 crore in 2017-18 to ₹1,508 crore in 2018-19. During 2018-19, an expenditure of Rs 42,46,910 crore (90.4% was incurred against total grants and appropriation of Rs 46,98,468 crore. Overall savings of Rs 24,51,558 crore were the result of savings of Rs 5,33,695 crore minus excess expenditure of Rs 821.3 crore in various grants/appropriations, which, in addition to excess expenditure of Rs 8,33,335 crore from 2013-14 to 2017-18 required regularisation of the State Legislature under Article 205 of the Constitution of India.The CAG reports further points out of 5,758 Utilisation Certificates (UCs) due in respect of grants aggregating ₹5,128.42 crore, 2,407 UCs aggregating ₹1,898.8 crore were pending as of March 2019.High pendency of UCs is fraught with risk of misappropriation of funds and fraud and state government must ensure timely submission of utilisation certificates in respect of grants released to grantee institutions, and may also review whether grants should continue to be given to grantees with high pendency in submission of UCc, the report states.It points out that of 14 autonomous bodies, only three had submitted accounts for 2018-19. The state government reported 44 cases of misappropriation, loss or theft of government money amounting to ₹94 lakh up to March 2019, on which final action was still pending. Forty-one of 44 cases have been pending for over five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cag-report-hp-fiscal-deficit-down-by-9-2-in-2018-19/story-UOKTNV2D3UQH97vKRskhDL.html

He operated bus services for essential care workers and passengers after the state government resumed services in the city on June 8. “I would go to work with my mask and gloves, and would use them throughout my eight-hour shift,” he said.However, on June 20, Paikade woke up with a fever and body pain that persisted even after taking medication from his family doctor. Fearing he had contracted the coronavirus, Paikade approached a government hospital in Mulund as his symptoms persisted. His reports came positive, and he soon started having difficulty breathing.He informed his son who is studying medicine in New Delhi. His son then informed senior BEST officials who rushed Paikade to the Covid isolation facility at SevenHills Hospital in Andheri.“The minute I reached SevenHills Hospital, the doctor hooked me up with oxygen as I was completely out of breath. I do not remember anything much after that. I remember the doctor saying mine is a critical case. I was put on a ventilator for 17 days,” he recalled.Paikade’s wife had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was kept at a quarantine centre where she recovered. His children reside outside the city.“It was very lonely and emotionally draining. I had prepared for anything, but my family gave me strength. My son is studying medicine which is why I was positive after speaking to him,” said Paikade.Senior BEST officials have lauded his courage and said that his positive outlook has motivated others. “He has been positive and courageous. Despite spending 65 days in hospital and on ventilator, he has encouraged other BEST employees to work through the pandemic,” said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade.Paikade is yet to recover completely and has difficulty breathing while climbing stairs.When asked about resuming work, he said he is planning to take some time off to heal. “I will have to recover fully and will then decide. The doctor has told me it will take eight months to fully recover, but I am positive. I step outside only to get medicines or for any important work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/best-driver-who-ferried-mumbai-s-essential-workers-spent-65-days-in-hospital-battling-covid-19/story-QEOVKISRCODgRxaptmHkJL.html
14-09-2020||City||Virus scare keeps many away from DU’s open-book exams||New Delhi: With Delhi University kick-starting the second phase of the open book examination (OBE) for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, scores of candidates reached the exam centres on Monday with their own answer sheets, mobile phones, and face masks. Students were screened thermally before being allowed into the exam halls. At the Shaheed Rajguru College in Vasundhara Enclave, students were asked to stand in painted circles outside the college premises to ensure social distancing.Guniganti Bindu, a student from School of Open Learning who also works in the jewellery sector, said, “We carried our own answer sheets as per the guidelines put in place due to Covid-19 crisis. At the centre, we were asked to sanitise our hands. We were a bit nervous but the examination was conducted smoothly.”However, officials said not all registered students appeared for the exams in offline mode. DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “We are yet to collect data from the examination centres and also find out how many students appeared in the online exams. The final statistics would be available on Tuesday. We are getting reports that not all of those who registered for offline exams turned up at the centres. This could be because a majority of them are SOL students. Even generally, there is a trend that of the registered students, only 50-60% SOL students appear for their papers.”Of the 12,000 students, who have registered to appear in the exams (OBE), only 3,000 had opted for offline mode. Unlike the first phase of the OBE exams conducted between 10-31 August, students this time were given the choice to either appear for the exam online or visit the university’s examination centres to take the tests. Due to the low number of students opting for physical or offline exams, the varsity selected a handful of colleges as examination centres for SOL students, including Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, Deen Dyal Upadhayay (DDU) College, Deshbandhu College, Shaheed Bhagat Singh College and Shyama Prasad Mukherji College for Women (Girls), along with three other centres.Hem Chand Jain, officiating principal of DDU College, said, “While the university has allotted us 450 students, we had around 12 students who visited the campus for the paper. Around 200 students will be appearing for their papers in the evening shift on Tuesday. Our security officials will ensure that there is no crowding at these centres.”Jain added that the college staff will be conducting thermal scanning and check Aarogya Setu application. “Masks are mandatory for students while invigilators have also been provided gloves and face masks,” he said.Not all colleges held physical exams on Monday. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “Eight of our students who were scheduled to appear for their paper today had opted for the online mode of exams. We have a candidate who will be appearing for exam tomorrow on campus. We have made all arrangements to assist the student.”Ramjatan Yadav, an undergraduate student who hails from Sultanpur and is currently in Delhi, said, “I had already put myself at risk by travelling to Dwarka and appearing for the postgraduate entrance exams (Delhi University Entrance Test) last week. So, I opted for the online mode of exams for my final-year papers.”The visually-impaired student said he did not appear for the first phase of OBE exams as he was not able to gather enough accessible reading material. “I was able to arrange for reading material by the time of the second phase of exams. However, appearing for the papers is still a challenge since getting a scribe was risky. So I had to read all resources, process it, and then type my answers online. It is a new process and hence time-consuming. There is an uncertainty over how this will affect my performance,” he said, while writing his papers at his local guardian’s home in Sangam Vihar.The exams – which will continue till October 1 – are being conducted in two three-hour shifts beginning at 9 am and 3 pm respectively.

Police said Sanjay is a distant cousin of pimp Sonu Punjaban, aka Geeta Arora, who was first arrested in 2007 in Delhi for human trafficking and running a major call girl racket. According to Noida police, the suspects would allegedly lure customers on the pretext of providing women for spa services at home.“They would take the women with them in a car and meet prospective clients at a pre-decided location, where they would take the money from them in advance through e-wallets. Then they would demand an additional amount for a security charge. If the victims refused, they would assault them and take the money or their valuables forcefully and then flee the spot,” said Anil Kumar, station house officer, Sector 58 police station.He said most victims do not inform the authorities about these incidents but one Noida-based man had filed an FIR at the Sector 58 police station on Sunday after he was robbed of ₹3,000 in cash in a similar manner on September 2. He had alleged that the suspects had also taken ₹5,500 from him via an online transaction. A case under sections 420, 392 and 504 was registered against the suspects.“They were nabbed around 3am from near the small D-park where they were travelling in a Santro car, which was then seized. Two phones used in the case and the stolen money were also recovered. They confessed to the crime and we also have the transaction history of the e-wallet,” said the SHO.Police said Punjaban was convicted and is currently serving time in Delhi’s Tihar jail and the majority of the operation was being run allegedly by Bhatia in Delhi-NCR. Police have identified 23 cases against him.“We are now on the lookout for the women who were helping them and other members of the gang working in this area,” said Kumar.Police added that Bhatia would allegedly take a majority of the money retrieved from customers who suspect them to be involved in several more cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-of-sonu-punjaban-gang-held-for-swindling-spa-customers-in-ncr/story-sE942WwiKsltimCmXccAAP.html

14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers on warpath, Khattar govt on backfoot||The knee-jerk reaction to farmers’ rally in Kurukshtera --- where peasants protesting against Centre’s agriculture ordinances were lathicharged --- has put the BJP-JJP government in Haryana on the backfoot. A major farmers’ movement has started gaining momentum in the state and protesters have announced to block all roads in Haryana on September 20, followed by a statewide yatra from September 27. The current scenario has fired up the principal opposition party -- the Congress – that is looking to corner the government over this sensitive issue. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), on the other hand, is also preparing to cash in on this anti-government sentiment of farmers. The BJP has been struggling to convince the protesting peasants that their apprehensions about the Centre’s three ordinances are unfounded. Political observers say one of the key reasons behind the BJP’s worry is that a majority of farmers hail from the dominant Jat community that has been at loggerheads with the party since it came to power in October 2014. The Jats had hit the BJP hard in October 2019 assembly elections. The saffron party (with 40 seats) was six MLAs short to cross the magical mark and therefore formed the government in an alliance with the Jannayak Janta Party having 10 MLAs. The JJP has been keeping the BJP on the edge on this issue. Dhankar-led delegation to meet Tomar todayOn Tuesday, state BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar will lead a party delegation that will meet Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar to hand over a report containing feedback of the agitating farmers against the farm ordinances. Dhankar had set up a three-member panel to look into the grievances of the farmers. The committee, comprising Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini and Hisar MP Brijendra Singh, held marathon meetings with farmers and traders on Saturday and Sunday. The panel handed over report to Dhankar in New Delhi on Monday. “An atmosphere of fear is being created...rumours are being spread that MSP will cease to exist and the grain markets will be shut,” Dhankar told HT. JJP asks BJP to clear farmers’ doubtsThe JJP, which draws its political muscle mainly from farmers, has been nudging the BJP to clear the misgivings of the farmers. The party has also been keeping the BJP on tenterhooks by giving conflicting statements regarding the three ordinances. JJP state president Nishan Singh says those in authority must give an unequivocal assurance backed with proof to the farmers that the Centre will not stop foodgrain procurement under MSP. He said MSP gives security to farmers and the JJP wants this to continue. “We are with the farmers on this issue. The government must apply brakes on the attempts being made to mislead the farmers. The earlier it is done, the better it will be,” he said. The JJP statement assumes significance as the farmers are mobilising support against the ordinances. The BJP, on its part, doesn’t want the protest to snowball into a major unrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-on-warpath-khattar-govt-on-backfoot/story-A8cqnFB5oLnMWCY6nsxwqM.html
14-09-2020||City||Sharp shooter arrested for the contract killing of 26-year-old in Modinagar||The police Monday arrested a sharp shooter who was allegedly hired to kill 26-year-old Akshay Sangwan on the night of August 24 outside his house on Tibra Road, Modinagar. Sangwan’s family has also accused the husband of the local MLA of criminal conspiracy in the case, but the police said he had no role in the incident and that the murder was allegedly planned by a woman whose brother Sangwan was accused of killing in 2019. The suspect who was arrested Monday from the area near Niwari Road was identified as Ujjwal Sharma. Police said he took ₹50,000 for carrying out the hit on Sangwan. The police also added that one of Sharma’s accomplices is on the run and will be arrested soon. According to the police investigation, Sangwan had several cases against him and had been in jail for killing his friend, Dipendra Kumar, in April 2019. Sangwan had come out on bail last November. “The murder was planned by Kumar’s sister Ruby Singh and her husband Vikas Singh who wanted to avenge Kumar’s killing. They planned the murder with the help of their accomplice Ashwini Singh and Anurag Tyagi and hired two men, one of whom was arrested on Monday. Our teams combed through a jungle area for about four days to find Sharma’s hideout and arrest him. He was nabbed while he trying to flee,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). Sangwan was gunned down outside his house on the evening of August 24. The police had said that one of the suspects, Anurag Tyagi, sustained an accidental gunshot wound during the incident and had died a day later at a Meerut hospital. Police said Ashwini had surrendered before a court in Ghaziabad on August 28 and Ruby Singh was arrested last week. “Both Vikas Singh (Ruby’s husband) and another accomplice Sappu Gurjar had come out on bail in connection with a case of Arms Act registered against them in Delhi. As per their the plan, they returned to jail on August 18, days before the killing was to be executed on August 24. But their role has emerged during’s Ashwini’s questioning . In all, we have about three more suspects, who are on the run, to arrest,” Jadaun said. The police are yet to seize an i10 car which was used in the crime. They suspect that the car is still with the suspects who are on the run. “So far, no role of the MLA’s made has been made out in the case. The murder plan was hatched by Ruby and her husband. They took the help of two shooters and roped in other accomplices. The suspects who are absconding will be arrested soon,” Jadaun said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sharp-shooter-arrested-for-the-contract-killing-of-26-year-old-in-modinagar/story-O9LHTUT0F8kJOmH7nyGswM.html

As they spotted Rohit with a knife in his hand, they asked him why he needed one. This led to an argument that soon got out of hand. Rohit stabbed Ashish multiple times. When Sahil tried to intervene, Rohit stabbed him in the leg. Sahil, who was also carrying a knife, then stabbed Rohit and fled the spot,” the officer said.Purohit said he formed teams to search for Sahil and he was arrested before he could flee the neighbourhood. “He was booked for Rohit’s murder,” the DCP said.As the incident took place near Rohit’s house, hearing the commotion, Rohit’s mother Meena rushed out to see her son being attacked.

14-09-2020||City||Three men on motorcycle crushed by car on Eastern Peripheral Expressway||Three men lost their lives to a road accident late Sunday on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) near Muradnagar they were crushed under a vehicle. The police said they have arrested the driver and also seized the car allegedly involved in the accident.The three victims were identified as Karamvir Singh, 18, Deepak Sharma, 20 and Priyanshu Tyagi, 19. Karamvir and Deepak are residents of Rewri Rewda village while Tyagi was a resident of Saithli village. The three friends, after their schooling, were preparing to give the Delhi police’s recruitment drive a shot and used to run and do other physical activities to prepare for the competitive exam.“The three friends were on a motorcycle and were going to drop Priyanshu to his house. Midway, they took to the EPE and stopped in between when one of them received a call on his mobile. While they were standing on one side of the expressway, they were crushed by a car. Locals rushed them to a hospital but they could not survive. On a complaint given by their families, we have registered an FIR against the car driver,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).“We sent the bodies for post mortem,” he added. The police identified the suspect car driver as Surya Kumar, who is stated to be resident of Patel Nagar in Ghaziabad and was allegedly driving his Sierra car at the time. According to the hospital, the victims were brought dead. “The three victims were brought to the hospital in an injured state but they were brought dead,” said Dr Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital at Nehru Nagar.According to the family of the victims, the three had been preparing daily so as to crack the Delhi police’s entrance tests. “They often engaged in long distance running and other activities as they had planned to join the Delhi police. On the night of the incident, Priyanshu had got late. So, the other two decided to drop him home. They set out on a motorcycle but met with the accident on the expressway. We have given a police complaint in connection with the incident,” said Uday Vir Singh, Karamvir’s uncle. Officers from Muradnagar police station said the suspect allegedly told them that he was trying to evade a truck in front of him and could not spot the three victims who were standing on the expressway.The officials of the National Highways Authority of India, the agency which completed the EPE project, said that two-wheelers are not allowed on the expressway stretch.“The EPE is only for cars and other commercial vehicles and two-wheelers are not allowed on the expressway. However, it is difficult to contain the local population as denying their two-wheelers access often leads to confrontation; driving two-wheelers often leads to accidents. The EPE is a high-speed expressway on which cars are allowed to reach 120kmph while commercial vehicles have a speed limit of 100kmph,” said an officer from the authority, who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-men-on-motorcycle-crushed-by-car-on-eastern-peripheral-expressway/story-sgRLozUsi0hIJ1Frmf0HUK.html
14-09-2020||Noida||Stop strike or face dismissals, Noida authority warns sanitation workers||The Noida authority has warned striking contractual workers that they may face dismissals if they don’t return to work immediately and submit their attendance through smart phone application FaceApp.A section of contractual workers are on strike since September 1, when the authority started recording their attendance via the app, the authority officials said.The employees had stopped work in protest as they do not want their attendance to be recorded via the app.“Most of the sanitation employees fear that if they record their attendance via FaceApp, then the authority may soon put them out of their jobs. Some employee leaders have created this perception in the minds of the workers and we are anxious about using this app. The authority must communicate with us properly on this issue,” said Brij Bhooshan a contractual employee.According to the authority, only 30% of the around 4,000 contractual employees engaged in sanitation work across the city are recording their attendance via FaceApp at present. The remaining workers are either not reporting to work in protest or are not recording their attendance on the app.“Instead of giving us permanent jobs, the authority wants to render us jobless and that is why they are using new methods to harass us,” said a sweeper, requesting anonymity.However, employees themselves are divided over using the app and not all are in support of the strike. Shiv Kumar, a contractual employee, said, “Those who are protesting want to take salary without working the mandated 10 hours. If they record their attendance via the app, and the time stamp doesn’t show 10 hours, then they may face salary cuts. What is the harm in filing attendance?” The authority started sing FaceApp for attendance to ensure that all employees mark their attendance daily, and work he stipulated 10 hours.“A worker has to log in on the app in the morning with the help of a login number and password. The app takes their picture so that we know who are at work and who are not. In manual attendance, there was a possibility of irregularities,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority.The authority pays a monthly salary of ₹12,000-16,000 to each employee, who are on the payroll of a private agency. Due to the strike the sanitation work has been hit across the city.“We are taking help of a new agency to tide over the crisis. We have asked the private agency to remove those who are on strike. We will remove all of them who will not return to work and follow the attendance protocols,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stop-strike-or-face-dismissals-noida-authority-warns-sanitation-workers/story-yPLX1porzluCpnBHXMELwK.html

14-09-2020||City||Residents, village heads demand government college in Dadri||Residents of Haryana’s Dadri have been waiting for the state government to establish a government college at the district headquarters since last four years.Dadri has only four colleges—three in rural areas and the government aided Janta College at the district headquarters. The Janata College at the district headquarters was established in 1965 and since then no government college has been set up there.Now, over 36 village heads in Dadri have demanded establishment of a government college at the district headquarters. They have also sent memorandums in this regard to Dadri deputy commissioner Shiv Prasad. Narender Dudi, sarpanch of Fatehgarh village, said over 5,000 students from the district will have to migrate to other cities like Bhiwani, Rohtak and Hisar since there is only one college at the district headquarters, which too, does not have honours course in graduation and post-graduation.“The Janta college does not provide even sociology in the bachelor of arts degree. We have been demanding a government college at district headquarters,” he added.Sunil Kumar, sarpanch of Ranila village said, “The Janata College was established when Dadri had a population of 15,000 only and now it has crossed 90,000. Still, no new college has been opened here.”“The government has discriminated with our district and we are yet to get a full-fledged college. Many parents prefer to get their daughters married instead of sending them to other districts due to financial crunch. We have sent a memorandum in this regard to Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan and administrative officials,” he added.Senior Congress leader and former MLA Ran Singh Mann said, “The government has been claiming to set up medical colleges at all district headquarters. However, people have been struggling to get a government college which has all graduation and post-graduation courses.”Dadri deputy commissioner Shiv Prasad said he has received memorandums from many panchayat heads and residents demanding a government college at the district headquarters. “I have forwarded these memorandums to concerned officials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-village-heads-demand-government-college-in-dadri/story-MOa4O0L4agVWlSVotHvwSL.html
14-09-2020||City||UP govt clarifies charges under paid Covid treatment, private hospitals told to comply||The Ghaziabad administration Monday directed private hospitals providing paid Covid treatment to comply with a recent order of the Uttar Pradesh government, clarifying the services/facilities that are to be included/excluded from treatment charges fixed by the government.On July 10, the government had capped Covid treatment charges at private hospitals in accordance with the recommendations of a committee headed by Dr VK Paul, professor member of Niti Aayog. The July 10 order had grouped patients under the heads of ‘moderate sickness’, ‘severe sickness’ and ‘very severe sickness’ and the rates were applicable to all hospitals, both accredited by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) and not. However, the July 10 order did not specify the different treatments that were to be included or excluded from the government rates and that had led to patient complaints of hospitals overcharging. To sort out the issues, state health secretary Amit Mohan Prasad Prasad on September 10 revised the order fixing charges for specific treatments and the ones that were included in the government rates. The revised order states that the charge for an isolation bed for ‘moderate sickness’ will be ₹10,000 a day (NABH-accredited) and ₹8,000 a day (non-accredited). The treatment will include oxygen and other essentials. The charge for an ICU bed (without ventilator) will be ₹15,000 a day (NABH-accredited) and ₹13,000 (non-accredited). An ICU bed with ventilator will cost ₹18,000 a day (NABH-accredited) and ₹15,000 (non-accredited). The order says the charges will include invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The revised order said all charges are inclusive of facilities in the form of a package. “This package includes bed, food and facilities like nursing care, monitoring, imaging and other investigations, and doctors’ consultations. The package also includes treatment of patients with co-morbidity and requiring short-term hemodialysis,” the order said. It further said high value medicines such as remdesivir and tests such as RT-PCR and IL-6 are not part of the package. The package rates are also applicable for paediatric patients. It also clarified that charges for normal delivery or C-section and treatment of newborn will be as per the rates of the Ayushman Bharat Yojna (a patient need not pay them). “On Monday, we provided private hospitals and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) with a copy of the new order and urged them to comply. Hospitals have been asked to put up the rates on their websites and also to display them prominently within their premises,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said he has formed a committee to take up patient complaints in case they are charged more. “The committee will inquire into the complaint and take appropriate action. In case of non-compliance, the erring hospital may face action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The new order will be applicable from the date of issue,” Gupta said. Dr VB Jindal, president of IMA, Ghaziabad, said, “The rates are higher when compared to those of Ayushman Yojna. So, hospitals will have better viability and will also put an end to the prevailing confusion,” he said.“The new order will be helpful.. We are already charging as per the prescribed rates,” Dr Mahesh Chaudhary, director (operations), Navin Hospital i Vaishali, said. Spokesperson of Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, said, “We have already implemented the order. We have L2 and L3 care facility and package rates are already applicable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-clarifies-charges-under-paid-covid-treatment-private-hospitals-told-to-comply/story-gsYot6mqj4Kn8GW2l2A3pO.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA extends permissions for building construction in areas of Mumbai till December||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has issued a circular extending the validity for various development permissions granted for building construction in areas under its special planning authority (SPA). This follows a similar extension offered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation‘s (BMC) in April. In a circular issued on September 10, metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev ruled that the validity of all permissions, no-objection certificates or commencement certificates that expired on or after March 25 will automatically be extended for another nine months, till December. HT has accessed a copy of the order. “In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, by considering ‘force majeure’ situation, the ministry of housing and urban affairs had issued an advisory to extend the validity of various kinds of approval,” the circular states. Rajeev said, “By extending the validity of permissions, we are hoping to provide some relief to the real estate industry, which is already facing many problems owing to the pandemic.” According to the circular, MMRDA received several requests from stakeholders including CREDAI-MCHI, an apex body consisting of members from the real estate industry in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The document further states no penalty will be charged while granting renewals or revalidations during this period. MMRDA is SPA for several areas within and outside Mumbai, including Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Wadala notified area; Oshiwara district; the Backbay reclamation scheme; Ambernath Kulgaon-Badlapur and surrounding area; 27 villages in Kalyan and Bhiwandi notified area, among others. According to estimates, the development potential in the Wadala notified area alone is worth ₹35,000 crore. Representatives from the real estate industry applauded the move. Mumbai-based architect Vilas Nagalkar said, “It is a good gesture from the state agencies as it would have been difficult to undertake the procedures in a lockdown.” In April 2020, BMC had ruled that the validity of all intimations of disapproval (IODs) expiring between March and June this year has been extended till September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-extends-permissions-for-building-construction-in-areas-of-mumbai-till-december/story-IsqcibgSbZAZf5MbH5hzzH.html

In the event of a positive report, the passenger will be transferred by state authorities to a designated institution,” said a spokesperson for MIAL.The spokesperson said that passengers departing from Mumbai will soon be able to undergo the RT-PCR test at CSMIA and have their reports emailed to them. As per an earlier initiative, all international arriving passengers could choose to be exempted from institutional quarantine by filling an online self-declaration form as well as uploading the results of an RT-PCR test undertaken within 96 hours before take-off. International arriving passengers leaving from Mumbai airport were allowed to display the results of the RT-PCR test to opt-out of institutional quarantine and instead observe a 14-day home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-csmia-sets-up-24x7-covid-19-testing-facility-for-international-passengers/story-UwPBfjZPjeI1iOwsLSbnNJ.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||70% rise in Mumbai’s pollution levels during first week of September||The drop in rainfall during the first week of September led to a sharp spike in the city’s air pollution levels, much before the end of the monsoon. Mumbai witnessed a 70% rise in particulate matter PM2.5 levels in Mumbai during the first week of September as compared to PM2.5 levels throughout monsoon and during the four phases of the Covid-19 lockdown, an analysis from January to September by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based air quality research group, revealed.The study showed Vile Parle, Andheri, Kurla, Sion and Worli were the five most polluted areas in Mumbai during the first week of September.The air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke and they are hazardous. Of this, PM 2.5 is smaller, with a diameter not more than 2.5 micrometres. These are fine particles that can stay in the air for days or weeks and are small enough to invade the narrowest of lung airways. According to CEEW’s analysis, the study period over nine months was divided into three phases — pre lockdown (January 1 to March 24), lockdown (March 25 - May 31) and monsoon or post lockdown (June 1 to September 10). The assessment, using data averages from 10 continuous air quality monitoring stations in Mumbai under the state pollution control board, showed: highest PM2.5 concentration for pre-lockdown was recorded on January 2 at 107.1 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), 33 μg/m³ was the highest for the four phases of the lockdown on May 16 while 53.3 μg/m³ was recorded on September 6, the highest during the post lockdown phase so far. The study also identified the cleanest air days with 16 μg/m³ on March 11 (for pre-lockdown), 7.1 μg/m³ on May 29 (lockdown), and 4.8 μg/m³ on June 30 (during monsoon). The 24-hour safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 μg/m³.“Mumbai has been experiencing good air quality for the past few months owing to monsoon and lockdown restrictions. With decreased rain during September first, air quality started worsening in the city. On September 6, readings showed a sharp spike in PM 2.5 levels, which was 70% higher than the PM2.5 levels during the entire lockdown and monsoon period,” said LS Kurinji, research analyst, CEEW, adding, “With the resumption of industries, constructions and other economic activities due to lockdown relaxations, anthropogenic (human-induced) emissions will soon worsen air quality. The city should start actively addressing its pollution sources to counter rising PM 2.5 levels.”Independent experts said the lockdown and weather impacts are temporary factors for air quality improvement. “Cities like Mumbai have been working on their respective National Clean Air Program (NCAP) action plans, but there hasn’t been major emission reduction on ground yet. Current interventions are disaggregated with multiple state departments involved in different activities compromising accountability,” said Polash Mukherjee, lead (air pollution) Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) India.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said as identified under the NCAP for Mumbai’s action plan, if two sources — vehicular pollution and re-suspended dust — are addressed, Mumbai would see much cleaner air as far as particulate pollution is concerned.“While the Covid-19 associated lockdown did throw our usual lives out of gear, one silver lining was the reduction in air pollution. However, as restrictions have been eased, the rise in emissions will be visible,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB adding, “For vehicles, the move towards Bharat Stage VI will help us remove not only nitrogen oxide, but PM. The issue of legacy vehicles remain, and we need to tackle that. Secondly, the use of water sprinklers, vacuum sweeping, having more green spaces, paving of roads as mandates issued to the civic body to arrest re-suspended dust. Work on this is going on and it should show results soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/70-rise-in-mumbai-s-pollution-levels-during-first-week-of-september/story-0S6ed3DWuuPTXHQeV0J4cP.html
14-09-2020||City||Yamuna pollution: Haryana told to expedite work on sewage plants||New Delhi:The NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has told the Haryana government to “expedite” its pending projects related to the construction and upgrade of effluent and sewage treatment plants as untreated or partially treated industrial effluents and domestic sewage are flowing into the Yamuna and adding to its pollution. The Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC), in a review meeting of the Yamuna Action Plan held via video conferencing last week, told senior Haryana officials to “compress the timelines of the said projects” and find alternative ways to reduce the toxic discharge from entering the Yamuna. “Though substantial progress had been made in decision making connected with the construction of STPs/CETPs, the timelines of awarding of work and construction need to be compressed. Temporary alternatives be found to make a substantial difference to the huge pollution entering the river Yamuna,” the YMC stated in the minutes of the meeting drafted on September 10. The two-member YMC comprises former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra and former NGT expert member BS Sajwan. The committee said of the 14 existing CETPs, 11 are either not functioning because of design fault or are not functioning to capacity and need to be upgraded. “Presently, 521 MLD (million litres per day) untreated effluent is being discharged into the Yamuna from different towns of Haryana. This is huge and there has been no reduction over the last two years,” it said. During the Covid lockdown, there was no discharge as industries were shut, which was one of the major reasons for a cleaner Yamuna during that time. Now with the gradual opening of industries in Haryana, the drains are again carrying high levels of untreated effluents that finally go into the river, adding to its pollution load. The Yamuna flows for 54 km in Delhi between Palla in north and Badarpur in south, of which the 22-km stretch downstream of the Wazirabad barrage to Okhla barrage is the most polluted. The committee said work on 30 new STPs in several towns has been much delayed. Major cities like Faridabad do not have functional STPs. Besides, the laying of sewerage network in major cities has been delayed by almost a year and hence untreated sewage is being discharged into the drains. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Haryana Yamuna Monitoring Committee (HYMC) reports showed BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) levels continue to remain high and way above permissible limits in major Haryana drains. BOD is the amount of oxygen used by microorganisms in the oxidation of organic matter. COD refers to the total amount of organic and inorganic chemicals in waste water. High levels of BOD and COD in waste water indicate untreated sewage and effluents. The YMC said the increasing pollution load in the Yamuna is caused by mixing of discharge from Haryana’s drain no.6 and a channel carrying effluents from the Kundli CETP into drain no. 8 at Sonepat. “This mixing of discharge is affecting the water treatment plant in Delhi’s Wazirabad, because of which potable drinking water is polluted and the plant needs to be shut down at times,” the committee said. S Naryanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said some projects had been delayed because of Covid and financial constraints. “Most work regarding the construction of STPs and CETPs are in the pipeline and will be completed soon. Some alternative measures such as bio-remediation are being experimented in Gurugram and based on the results, will be extended to other cities. We will submit a status report to the state government on the projects this week,” said Naryanan. PKMK Das, member, Haryana Yamuna Monitoring Committee, said nine new CETPs are being constructed in towns such as Panipat, Sonepat and Kundli. “The new CETPs will help in better treatment of effluents while the existing ones are being upgraded both in terms of design and capacity. A proposal to construct two conduit carriages has been approved to fix the mixing of discharge in drains that are affecting the Wazirabad plant in Delhi,” Das said. Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said discharge of untreated industrial effluents from Haryana is a major contributor to pollution in the Yamuna. “Haryana, which is upstream of Delhi, covers the city from three sides (North, West and South) and hence effluents from its drains, for instance, drain no. 2 in Panipat, flow directly into the Yamuna. The government needs to bring in stringent measures to curb untreated discharge,” said Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yamuna-pollution-haryana-told-to-expedite-work-on-sewage-plants/story-mJDDBdUHL5PLzRsW9GfkeO.html

The party’s supporters were protesting against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, the self-styled legal advisor of the USA-based Sikhs for Justice, accusing him of instigating the youths and farmers of Punjab. Pannu had reportedly asked people to stop trains on Sunday, however, the call received no response. But the Shiv Sena supporters gathered near the Clock Tower around afternoon and started marching towards Gate Number 2 of the railway station, holding Tricolours in their hand. Assistant sub-inspector Kuldeep Singh, who is investigating the case, said the Sena supporters flouted social distancing norms and staged a protest despite a ban on gathering of five or more people.

This was confusing,” Singla said.Dr Mini P Singh, professor at the department of virology at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said contradictory results were possible and depended on the condition of sampling as well as storage of samples.“Expertise at different levels is required to properly conduct a test. So, test results can be altered if a sample has not been taken correctly or is not properly stored. Labs should ideally keep a check on the number of positives being reported among the samples daily and there should not be a huge jump or dip. If technically the labs cannot rule out the infection or prove its presence, a repeat sample should be taken,” she added.However, the patient had to be isolated till infection was ruled out, Dr Singh said.Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla said the administration should keep a check on such issues and testing in government sectors should be improved.“This is the second time in a week that such a problem has come to fore. It is (due to) the carelessness of the administration,” Babla said.Meanwhile, Autyuala Healthcare said they had proper checks and balances in place and testing was being done as per protocol.“These are baseless allegations that the labs are minting money by giving false results. To clear the air, I have asked the health department to conduct an audit on the functioning of our lab,” said Pankaj Kansal, director, Atulaya Healthcare.The response of SRL Diagnostics was awaited at the time of filing this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sampled-for-covid-19-in-one-day-man-gets-positive-and-negative-reports-from-two-labs/story-CXnJpWV4UxkXeGM9NYJA0H.html

The move was taken after 15 cases were detected in the locality, said civil surgeon Ragesh Bagga.Sources in the health department said the area was declared a containment zone last Wednesday; however, as cases kept piling on, authorities decided to seal the streets to further check the spread of the virus. The move did not go down well with the residents. Many complained that they faced difficulties in getting to work and were even unable to go out to purchase essentials such as milk and vegetables. “The health department should have informed us in advance so that we could stock up on groceries and other ration items. The streets were sealed suddenly in the morning, leaving everyone in shock. I am perfectly fine but still I could not go for work,” complained Munish Dogra, a resident of Durgapuri. Another resident said, “The prolonged lockdown has already caused financial troubles for everyone and now the police has sealed our area. I had to take the long route to reach my workplace.”Naina Sharma, a homemaker, said there was no milk or vegetables in her house all through the day. “I could go and get vegetables only in the evening when we were given some relaxations,” she said.

14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC to auction off 70 old cars||The fund-starved municipal corporation (MC) has decided to auction off around 70 old vehicles (mostly ambassadors and gypsy cars) to reduce expenditure incurred on their fuel and repairs. Most of these vehicles are over 15-years-old and were allotted to superintendent and sub-divisional level officers of the MC. Sources in the civic body said that with this move, the MC is also trying to put a stop to the unnecessary use of government vehicles by officials. Now, a specified number of vehicles will be provided at the zone offices which will be allotted to field staff only after getting permission from the zonal commissioner. An official, requesting anonymity, said, “Officials will now have to use their own vehicles. This will stop wastage of fuel, as many times, the officials use government vehicles for personal reasons. Mayor Balkar Sandhu is keeping an eye on fuel consumption and has also caught a few cases of fuel theft by MC officials.” The decision on purchase of new vehicles will be taken by higher authorities. MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon said, “The outdated vehicles have been kept at the MC’s workshop in Hambran road. The decision to auction them off has been taken due to their low mileage and high maintenance costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-to-auction-off-70-old-cars/story-gu5UL2XYnlefzQIzmsFwRM.html

He rushed home immediately, but the accused had already fled by then. Maini alleged that the accused are aides of Sushil Raju Thapar, husband of Congress councillor Indu Thapar. Gaurav Kalia, a BJP worker and Maini’s neighbour, alleged that the accused had made derogatory remarks against them on social networking sites at the behest of Thapar. During lockdown, the accused also had thrown liquor bottles outside his house. Kalia also alleged that according to eyewitnesses, the accused had pointed the gun at Yogesh’s wife, however, the locals intervened. When contacted, Sushil Raju Thapar, refuted the allegations. He said he had no rivalry against anyone and also stated that he had all valid documents and permission for constructing the hotel. Division Number 8 station house officer inspector Jarnail Singh said a case has been registered under Sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act against the accused.

But in private hospitals the demand has gone up as patients from others parts of the region are being admitted,” said Dr Manjit Singh, Mohali civil Surgeon.There was no oxygen shortage though, as “we had accessed the growing demand on time and made arrangements accordingly,” said Dr Ravi Gupta, medical superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh.However, demand for oxygen was increasing in a number of hospitals, including GMCH in Sector 48, where supply was coming in through cylinders. Similarly, at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), demand had increased in the last two weeks as more Covid-19 patients were being admitted – not just in the dedicated Covid block but also in emergency. “Though a few services have been curtailed to provide Covid-19 services, there has been a marginal increase in oxygen consumption in the hospital, which was expected to grow manifold in future considering the present scenario. At present the supply chain is as per requirement,” said a senior PGIMER doctor. Surinder Singh Virdi, managing director of Anaesthetic Gases Private Limited, Dera Bassi, a major supplier of oxygen in the tricity, says: “Demand is up since private hospitals started admitting patients. Before Covid, we used to supply around 15,000 bulk oxygen cylinders per month in the region and now it’s 25,000 cylinders.Rupinder Singh Sachdeva, managing director, Hitech Industries Limited, a key producer of medical oxygen in the region, said they were now only supplying to major hospitals. “Our firm’s daily procurement of liquid oxygen from other states have fallen from around 30% as suppliers are meeting the demand of other states,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/oxygen-demand-shoots-up-as-covid-cases-spike-in-tricity/story-4wCV6rYJfJJn41Z2EOiHLM.html

The group of councillors, led by leader of opposition in general House of MC, Harbhajan Singh Dang, also handed over a list of 11 roads, whose samples failed the quality test conducted by MC in the past. Others who were present at the meeting included Jaspal Singh Giaspura, Manpreet Manna, Sarabjit Singh Laddi, Nirmal Singh, Vijay Danav among others. ”Recently, 11 road samples failed the quality tests conducted in different areas including Ashok Nagar, Himmat Singh Nagar, textile colony, Baba Mukand Singh nagar and Bal Singh Nagar . But, no action has been taken against the officials and contractors who have constructed inferior quality roads. Public money is being wasted and the MC is taking no action against the same. We have demanded that strict departmental action should be taken against the officials concerned including sub divisional officers and executive engineers.

14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Congress councillor opposes serving of CLU notices to shopkeepers in Ludhiana||Shopkeepers of the Ghumar Mandi area and Congress councillor-cum-chairman of Punjab State Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC), Gurpreet Gogi, have opposed the municipal corporation’s move to recover change of land use charges (CLU) charges from shops in different parts of the city amid the pandemic. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, zonal commissioner Kulpreet Singh and Gogi had a meeting in Ghumar Mandi area on Monday wherein shopkeepers and Gogi strongly opposed the move. The shopkeepers said that they will be forced to raise an agitation against the MC and state government, if the civic body did not stop serving the notices.Shopkeepers from other nearby markets in National road and video market also participated in the meeting. “The shopkeepers had raised the issue with me, so I asked the mayor to visit the area and listen to their grievances. Notices are being served to decade-old shops, when CLU norms were not even notified. Also, no prior approval has been taken from the general House of MC before serving the notices. Even if the MC has to recover the charges, the matter should be taken up in the general House meeting and a committee should be formed to take decisions like rate of CLU charges. Such activities are putting a blot on the image of the state government, which is not acceptable,” Gogi said. Shopkeepers also raised questions on the timing of the notices as they are already reeling under losses due to the pandemic and many of them are struggling to make ends meet.President of Ghumar mandi market association, Pawan Batra, said,”The shopkeepers are struggling as we are left with 20 to 25 % business amid the pandemic. First of all, the notices are being served to every shop without even looking into the records to know whether the CLU norms apply on them or not. Secondly, how will the shopkeepers pay CLU charges worth lakhs, when they are facing financial crunch. They will be forced to move on roads if the MC does not stop serving notices.”Earlier, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra had also raised objections against notices being served to decade-old shops.”We are already in talks with the government to reduce CLU charges and minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had also taken up the matter at state level in the past. We will again discuss the matter at the state level to bringing some relief to the shopkeepers,” Sandhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-councillor-opposes-serving-of-clu-notices-to-shopkeepers-in-ludhiana/story-WP6DtPrmTOOOfJZNFjLWNK.html

Only those customers visit the malls who need something specific, that too mostly on Sundays.”The employees of stores situated in other malls said the negotiations were on with the mall management regarding reduction in rent. Many employees even lost their jobs as stores cut down their fixed expenses.The manager at an eating joint in MBD Neopolis, Rohit, said, “The footfall is less as cinemas are closed and people are avoiding eating out. Even when we are taking all precautions, the response has reduced by around 70%. But our expenses are the same. Our team is negotiating with the mall management regarding the rent.”Marketing manager of Westend Mall, Ramesh Gandhi, said, “We cannot reveal the figures regarding the overall response, but it is increasing with the relaxations being announced by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-relaxations-malls-in-ludhiana-receive-low-footfall/story-00ZvAuM4QAxaPmiKj8xjcM.html
14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Oyo founder booked for fraud, company refutes charges||An FIR has been registered against Ritesh Agarwal, founder and CEO of Oyo Hotels and Homes Private Limited (OHHPL), and Sandeep Lodha, CEO of OHHPL’s brand Weddingz.in, for alleged fraud and conspiracy. An Oyo spokesperson, however, refuted the charges against the company.The case was registered by the Dera Bassi police last week after Chandigarh businessman Vikas Gupta alleged that the OHHPL top management wriggled out of an agreement with him illegally and with criminal intent. The agreement was signed in 2019 with Gupta’s Manimajra-based company, Vikas Mineral Foods Limited (VMFL), which runs the marriage palace Casa Villaz Resorts in Dera Bassi. Gupta, who held a press conference on Monday, said he had submitted all the documents OHHPL had asked for and after its top management, including finance and legal teams, were satisfied with the paperwork the agreement was signed allowing the company to run Casa Villaz Resorts.Also read: Govt bans export of onions with immediate effectThings were running smoothly till the Covid-19 outbreak, after which restrictions were imposed on gatherings for weddings and events. Gupta alleged that OHHPL, fearing losses, hatched a premeditated conspiracy, and against the terms of the agreement, sent him a notice on March 3, 2020, to again submit the NOCs and other documents. Gupta said he was given a 15-day notice to reply whereas the agreement stipulated a 30-day notice period to any party wishing to end the agreement.Gupta alleged the documents OHHPL had wanted resubmitted were the ones he had given earlier. Soon, however, OHHPL terminated the agreement.A notice was then sent by OHHPL, Gupta alleged, and instead of paying him damages for ending the agreement it slapped a penalty of about Rs 5 crore (approximately) on him as “part of a criminal conspiracy to make huge and easy money through pressure tactics.” Refuting the charges, an Oyo spokesperson said late on Monday: “OYO Hotels & Homes and all its businesses including Weddingz.in have always maintained the highest level of integrity, transparency and commitment to its venue partners and operates keeping in mind the mutual interests of its venue partners, customers and employees. OYO refutes such baseless and publicity-oriented claims made against the company’s founder and other executives.” Also read: Won’t be enough Covid-19 vaccines till 2024 - Serum Institute’s Adar PoonawallaAnother allegation Gupta made was that in what appeared to be “criminal intent,” the name of Casa Villaz Resorts was still being used by OHHPL and “innocent people were being cheated of money by booking marriages.” There was proof that weddings had been booked till December 2020, Gupta said, adding that he was being made a scapegoat in the whole modus operandi.A case under Section 420 (cheating) and 120-B ( criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against Ritesh Agarwal and Sandeep Lodha at the Dera Bassi police station. Oyo’s responseIn response, the Oyo statement said: “In the present issue, the dispute between the contracting parties is civil and commercial in nature and there is no criminality involved. Any disputes between the parties ought to be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal and moreover, both parties have already nominated /proposed arbitrators vide their arbitration notices, under the arbitration clause in the contract signed between both parties. In spite of the same, such frivolous FIRs in matters that are essentially civil disputes are filed against reputed CEOs, young Indian entrepreneurs only with a malafide intent to harass the corporate and its senior management and to damage global reputation of OYO Hotels & Homes and India as a destination for global business.”Calling these allegations “baseless, incorrect and defamatory in nature,” the Oyo statement read: “On a similar matter where an FIR was wrongfully filed against OYO, the Honourable Karnataka High Court while observing that the issue was civil in nature, granted an interim relief in favour of OYO. OYO has reposed its faith in the judicial system and will submit its representations to the higher administrative authorities and judiciary to ensure that justice prevails.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/oyo-founder-ritesh-agarwal-booked-for-fraud-criminal-conspiracy/story-azHBHSNyk4EjTNqCbNgC8I.html

It has been planned to set up playgrounds for cricket, football, hockey, lawn tennis, etc, at the sports park.Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal visited the site along with civic body officials and experts from GNDEC to kickstart the work on Monday.A huge amount of legacy waste (garbage) is lying at the site for a long time. The MC has decided to use the legacy waste in the foundation of the park after consulting the experts.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “There is no need to shift the legacy waste from the site as most of it has been turned into soil over the years. The experts from GNDEC have started soil testing and the project would be commenced at the earliest. Apart from a cricket ground, infrastructure would also be developed for hockey, lawn tennis, basketball among other games at a cost of around ₹52 crores.”Earlier the consultant company of Smart City Mission had tabled a proposal to shift the legacy waste from the site at the cost of around ₹20 crores. But the proposal was declined by Ashu and Balkar Sandhu.Ashu said, “The project was hanging fire for a long time as no one took the initiative. We have been conducting meetings in the last few months and soil testing is now being conducted. The officials are also preparing a detailed project report, following which tenders would be floated. It is expected that the construction work will begin by December.”Expedite construction of ROB, RUBs: Ashu tells officialsCabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Monday held a meeting with officials of the MC and railway to take stock of the ongoing construction work of rail overbridge (ROB) and two rail under bridges (RUBs) on Pakhowal road here. He was accompanied by mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal.The minister asked the officials to expedite the construction of the bridges, especially the under path (RUB) first to facilitate the traffic. The construction of a ROB and two RUBs on Pakhowal Road has been a long pending demand of the city residents. This joint project is worth around ₹120 crore and would provide a much-needed respite from traffic congestion to the city residents.To ease the traffic movement and avoid congestions due to the construction, the minister also requested railway officials to temporarily open the level crossing near the ROB on the Ludhiana-Ferozepur section during the construction period for smooth execution of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/proposed-sports-park-soil-testing-of-identified-site-in-jainpur-begins/story-Mu6UGheOB6ZQvi7ViH1vtK.html

There is no facility to provide potable water to visitors also.”“I have told the officials to move out of their offices frequently so that they could know the problems being faced by staff and visitors.

14-09-2020||City||Parents protest against private school, demand fee waiver||High drama was witnessed at Silver Spot Convent School, Hargobind Marg as many parents gathered in front of the school opposing the decision to demand fee from the students.More than 70 parents gathered at the school gate and raised slogans against the school management for demanding fees and other charges. Parents alleged that the authorities were harassing students, who did not deposit the fee, by removing their names from WhatsApp groups and not allowing them to take online evaluation tests.Parents protested outside the school for over two hours and later submitted a complaint (a copy of which HT has seen) to the assistant commissioner of police (Central) Waryam Singh. In the complaint, parents have requested the authorities to resolve the matter as they are unable to deposit the fee due to financial losses incurred due to the lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They said they were already under stress as they had not received salaries during the lockdown period while some of the parents had even lost their jobs or suffered losses in their business. However, the ACP (central) has asked the parents to submit the complaint to the commissioner of police. Now, the parents will again gather at the CP office on Tuesday to submit a written complaint against the school. ACP Waryam Singh said, “A protest was held by the parents outside the school and the police reached the spot to pacify them. The team asked the parents to stop the protest in view of the pandemic. I have asked the parents to submit the complaint with the CP on Tuesday.”Parents also alleged that the school was affiliated with the Punjab School Education Board and for the last few years, the school authorities claimed that they were affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. The board outside the school premises still displays that it is affiliated with PSEB. Parents must be told the truth. A protesting parent, Jatinder Chanana said, “On September 7, we had raised an agitation outside the school and contacted the principal but to no avail. To resolve the matter, cops from the Shingar police post reached the spot and contacted the school authorities and asked the parents to visit the school today. When we have visited the school, we found the gates were locked and the principal was not responding to our calls. My daughter is studying in Class 6 and she was removed from the WhatsApp group last week. When we contacted the class teacher to know the reason, it revoked no response.”Another parent, Prince Kalra, said, “Due to financial constraints, parents are unable to pay the school fee and if the school authorities can resolve this issue then students will be able to continue their education. We have requested the school authorities twice to initiate dialogue with parents so that we can reach to a conclusion.” Despite repeated attempts, school principal, Harmohanjit Kaur could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-protest-against-private-school-demand-fee-waiver/story-qjnxwEOrrmTG4EizhIbLGL.html

14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Monsoon withdrawal after Sept 24, but dry weather likely ahead in Chandigarh: IMD||Even as Chandigarh has recorded a surplus monsoon this year, September is 91% deficient with only 8.1mm rain so far, and the situation is unlikely to improve much, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Monsoon this month has remained weak in the region as compared to the previous months, and is active mostly over peninsular India now,” said Chandigarh IMD director Surender Paul.Paul said light rain can be expected in the region on September 17 and 18, but it will be present in isolated areas. “Over the next 10 days, dry conditions are likely to persist,” he said. According to the weather bulletin, mercury will hover between 26°C and 35°C in the coming three days.Monsoon season is considered from June to September. As much as 919.6mm rain has been recorded so far, against a normal of 790mm till September 14, making it 16% surplus. This was due to heavy spells in July and August and above normal rain in June as well. Last year, 120.9mm rain was recorded in September, while in 2018, the figure stood at 270mm.Even though no rain is being recorded in the region, monsoon withdrawal is unlikely to happen before September 24, said Paul. “Even though not bringing much rain, a system of easterlies is still active in the region. Monsoon withdrawal cannot be declared while they are active,” he said.IMD had recently adjusted the normal monsoon withdrawal date for the city from September 21 to September 23, but this year it’s likely to be later than normal. Even last year, withdrawal got delayed till October 9.During the withdrawal period, too, rain can also be expected in the region, said IMD scientist Shivinder Singh, attributing it to possible interaction between western disturbances and easterlies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/monsoon-withdrawal-after-sept-24-but-dry-weather-likely-ahead-in-chandigarh-imd/story-uHshTs86hQqdvm8E94tFCM.html

According to the district health department figures, the case frequency in March, in contrast, was just one case every 15 hours. In April, a case was reported every seven hours and in May, every 2.5 hours. The frequency picked up in June when one Covid-19 case was reported every 23 minutes and in July, every 17 minutes. The speed of spread in August remained more or less the same as that of July with one case reported every 16 minutes. However, the speed of spread doubled in September with the district recording one Covid-19 case every 8.45 minutes. District magistrate Suhas LY said with all economic activities restarting after the nationwide lockdown, the main aim of the administration now is to reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) and keep it to a minimum, while simultaneously increasing the scale of testing. “We have adapted ‘track, test and treat’ methodology for checking the spread of Covid-19. As a result, GB Nagar’s CFR has gone down to 0.46%, which is much better than national figure of 1.67% and the state’s 1.41%,” he said. The DM also said Gautam Budh Nagar’s testing rate is the “best among all districts of north India”. “Our testing rate per million per day is over 1,750, which is nearly 150 more than other best districts in north India. We have also issued advisories for factories and other industrial establishments to strictly follow the safety protocols. Six teams, with the help of district industries department, have been constituted to inspect whether safety protocols are being followed in workplaces and factories,” he said. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said to check the spread of Covid-19 in the district, daily testing has been increased and rapid antigen kit testing camps are being organised regularly at different places in the district. “Testing camps will be organised in sectors 61, 93B and 52 on Tuesday, and in sectors 62, 71 and 77 on Wednesday,” he said. The CMO further said besides ramping up testing, the district has stepped up monitoring of patients in home isolation. The health department’s surveillance teams have started implementing stringent containment rules. “Early hospitalisation of patients needing medical support and efficient infection control at health care facilities are our top priorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bleak-september-for-gb-nagar-one-covid-case-reported-every-8-45-minutes/story-6fbq07ohKhNrZWuX712hfL.html

We want a written assurance from Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni that she will initiate a special ‘girdawari’. If not, then we will intensify our stir,” he said.Meham MLA extends support Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, reached the dharna site and extended support to the agitating farmers. Kundu said the government is reluctant to solve the issues of farmers and asked them to snatch their rights from the ‘blind and deaf’ government.“ I condemn the use of force by police on farmers at the Pipli rally on the state government’s direction. The BJP-JJP government is anti-farmers and have brought three ordinances from back door. This government wants to give your lands to private players and destroy farming,” he added.He also urged the farmers to ban the entry of BJP leaders in their respective villages. “The BJP leaders had promised to implement the Swaminathan commission report six years ago but they failed to do so. After the Pipli attack, it is now time to restrict the entry of BJP leaders in the villages,” Kundu said.Farmers in several parts of Bhiwani district have also been holding protests seeking special girdawari for damaged crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-seek-compensation-for-damaged-crops-during-mahapanchayat-in-hisar-s-balsamand-village/story-8GU1S4rainobXrAXMOMH2K.html

In the city on Monday, after her election to the legislative council post, Gorhe said: “Citizens must use masks, but, at the same time, police also need to take action against car drivers not wearing masks. There is no need to act against car passengers not using masks if their windows are closed.” “It is true that Pune’s Covid situation is becoming critical. One of the reasons is the transfer of the municipal commissioner. There are some errors at the administrative level. Despite awareness, citizens avoid the use of masks, which is wrong,” she said. ‘Not in the loop, no invitations: this is wrong’ Deputy speaker of the Maharashtra legislative council Neelam Gorhe also raised objections about the functioning of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) and the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Gorhe said, “PMRDA and the university of Pune are not keeping MLAs in the loop and are not even sending out any invitations. This is wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mask-of-confusion-fine-the-driver-but-not-the-passengers-says-dy-speaker-of-legislative-council-neelam-gorhe/story-e5vu4cUSFlIUx0NOlB3apO.html

14-09-2020||Patna||‘He was compelled’: Raghuvansh Singh’s letter sparks row after his demise||Even before the mortal remains of former union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh could be consigned to flames, an ugly verbal spat has broken out between Grand Alliance and NDA leaders over the letter written by Singh from his hospital bed in New Delhi days before his death. The RJD and Congress cast doubts over letters written by him and alleged that “he was compelled to write such letters.” Singh, who died at AIIMS in New Delhi on Sunday, had on Thursday announced his resignation from the party vide a hand-written letter addressed to jailed RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and followed it up with a series of communications the next day, drawing the attention of chief minister Nitish Kumar towards a number of issues. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while inaugurating oil and natural gas projects in Bihar, had appealed to CM to execute the development projects he wrote about in the letter. “Let’s together--the state and the Centre--fulfil his wishes,” Modi said. Among other things, Singh had sought extension of MGNREGA benefits to the farm sector. The RJD and Congress leaders termed the whole matter as “fishy.’ Also read: Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tests positive for Covid-19“No person admitted to a hospital ICU can write a letter. He was upset over many things which he had expressed freely. But he never betrayed any intention of quitting the party he had nurtured. The state government is doing politics in the matter,” said Bhai Birendra, RJD MLA from Maner. “It seems to be a conspiracy of the NDA,” he added. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad SIngh backed RJD MLA. “I met Raghuvansh babu just a week back. He was a transparent man and had he really been thinking of quitting his party, he would not have tried to hide it. There is some conspiracy at some level”, the Congress leader said. “He was critical of Nitish Kumar during our meeting,” he said. The NDA leaders, on the other hand, expressed their shock over the allegations of the GA leaders. “They are shameless. No RJD leader bothered about him when he was ill. Now, when he raised certain issues related to Vaishali, they are talking rubbish,” said minister and JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar. Also read: The importance of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh“Singh had been tormented by the pettiness of the RJDs new generation of leaders. Who can forget Tej Pratap Yadav’s remarks demeaning his stature? The party will face his curse,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand. Lalu Prasad’s eldest son Tejpratap Yadav Yadav had reacted to Singh’s exit by saying “a lota (pot) of water makes no difference to an ocean”. Former BJP state president and Rajya Sabha MP Gopal Narain SIngh too joined the issue and called it “novice” politics of young RJD leaders.Meanwhile, on Monday afternoon, former union minister’s body was consigned to flames with full state honours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raghuvansh-s-letter-sparks-a-spat-after-his-death/story-oeP6OCk5VViqHNKDi1q5RK.html

He was chairing a meeting to take stock of the Covid situation in the state. The CM was told that the health department has so far issued licence to an industrial supplier to manufacture medical oxygen, while six packaging units have been allowed to package oxygen for medical use. With this, the state now has internal capacity to manufacture 800 medical oxygen cylinders and package 2,000 units per day. With the supplies from other states, there will be enough oxygen to meet any further escalation in demand, the CM was told. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said Punjab was following the 10-day discharge policy as per ICMR guidelines. She said, to manage the increasing number of cases, it has been decided to add 50 L3 beds at Faridkot Medical College. Dr KK Talwar, head of the group of experts on health for the government, said the panel will be sending samples to IMTECH to check on the nature of the virus and ascertain if it has mutated in the last one month, in comparison with the samples sent earlier. ‘Punjab figures not worst in country’A special invitee to the meeting, Ambuj Roy, a professor of cardiology, AIIMS, New Delhi, said majority of the Covid deaths in Punjab had taken place after August 6. At 2.96% the case fatality rate (CFR) in Punjab was higher than the national average of 1.65%, as was the deaths per million at 78.5 (national average 58.3), he noted, but added these figures were still better than many states in the country. In fact, Punjab’s positivity rate of 5.72% was much better than the national average of 8.47%. To a query from the chief minister on the success of plasma therapy, Dr Talwar said studies did not confirm results so far though FDA had recommended this course of treatment. However, given that there was no evidence of any negative impact either, it was advisable to give plasma therapy to moderate and moderately serious patients, said Dr Talwar. Health secretary Hussan Lal, in his presentation, apprised the chief minister of the various measures taken to boost testing and monitor home isolation cases, with the health department in the process of engaging a professional agency to monitor these cases. To boost testing, various steps have been taken to streamline walk-in testing, with sufficient teams and counters being put in place across districts to minimise waiting time and make the entire process smooth for the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-stresses-on-local-production-of-medical-oxygen-to-meet-demand/story-ivxOgtmLMDUWow4OBFt5iK.html

These were the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance.Farmer leaders Buta Singh Burjgill, Ruldu Singh Mansa, Jaipal Singh and Baldev Singh Nihalgarh said in a joint statement that the Central and state governments were pursuing and implementing anti-farming policies mandated by the World Trade Organisation. The government wanted to hand over agriculture to national and international corporates, they alleged.“The BJP had promised to implement the Swaminathan Commission recommendations during the Parliamentary election campaign in 2014. Also, the Central government promised to double the farmer’s income by 2022. We want to remind the government of these promises,” said Burjgill.“A large number of farmers are protesting outside Parliament and thousands of farmers held protests in Amritsar, Jalandhar (Phagwara), Barnala, Patiala and Moga districts of Punjab. The Central government has enlisted these ordinances to present on the very first day of the Parliament session. It was just a symbolic rally but we have asked our cadre to prepare for September 16 action when we may block rail or other places,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).Accusing the Shiromani Akali Dal of taking “U-turns” and asking its leaders to “stop shedding crocodile tears,” Jagmohan Singh said if the party shared the farmers’ concerns it should withdraw its support to the Central Government and come forward openly to support the farmers’ agitation.Bridge over Beas blockedMeanwhile, in their campaign against the ordinances, farmers from Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur districts laid siege to the Tanda-Sri Hargobindpur road and blocked the bridge over the Beas river. Led by the Kisan Sangharsh Committee state general secretary Sawinder Singh Chutala, the farmers started their dharna at about 11 am, which continued till late in the evening. However, despite heavy police presence and prohibitory orders in place the agitators were allowed to give speeches. Chutala said the agitation would be intensified if the Centre did not repeal the ordinances and lower diesel rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-remind-govt-of-promise-to-double-their-income-hold-lalkar-rallies-in-5-punjab-districts/story-mlDIPHmrHm72shvjoJwURN.html

14-09-2020||Bhopal||MP govt to rechristen Ladli Laxmi scheme, aims to make girls self-reliant||The Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Madhya Pradesh (MP) government has apparently realised the flaws in the save the girl child campaign called Ladli Laxmi Scheme (LLS) 13 years after it was launched. The realisation has come following a decrease in sex ratio at birth by 33 points.The state government is considering certain changes to the LLS to make it more effective. State women and child development (WCD) department officials said the LLS couldn’t be effective as more focus was given on providing financial assistance to girls for school education and also for their marriage. These measures were not enough to change the patriarchal mindset of the public towards a girl child, they added. Officials said the data released by various national agencies in the past related to skewed sex ratio at birth, drop-out rates of girls from schools, the growing number of cases of female infanticide and foeticide suggest a worrisome trend. “The benefit, which is being provided under the LLS, will continue as it has become a law. But the WCD department is all set to introduce an integrated scheme in place of all old state-run schemes, including the LLS with a new vision to save the girl child. The renewed focus will be more on making girls self-reliant, independent, breadwinners for their respective families and inspiration for others in ushering social changes,” said a WCD official.“Under the new scheme, the girls will be given financial aid for higher education, for preparation of competitive examinations and to set up a business. A campaign will be run to give a social message that a girl child can earn and is no more a burden. The achievers will be projected as brand ambassadors by the department,” said the officer. “Similarly, training will be held regularly in rural and urban areas for boys to make them sensitive about girls and to change their mindset. A social audit will be conducted regularly to know the change in society,” he added. According to a new draft, the home, law, industry and other few departments will also be part of the scheme in a bid to ensure if any crime is committed against a woman, then justice will be delivered to her. Plans are afoot to eradicate stigmatisation of rape survivors and her family members and other acts of violence against women. In 2007, the LLS was introduced to improve skewed sex ratio, foster a positive attitude towards girls in the society, provide education to them and stop social evils such as infanticide and foeticide.But, the scheme failed to deliver expected results, the government data showed. MP’s sex ratio at birth worsened from 960 in 2005-06 to 927 in 2015-16, as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report. Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Pratham’s Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2018, report, which was released the following year, showed that the drop-out rate for girls in the 11-14 age group and in the 15-16 age category increased to 7.7% and 26.8%, respectively, from 7.3% and 23.4%, respectively, in 2006. The Asian Centre for Human Rights Commission (ACHRC) report, which was released in 2016, showed that MP had the highest cases of female infanticide and foeticide (537) in the country between 1994 and 2014. The report had prompted the state government to make changes to the LLS.Veena Bandyopadhyay, social policy specialist, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said: Some positive changes were found, but the preference for sons continues in the society. The state government should take additional measures to promote girl child by providing job training and helping them in becoming an earning member of her family.” Waseem Siddique, convener, Childline Indore, said, “The LLS has failed to curb foeticide and infanticide cases in the state. Though MP is the worst-affected state, only 50 such cases were reported until 2018. A total of seven people have got convicted until August under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PC&PNDT) Act, 1994” The WCD department has accepted the flaws in the scheme during various inter-departmental meetings, officials said. “The scheme, which has over 36 lakh beneficiaries, failed to address several concerns. The major flaw in the LLS is that the beneficiary gets Rs 1 lakh after she attains 21 years of age and the money cannot be used for education. The money is set aside for solemnising a girl child’s marriage. Similarly, the grant of Rs 12,000, which is being given in three installments to ensure school education of girls, is not enough to change the mindset of the public,” said a WCD officer, requesting anonymity. Another WCD officer said, “The government’s emphasis on marriage and school education finances created an impression that a girl child is a burden. In the past 13 years, the department hardly conducted any mass survey to know the impact of the scheme, which led to various unfavourable reports.” Prashant Dubey, a child rights activist, said parents feel marriage is the only way to protect their daughters. “The department should address this concern of parents because this is also a reason behind infanticide, foeticide and drop-out from schools,” he said.Minister for WCD Imarti Devi said, “The old benefits in the LLS will continue. In the new scheme, we will focus more on making a girl child independent and self-reliant. Similarly, the coordination with other departments, including home and panchayat, will also help to provide a safe environment to our girls. We are serious about our girls’ future and the changes in the campaign will reflect our intent. The new scheme will address all pending issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-govt-to-rechristen-ladli-laxmi-scheme-aims-to-make-girls-self-reliant/story-n8rrRWAS8vmS8f5WSI5AiP.html
14-09-2020||City||33% of Delhi lives in rented houses, govt’s survey finds||New Delhi: A socio-economic survey conducted by the Delhi government has found that 66.63% households in the city own their homes, while 32.38% live in rented accommodations. However, since most of those who said they own the property were living in the pockets where a majority of resettlement colonies are located, experts said the data reflects the increasing presence of informal settlements in the form of unauthorised colonies and slums in the national Capital. The survey, carried out between November 2018 and 2019, covered 20.05 lakh households and 1.02 crore population. Delhi’s actual population as per the state’s planning department is over 2 crore.The survey report showed that house ownership was highest in areas under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which is the most cash-strapped civic body in the city, and where several unauthorised colonies are located. While 62.70% of the households surveyed in the New Delhi Municipal Council’s area were found to be living in rented accommodations.Debolina Kundu, professor at the national institute of urban affairs (NIUA) and member of the 5th Delhi finance commission, pointed out that if one analyses district-wise data, the Shahdara district has the maximum households living in their own properties (76.37%), followed by the Central district (72.36%). Only 44.73% of the households surveyed in the New Delhi district had their own houses. Delhi has 11 districts. “The fact that east Delhi and the Shahdara district have the highest number of families living in their own properties suggests that the Capital continues to have a high share of unauthorised colonies, slums and villages. If EDMC has the highest percentage of people living in their own accommodation then it also clearly explains the low property tax collection from these areas because the corporation still remains the most cash-starved,” she said. Kundu further said the NDMC has the largest share of those living on rent because of the exorbitant property prices in the area, which is also a hub for various private and government offices.“This report could provide important inputs to prepare the Master Plan of Delhi 2041,” she said. Vehicle ownershipOf the 20.05 lakh households surveyed, 51.78% owned motorised vehicles for personal use. The number of households who possess only two-wheelers in Delhi was 40.35%, whereas 4.34% households possessed only four-wheelers and 6.59% owned both two and four wheelers. Only 0.50% had ‘other motorised vehicles’ for personal use. Households in the average monthly expenditure group of Rs.10,000 to Rs.25,000 owned the highest number of two-wheelers only, whereas, households in the group of more than Rs 50,000 had the maximum number of four wheelers for personal use, the report stated.Air-conditioners and water supplyThe report also shows that 22.22% households have air-conditioners and 21.27% have a computer. Of the households that had a computer or a laptop, 80.15% were using an internet connection. It also revealed that 93.83% of households surveyed in Delhi have mobile phones.A senior government official said these trends corroborate the fact that over 85% of Delhi’s population belong to the low-income group and lower mixed incomer group categories.The study stated that 40.78% of the surveyed households had ration cards issued by the food and civil supplies department. Of these, 85.98% were getting ration from the public distribution system.It also said that 70.98% households get tap water, while 5.82% did not have it. “These figures are close to the 2011 Census and illustrates that access to tap water has not improved much and the government needs to invest in water provision. This report will help in various policy interventions,” the official said. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who had commissioned this survey in 2018 did not respond to calls and text messages for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/33-of-delhi-lives-in-rented-houses-govt-s-survey-finds/story-jBj2jXY2iXfCdSZcg19TpO.html
14-09-2020||City||A textbook problem: Schools shut, publishers count losses||New Delhi: For the past six decades, Rajiv Gupta’s family has been selling school and college textbooks from their shop in Delhi’s Nai Sarak, one of the country’s biggest textbook markets. The shop, which saw a never-ending stream of students before the onset of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, hardly receives any customers these days.“ These days, only a few parents come to buy books for their children. My sales have plummeted by 70% this year, ” says Gupta. The continued closure of schools and other educational institutions due to the Coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the textbook industry, with booksellers and publishers experiencing an unprecedented decline in their business after decades of robust growth. According to the India Book Market Report by Nielsen released in 2015, there were about 21,000 book retailers and about 9,000 publishers in India, out of which 8,107 published books for schools, colleges and higher educational institutions. Educational books formed about 70% of the book market in India--- with the school and college books market valued at Rs. 18,600 crore and Rs. 5,600 crore respectively in 2013–14. According to the report, the K-12 books market was likely to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 19.6%, from Rs 22,170 crore in 2014-15 to 54,190 crore by 2019-20. But this otherwise exciting story of textbook publishing in India has taken a grim turn with sales of many well-known publishers dropping as much as 50% compared to last year.“Publishers are sitting on massive unsold stocks. Since the Coronavirus lockdown happened in March, the last-mile sales of books suffered. Most publishers had dispatched the books to distributors or bookshops but a lot of stocks are still lying unsold with them. Nearly 30-40% stocks may come back as returns,” said Monica Malhotra Kandhari, vice president, Federation of Indian Publishers and managing director, MBD Group, one of India’s oldest and largest publishing companies.“Our sales have plummeted 50% this academic session,” says Ashwani Goyal, managing director, Goyal Publishers, one of the country’s largest publishers of language learning books. Many in the industry say that one of the major reasons for the fall in the textbook sales is also the fact that a large number of children of migrant workers in budget schools have gone back to their villages, and are unable to continue their education online. The point is endorsed by the owners of the budget schools. “Our schools had 400 children, most of them belonging to low-income migrant families, and we have lost touch with 50% of them. We have been able to provide online education to only about 30 children. Our fee is only Rs 700 for Class 8 and Rs 400 for nursery, still only 21 out of 400 children paid fees last month. Their families are struggling for survival; education and books do not seem to be their priority, ” says DP Sharma, who runs Ved Pal Memorial School in Hastal in Uttam Nagar, west Delhi, which has 150 budget schools, most of which came up in the past two decades; most complain of thousands of “missing” students. Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools, an association of private schools in Delhi, says that this year many private schools also recommended digital books. “A lot of private schools put the list of books on websites recommended and digital books in case the children were unable to buy physical copies. Besides, schools were also sending chapters of various books online in April . There has never been such online consumption of education content before, ” he adds. Ashwani Goyal said what has also affected sales is online piracy “ I am surprised by the number of illegal PDFs of our printed books available online,” says Goyal, who has about 800 titles in circulation, catering to school and college students. In the past few months, he has digitized most of his titles and made them available on e-reading platforms such as Bru. Like many other publishers, Goyal feels that recycling of old books during the lockdown in April and May also affected sales. Aparajitha Gautam, president, Delhi Parents Association, says that between March and May, the association aggressively promoted the exchange of old books across the city through thousands of parents’ WhatsApp groups. “This helped children procure books when all bookshops were closed and even-e-commerce companies were not delivering books. Eventually, a large number of parents did not buy new books at all, and many bought only a few select books apart from notebooks,” she says. Ish Kapur, who runs Dhanpat Rai Publications, says sales of books have been affected differently in different parts of the country. “ Textbooks sales are particularly dismal in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu , which are severely hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. The sales of books for primary classes have been particularly bad,” says Kapur, whose publication house is known for its mathematics books by RD Sharma. “Our sales are down by 25%; we have never seen such a downturn in business in our 70-year-old history. The sales of even our best -selling titles have been affected,” adds Kapur. The textbook industry follows a sales and marketing strategy that is completely different from that of trade publishers because it is aligned with the school academic year. Every year, in October, representatives and salespersons of various publishing companies start visiting schools across the country for meeting principals and teachers, to make presentations on their books. “We touched base with 70,000 schools last year. However, we are not sure if we will be able to undertake the same exercise this year as the schools are still closed. The production of books starts in August-September each year; but this year as the publishers are sitting with huge stocks, it seems like only 10-20% production may happen,” says Kandhari. Talking of the future of print textbooks in the post-Covid world, she says textbook publishers will have to reinvent themselves. “Hybrid model of education with a mix of online and in-person classes is going to be the new normal. The textbooks will co-exist with digital learning content,” says Kandhari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-textbook-problem-schools-shut-publishers-count-losses/story-VO9iDKNu1I0Eq1vOLtG63I.html
14-09-2020||City||MPD-2041 to have a regeneration policy for old areas||New Delhi: The Master Plan of Delhi-2041, which is the vision document for the city, will spell out a detailed “regeneration policy” for areas that have come up decades ago and now need better civic infrastructure. Though the current master plan also allows redevelopment of existing areas but the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has asked the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which is preparing the next master plan, to work on a regeneration policy keeping the ground realities in mind.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “The regeneration policy will be one of the key focus areas on the new Master Plan. It is an important aspect, as large parts of the city were developed a long time back.”“The city has grown over the years and so has the infrastructure requirement. Regeneration of old areas in a planned manner will help in providing better civic infrastructure and basic amenities to people and improve quality of life,” said Jain.Officials said the policy will only provide a legal provision and a broad road map for redevelopment but it is up to the people of a particular locality to pool in land -- the component critical to build new facilities -- for more amenities with the DDA only facilitating the effort. Experts say that bringing people together for such projects was the key reason why only two major projects -- East Kidwai Nagar and the seven general pool residential accommodation colonies -- could be taken up under the redevelopment policy laid out under MPD-2021. Since government was the land owner, there was no hurdle in implementing the projects. Residents want redevelopmentSeveral housing societies in Indraprastha Extension in East Delhi, which came up in the late 70s and early 80s, have been demanding redevelopment. Despite several efforts by some residents, no redevelopment projects were sanctioned in this area. Madan Khatri, president of Vikalp cooperative group housing society, said, “For nearly a decade, we have been running from pillar to post to get the benefit of the redevelopment scheme. Our societies are designed as per the 1962 MPD and can’t meet the growing civic infrastructure needs. We want the DDA to clearly draft the redevelopment policy so that people can benefit from it.”The resident welfare associations say that the policy will be beneficial for residential colonies that came up four-five decades back. “There are several double-storeyed resettlement developments in Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar etc., which came up in the 60s. These colonies don’t have the adequate civic infrastructure. But the DDA should clearly spell out the norms, as getting people together for redevelopment is difficult,” said Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs across Delhi.Need for area-specific plansUrban development experts agree that a regeneration or redevelopment policy is needed, as there are several areas, especially urbanised villages, unauthorised colonies, resettlement colonies, etc, where redevelopment is the only way forward to improve the quality of life. But instead of a broad policy, efforts should be made to chalk out area-specific plans, they added. To ensure that the policy gets implemented and people actually benefit from it, AK Jain, former planning commission with the DDA, said the policy should encourage community-based approach and be area specific. “For the redevelopment, we can’t have a blanket policy for all the areas. It should be area specific as the problems of an urbanised village are very different from a plotted colony or unauthorised colonies. There are other issues such as ownership rights, etc which needs to be addressed,” said Jain.Boon for resettlement, commercial areas The policy can be useful in improving the civic infrastructure in developing areas with mixed land use, resettlement colonies, unauthorised colonies, rural and urbanised villages and slums.Sanjukkta Bhaduri, professor of urban planning and dean research at the School of Planning and Architecture, said areas such as Mangolpuri where several resettlement colonies came up in the late 1960s. “Redevelopment is the only way forward for these areas. But it should be based on the local area plan which must be prepared ward-wise. We also need to assess the impact of the project on the nearby areas.”In the last two decades, large parts of residential areas in the Capital have become fully commercial as over 2,500 streets were declared as commercial and mixed land use. Shamsher Singh, the former chief town planner with the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), said parking has become a serious problem in these areas, especially roads which were declared completely commercial.“While 100% commercial activity is allowed on residential plots on streets declared as commercial, the building byelaws are residential. If these plots are allowed to redevelop as per commercial norms, the issue of parking and other infrastructure can be resolved,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mpd-2041-to-have-a-regeneration-policy-for-old-areas/story-NCRgMmlp3rzxdOt5Hs5KSM.html
14-09-2020||City||Face shields cannot be an alternative to masks||Tired of wearing face masks for long periods, many consumers are in recent weeks switching to face shields for protection against the coronavirus, while visiting friends and relatives or even at work. However, experts warn that face shields cannot be a substitute for the mask.The biggest problem with the shield is that when worn, there are gaps between the face and the visor at two places- near the chin and the ears and scientists say that aerosolised droplets carrying the virus can enter the respiratory tract of the wearer through these gaps. In fact earlier, when Covid-19 was believed to spread mainly through large respiratory droplets, plastic face shields that extended lower than the chin and went beyond the ears with no gap between the forehead and the shield’s head piece, were believed to be quite effective and some scientists even argued that they were better than the mask in preventing the spread of the disease. The added advantage of the shield was that it protected the eyes too and also prevented the wearer from touching the face. However, with growing scientific evidence that airborne aerosols carrying the virus may play a major role in spreading the disease, many countries are enforcing strict rules against their usage as an alternative to face mask and reiterating that they can only provide an added layer of protection when worn over a face mask.In fact in July, the Swiss health officials warned against using face shields as a substitute for masks and said it gave the wearer a false sense of security. According to media reports, the warning came after an outbreak of Covid-19 in a hotel in the Graubunden region, wherein it was found that hotel employees who wore face shields were infected while those who wore masks were spared.The most recent work on the topic in Physics of Fluids, published by the American Institute of Physics on September1 , strongly discourages the use of face shields and says that they could have an adverse impact on Covid-19 mitigation efforts (“Visualising droplet dispersal for face shields and masks with exhalation valves”, Siddhartha Verma et al).The researchers, who used qualitative visualisation to examine the performance of face shields in preventing the spread of the virus, said although the shield blocked the large respiratory droplets, the smaller aerosol-sized droplets can disperse over a wide area in lateral and longitudinal directions and flow around the visor , even though with decreasing droplet concentration.In conclusion, the researchers recommended use of high quality cloth or plain surgical masks without exhale valves for minimizing the community spread of the disease.Yes, face masks may win over face shields, but here again, their effectiveness will depend on the quality of the mask and even more important, how it is worn. A study published in April this year in the American Chemical Society Journal (ACS Nano), showed how a loose and ill-fitting mask considerably brought down the filtration efficiency , defeating the very purpose of wearing the mask. The research also said a hybrid cloth mask made of different fabrics provided high filtration efficiency. (“Aerosol filtration efficiency of common fabrics used in respiratory cloth masks” )I must also mention that these days, consumers seem to be under the impression that they need not maintain social distancing, once they wear the mask. They must remember that social distancing , hand washing and correct usage of the mask are all equally and absolutely essential for protection against the virus.To emphasise the importance of social distancing, I must mention another study published in Physics of Fluids by the same authors in June this year , which pointed to uncovered emulated coughs travelling further than the currently recommended 6-feet distancing guidelines-- in fact up to 12 feet. The authors observed that there may be need to update the current social distancing guidelines “to account for the aerosol-based transmission of pathogens”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/face-shields-cannot-be-an-alternative-to-masks/story-75vpjpSBQHb3dMNIObCiyH.html
14-09-2020||Pune||Covid Impact: Depositors in various cases probed by police in Pune believe refunds will take longer||Investors, mostly senior citizens, who have been duped in various schemes, are worried over the unfolding of the Covid-19 situation and its devastating impact on the possible return of their money. The Covid induced lockdown has been a double whammy for investors in DSK and Shivajirao Bhosale bank case, currently being probed by police. As many as 33,000 depositors, most of them senior citizens are demanding their money back amid their fading hope as prices of properties owned by city-based developer DS Kulkarni and the delay in case has prolonged their wait. DSK along with wife Hemanti, son Shirish, son-in-law Kedar Vanjpe and his wife Sai have been arrested by the Economic Offence Wing, which is probing a Rs2,043 crore fraud. Though activists fighting for the investors feel the cases being heard must be fast-tracked, investors believe that it will take a long time before they will finally get their dues from the state government. Jyotsana Kulkarni, a resident of Baner and investor in DSK scheme said, “We had deposited the money with DSK group as fixed deposit and expected it will help us in our old age. During the last two years, we are constantly hoping that we will get the refund but the case is not being heard during the Covid-19 crisis and it is a cause of concern. We believe that the refunds won’t come early as frauds take long time for being investigated by the police and decided by the courts.” The impatience has grown among most investors, who had put in their life savings in various schemes run by DSK, expecting bright returns. During one of the hearing earlier last year, an investor shouted at DSK’s wife Hemanti in the courtroom blaming her for her husband’s death. The judge had to ask staff to take depositors away. Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan said, “Covid-19 has impacted the functioning of the court since lockdown. With the courts opening as per the district judge orders, we will see hearing into the case after which the case will move ahead on a regular basis. It is because of Covid-19 that the case has been delayed. The courts are going to begin from Monday and the DSK case will definitely get momentum and will be heard regularly.” RTI Activist Vijay Kumbhar who has been helping DSK investors since the beginning, said, “We have been demanding a fast-track court to ensure that the victims are compensated at the earliest. The DSK investors are facing problems for their day to day living since a long as all their savings have been lost. The investors have been suffering from a long time and now with Covid-19, there seems to be no immediate relief from their problems and it will be a long wait for them before they get their money back from the government.” In the Shivajirao Bhosale bank case, police have arrested the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member of legislative council Shivaji Bhosale along with other bank officers on charges of ₹71 crore fraud and other financial misappropriations running into crores. The bank, with 12 branches and ₹430 crore deposits, across Pune district and 1.10 lakh account holders, was promoted by Bhosale. According to Hemant Shedge, president, Kothrud depositors samiti which is fighting for the investors right in the multi-crore Shivajirao Bhosale bank case, the pandemic may further delay their hope for a return of money. “It took very long for the state government to take action against the bank directors. Covid-19 has multiplied their problems further as the courts were shut for a very long time and the investigation too is going on amidst the growing Covid crisis. The depositors believe that it will take long before the final dues get settled and one never knows whether they will be alive or dead at that time,” he said. Sarika Patil, who lost a ten-lakh deposit in the bank said, “We don’t have any money left as we had kept the bank FD for our medical expenses and daughter’s marriage. Since the last two years, there is no hope left.” Investors awaiting refund in another scheme – The Pan Card Club, which began operations in 1997 collected ₹1,400 crores from depositors nationally. Siddhartha Kanse, an investor in the scheme said, “We have done all our work and the case is legally settled but still the payments have not been given. I believe that it will take some more time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-impact-depositors-in-various-cases-probed-by-police-believe-refunds-will-take-longer/story-n1WxCBLghEzxXVC3jBYj4L.html
14-09-2020||Pune||Only 50 golfers allowed to play at a time on the course: Swastik Sirsikar, golf captain, Poona club golf course||The lockdown facilitated the early renovation of the club house at Poona club golf course. The golf course restarted its operations on August 5 and since then has functioned smoothly. Members are happy with the condition of the course and the renovated club house adds to the joy of playing their favourite sport. Swastik Sirsikar, golf captain of the Poona club golf course, described how a golf course with safety SOPs can score a birdie even during a pandemic.How challenging was it to get the course ready again?No one had expected that it would be such a long lockdown. We closed our course on March 17, but had hoped that it would reopen in April or May. The conditions were challenging as our staff members were not coming in, also we are located very close to a containment zone, Yerawada, and many of the maintenance staff lived in the same place, so we faced a lot of difficulty. We got e-passes and permission for a few staffers to come and do the work only for couple of hours daily. Right before we open our course, we got our whole staff tested for Covid to assure our members that they will be playing in a safe environment.Has the number of golfers coming to the course increased?We were apprehensive about the number of golfers who would come back in the first month of our reopening (August). First it was 80 or 90 golfers who had prior bookings. Currently, 150 members visit the golf course in a day at separate time intervals allotted to them between 7am and 6pm. Only 50 golfers are allowed to play at a time on the course. We are not focused on how much money is coming in as right now we just want to provide our recreational facilities to the members who have been locked down over the past few months. We cannot open our restaurants and cafeterias as it gives people a chance to socialise.How has the functioning of the golf course been tracked?Everything is monitored on a daily basis and everyone is happy with standard operating procedures (SOP) in place. The committee meets every week on Wednesday to review all the operations, if not physical then through online platforms. The SOPs are upgraded too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/only-50-golfers-allowed-to-play-at-a-time-on-the-course-swastik-sirsikar-golf-captain-poona-club-golf-course/story-vCtimhm2B9vNYtahq9WQTP.html
14-09-2020||Pune||Teeing off in post-Covid era is all about staying at par with course SOPs in Pune||The coronavirus pandemic is showing no signs of relenting even after six months of precautions and lockdown. Sportspersons have been hit the worst with many unable to practice due to closure of sports arenas. With unlock phasing in the country, sport is seeing a dynamic change from no fans to no contact sports as of now. However, the city has seen tennis and golf tee up to the Covid challenge and start the games with safety on the mind.The Poona club golf course restarted its operations on August 5 keeping on par with all Covid-19 safety measures with strict standard operating procedures. The start was staggered as golfers trickled in and rules were put in place to make sure, its a smooth drive down the long course for the club. Only 50 golfers have been allowed inside the course at the club which boasts of almost 500 members. Sanitisation at the entry/exit, three-balls to tee off at an interval of 15 minutes and only forecaddies (caddies who are course, ahead of the players to keep a track of the balls) allowed are some of the new measures put in place by the golf course management. Maintaining social distance and using sanitisers frequently are now looked at habits, golfers have to develop.“Course is open for members only and one is only allowed after following all the SOPs. Strict measures have been taken by our committee and in one month, all the things have been progressing smoothly,” explained Santosh Datta, Rules and Discipline Chairman of the Poona club golf course.One on one coaching had been halted at the course but resumed from September 12. As of now, no guest players are allowed on the course.Along with being a competitive sport, golf courses have always been a place to socialise and catch up with friends, however, in the post-Covid era, this has changed. “All clinics, tournaments, banquets and gatherings have been suspended and gathering of more than four persons at any place has is prohibited,” reads the screens constantly displaying all the SOPs in place at the course.“Most of the golf courses, even in Mumbai and Delhi, are following the SOPs which we brought in place. Many guest players are seeking permission to start playing here, but we have not agreed on that front yet,” said Swastik Sirsikar, Golf Captain of the Poona club golf course.Radhika Kanitkar Tulpule, a former tennis player and also a regular at the golf course, is extremely happy with the way the club house has been renovated and the course is maintained.“I have been to course since it restarted and it has been maintained really well. Sirsikar and president of the course Rahul Dhole Patil managed to keep the course up to par even during Covid-19,” added Tulpule.Standard Operating Procedures at golf coursesThe Poona Club Golf Course, Yerawada, is implementing a two-phase plan to open up the golf course keeping in mind all Covid-19 precautionsFirst phase (August 5- September 11) Caddies were not allowed in the first phaseAll practice areas were not operational, except box netsSecond phase (From September 12) Only limited number of caddies allowed to foresee the balls Coaching on one-on-one basis is allowedMaximum four players are allowed to practice on chipping and putting areaGolfers at the course Only 3-ball allowed to tee off at a time (four-balls allowed in second phase)Maximum 50 golfers are permitted on the course at any given timeTee offs will be at an interval of 15 minutesOnly one player allowed in one cartPlayers to carry their own personal sanitisers for the club grips and ballsGolfers at the entry Use sanitser to wash hands at entry pointsBody temperature check will be carried out at the entry pointSanitise the golf bags and trolleys before and after the gameCaddies’ corner At least 200 caddies are dependent on the Poona Club for their daily earnings and ever since the lockdown started, Poona club management distributes ration packets to all the caddies every 15 days.“Although we don’t appoint caddies officially, they earn their livelihood from the golf course, so the course management decided to support them. Now, we have allowed fore caddies at our golf course,” said Swastik Sirsikar, Golf Captain, Poona Club Golf Course, Yerawada.“The management is supporting us wholeheartedly till date. I am a fore caddie right now and I miss my conversation with the golfers, which is not allowed now. Most caddies are still connected with golf and a few others joined different professions to earn a living,” said Amir Khan, caddie at the Poona Club Golf Course, Yerawada, over the last 18 years.Golfers say Kumar Chandragupta, golferI continued to follow my golf exercises and practiced golf swings during the lockdown. When I came in first, I only played 9 holes as I was tired, today I played all the 18 holes as it takes time to get back into the habit of playing 18 holes.Nalin Mheta, golferGolf course opened in very good condition and it is very well managed.

14-09-2020||Kolkata||Eye on polls, Mamata Banerjee launches party’s new Hindi cell on Hindi Diwas||In a bid to woo Hindi-speaking voters in some of West Bengal’s urban, semi-urban and industrial belts where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bagged seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday launched an all-new three-tier Hindi cell of her party. India observes Hindi Diwas on September 14, the day on which the Constituent Assembly adopted Hindi as one of the official languages in 1949. Dinesh Trivedi, former Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore, one of these industrial belts, has been appointed chairman of the restructured Hindi cell which will have separate committees at state, district and community block levels. Also Read: PM Modi, Amit Shah extend greetings on occasion of Hindi DiwasThe decision, senior TMC leaders said, was based on recommendations made by election strategist Prashant Kishor. Kishor, who earlier helped the BJP, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and YSR Congress win elections, was roped in by Banerjee after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 seats to 22. The BJP poses a challenge to Banerjee in the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls. Though Banerjee gave official language status to Hindi in 2012, within a year of coming to power, the TMC’s old Hindi cell was practically non-functional, party leaders said. Vivek Gupta has been made president of the new cell. Banerjee on Monday afternoon reached out to the Hindi-speaking population with her tweets on Hindi Diwas. “Warm wishes on #HindiDiwas. Bengal is a land of inclusivity and through our persistent efforts we have proudly inculcated Tagore’s values of ‘Unity in Diversity’.GoWB has taken various initiatives to strengthen Hindi Education, Culture and Welfare of the community in Bengal,” she wrote. Warm wishes on #HindiDiwas.Bengal is a land of inclusivity and through our persistent efforts we have proudly inculcated Tagore’s values of ‘Unity in Diversity’.GoWB has taken various initiatives to strengthen Hindi Education, Culture and Welfare of the community in Bengal (1/2)“GoWB has constantly persevered to undertake inclusive development for all by giving recognition to Hindi, Urdu, Gurmukhi, Ol Chiki, Rajbanshi, Kamtapuri, Kurukh languages. I urge the Centre to follow suit by also including Bengali as a classical language in NEP 2020,” said her second tweet. Trivedi too held a press conference where he spoke in Hindi and talked about the recognition Banerjee has given to ethnic languages. “The reconstituted Hindi cell will have a three-tier structure… We believe this would ensure greater representation to people from the Hindi community within the party, provide a platform to make suggestions, address their grievances and make them active stakeholders in Smt Mamata Banerjee’s cause for furthering all-round development in Bengal,” the TMC said in a statement. “The Hindi Cell would actively strive towards strengthening Hindi education, culture and overall welfare of the community in Bengal. We believe the work that began in 2011, will only get greater impetus through this reconstituted Hindi cell,” the statement added. In 2019, Trivedi lost the Barrackpore seat to Arjun Singh who left the TMC and joined the BJP. Singh’s son and brother are legislators from two assembly segments in Barrackpore. Among the other BJP-controlled Lok Sabha constituencies that have a substantial Hindi-speaking population are Midnapore, Asansol and Darjeeling. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who is the MP from Midnapore, was in Delhi on Monday to attend the Lok Sabha. “All these years Banerjee had been saying that Bengali and Bengal will prevail over others. Now she is suddenly giving plum posts to Hindi-speaking leaders. A party cannot run like this. She is trying to copy the BJP but minus the policies that we follow,” Ghosh told reporters in Delhi. “It appears that Banerjee wants to use the Hindi language to counter religious polarisation,” said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/eye-on-polls-mamata-banerjee-launches-party-s-new-hindi-cell-on-hindi-diwas/story-XwRHdwZ1eNHIiYtrfRzX5N.html
14-09-2020||Pune||Pune civic chief visits Katraj as overflowing lake revives memories of 2019 flash floods||The two hours of heavy showers saw water logging on most of the roads in and around Katraj lake, which began overflowing on Friday night. On Sunday, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar along with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator Ashwini Kadam visited the areas affected by rain. Looking at the condition, corporator Kadam has placed demands to the PMC and asked for quick action. Kadam said by accumulating trash and soil over the years, the depth of Ambil Odha stream has reduced. This has caused an overflow with usually one or two heavy spells of rain and spreading fear in the nearby residents. There should be a provision to release water from Katraj lake like other dams so that it will not cause flood situations. The corporator also demanded that illegal constructions shall be demolished to broaden the height and width of Ambil Odha stream keeping the vision of future requirements (of next 50 years). It will help to survive situations like a cloudburst. The boundary walls shall be erected immediately to protect residents. Although, the situation did not turn grim like the flash floods of September 2019 but the high-intensity flow of water brings back the memories of 2019 when 26 people died and caused massive damage to property. “None of the PMC officials came to help Katraj people. The JCB which you saw (Facebook live video) was my private and whole work yesterday night was done by party members and local people,” said Vasant More, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) corporator said. The water from Katraj-Kondhwa road was overflowing and water entered in few areas of Shelar Mala, Katraj. More and more members from the MNS party were actively working till midnight to clear the passage of water flow. The damage like broken walls bent electric poles and debris have not been cleared by PMC officials. “In the complete one year, even after complaints from people, PMC still has not done any repair work. Since pipelines are damaged, water entered few areas. Our members released water on the right time and made sure it did not cause much damage,” said More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-chief-visits-katraj-as-overflowing-lake-revives-memories-of-2019-flash-floods/story-xuqs9ND668BGf4HBVz14VJ.html

While Hengale was in the examination department of the institute, Kumar is a former student, according to the police.“He was working in our examination department. He shared the contact details of the students. That was our initial complaint. We formed a committee and corrected the situation and informed the particular students as well. There were no financial transactions, fortunately. He accepted his guilt and tendered his resignation,” said Swati Mujumdar, director, Symbiosis Open Education Society.Symbiosis Centre for Distance Learning, which operates under the Symbiosis Open Education Society, found the leak of data back in December 2019.The incident took place between September 2018 and December 2019 and a complaint was lodged in December 2019. However, a case in the matter was registered on Saturday, according to college officials. Whether Mujumdar did manage to get in touch with any of the students is a matter of investigation.“We have asked the police to investigate whether marks were changed at all. That was in December 2019. Since then, we have rectified the situation. Most of the over 170 students had not even failed. These are on-demand exams that students can take at any time. To the few students who could have been affected, we asked them to take a re-exam and they willingly did,” said Mujumdar.A complaint in the matter was lodged by Namdev Kumbhar (58), an official of the college, a resident of Model Colony.“The issue was brought to light by the IT cell of the college itself.

14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police get 10-day custody of Umar Khalid after his arrest under anti-terror law||A Delhi court on Monday sent Umar Khalid to 10-day police custody day after his arrest under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for alleged role in the conspiracy behind the February riots in the national capital.Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riotsSpecial public prosecutor Amit Prasad had told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat at the Karkardooma district court that Khalid has to be confronted with voluminous documentary evidence.The Delhi Police’s special cell is looking into a larger conspiracy case in addition to multiple cases filed in connection with the riots that left 53 people dead and close to 400 injured.In separate charge sheets related to the riots, the police have said Khalid met suspended and jailed Aam Aadmi Party’s councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)-National Register of Citiznens (NRC) to allegedly plan the riots. He has been interrogated twice in the last two months for his alleged role. The police have also linked Khalid’s speeches to the riots.Khalid’s lawyer, Trideep Pais, told the court during the virtual hearing that the police have to clarify where he gave the speeches and show the proof that his client asked people to come and protest. He added Khalid is against the CAA and he is not ashamed of it. Khalid’s father, Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, has accused the Delhi police of targeting those who participated in the protests against the CAA and NRC.“This is nothing but an attempt to corner the activists and silence the voices of those who dissent against the government. The Delhi police have been trying to weave a false story by naming few people who participated in the anti-CAA-NRC protests, including Umar, as the ‘masterminds’ behind the north-east [Delhi] violence. However, everyone knows who was actually behind the riots.”The riots were triggered following clashes between supporters of the CAA and its opponents.The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims, who have entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh before December 31, 2014, triggered protests across the country. Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India NRC. A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from the NRC in 2018.Khalid was arrested after being questioned twice. He has denied the allegations, calling the inquiry a conspiracy.Shocked that an anti-terror law UAPA has been used to arrest a young, thinking, idealist like @UmarKhalidJNU who has always opposed violence and communalism in any form.He is undoubtedly among the leaders that India deserves.@DelhiPolice can't detain India's future for long.Also Read: Umar Khalid’s arrest: Activists, academicians, politicians express solidarity, call it a ‘witch-hunt’Hussain, Jamia student Meeran Haider, Jamia Coordination Committee’s Safoora Zargar, and Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita have also been arrested under UAPA on charges of allegedly planning and executing the north-east Delhi riots.The riots were triggered in the run-up to the assembly elections in Delhi and right-wing groups have also faced accusations of fanning them.Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav called Khalid a thinking idealist and added he is shocked that an anti-terror law has been used to arrest the activist who has always opposed violence and communalism in any form. “He is undoubtedly among the leaders that India deserves. @DelhiPolice can’t detain India’s future for long,” Yadav said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/umar-khalid-produced-in-court-delhi-police-seeks-10-day-custody/story-RR98Lx89UbSHNf2ezBmtEO.html
14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab health dept website back in new avatar after four days||The Punjab health department’s website, pbhealth.gov.in, that had not been working since September 11 was restored at 3pm on Monday with a new look. The message on the homepage read, “Welcome to the new website of Department of Health & Family Welfare, Punjab. The updation of the website is in progress.” The website provides updates on the Covid-19 situation, intimates the public about government instructions to hospitals besides contact details of nodal officers and control rooms, and uploads public notices and media bulletins. It also provides details about the Covid-19 protocol for non-resident Indians (NRIs) headed for Punjab. The Punjab government website, punjab.gov.in, has a webpage of the Punjab health and family welfare department but it contains only contact details of ministers and senior officials of the department. There was concern among health staff and people as the website had stopped working at a time when the Punjab government is trying to counter rumours and misinformation about Covid-19 on social media. There have been rumours of organ smuggling of Covid-19 patients being spread on social media, resulting in people avoiding getting tested or hospitalised for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-health-department-website-catches-virus-in-covid-time/story-ypa8lGoIpgJXG7mR1VKUJP.html

The Delhi police have issued a clarification saying these individuals have not been named as accused in the case.Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riotsThe riots were triggered following clashes between supporters of the CAA and its opponents.

He has been booked under several charges including UAPA, sedition and conspiracy for murder.

14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar back in Chandigarh after recovering from Covid-19||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday returned to the state capital of Chandigarh from Gurugram after recovering from Covid-19 and urged people to religiously follow all guidelines such as wearing masks and observing social distancing to stay safe. He asserted that there was no need to be afraid of coronavirus, but we have to remain vigilant. After testing positive for novel coronavirus on August 24, just two days before the day-long monsoon session of the state assembly, Khattar, 66, was admitted to Gurugram’s Medanta hospital for treatment. He had developed fever and body ache three days before testing positive on August 24. He was taken to the hospital around 2.30am on August 25 where he remained admitted for the next 17 days. He was discharged on September 10 after he tested negative a day earlier. It was decided that he will rest in Gurugram for three days after his discharge. THANKS HOSPITAL STAFF, WELL-WISHERS Talking to reporters in Gurugram shortly before leaving for Chandigarh, Khattar said he had fully recovered though doctors had advised him to monitor his health for the next 10 days. “I want to thank all those who wished and prayed for my speedy recovery as well as the doctors who were involved in my treatment,” he said. A multidisciplinary team of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi; Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, Gurgaon civil surgeon Dr Virender Yadav, and Medanta’s Dr Sushila Kataria reviewed his condition, line of treatment and progress made, a state government statement had said earlier. OFFICIAL WORK KEPT CM BUSY Replying to a question, he said while he was on the road to recovery, he kept himself engaged with official work. To another query, he said he can’t say for sure from where he contracted the infection, but just before catching the virus, he had attended official meetings in Delhi. One of the meetings Khattar attended days before he tested positive was with Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who also tested positive later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-back-in-chandigarh-after-recovering-from-covid-19/story-Qo05ZDhE4MjHpm9rqNtV7H.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Political slugfest continues over Kangana Ranaut’s departure||Political parties are engaged in a slanging match after actor Kangana Ranaut left Mumbai for her hometown Manali in Himachal Pradesh (HP) on Monday.Ranaut is locked in a bitter war of words with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, over actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probe.The Congress and the NCP criticised Ranaut for her studied silence about the alleged drug nexus in Bollywood. The Opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party, questioned the Maharashtra government for allowing her to leave Mumbai. “When she says that she has the information about the Bollywood drug mafia, she should have ideally gone to the Mumbai NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau) office and recorded her statement. Instead she is going back to Manali,” said Sachin Sawant, a spokesperson for the Congress. Sawant said two inferences could be drawn from her radio silence. “Either, she is not disclosing the fact that in itself is a crime, or she has made up a story,” he added.The NCP criticised Ranaut for driving her own personal agenda. “She is defaming Mumbai because she plans to join politics. It is sad that she is defaming Mumbai, which has given her everything,” said Nawab Malik, who belongs to the NCP and also a minister in the MVA coalition government. “That’s alright, she has only this work now (to make statements against Mumbai). The people can clearly see her love for Mumbai through these statements. Mumbaikars will now decide whether she can live in Mumbai or not after she equated Mumbai with Pakistan occupied Kashmir. She has got a dual personality. She’s an actor too. Whatever script she’s given, she will say those lines... journalists should investigate who has given her the script,” Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab said, reacting to Ranaut’s statement.The BJP criticised the MVA coalition government for Ranaut’s departure from Mumbai. “Home minister Anil Deshmukh had said Maharashtra Police would investigate the allegations that Ranaut used to consume drugs. Was she investigated? How come the state government allowed her to leave Mumbai in the first place without questioning her?” asked Atul Bhatalkar, a BJP member in the Maharashtra legislative assembly (MLA). Ranaut tweeted that she was leaving Mumbai with a heavy heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-political-slugfest-continues-over-kangana-ranaut-s-departure/story-V1Qp7yGxsREnYCW1Dnnh0M.html

The court will pronounce the sentence on Wednesday. Dey, who was 34, was strangled with the cable of a mobile phone charger. Anindita Pal Dey, who is also a lawyer, was also accused of tampering with evidence. Dey’s body was found on the floor of the couple’s bedroom. Anindita initially told the police that he fell from the bed and had a heart attack. “I want maximum punishment for her,” said Samir Dey, the victim’s father, who was present in the court on Monday. “It is the victory of truth. The verdict has proved that evidence has the last word,” said Bibhas Chatterjee, the public prosecutor. Anindita, who was out on bail till now, was also present in the court. The police had arrested her six days after the murder. She made contradictory statements for six days in an apparent bid to mislead investigators, the police said. Avvaru Ravindranath, the then deputy commissioner (detective department) of Bidhannagar City Police, said she broke down during interrogation and confessed. “The contradictions in her statement became apparent after the autopsy report confirmed that Dey’s death was caused by strangulation,” Ravindranath told HT in December 2018. The police said the couple often fought over the number of phone calls that Anindita made. The couple had allegedly quarrelled on the night of the murder as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/wife-of-calcutta-high-court-lawyer-pronounced-guilty-of-murdering-him-in-2018/story-vyOMl7PrQ80JihLQYC698J.html
14-09-2020||Lifestyle||Unlock 4.0: Fitness enthusiasts rejoice as gym and yoga institutes reopen in Delhi||“The last six months have been financially exhausting for all of us. I’m glad the government finally decided to heed to our demands and allowed reopening of gyms in the city,” says Ankur Sehgal, owner of two centres of Strength Gym in Paschim Vihar, Delhi. Most gym owners and fitness enthusiasts in Delhi are happy with the recent orders that permit reopening of gyms and yoga institutes, within the guidelines that mention how strictly these places need to follow social distancing and other standard operating procedures due to Covid-19 situation.Gym owners feel that the resumption of their businesses will help them pay their employees. “I’ve been lending a helping hand to all my employees, and did not lay off anyone. But, this wasn’t the case with all places in Delhi as many lost their jobs during the time when gyms and other fitness centres were asked to remain shut, and not everyone had an alternate source of living. Hopefully now all those people will get some financial support,” adds Sehgal. Fitness enthusiasts are excited that they’ll be able to resume their regime, which had taken a hit because of the temporary closure of gyms. “Ever since the lockdown, I tried working out at home and used various apps to keep myself fit. But, it was extremely tough for me to maintain a routine. Now that the gyms are opening up again, I’m happy that I’ll have an hour just to myself,” says Rupsi Kumar, a Delhi-based HR professional.Arpan Khosla, a Dwarka-based stand-up comedian, is hopeful that people will be careful while resuming their visits to fitness centres amid the pandemic, and says, “Though we are still battling cases of Covid-19, I feel it’s a good thing that gyms are reopening since they are important for a person’s physical and mental health; both of which have deteriorated during the pandemic. But, I hope all the safety measures are followed!”“We will ensure all safety measures are complied with,” says Nikhil Kakkar, COO, Gold’s Gym India. Sharing that the safety of their staff and members is on top of their mind, he adds, “Trainers have been asked to wear masks and gloves at all times, and sanitisation stations have been erected at all centres. We will follow basic cleaning and disinfecting protocols, and will sanitise the clubs on an hourly basis. There will be less members for each session in order to main social distancing.”Since the orders came in late night on Sunday, not all gym in the Capital could reopen on Monday morning as many were busy making arrangements to ensure they run in compliance with the Covid-19 safety protocol. But some gym owners are still feeling the pinch of delay in the decision to reopen the gyms. “This decision should have been taken three months back, when salons were allowed to open across India. We made several representations to the government in the last four months, which went unheard,” says Istayak Ansari, founder and director, UFC Gym India, adding that the losses that the industry has suffered will take at least a year to recover. “There has been zero revenue for the last six months, and gym members are expecting their memberships to be extended for the Covid-19 period. This will also lead to revenue loss in absence of any help from the government,” says Ansari.In non-containment zones, yoga institutes have also been granted permission to reopen. Poonam Arora, who runs Priyasha Yoga Studio in Rohini, says, “I’ve reduced my batch size, and am screening all members (before they enter the class).

It’s expenditures have also risen by around Rs 600 crore because of Covid-19 relief measures, according to the latest available figure. Last week, BMC’s general body slashed Rs 2,500 crore from the funds allocated to various infrastructure projects in Mumbai such as coastal road, Gargai dam and road works.The civic body has asked all its departments to slash their revenue expenditure by at least 20%. BMC has also incurred losses from delayed collection of property, water and sewerage taxes during the lockdown period and also a loss of income in the development plan department. All departments have been asked to communicate to the accounts department how they plan to reduce their revenue expenditure. The order was issued by the accounts department 10 days ago.Revenue expenditure is the cost incurred by the civic body to keep its machinery running, including establishments and administrative costs, pensions and gratuity, and operations and maintenance costs. However, the slashing of revenue expenditure will not affect establishment cost, pensions, and corporators’ funds. “On many instances, it is noticed that departments use this money before the close of the financial year only because it is allocated in the budget,” the circular stated. In February, the then BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had presented a budget of Rs 33,441 crore, of which Rs 18,797 crore and 14,637 was revenue and capital expenditures, respectively. The budget had also enlisted measures to reduce revenue expenditure incurred by the civic body. It had introduced a hiring freeze in a bid save the civic body Rs 250 crore a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/income-hit-by-lockdown-bmc-looks-to-cut-costs-this-year/story-fmsGKpqvxewLh7HYWZnu5L.html
14-09-2020||Chandigarh||Kangana makes quiet return to Himachal, steers clear of media in Chandigarh||Unlike her high-profile departure on September 9, Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut made a quiet arrival at Chandigarh airport on Monday afternoon on her way from Mumbai to her native place in Himachal Pradesh. Kangana left Mumbai “with a heavy heart” in the morning, saying she has been terrorised with “constant attacks and abuses” and declaring that her analogy comparing the city with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was “bang on”. The actor, whose comments triggered a spat with Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena, did not talk to the media at the airport and only waved from a distance. Last week, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) took exception to the videography by TV channels on board her Chandigarh-Mumbai Indigo flight, saying such action was prohibited which compromises air safety, creates chaos and violates norms. The aviation regulator issued an order for commercial flights stating that violation of in-flight norms will invite a suspension of that scheduled route for two weeks. The actor has been aggressively criticising the film industry and the way it functions since the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June. She initially said it was not a suicide but a “planned murder” by an industry that does not acknowledge outsiders. She escalated her attack to tackle the alleged drug nexus in the industry, as well as targeting the Maharashtra government for its handling of the case. She sparked anger after she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Her spat with Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut led to her receiving Y-plus security, a detail of around 10 armed commandos who accompany her whenever she travels. On her arrival in Mumbai last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation exempted Kangana from the 14-day home quarantine rule for those arriving from outside the state after she submitted an online application for the exemption as she was on “a short visit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kangana-makes-quiet-return-to-himachal-steers-clear-of-media-in-chandigarh/story-UMHmJWYN7hLOQmqZliOCVL.html

She also called the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government ‘Sonia Sena’ alluding to Congress’ partnership in the coalition. She said that there is a ‘reign of terror’ in Maharashtra.In a separate tweet, she also accused the state of inciting feelings of anti-nationalism and said that real freedom is in danger. She also said that her “voice was silenced” and she “paid the price for exercising her freedom.”The actor was referring to the recent series of events in Maharashtra. She had criticised the film industry and the Maharashtra government over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Her tussle with the Maharashtra government intensified when she compared the state to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. After her spat with Shiv Sena lawmaker Sanjay Raut over the remark she was assigned Y+ security cover. The actor’s office in Bandra was also demolished by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday. BMC alleged that there were illegal alterations made to bungalow but the Bombay High Court stayed the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bollywood-actor-relieved-to-have-returned-from-mumbai-safely/story-WP4YMRt730H0z51J5ZHtyL.html

14-09-2020||Delhi||‘Delhi Police trying to mute voices of those who dissent against govt’: Umar Khalid’s father||Activist Umar Khalid’s father, Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, on Monday accused the Delhi police of trying to mute the voices of dissent against the government and weaving a false story a day after his son was arrested under the anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).The Delhi police’s special cell on Sunday arrested Khalid, 33, for his alleged role in the conspiracy behind the February riots in the national capital.Ilyas said Khalid is being targeted for participating in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“This is nothing but an attempt to corner the activists and silence the voices of those who dissent against the government. The Delhi police have been trying to weave a false story by naming few people who participated in the anti-CAA-NRC protests, including Umar, as the ‘masterminds’ behind the north-east [Delhi] violence. However, everyone knows who was actually behind the riots.”Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riotsThe CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims, who have entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh before December 31, 2014, triggered protests across the country. Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India NRC. A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from the NRC in 2018.Illyas alleged the Delhi police were using the same “tactic” as used in the Bhima Koregaon case in which intellectuals and activists have been accused of conspiring with Maoists to foment violence near Pune two years ago. He added stringent provisions of UAPA have been invoked in the case to ensure that the arrested persons stay in judicial custody for a longer duration.“The Delhi police are replicating what has been happening in the Bhima Koregaon incident investigation for the last two years. They have been arresting activists without any concrete evidence and invoking UAPA against them. The Delhi police are doing the same in this case. Every time they questioned Umar, they told him that they do not have concrete evidence against him but still, they have arrested him,” he said.Also Read: Delhi riots: Filmmakers Saba Dewan, Rahul Roy called for questioningIn at least four charge sheets related to the riots, police have said Khalid met suspended and jailed Aam Aadmi Party’s councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site against the CAA-NRC to allegedly plan the riots. He has been interrogated twice in the last two months for his alleged role.Illyas accused the police of carrying out a “witch-hunt”. “It is the clear message from the Delhi police that no one will be spared if they raise a voice against the CAA and NRC. It is just an attempt to curtail any possibility of protests against this Act in the future… They are recording false statements against certain people.”At a virtual press conference on September 4, Khalid said the police have been following two kinds of laws in Delhi -- one is for the supporters of the ruling party and another is for the people against whom evidence is being manufactured.Ilyas said the family will fight for justice. “They [police] have been trying to seek his custody. We will fight against it. But the family is not afraid. We are used to this witch-hunt now.”Hussain, Jamia student Meeran Haider, Jamia Coordination Committee’s Safoora Zargar, and Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita have also been arrested under UAPA on charges of allegedly planning and executing the north-east Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-trying-to-mute-voices-of-those-who-dissent-against-govt-umar-khalid-s-father/story-FNK4gotl2Er8nmgtxSivUI.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||Remarriage during pendency of appeal against divorce not void: Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that a second marriage performed by a Hindu during pendency of an appeal against a decree of dissolution of h/her marriage -- though prohibited by law -- cannot be termed legally binding.The HC held that such an act cannot also be termed as a contempt of court.Justice Anil Kilor last week held that Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, allows remarriage only after the dismissal of appeal against a decree of divorce, but since no consequences for contravention of the provision are provided in the Act, a remarriage during pendency of appeal cannot be termed void.“It is clear that having provided no consequences of a marriage performed in contravention of Section 15 of the Act, it cannot be said that such marriage would be void,” said justice Kilor while dismissing a petition filed by a resident (35) of Akola, Maharashtra.The judge also rejected the petitioner’s contention that her husband, a teacher (40), who also belongs to Akola, was liable to be punished for contempt of court for having performed a second marriage during pendency of her appeal challenging the decree of divorce passed by the Akola district judge.The couple had got married in December 2003, but their conjugal ties were strained from the outset. Soon, the wife left her husband. He filed for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion, but a joint civil judge rejected his divorce petition in October 2009.However, the Akola district judge allowed the teacher’s appeal on November 25, 2015, and dissolved the marriage by a decree of divorce. Then, the woman moved the HC and while the appeal was pending, her husband remarried on March 20, 2016.The woman contended that under the Contempt of Court Act, 1971, willful disobedience of judgement, orders, directions and “other process of a court” are punishable as civil contempt.She argued that since the right of appeal under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is a “process of a court”, her husband was liable to be punished for having committed civil contempt.Justice Kilor rejected the argument, observing that the “willful disobedience” is related to the same command issued by a court between admitting a legal proceeding to giving its verdict.The judge clarified that during these stages various commands need to be issued by a court such as issuance of summons, deposit of cost, compelling appearance of any expert or person as a witness, production of documents or record etc, and disobedience of any such orders would come within the ambit of “other process of a court”.But, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that contravention of provision of Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 would amount to willful disobedience of “other process of a Court”, as contemplated under the Contempt of Court Act, 1971, the HC observed.“In the said backdrop, I am of the considered view that performance of a second marriage during the pendency of appeal would be a contravention or a breach of prohibition stipulated under Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, but in no case it would amount to disobedience of any command of the court,” said Justice Kilor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/remarriage-during-pendency-of-appeal-against-divorce-not-void-bombay-high-court/story-DOx3MTmK4Rh0Uy9B852kON.html

Her mother was also brutally injured in the incident that took place around 9.30 am at their home in Barola village, under Sector 49 police station limits, the police said. “When a local police team reached the spot, the woman was found injured and the child was found dead. They were immediately taken to a hospital, where the woman is undergoing treatment,” Additional Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh said. “An inquiry from neighbours and other locals revealed that the man was an alcoholic and often fought with his wife. They had a major fight day before yesterday also,” Singh said. The accused, identified as Amit, is a native of Bulandshahr district. He worked here and stayed with his family but is absconding now, according to the police. The accused also informed the family of his wife Renu that the child has died but told them it happened due to some other reason, the police said. “He tried to misinform his in-laws,” the Additional DCP said, adding that it prima facie appears that Amit killed his child and wounded his wife. An FIR has been lodged at the local police station and efforts are on to arrest the man, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/3-year-old-dies-after-father-allegedly-smashes-her-on-floor-during-fight-police/story-1L9W7C7k1jCS0qEYgmHJUJ.html

14-09-2020||City||Health research picks up in Bihar in last decade, but still limited, says study||A study published in an international peer-reviewed journal this month has found an extraordinary rise in health research output from Bihar, the third most populous state of India, post-2010. “For the ten-year period from 2010 to 2019, a total of 706 research articles was published during this decade, which is more than 70% of total health research output on Bihar. In terms of growth, this was more than five times higher in output as compared to the previous decade. Clinical subjects (25 %) followed by leishmaniasis (23%) were the most common theme.”The study by Keshri VR and Tigga NS and published in Global Health Reports said medical institutions (45%) were the biggest contributors to health research and over 60% of papers were authored by a lead author from outside Bihar with a majority not having a local co-author.Also read: Centre revises most Ayushman packagesThe majority of lead authors of research papers based on Bihar were affiliated to an institution or organisation outside Bihar (61.5%). But a majority of the research papers in basic or clinical research domain were led by authors located in Bihar (54.7%).Researchers based in other Indian states and outside India contributed to 41.2% and 16.6% of the research papers on Bihar. Among international authors, the highest proportion was based in the US (8.4%), followed by European countries, including the UK (5.6%). The location of the lead authors of around 3.8% of total papers was either not mentioned or was not available.Leishmaniasis, an endemic disease whose 80% of the total cases in India are reported from Bihar, was the most common subject funded by both national (53.1%) and international (31.5%) funding sources.The study, however, found the number of papers per million of the population was 0.1 and 2.9 for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh compared to 9.3 for Karnataka. It cites inadequate teaching and research facilities as significant bottlenecks of Bihar’s health sector.The study has called for a policy intervention to address Bihar’s “very limited health research output”, which is also not aligned with the priorities of health systems and disease burden.“Overall, the health research output from a group of eight large states with 46% of the population of India accounted for less than 10% of total health research output of the country. Health in India is a subject matter under the jurisdiction of state governments and a significant disparity in health systems and health research output indicate skewed priorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-research-picks-up-in-bihar-in-last-decade-but-still-limited-says-study/story-lBuvjStpacq6UDDI0tFFqM.html

While 9,467 students will take the exam in online mode, only 3,313 have chosen to appear for it in-person.According to the DU’s officiating dean (examination) DS Rawat, of around 12,780 registered students,10,780 are from the School of Open Learning (SoL) and around 2,000 are those enrolled in regular colleges and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). “While regular students and those from NCWEB will visit their respective colleges and departments to take their exams, those enrolled in the school of learning (SoL) have been allotted centres located in different areas across the city,” he said.HT had on September 11 reported that only a quarter of students appearing in the second phase of DU exams have opted to appear in-person for their exams. In some colleges, including Sri Ram College of Commerce and Aryabhatta College, no student had registered to appear in the second phase of the exams physically. The exam will be held between September 14 and October 1.The colleges selected as examination centres for SoL students included Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, Deen Dyal Upadhayay (DDU) College, Deshbandhu College, Saheed Bhagat Singh College and Shyama Prasad Mukherji College for Women (Girls), along with three other SoL centers.DU will conduct the second phase of its open-book exams for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students who could not appear in the first phase, that was held online between August 10 and August 31. This time, the students have been given the option to either write the exam online or visit the university’s examination centres to take the tests.The university’s examination department had last week issued a detailed advisory to all the colleges and asked them to be ready with thermal scanners, sanitisers and masks before the exams commenced. At the colleges or examination centres, students will be asked to submit an undertaking declaring themselves free of any symptom of Covid-19. They have been asked to carry their own paper sheets to write the exams; gadgets such as mobile phones or laptops to download the question paper, sanitisers, masks, gloves, and a transparent water bottle.Payal Mago, principal of Shaheed Rajguru College in Vasundhara Enclave, said that they have exams in two shifts at their college on Monday. “In the first shift we are expecting only seven students.

14-09-2020||Education||Order inside NEET exam halls, but many parents flout norms||The country’s most competitive medical entrance examination, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), was held in more than 3,800 centres across the country, with strict protocols necessitated by the pandemic, which had also led to the exam being postponed twice previously this year.The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to various medical courses and 15,97,433 candidates had registered to appear in it this year.While the exam began at 2pm, students were asked to report at their respective examination centres in staggered slots from 11am onwards to avoid crowds at a single time in any centre. Outside centres, students were required to stand inside circles drawn on the ground and spaced five or six feet apart. Candidates’ temperatures were checked before they were allowed into the centres, and upon entering, students were handed fresh face masks and asked to sanitise their hands. Examination halls were allowed to accommodate a maximum of 12 candidates at a time to allow social distance. Students were not permitted to carry anything other than the admit card, ID cards, two passport-size photographs, a sanitiser and a transparent water bottle. The exam concluded at 5 pm.Over 110 centres in the Capital were earmarked for the exam, and around 54,000 students were supposed to appear in it, with many travelling to the city from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Among the aspirants was Ankit Mehra, 17, who had taken a roadways bus from Haryana’s Rohtak district to his centre in Mayur Vihar. “I took an auto from the bus stand to my exam centre. I was initially scared because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, but I am satisfied with the arrangements made at the centre,” he said.While many students travelled to the centres in private vehicles, some took taxis, while others used the Delhi Metro, which began operations early on Sunday, in view of the exam. Shrishti Bansal, 18, a resident of Dilshad Garden, who used the Metro to travel to her centre in Rohini. “It was more convenient to take the Metro than a taxi. I was glad the service restarted operations before the exam, because we don’t own a vehicle,” she said.Many students, however, said they had a tough time writing exams while wearing gloves. Rubina Siddiqui, 18, a resident of Shankar Vihar, said, “It’s very challenging to write an exam while wearing a mask and gloves. It would have been better if the exam was being conducted on computers at the centres.”Most students, however, said they were relieved the exam is now over. Sweta Singh, 19, a resident of Lakshmi Nagar, said she had dropped a year to prepare for NEET. “I was getting very anxious because of the delay in the exam... I was waiting for this exam for the last 18 months, and am glad it’s finished now,” she said.The NTA allowed in students with high body temperature, but no other Covid-19 symptoms. At an examination centre in north Delhi’s Raj Niwas Road, special arrangements were made for a student after her temperature was recorded to be above the normal. “The student had no other symptoms. We made her sit and take the exam in a separate room,” an official at the centre said.Meanwhile, many parents complained that social distancing was not maintained outside several examination centres. Ramesh Singh, a businessman from Narela whose daughter appeared in the exam at a centre in east Delhi, said, “There was so much crowd outside the exam centre at around 5pm. Many parents were not even wearing masks. People continued to gather there despite officials trying to disperse crowds and requesting parents to keep a distance.”Similar concerns were raised by parents from an examination centre in Narela. Amit Sehgal, father of an 18-year-old aspirant, said, “My son was satisfied with the management inside the exam centre, but the crowd management outside was very poor. There was a sea of parents outside the centre in the evening, with no proper distancing maintained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/order-inside-neet-exam-halls-but-many-parents-flout-norms/story-rzW6gORcBvQlO94rcqrbKL.html
14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi gyms: Select few reopen, most remain shut due to late night order||A select few gymnasiums resumed their services on Monday morning because owners either were making the necessary arrangements to ensure proper sanitisation and hygiene following the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, or were unaware of any such order being passed by the Delhi government that has also allowed yoga centres to operate.In a late night order on Sunday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed gymnasiums and yoga institutes to reopen with immediate effect on condition that they strictly follow all the Covid-19 safety protocols that have been put in place by the government.Also Read: Delhi govt permits gyms and yoga centres to open under Unlock 4On Monday morning, a few small gymnasiums in the national capital reopened, but most of them largely remained shut.Sunil Kumar Tonk, the owner of Black’s Gym, which has 16 fitness centres across Delhi-national capital region (NCR), said he would need up to three days to reopen all his gymnasiums.“The order came so late on Sunday night that most gymnasiums owners still do not know about it. On Monday and Tuesday, I shall hold meetings with the heads of my fitness centres to ensure that all the safety measures are in place. We will reopen the fitness centres after taking all precautions,” Tonk said.But, Spartan’s Gyms and Aerobics centre at Vikaspuri reopened at 5am and by 8:30am at least five members had used the facility.Lucky Wasan, the owner of the gymnasium, said he was ready with all the preparations. “We have sanitised our premises and equipment. Everyone is wearing a mask while working out. However, our changing rooms are shut for now,” Wasan said.Aditi Rai, a member of the gymnasium who came for a workout session, said the Delhi government’s decision is a big relief for her. “Working out is like meditation for me. For all these days, I somehow adjusted with home workouts, but there’s nothing like sweating it out in the gymnasium with your peers and trainers to pump you up. However, a drawback is that high intensity workout gets difficult while wearing masks. The breathing pattern is somewhat compromised,” she said.There are over 6,000 gyms and fitness centres across the national capital that employ more than 100,000 people.Sunday’s order stated that gymnasiums and yoga centres would be allowed to operate with immediate effect only if they strictly follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) laid down by the Union ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW). “In case of any violation, owner and manager of the premises shall be liable for persecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides sealing of such premises forthwith,” the order, seen by HT, stated. It also directed all district disaster management authorities to ensure that gymnasiums and yoga centres comply strictly with the SOPs in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The SOPs for gyms issued by the Centre on August 3 had restricted yoga and workout sessions to only such activities that do not require trainers to touch members and not more than 10 people per 1,000 square (sq) feet (ft) of space.Facilities such as sauna, shower, body massage and spas were also not be available until further orders. All other social distancing and preventive measures such as hand hygiene and thermal screening at the entrance were to be strictly followed by members and gymnasium and yoga organisers.Face masks will be mandatory at all times within gymnasium and yoga centre premises. Gymnasiums and yoga institutes must ensure a minimum distance of six feet between individuals. They should try and utilise outdoor space by relocating or offering online training classes wherever possible. Specific entry and exit pathways to be created by floor and wall markings and precautionary instructions on posters to be placed within closed spaces are some of the rules issued by the Centre as part of the SOPs.The Central government under its unlock 3:0 guidelines issued on July 29 had allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to reopen across the country from August 5. But the DDMA, headed by Lieutenant- Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, did not allow the resumption of these services owing to a spike Covid-19 cases in the national capital. On August 6, the Delhi government had sent a file to the L-G’s office to reopen hotels, weekly markets, gymnasiums and yoga centres in the national capital.The DDMA on August 19 had allowed the reopening of hotels and weekly markets, but gymnasiums and yoga centres were prohibited until Sunday’s order overturned it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-thanks-to-late-night-order-gyms-yet-to-reopen/story-nuCyDVYkYcrrJOE8s3BmZJ.html

14-09-2020||Delhi||‘Reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid patients’: Delhi govt to private hospitals||With the number of hospitalisations of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the rise, hospitals in Delhi have started running out of intensive care unit beds. Only 35% of the total 2,201 ICU beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across hospitals remain vacant as on Monday morning, according to the Delhi Corona App. With this in mind, the Delhi government yesterday ordered 28 big private hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. The total number of hospitalisations stood at 6,503, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Sunday. This has overshot the highest number of hospitalisations – just over 6,200 - Delhi had seen during the surge in cases in June. Those in hospitals account for only about 22% of the total number of active cases or those still living with the infection in Delhi. The government had set up a committee in the beginning of June to assess the need for hospital beds. Based on the trends then, the committee had predicted that Delhi would need 15,000 beds by the end of June and 42,000 by mid-July. However, the numbers started declining in June-end.The government, in the meantime, had ramped up its bed capacity to over 15,000 and slowly started bringing it down in August when the number of new cases as well as hospitalisations saw a dip. Currently, Delhi has 14,397 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across hospitals – both government and private. Of these, only 15% beds are in the intensive care units and are either with or without ventilators. To increase the number of ICU beds, the government had first directed its own hospitals - Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital - to scale up the number of ICU beds. The three hospitals currently have 600 ICU beds of which almost 48% remain vacant.It is the big private multi-speciality hospitals that are running out of ICU beds, about 85% of the ICU beds in these hospitals are currently occupied.“You see, the patients who had been delaying their surgeries and other planned procedures have started visiting the hospitals in the last one month, with most of the big private hospitals running at 90% of their total ICU capacity. If you look at the statistics from these bigger hospitals in the last three months, they received about 2.5 times non-Covid patients than Covid patients. This means the government would be jeopardising the lives of these non-Covid patients,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India).“Apart from that, this move is also penalising the private hospitals economically. When they say 80% of the ICU beds have to be reserved, it means the beds have to be reserved even if there aren’t any Covid-19 patients. But, the government would not be paying the hospitals. It is one thing to say, reserve 500 beds and we will pay for it. Besides, why should ICU beds be kept vacant when someone else might need it,” said Gyani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/reserve-80-icu-beds-for-covid-patients-delhi-govt-to-private-hospitals/story-4kGIhbDola1oUCKhk5sXrO.html

A roadmap in this regard has been sought from the UP DGP. This is a dream project of the UP chief minister. The basis of this force is an order of the high court, which had ordered that there should be a specialised force for civil courts. In all, there will be 9,919 personnel in the force.”Awasthi said five battalions of the Uttar Pradesh Special Security Force (UPSSF) will be constituted in the first phase and it will be headed by an ADG-ranked officer.“Expenses incurred in the first phase will be around Rs 1,747 crore,” Awasthi said.Later, in a statement, he said the force will provide security to the high court, district courts, administrative offices and buildings, metro rail, airports, banks, financial institutions, educational institutions and industrial units.This force will have the powers to search without any warrant. Members of this force will also be able to arrest any person without the orders of a magistrate or a warrant, the statement said.On December 18, 2019, the Allahabad high court had pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government over a shootout at a Bijnor courtroom.Three assailants had on December 17, 2019, opened fire in the court of the Bijnor chief judicial magistrate, killing a murder accused and injuring three others - two policemen and a court employee.The Muzaffarnagar court had witnessed a similar incident in 2015, when an armed man entered the courtroom masquerading as a lawyer and shot dead Vicky Tyagi, an alleged gangster.Chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council, Darvesh Kumari Yadav, 36, was shot dead by a colleague in her chamber on the civil court premises in Agra on June 13, 2019.A two-judge high court bench had said that most incompetent police personnel are being posted at the courts, adding that it will seek the deployment of central forces if the state government is not up to the task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-s-upssf-can-arrest-any-person-without-a-warrant/story-CdAK21jc99LK9gL8dTsqqM.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||Fight Covid-19, not the Opposition or Kangana Ranaut, Fadnavis tells Thackeray||Maharashtra accounts for 40 per cent total deaths in the country due to Covid-19, hence Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should fight against Covid-19 rather than the opposition or actor Kangana Ranaut, said Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra BJP leader. “Today in Maharashtra there are more than 10 lakh Covid-19 patients and our state accounts for 40 per cent total deaths in the country.... Firstly, our Chief Minister should fight against coronavirus rather than opposition or Kangana,” said Fadnavis. Speaking about Bihar elections, Fadnavis said, “We will practise making man to man contact while maintaining physical distancing. The credibility of our opposition parties has ended. People will bless our alliance.” Earlier on Sunday, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis in Bihar’s Ara said that the beating up of a former Naval officer in Mumbai is a kind of “state-sponsored terror”, and reiterated that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should stop the “gunda raj”.“What happened is very wrong. This is a kind of state-sponsored terror. As I did through my tweet yesterday, I call upon the Chief Minister to stop this gunda raj. Six people were arrested yesterday after pressure from the media but were released within 10 minutes. I do not think Maharashtra has ever seen such a situation before,” Fadnavis said while speaking to the media here.Fadnavis reached Bihar on Friday ahead of the state assembly elections along with BJP national president JP Nadda as part of his two-day visit to poll-bound Bihar.Earlier on Friday, Madan Sharma, a former Navy officer alleged that he was beaten up by goons from the Shiv Sena after he forwarded a message on WhatsApp.“An extremely sad and shocking incident. A retired naval officer got beaten up by goons because of just a WhatsApp forward. Please stop this Gunda Raj Hon Uddhav Thackeray ji.

14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Long rest in Shidipura||The world is so much at turbulence. But here, all is at peace. Which isn’t surprising for this is a graveyard.Shidipura Qabristan, near Filmistan Cinema in central Delhi, isn’t huge, far smaller than that more famous Muslim graveyard—Dilli Gate Qabristan in ITO. But within its limited geography, it exists like an isolated autonomous land, free of the constraints existing beyond its walls.This morning, no one’s here. The only sound is of the cooing of birds hidden amid the thicket of tree leaves. While the hyperactive squirrels are playfully running after one another over the fallen leaves. Some distance away, a long tail slithers under a cover of crackling dry leaves—is that a snake? A large number of graves have plants and weedy grass growing out of them. Some are so thick with this flora that they appear to be like flower pots. The stone slabs of a few graves show long undulating cracks, the surface of the stones have smoothened over the passage of several seasons. As in all cemeteries, it is fascinating to read the inscriptions carved on these gravestones. Quite a few of the buried people here are referred to as “waley”, meaning belonging to. For example: Haji Tajiuddin Tahir Papaiyye Wale. Another gravestone belongs to a woman. The carved inscription doesn’t give away her name. Instead, she is identified as “W/O Late Mohd. Aslam Culcutta Wale.”The graveyard shows absolutely no sign of the life going on outside. While strolling along the narrow track dappled with the shadows of tree leaves, one feels so far removed from the world that coronavirus and all the other news headlines of the day seem like a rumour. But there’s one material exception to this utmost detachment —the colourful paper kites trapped among the trees. Indeed, if you look up, you would keep spotting more and more kites—perhaps they belong to the area’s kite players and drifted over unto the graveyard after their strings were cut.And finally, a living human is sighted. The elderly man is alone. He is carefully sprinkling grains beside a succession of graves. “It’s for birds,” he says, explaining that he comes daily to the graveyard to feed the birds.On stepping outside the cemetery’s gate, the road is clogged with auto rickshaws and cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-long-rest-in-shidipura/story-HSHy8LFJqrNyGSgZQ4nVOI.html
14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s plan for 2041 to revive old colonies||The Master Plan of Delhi-2041, which is the vision document for the city, will spell out a detailed “regeneration policy” for areas that have come up decades ago and now need better civic infrastructure. Though the current master plan also allows redevelopment of existing areas but the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has asked the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which is preparing the next master plan, to work on a regeneration policy keeping the ground realities in mind.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “The regeneration policy will be one of the key focus areas on the new Master Plan. It is an important aspect, as large parts of the city were developed a long time back.”“The city has grown over the years and so has the infrastructure requirement. Regeneration of old areas in a planned manner will help in providing better civic infrastructure and basic amenities,” said Jain.Officials said the policy will only provide a legal provision and a road map for redevelopment but it is up to the people of a particular locality to pool in land — the critical component to build new facilities — for more amenities with the DDA only facilitating the effort. Experts say that bringing people together for such projects was the reason why only two major projects —East Kidwai Nagar and the seven pool residential accommodation colonies — could be taken up under the redevelopment policy under MPD-2021. Since government was the land owner, there was no hurdle in the projects. Several housing societies in Indraprastha Extension in East Delhi, which came up in the late 70s and early 80s, have been demanding redevelopment. Despite several efforts by some residents, no redevelopment projects were sanctioned in this area. Madan Khatri, president of Vikalp cooperative group housing society, said, “For nearly a decade, we have been running from pillar to post to get the benefit of the redevelopment scheme. Our societies are designed as per the 1962 MPD and can’t meet the growing civic infrastructure needs. We want the DDA to clearly draft the redevelopment policy so that people can benefit from it.”The resident welfare associations say that the policy will be beneficial for residential colonies that came up four-five decades back. “There are several double-storeyed resettlement developments in Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar etc., which came up in the 60s. These colonies don’t have the adequate civic infrastructure. But the DDA should spell out the norms, as getting people together for redevelopment is difficult,” said Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs across Delhi.Urban development experts agree that a regeneration or redevelopment policy is needed, as there are several areas, especially urbanised villages, unauthorised colonies, resettlement colonies, where redevelopment is the only way forward to improve the quality of life. But instead of a broad policy, efforts should be made to chalk out area-specific plans, they added. To ensure that the policy gets implemented and people actually benefit from it, AK Jain, former planning commission with the DDA, said the policy should encourage community-based approach and be area specific. “For the redevelopment, we can’t have a blanket policy for all the areas. It should be area specific as the problems of an urbanised village are very different from a plotted colony or unauthorised colonies. There are other issues too which needs to be addressed,” said Jain.The policy can be useful in improving the civic infrastructure in developing areas with mixed land use, resettlement colonies, unauthorised colonies, rural and urbanised villages and slums.Sanjukkta Bhaduri, professor of urban planning and dean research at the School of Planning and Architecture, said areas such as Mangolpuri where several resettlement colonies came up in the late 1960s. “Redevelopment is the only way forward for these areas. But it should be based on the local area plan which must be prepared ward-wise. We also need to assess the impact of the project on the nearby areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-plan-for-2041-to-revive-old-colonies/story-vKrvcCdVLyfPJJiJo2W5NN.html
14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi assembly session today; 4 MLAs coronavirus-positive||A day ahead of a one-day special session of the Delhi assembly, at least four MLAs had informed the Vidhan Sabha secretariat that they have tested positive for Covid-19. All legislators had been asked to mandatorily get tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) before attending the session on Monday and carry the report with them. The session will be conducted with all Covid-19 protocols, officials said, with the legislators being allowed to sit on a first-come-first serve basis and following strict social distancing norms and wearing face mask. Assembly secretariat officials said the MLAs who have tested positive until Sunday evening were BJP MLA from Ghonda Ajay Mahawar and AAP MLAs from Wazirpur Rajesh Gupta, from Kirari Rituraj Jha and Surendra Kumar from Gokalpuri. Besides legislators, 214 officials, security personnel and support staff were also tested through the rapid antigen test, of which three tested positive. These include two Delhi Assembly officials and one Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector.“Apart from these four, 29 MLAs had got RT-PCR tests done at the Delhi Assembly on Friday. While 22 legislators have tested negative, results of seven are awaited. Rest of the MLAs can either bring their Covid test reports on Monday or get a rapid antigen test done on the Assembly premises before the session begins,” a senior government official, said on condition of anonymity. According to the list of business, the session will have no Question Hour. However, it will have a special mention session where a few MLAs selected by Speaker Ram Niwas Goel will be allowed to speak. “Members (MLAs) have been requested to confine the text of the Special Mention to 8-10 lines only and not to deviate from the original text, while raising the same on the floor of the House. Any deviation will be disallowed and treated as summarily expunged from the proceedings. The matter should relate to only one department and raise only one issue,” Goel said.In the remaining part of the session, various bills and order will be tabled for the approval of the House. These include the recent tariff order issued by the Delhi electricity regulatory commission (DERC) and the Delhi goods and services tax (amendment) bill, 2020.While Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators are planning to talk about the ‘Delhi Model’ in Covid-19 management during the special mentions, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) MLAs said they would raise the issue of demolition of 48,000 slums along Delhi’s railway tracks. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “If the Delhi government fails to rehabilitate the slum dwellers, then BJP will do it and rehabilitate them in the vacant flats. The BJP will vociferously raise the issue of 48,000 slum dwellers ordered to be removed from railway land during the Assembly session,” said Bidhuri.This will be the second session of the assembly to be convened during the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously, a one-day session was held on March 23 to present the budget.

The victim’s mother too changed her statement on Sunday. “The girl told the CWC members that Jaspal alias Jassa (20) of Boot village raped her on the pretext of resolving dispute with her boyfriend. She, however, said sarpanch Billu, Gagan, and Manpreet did not rape her,” said Bholath deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Jatinderjit Singh. The police on Saturday had arrested Jassa and booked three under Sections 376-D (gangrape) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). “We are investigating the matter. There is no other evidence against them (sarpanch and 2 others). The FIR will be quashed against the three,” superintendent of police (investigation) Sarabjit Singh said. The case is also being supervised by the district legal service authority (DLSA) and CWC members and they are ensuring financial and medical assistance to the victim as per the POCSO procedure.

14-09-2020||City||Eight-fold rise in weapon seizures on Indo-Pak border in Punjab this year||The recovery of weapons by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the India-Pakistan border in Punjab witnessed an eight-fold spike this time as compared to the corresponding month last year. According to officials, 32 weapons of different types, including AK-series assault rifles and Berretta pistols, were seized along the border till September 12. Last year, the figure was only 4 till September 30. The BSF personnel seized 12 and 19 weapons along the Punjab border during the entire year in 2019 and 2018. Also, a spike of more than two-and-a-half times was witnessed in the recoveries of heroin along the international border this year, said BSF. The BSF seized 394-kg heroin along the border till September 12 against 149kg till the corresponding period last year. “Pakistan is really desperate to push in consignments of weapons for Kashmir and anti-national elements in other parts of the country. Prima facie, it appears the weapons are being smuggled to encourage terror activities in India,” said a senior BSF official. “Not only the quantity of heroin recovered increased but also the number of incidents of consignment being pushed into the Indian territory went up. In 2019, the incidents of smuggling were less as compared to this year. We noticed that at least one pistol — either of Pakistan or China make — is being smuggled from across the border with each consignment of heroin,” the official added. BSF inspector general (IG Punjab frontier) Mahipal Yadav said, “Right now, I don’t have access to the data and therefore can’t make any comment on the issue.” Punjab shares 553-kilometre frontier with Pakistan, apart from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. A senior Punjab Police official, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “After the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, strict security arrangements have been put in place there. Now, some people in Pakistan are trying to sneak in weapons into the Indian territory through the Punjab border.” The biggest recent weapon seizure was in the Abohar sector on September 12 in which the BSF’s 124 Battalion seized three AK-47 rifles with six magazines and 91 rounds, two M-16 rifles with four magazines and 57 rounds and two pistols with four magazines and 20 rounds. Also, last month, the BSF’s 103 Battalion shot down five Pakistani intruders who allegedly opened fire on them in the Dal border outpost of Tarn Taran district. During the search operation of the area, an AK-47 assault rifle with two magazines and 27 rounds, four .9mm Berretta pistols with seven magazines and 109 rounds, 9kg heroin and two mobile phones were recovered. Later, the police arrested four persons — two from Dal village and two from Dhunda village in the district who were to receive the consignment. Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said, “Our investigation into the case suggested that the four arrested men were to deliver the consignment to two persons who have been identified. They are still at large. The motive behind the smuggling of weapons will be clear once we nab the two men.” The SSP said they have been holding meetings with the BSF officials to strengthen the second line of defence in the border areas of the district. “In the coming days, we are planning to install joint check-posts with the BSF,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-fold-rise-in-weapon-seizures-on-indo-pak-border-in-punjab-thsi-year/story-vmses1XlJqNhRjHudIcQ0O.html

14-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai doctor writes about his viral encounters||I got infected with a serious life-threatening virus while working in the present Covid ICU ward of KEM Hospital in Mumbai. This was long ago in 1984. It was then the male surgical ward no. 5. During this pandemic, the same ward has been converted into the Covid ICU. The potentially fatal virus that infected me then was Hepatitis B. Again, in 1995, I was exposed to another serious and dangerous virus while working as a junior surgeon in Sion Hospital, another major public hospital in Mumbai. Did I become HIV positive?A few days ago, I performed a major surgery on an infant which lasted more than 10 hours. It was an operation to create an oesophagus for an infant, who was born without one. A couple of days later, my assistant surgeon, who had worked in Covid ward a week earlier, developed fever and sore throat. He was at high risk for contracting Covid and as we had come in close contact for a prolonged period during the surgery, I got swabbed too. Thankfully, the result was negative. This piece is a relook at my viral encounters with these potentially fatal viruses, the health issues they raised, how society and authorities reacted, the current status of these viruses on this planet and what inferences we can draw from the past for the future of Covid.In 1984, when I came down with Hepatitis B, quite like the Covid virus, most of us, were blissfully ignorant about the microbe. This may seem surprising because the Hepatitis B virus had been detected years earlier. But back then, communication happened at a snail’s pace. No internet, no social media, no email, no mobiles and no 24x7 international TV. Currently, there is an infodemic running parallel with the Covid pandemic. But when I got infected with Hep B, I had to go to the College Medical library and browse through latest journals to understand more about this virus and the symptoms it causes. Unlike the Covid virus, which is an RNA virus, the Hepatitis B is a DNA virus and is transmitted via contact with infected body fluids. I was then, a young, overworked resident doctor (as resident doctors in public hospitals still are) and we had to operate day and night on surgical conditions and emergencies of all kinds. Accidental needle or cautery pricks and the occasional cut while performing surgeries were not uncommon. In the emergency ward, when a gasping trauma patient would be wheeled in, I remember taking an IV line or intubating him without wearing gloves (often because the right size was unavailable). During one such life-saving procedure, the potentially fatal Hepatitis B virus carried by the patient had entered my body via a small cut on palm. I had remained fully healthy and unaware of this for six weeks (the incubation period) and then developed severe Hepatitis and jaundice. For the first week, my jaundice was dismissed as the commoner Hepatitis A, but someone suggested that we should test for this new virus. My HBsAg antigen test came positive. I was feeling sick and tired and had lost my appetite. My library reading informed me that there was no cure or medication for this virus and that it could be fatal. If you survived, you had a much higher risk of developing liver cancer. It was also called the ‘surgeon’s jaundice’. I was down for two months and had lost a lot of weight. The authorities refused my sick leave as they had no such disease in their list of occupational hazards. It was only after I wrote a couple of articles in the newspapers about this new virus that my leave was sanctioned. Today, 30 years later, Hepatitis B is the most common serious liver infection in the world. Two billion people (or 1 in 3) have been infected and more than 292 million people are living with a chronic Hepatitis B infection. Like Covid, there is a simple test to diagnose a hepatitis B infection. Most importantly there is a safe vaccine to prevent hepatitis B. The vaccine gives adequate immunity in 90-95% of cases. Yet, each year up to 1 million people die from Hepatitis B. As of today there is no definite cure. I hope the Covid scenario after a few decades is not the same as Hepatitis B. Vaccines may become available, but will they reach everyone? Will they be as effective as the Hepatitis B one. Generally, the efficacy of the respiratory virus vaccines is not as good. Influenza vaccines prevent the illness in 40-60% cases only.Ten years after my encounter with the Hepatitis B virus, another serious viral danger came my way – the HIV. The world HIV pandemic raged in the 1990s. By then, I was a junior consultant surgeon and India had entered the era of desktops, internet and email. So this time around, when the virus threatened me, many of us were adequately aware of not just its existence but also its mode of spread. One novelty about this virus, unlike those in the past and Covid, was the amount of stigma attached to it. AIDS, the disease caused by HIV, was known to be associated with promiscuity, homosexuality, drug use and prostitutes. I had operated on a middle aged man, who later turned out to be HIV positive. All of us who participated in the operation were at risk. I was tense and got my blood test done. I knew that there was no cure for HIV, and in those days if you got AIDS, death was certain within one year. It was a huge relief when my test came negative. During this evolving HIV pandemic, I recall attending a meeting in the Sion Hospital auditorium to discuss the situation. The auditorium was packed with hospital doctors. Among the various issues discussed, an important ethical question arose – should we do the HIV test on all patients before they are taken up for surgery? The test was expensive. Should the hospital pay for all these tests or should the patients be charged? It did not take much time to reach a consensus that the test be mandatory for all surgical patients. Doctors’ lives were at risk and must be protected. Just as the meeting was about to end, I remember standing up and posing a corollary tricky question – going by the same yardstick, I asked, shouldn’t all doctors operating or doing procedures on patients, also be required to get their HIV testing done ? There was pandemonium and loud disagreement. And as I recall, this particular matter was deferred for further discussion. There is still no consensus on it.As regards AIDS, till today, we do not have a vaccine against the virus, nor do we have a cure. Only life-prolonging medications are available which have essentially made HIV into a chronic disease. Although new infections have decreased, 1.7m people were newly infected in 2018, and worldwide 32m people have died of AIDS. The examples show that scientific cures and effective vaccines can take a long time. The stories of these two viruses also tell us that we have to live with viruses for many years. Viruses will come and stay. And humanity will have to learn to live and adapt to their peculiar ways. As health care workers, we have to learn and adapt even faster. In our hospital we have commenced doing routine surgeries, albeit with enhanced precautions and protection. Although it is still not the time to lower one’s guard, the fear about the virus is decreasing. The other day, I was pleasantly surprised to gather that the staff nurse assisting me in the operating room had been admitted with Covid in May and had now resumed full duties. The casual banter in the OT lounge during tea and lunch breaks is about Covid antibody levels. One staff nurse was lamenting that though she was antibody positive (meaning she has some immunity against the virus) her levels were not as high as her colleagues!And as we come to terms with this pandemic, we cannot forget the lessons the past viruses have taught us. Ultimately, the pandemic may subside, but it will not end. If Hepatitis B and HIV taught us to change our behaviours as individuals, the Covid pandemic has emphasized the need to change our behaviour as a society. We cannot afford to neglect public health any longer.

The police said that they have arrested the “mastermind” of the gang and two suspects are on the run. The police recovered a mobile phone and three registers, three passbooks and ₹22,500 cash from one of the suspect’s possession. The arrested suspects has been identified as Dharmesh Thakur ,38, from Badarpur in Delhi. The two other suspects, who are on the run, were identified as Aakash Verma of Ghaziabad and, Deepak Sharma of Gautampuri in Delhi. The police said that all three suspects are class 10 dropouts.The police said the gang used to operate from different locations and often work from a moving car to evade being identified.The police said Thakur was the mastermind of the gang. He had allegedly started duping people in 2018 after getting inspired from movies. He analysed a lot of fraud cases of insurance companies to figure out ways how to dupe people following which he formed the gang and involved his two friends who had an experience of working in call centres, the police said.The police started searching for the gang members after one Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Gururgam, filed a complaint of cyber police station stating that on September 10, 2019, he had received a call from a man impersonating as an executive of a reputed insurance company. The impersonator sent a link to Kumar’s mobile phone and email id following which ₹50,000 each was deducted in four transactions and he lost ₹2 lakh from his bank account.After detailed investigation, a case was registered ay cyber crime police station under sections 420 (fraud) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66D of Information Technology Act on April 30 this year and a probe was initiated in to the matter, said the police.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said a team from cyber police station tracked the location and Thakur’s movement and arrested him from Faridabad on Friday night. “During questioning, he confessed to the crime and revealed that he had formed a gang with his two friends and used to run a small-time call centre to dupe people,” he said.Rao said the suspects used to make calls using data they had bought through an executive working in a call centre in Delhi. “They used to send a link on people’s mobile phone and email id after luring them with heavy discounts of premiums of life insurance and cashback schemes. They used to get the money transferred through e-walltets and used to keep changing locations to evade arrest,” he said. The suspects used to pose as officers from financial service firms, seeking takes and payments under various heads.Rao said as per their records, the suspects have duped more than 100 people of over ₹2 crore, but exact details are yet to be ascertained.The suspects, the police said, even underwent a voice and ascent training from BPO trainers so that they could gain their victims’ trust.“During the probe, the police team took details from banks and the details of their phone numbers through which the calls were made. The suspects used to switch off their mobile phones after making the calls used the same mobile numbers every day. The team reached the Thkaur’s location in Faridabad using technical surveillance Friday late night,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-kingpin-of-gang-that-duped-over-100-people-on-pretext-of-selling-insurance-policies-arrested/story-vdcTC7D2GEyFevZ9F15A3L.html

14-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s Covid situation: September already worse than Aug in terms of cases, deaths||In the first two weeks of September, the district recorded 3,108 new cases of Covid-19, exceeding August’s total reported caseload of 3,046 new infections, according to the state health department. In deaths too, the September with 14 deaths has already managed to outstrip August’s count of 10.The month is also set to overtake July when the district had 3,819 infections (33 deaths) and June with 4,689 cases (94 deaths).Health department officials and experts said that this indicated a rapid spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, among Gurugram’s population, and cautioned against non-essential public movement.From 1,686 on September 6 to 2,232 on September 13, Gurugram saw a 32% increase in the number of active Covid-19 cases over the past week, during which it also registered an average of 275 new positive cases each day (up from 191 new cases each day the week prior).The district’s test positivity rate (TPR, which is the number of positive cases per 100 tests), between 9 to 11%, over the past week was above the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) recommended benchmark of 5% over two weeks.On Sunday, when Gurugram recorded its highest single-day jump of new positives yet, recording 339 cases of Covid-19, the positivity rate stood at 9.4%. In the last week of August, the positivity rate was 6 percent (with fewer tests being conducted daily).Dr. Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMER Chandigarh, said, “A high positivity rate is worrying, especially if it coincides with an increase in testing. What you would hope to see is the opposite, fewer proportion of positive cases when there is an increase in tests. Essentially, what the numbers indicate is that Gurugram may once again be undertesting, and is therefore unable to keep up with the spread of the virus.”The district’s total tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 15249, up from 13321 a week ago. That is equal is 1928 new cases in seven days, the highest weekly aggregate since the outbreak began in March. The daily growth rate in new positives, as of September 13, was 2.2 percent, and has remained above two percent for at least two weeks now. This is also reflected in the sharp contraction of Gurugram’s doubling rate, which stands at 48 days as of September 13. For comparison, in the last week of August, the doubling rate was around 81 days.“People are disregarding social distancing and basic hand hygiene. While it’s important to resume normal activities, it shouldn’t lead to carelessness. I would advise people to stay at home as much as possible,” said Gurugram chief medical officer Dr. Virender Yadav. He added that the department is taking necessary measures to shore up testing. In coming weeks, the district’s capacity to test for Covid-19 is expected to touch 5,000 samples per day. At present, the district tests around 3,300 samples per day.Even so, officials pointed out that the newer cases are mild in nature. “Deaths are still low. Most people are in home isolation. Why the cases are milder is still a matter of speculation. It could be a different section of the population is getting affected, or a possible mutation of the virus. We don’t know yet,” said Dr. Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram.The district recorded two new deaths due to Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the total toll to 147. The mortality rate, however, remains under one percent (with 0.97 percent of infections leading to death). This, experts explained, is not unexpected. “Our contact tracing efforts are able to find cases earlier into infection, and with treatment protocols having improved, we are able to keep the mortality low, which is the primary aim,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gururgam.BOX:Test-positivity rate (TPR):September 13: 9.4%September 12: 9.2%September 11: 9.1%September 10: 11.2%September 9: 9.9%September 8: 9.2 %September 7: 5.8%September 6: 11.5%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-covid-situation-september-already-worse-than-aug-in-terms-of-cases-deaths/story-xamnZT4LcM0JdfIdD4ZTyI.html

While four approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court fore relief, one has applied for renewal of license. A meeting under the chairmanship of HSVP administrator Jitender Yadav on Friday decided that an executive engineer of the authority and assistant town planner will inspect these projects and also issue a notice to developers. The notice, Yadav said, will seek information on flats, shops and plots booked, money paid and how much has been paid to land owners. “Basically the objective is to know the extent of third party rights that have been created in these projects. If information is not given to the authority then the officials will visit the offices of these developers and get the information as it is important to resolve the issue,” said Yadav. Yadav further said that, if required, the authority will auction the land or property in these projects so that claims of those who have booked property, pending external development charges and infrastructure development charges (EDC/IDC) payable to the government, and claims of land owners can be fulfilled. The authority estimates that ₹300 crore was pending as EDC/ IDC. Officials of the town planning department and engineering wing of HSVP were present at the meeting. Officials also said that owners who had booked plots in these projects are facing lot of problems as they have taken loans and paying EMIs for projects, which are stuck for years and whose licenses stand cancelled. “Our priority is to ensure that people whose money is stuck in these projects get back their money,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-hsvp-to-auction-land-of-projects-whose-licence-has-been-cancelled/story-HAcj1FQmvL2tNUlzGfnoXI.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||NEET-UG exams in Maharashtra: Very easy, say students at Mumbai centres||Close to 16 lakh undergraduate medical and dental aspirants across the country appeared for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday. A total of 2.28 lakh students from Maharashtra, highest in the country, had registered for the exam this year. Most students found the exam very easy compared to the past few years.While most students found the pre-exam process of admit card checking and frisking before entering the exam centre peaceful and in line with the required safety measures, some complained of unnecessary hassles just before the exam, which added to their anxiety. A city-based school which was allotted as an exam centre found out about it only today and ended up starting the pre-exam process a little late. “The centre displayed its seating arrangement list only by 11.45am and started allowing students to enter the campus post 12 noon. The exam then started at 2.30pm, which is half-an-hour late, but students were given extra time to finish their paper,” said one of the parents, on condition of anonymity. Some parents also complained of crowding outside the exam centres, flouting all social distancing norms. “The exam centre was not equipped with enough manpower to handle the crowd of parents and students. However, a large number of exam centres managed to conduct the pre-exam session very well and ensured staggered entry and exit for students to avoid crowding,” said Ruiee Kapoor, an activist and parent of a medical student. As per the final registration figures revealed by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in January, over 15.93 lakh students registered for the NEET; the number stood at 15.19 lakh in 2019. Maharashtra had topped the registrations for the second consecutive year, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 1.54 lakh and 1.38 lakh students, respectively. A total of 1.19 lakh students registered for the exam from Karnataka and another 1.16 lakh students from Kerala, among other states. Keeping the current situation in mind, NTA had announced that all safety precautions will be undertaken at every exam centre to ensure maximum safety of all stakeholders – staff and students. To implement appropriate distancing during exams, the total number of exam centres was increased from 2,546 last year to 3,843 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/neet-ug-exams-in-maharashtra-very-easy-say-students-at-mumbai-centres/story-Rwfq1J89McYebFvuHeet3H.html
14-09-2020||Gurugram||GMDA to upgrade 30-year-old drains along Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will complete the upgrade of the sewerage lines along the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road by December this year — almost 30 years after they were first laid down, said officials on Sunday.GMDA officials said that the sewerage line along the stretch was laid down in the early 1990s and currently lies in a state of neglect. Also stormwater from nearby drains gets mixed up with sewage, leading to waterlogging on the stretch. GMDA officials said that to resolve the issue, the master sewerage line is being reinforced using the Cured In Place Pipe (CIPP) method, which will increase its life span by another 50 years.“In the CIPP method, a resin tube primarily made of polyester, is inserted from the surface into the damaged pipe. Over time, this new tube starts taking the shape of the existing one. Further, to increase its curing rate, water measuring above 80 degrees Celsius is added. In simple words, a new pipe is added within the existing one to give it more strength and resilience, and to fill up the possible gaps and cracks to stop leakage. The biggest advantage of this method is that little to no excavation is required. As such, the work can be completed much faster,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.Kumar said that once the tube is cured, it stretches from one manhole to the other, and hence, work is only done in small patches. Otherwise, a significant amount of excavation would be required.He said that the CIPP method is currently being used on a 1.4-kilometre stretch of the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road for a cost of ₹7 crore and that the GMDA is hoping to complete the project by December.GMDA officials said that this stretch is one among the many other master roads in the city, where drainage lines will be upgraded or replaced. The decision has been taken in the wake of the severe waterlogging that the city experienced last month on August 19 and 20. Kumar further said that a significant number of drains across the city are 30-35 years old, and are in the dire need of upgrade.“We have started making plans for enhancing the next leg of sewerage drains, between IFFCO Chowk-Signature Towers-Rajiv Chowk along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. This is a key stretch as lakh of heavy vehicles cross the stretch on a daily basis. If we don’t strengthen the existing drains than they can easily collapse under the weight of heavy vehicles, and may develop leakages, which can subsequently affect the road surface as well. Work on this will start shortly,” said Kumar.Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road, a 7.5km-long stretch between Dundahera border and Mahavir Chowk, is one of the oldest roads in the city that provides a direct link between Delhi and Gurugram. More than one lakh vehicles ply over on the stretch on a daily basis, as per GMDA officials.Along with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), GMDA is also looking to widen the stretch from four to six lanes, build pedestrian bridges, cycle tracks and pavements at four junctions — Hanuman Chowk, Jwala Mill T-point, Sector 18 T-point and Sector 21 T-point. This project is expected to cost ₹55 crore, a large portion of which will be spent in building new or fixing old stormwater and sewerage lines, said GMDA officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-upgrade-30-year-old-drains-along-old-delhi-gurgaon-road/story-PcT2z1QxBF7sBf5UwDf4GP.html

14-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Vehicle thefts surge post lockdown as police launch crackdown||The number of snatching cases in the city may have put Gurugram Police on its toes , but it is the surge in vehicle thefts in the past few months that is giving the force headaches.The city police has decided to crack the whip on vehicle thieves after data available with it suggested that the vehicle thefts have shot up considerable ever since the 68 day lockdown was lifted. Gurugram police have so far has arrested more than 50 people from Nuh, Faridabad, Delhi and Rajasthan, who they said were involved in stealing vehicles. Last year, between January and September 10, around 2,804 vehicle theft cases were reported from the city. This year, at least 1,742 cases have been reported, a dip of 37.9%, with the police saying that the lockdown having played an important role, with a three layer security ring and heavy deployment of personnel during night time also helping. However, despite all the measures in place, the city witnessed 54 cases of vehicle theft in May, 115 in June, 210 in July and 289 in August. In comparison, number of vehicle theft cases registered in April this year was just 34.The city now witnesses at least seven cases of vehicle theft, on an average, daily. The gangs involved in the crimes often are from nearby districts and the vehicles are mostly sold in Northeast India and Uttar Pradesh at half the price, said police. lice commissioner K K Rao said that a crime mapping exercise — which identified areas from where maximum cases of vehicle thefts were reported — has helped them to keep a check on such vehicle thefts. “Since we have identified all the vulnerable spots, teams have been assigned duties accordingly and are coordinating with police control room, so that they know identity of suspects and the roads that they take to flee. We have provided the latest technology — GPS and wireless communication devices — to officials deployed at 147 crime spots, 79 police control room vans and 123 patrol bikes,” he said. Police said they have started analysing the spots through Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System, which accesses real-time data from the police control room. Rao said that they have continued deployment of force in three cordons, covering all roads connecting it to neighbouring districts, including Nuh. “The outer cordon has around 540 cops deployed at the borders connecting to other districts and state. Barricading is done and nakas have ben set up at 147 spots to avoid unwanted entry and to check all suspicious vehicles. The inner cordon is deployed at the vulnerable spots from where most of the street crimes, such as snatching, robbery, and vehicle thefts, have been reported. The last cordon is keeping vigil of dark spots and our focus is on crimes against women ,” he said. As many as 2,500 cops are deployed in the three layers to maintain law and order across the city with all wings of the Police Control Room (PCR), traffic, Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) having been roped in Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that as a result of the lockdown, there has been a marked change in the crime pattern across the city. But that’s not the only reason as to why the number of vehicle thefts had gone up. “The gangs from different areas conduct reconnaissance of the residential areas and target luxury cars and SUVs which are then sold at better prices as compared to others. The gangs are also involved in forging documents to sell these vehicles and these days they are using latest technology to break locks and to start ignition,” he said. Sangwan said that they have intensified night patrolling, increased deployment on roads and added more checkpoints along borders with Delhi and Rajasthan where chances of fleeing with stolen vehicles are high. About 5,800 police personnel are deployed across the city and 1,780 of them are on night duty. Last month, the city police got 59 probationary sub-inspectors, who will also be given the responsibility to tackle crime and to come up with new ideas. “One of the other reasons for the increase in vehicle theft was due to the absence of modes of transport. Last month, most of the motorbikes that were stolen were from parking areas outside hospitals and vacant plots ion residential areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-vehicle-thefts-surge-post-lockdown-as-police-launch-crackdown/story-lTjbJGvvhSmIWU1rUlKOaO.html

After the nationwide lockdown had been was imposed, the restrictions were further extended. The Noida authority had stopped entry of visitors to the main administrative building without appointment. The UP government had asked the authority to execute work online.The authority said it will only allow entry of visitors only after they are screened by thermal scanners.The authority has also launched a new portal— pis.mynoida.in— wherein property allottees can fill up the know your customer (KYC) details and generate a registration number and password. With the help of the registration number and a password, the allottee can get executed most of their property-related works such as map approval, mortgage permission, time extension and transfer of property online. The move is aimed at ensuring that most allottees do not visited the authority office.“We request all the allottees to follow all precautions for their own safety and their safety of others,” said Maheshwari.From June 1, the authority had started meeting its officers on special duty (OSD)-level officials only after appointments, provided the work was important and not addressed without a meeting. Before June 1, meeting with all junior or senior officials, including their entry, was banned inside the authority office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-to-resume-public-meetings-in-its-offices-from-september-16/story-1rfr6TYv8kUAZtYqlrnZlM.html
14-09-2020||Noida||Three-year-old murdered in Noida, parents detained||The Noida police on Sunday detained the parents of a three-year-old girl child who was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her home in Barola village.According to the police officers, the incident came to the fore around 9.30 am on Sunday when the girl’s maternal uncle informed the police about the murder following which the girl’s body was sent for an autopsy.“A team from the Sector 49 police station was rushed to the spot where the girl’s body was found. Her mother had a head injury and when questioned about the whereabouts of her husband she claimed that the latter had murdered the child and assaulted her before fleeing,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), zone 1.The ADCP said the 28-year-old woman was sent for treatment to the district hospital. The girl’s eight-year-old brother was also present at the spot, but was asleep at the time of the incident, the police said. However, after he was woken up by his mother, he had called up their uncle telling him about his sister’s death.Initially, the police said, that when police officers had tried to reach the girl’s father, his phone was switched off and they suspected him to be on the run. However, on Sunday afternoon, the father, who worked as an electrician, turned up at the Sector 49 police station. He claimed that he had been out of town in Mathura since Saturday for a religious ceremony and had nothing to do with his daughter’s death, the police said. “We are verifying his claims. He has also alleged that his wife killed their daughter” said ADCP Singh.The police said they also questioned the couple’s neighbours who told them that domestic flights were common between the two. The family is from Bulandshahr and live in a rented house in Noida.The police said they suspect that the mother could be behind her daughter’s murder.They further said that when they questioned the mother again, they found many inconsistencies in her statement. Her head injury also seems to be self-inflicted, the police said. A police officer, who did not wish to be identified, said it appears that the girl died on Saturday night, but the mother’s injury seems fresh. He added that the autopsy will confirm the time of death.“We are questioning both the husband and wife, though it increasingly seems that the mother is responsible for the murder. Due action will be taken soon in the matter.

14-09-2020||Delhi||Okhla Bird Sanctuary to reopen for visitors after five months||In what comes as good news for bird watchers and nature lovers, the district forest department is reopening the Okhla bird sanctuary for visitors from September 15, officials said. The sanctuary, spread over 400 hectares, is home to about 350 species of birds and the only declared eco-sensitive zone of the district, was shut for visitors since past five months in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The sanctuary was closed in late March when the nation-wide lockdown was announced.“We have decided to reopen the Okhla Bird Sanctuary from Tuesday. It was closed in March in wake of the nationwide lockdown. This was the first time the sanctuary had been closed for visitors for such a long time. We hope that nature lovers, especially birders, can enjoy their visits again, with better infrastructure,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest department (DFO), Gautam Budh Nagar. Officials said all precautions will be taken. Some surprises such as a high-resolution 360-degrees camera for real-time monitoring of birds, a new command centre, more shelters and sheds, including sitting areas and new signage highlighting the flora and fauna, also await visitors. “There are some simple protocols, such as visitors will be scanned for temperature at the gates, their hands will be sanitised and there will be no entry without masks. We are also installing new signboards by Monday to remind visitors to keep their masks on and maintain social distancing,” said Arvind Mishra, range forest officer of Okhla Bird Sanctuary.Speaking of the new infrastructure, officials said a new camera has been installed near the lake for monitoring waterbirds in the upcoming birding season of October 2020 to March 2021.“The high-resolution IP speed dome camera, which has a capacity of optical zoom of 45 times and can do a full-sweep, 360 degrees view, has already been installed on a dedicated tower in the lake. This will give a live feed of the birds at the new control centre developed inside the sanctuary. We have completed all the infrastructural works and the display will be made functional from October 1. It was delayed due to the Covid-19,” said Srivastava.The Sanctuary recorded 21,061 water-birds of 115 different species, as per the annual census undertaken by the forest department in February 2020 for the birding year of 2019-20.Migratory birds start arriving in the sanctuary by October, while their strength reaches its peak by December. Their departure begins by March and by April-mid they are all back at their breeding grounds in central and north Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/okhla-bird-sanctuary-to-reopen-for-visitors-after-five-months/story-DUM3pJ7SKJBogPOUzFHVLN.html

14-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Sion hospital accused of misplacing body of accident victim||Family members of 28-year-old Ankush Sarvade, who succumbed to injuries from a road accident while undergoing treatment at Sion hospital on Sunday, have accused the hospital of erroneously handing over his body to the family of another person who died of suicide. The Sarvade family also claimed that the other family, that has not yet been identified, carried out the last rites. Sameer Siddiqui, a friend of the Sarvade family, on Sunday told Hindustan Times, “Ankush died due to his injuries in the wee hours of Sunday, and the family was informed by the hospital of his death. When they came to claim the body, they requested the hospital to give them 15 minutes as more family members were arriving. After a while, when they returned to claim Ankush’s body, they found it was missing. Later, they got to know the body was handed over to another family by mistake.” Siddiqui said the family would approach Sion police to file a complaint of negligence against the hospital. Two employees of the mortuary were suspended and an inquiry will be initiated against them, said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital, in an official report on the incident late on Sunday night. The report stated orders for the suspension and subsequent inquiry were given over the telephone by additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani who is also in-charge of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) public health department.The deceased’s sister, Jayashree Sarvade, took to social media to highlight the issue in a video. She said, “He met with an accident and had an injury on his head. We took him to Sion hospital. On Sunday at 2.30am, the hospital called us to inform that the patient, my brother, has died. After everything, the hospital told us the body had been handed over to someone else. That family even completed the last rites. We want my brother’s body back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sion-hospital-accused-of-misplacing-body-of-accident-victim/story-XxiMhjRvMeWxLVhA5EZRZL.html
14-09-2020||City||Testing takes a hit in Ghaziabad as TrueNat kits exhausted, new RT-PCR lab accepting only 250 samples per day||Ghaziabad: The testing capabilities of the district have taken a hit as the only TrueNat machine, which is used for testing for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, at MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad has exhausted all its kits. Also, the newly inaugurated lab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has not been testing samples sent by the district health department. Doctors at the District Women’s Hospital, which is located in the same complex as the MMG District Hospital, said samples of their patients have not been tested through the TrueNat machine since September 10. About 15 deliveries, including caesareans (c-sections), take place at the hospital every day, on an average.“Earlier, we were using a mix of TrueNat and rapid antigen testing for our patients to acertain whether they have Covid-19. However, since September 10, MMG Hospital has stopped accepting samples from us as they say they do not have testing kits. In such a case, we are testing our patients with rapid antigen kits only,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of the District Women’s Hospital, which is a non-Covid government facility.The TrueNat machine was provided to Ghaziabad district by the state government and its negative result for a sample is considered confirmatory.A positive result via the rapid antigen kits, meanwhile, indicates a true positive but needs a subsequent RT-PCR test to confirm, in case the test comes out negative.The lab was inaugurated on August 15. Initially it accepted about 300 samples from the district health department. As per rules, the facility can cater to the health services run by the district administration only.“Our patients, who undergo C-sections, are at major risk as they have to stay in the hospital for at least five days, during which their relatives and other family members also come for visits. So, without any confirmation of their Covid-19 status, there is a risk of exposure. Women undergoing normal deliveries are less at risk as they stay in the hospital for only 24 hours after which they are discharged,” she added.She added that the hospital authorities are, however, taking all precautions to prevent any spread of Covid-19 from any suspected patient.Further, the new RT-PCR testing laboratory, which was inaugurated by Atul Garg, Uttar Pradesh’s minister of state for health, on August 15, is yet to be fully utilised for the purpose of testing of Covid-19 samples taken by the district health department.“The new laboratory has not been accepting samples sent by us, which are collected by our teams from different locations across the district. We take up about 3,000-3,500 samples, which includes about 900-1,000 RT-PCR samples. In such a case, we have had to send our samples for testing to laboratories in other districts, including those in Noida,” Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said. Ghaziabad MLA and minister of state for health Atul Garg did not respond to calls. The new lab, according to officials of MMG Hospital, is currently testing about 200-250 samples per day.“We are still waiting for an RNA extractor machine, for which we have already written to state officials. This will help us reduce the time taken for testing. We have been given a target of 200 tests per day. Once we receive the RNA extractor machine, we can increase this to about 1,000 a day and will also be able to increase the number of shifts to three as against two at present,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG Hospital who is also in-charge of the new laboratory.He said that samples of only those patients who are themselves coming to MMG Hospital are being taken up by the lab, He added that a new RNA extractor machine costs about Rs 30 lakhs. “The trueNat machine has not been functional since September 10 as the testing kits are exhausted. We have informed the concerned authorities about the issue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/testing-takes-a-hit-in-ghaziabad-as-truenat-kits-exhausted-new-rt-pcr-lab-accepting-only-250-samples-per-day/story-lBdNSIOMd2RzrBoUm8IpKI.html

In line with the Supreme Court’s interim stay on Maratha quota in jobs and education, the state education department stayed the admission process for FYJC until further orders. The second merit list, which was supposed to be declared on September 10, has been postponed as a result of this. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), nearly 3.1 lakh seats are up for grabs this year for which more than 2.12 lakh students have applied. With the delay owing to the procedure, parents, students and colleges have requested the education department to release a revised academic schedule. “Even as the government has reduced the syllabus by 25%, it is going to be challenging for the students to study the remaining in the very little time that is left. An alternate academic schedule should be declared for this year,” said the principal of a suburban college. An official from the education department said a revised schedule had not been made yet, adding, “Government instructions are awaited in the matter.” Uday Nare, teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public school in Andheri who has written to the government in this regard, said, “Teachers and parents are worried that these students would have to face an academic loss due to the delay in the procedure. Some solution needs to be arrived at by the government with the state education department to make the year less stressful for the students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/complete-fyjc-process-soon-parents-colleges-urge-maharashtra-government/story-354J3wiSWe3cFHdX7FzQSK.html

Following this, the DDMA on August 19 had allowed opening of hotels and weekly markets, but gyms and yoga centres continued to be prohibited.Sunday’s order stated that gyms and yoga centres will be allowed to operate with immediate effect only if they strictly follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) laid down by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. “In case of any violation, owner and manger of the premises shall be liable for persecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides sealing of such premises forthwith,” the order, seen by HT, read. It also directed all district disaster management authorities to ensure that gyms and yoga centres comply strictly the SOPs to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The SOPs for gyms issued by the Centre on August 3 restricted yoga and workout sessions to only such activities that do not require trainers to touch members and not more than 10 persons per 1,000 sq feet space.Facilities like sauna, shower, body massage and spas will also not be available until further orders. All other social distancing and preventive measures, like hand hygiene and thermal screening at the entrance, are to be strictly followed by members and gym/yoga organisers.Face masks will be mandatory at all times within gym/yoga centre premises. Gyms and yoga institutes must ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between individuals and plan floor area based on 4 metre square per person. They should try and utilise outdoor space by relocating or offering online training classes wherever possible. Specific entry and exit pathways to be created by floor and/or wall markings and precautionary instructions on posters to be placed within closed spaces are some of the rules issued by the Centre under the SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-allows-gyms-yoga-centres-to-reopen/story-xK6DeSoRNuACyTOZ7u7sXN.html
14-09-2020||Delhi||Monday challenge: DMRC to make 4500 trips to meet rush||After seven days of trials and errors and staggered reopening of its entire system, Delhi Metro is keenly forward to Monday — the first full working weekday when the entire network will become operational after nearly six months and the first acid test of all the safety and social distancing norms that have been put in place. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation plans to make 4,500 train trips from Monday , as it expects a surge in ridership. Nearly 1.5 lakh people had taken a ride on the Metro on Saturday, when the entire network spread over 389kms was made operational for the first time after nearly six months.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials expressed confidence that even if the crowd increases, they are ready to deal with the increase in ridership, while ensuring all safety norms to contain the spread of Covid-19. Going by the gradual increase in ridership between September 7 and September 12, when the entire network was thrown open to the public, DMRC officials are expecting a dramatic increase in ridership from Monday.The DMRC switched back to its pre-lockdown schedule on September 12, with trains operating between 6am and 11am on all 10 corridors, at a gap of 2.5 minutes to 6 minutes, on an average. With the number of commuters gradually increasing, the challenge before the Metro is to run its services at pre-lockdown speed while following all the Covid protocol, which involves social distancing and sanitisation of the trains.Anuj Dayal, executive director, DMRC, said, “Over 4,500 trips will be made with 294 trains across the network, including Airport Express Line. A team of around 8,000 housekeeping staff will look after the overall sanitisation work across the network. Around 1,500 Delhi Metro officers and staff along with civil defence volunteers are being specially deployed at the stations to facilitate commuter movement, in addition to the regular staff.”DMRC officials say that the new system has been carefully worked out. While all measures are in place, DMRC officials have urged commuters to avoid unnecessary travel, especially during peak hours. “We would also request the commuters to stagger the timing of their journeys, so that we can all avoid the peak hour rush,” Dayal said.Dayal added, “Delhi Metro officers and staff along with civil defence volunteers will be deputed at the stations to facilitate commuters. Adequate availability of sanitisers as well as thermal scanners has already been ensured. Flying squads have been deputed to ensure adherence to Covid 19 related norms inside the system.”Due to low turnout, as compared to the pre-lockdown period, DMRC’s train operations have been affected in the first week of its opening.While DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh had urged commuters to “break the peak”, the Metro has put in place a mechanism to avoid crowding at stations. A DMRC official said that from Monday, the DMRC might start empty trains or short loop some trains to manage crowded zones. “We have worked out a clear strategy to manage crowding at stations. We may opt for starting certain empty trains from terminal stations or short loop some trains to manage the crowded zones on a particular route/sections, if need be,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monday-challenge-dmrc-to-make-4500-trips-to-meet-rush/story-DP4HWVyccnhBUUn9E4804N.html

14-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 surge to stabilise in 2 weeks: Govt||The Delhi government said on Sunday it expected the fresh surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital to stabilise in 10-15 days, even as it announced measures to augment health care infrastructure in the city to tackle growing active cases and boost the critical care system at hospitals.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain ruled out further lockdown restrictions in Delhi, arguing that they were no longer a solution to the pandemic and implored the public to wear masks and maintain hygiene. “It [the surge] is very much on expected lines, and will stabilise in 10-15 days,” he said at a digital news conference.Jain attributed the spike to aggressive testing undertaken by the Delhi government in recent days, as well as the easing of restrictions in a bid to revive the economy, which was hit severely by the pandemic.All private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in Delhi have been allowed to increase their bed capacity by up to 30% and 33 major private hospitals have been asked to reserve 80% of their intensive care unit (ICU) beds for patients suffering from the viral infection.The move to augment hospital bed capacity comes at a time when Delhi is seeing a record surge in Covid-19 cases. The Capital on Saturday added 4,321 new cases of Covid-19 — the highest single-day spike in the city so far. Another 4,235 new cases of the infection were added on Sunday.He said that although around 50% Covid-19 beds in the city were vacant, ICU beds at a few major private hospitals were running out, with patients preferring private health care facilities to government-run ones.“I held a meeting through a video conference with all private hospitals on Saturday. They have agreed to our plan. Orders have been issued to allow all Covid-19 hospitals in the city to increase their bed capacity by 30%, if required, while 33 major private hospitals have been asked to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. These are hospitals that have 50 beds or more. If some of these ICU beds are currently occupied with non-Covid patients, then they must be included for Covid-19 patients after the existing ones are discharged,” Jain said.The minister explained that if a Covid-19 hospital has 100 beds, it would be allowed to increase its capacity to 130 beds, according to the latest order.At present, Delhi has 14,372 hospital beds, of which 7,924 are lying vacant. Of these, 489 ICU beds with ventilators and 277 ICU beds without ventilators are unoccupied.The Delhi government’s decision came after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 9 asked officials to draft a plan to increase Covid-19 bed capacity in Delhi, especially ICU beds.As HT first reported on September 9, the situation is worse in multi-speciality private hospitals in the national capital. Over 89% of ICU beds with ventilators in 11 private hospitals were occupied until Friday, while 82% of ICU beds without ventilators in eight private hospitals were also filled on that day.Delhi recorded the highest-ever total hospitalisation due to the contagion in a single day on Friday after 6,294 people were admitted. The previous record was 6,264 during the Covid-19 surge in the city in June-July.“Wearing masks reduces the chances of spreading and contracting Covid-19 significantly. The public should wear masks. The government is also running an intensive awareness campaign on the importance of masks. Everyone should wear a mask and follow strict social distancing norms. We have moved far away from the times of lockdown. That (lockdown) is not going to happen again,” Jain added.Hospitals and mohalla clinics are also testing asymptomatic people amid a boost in testing in the Capital.However, the count of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered to be the most accurate to diagnose Covid-19, continued to remain low in comparison with the less accurate rapid antigen detection (RAD) test.Data showed 9,182 swab samples — 15% of all the tests — were tested on Friday using the RT-PCR method, according to Saturday’s health bulletin.Jain said the results of the third serological survey, which was conducted in Delhi between September 1 and 5, would be announced in a few more days as the study of the samples is still in progress.He added that the test positivity ratio of Delhi of a single day is 7.19%, whereas the national test positivity rate is about 8.8%. “Delhi recorded 28 deaths as per Saturday’s bulletin which brings down the mortality rate of the last 10 days in Delhi to about 0.68%, which is much lower when compared to the national average of 2.23%,” Jain said.The Delhi government’s decision to reinforce hospital bed capacity is on the right track, said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“It is good that the government has finally done something about the low availability of ICU beds in major private hospitals. The government, however, should also simultaneously improve its contact-tracing exercise. Also, surveillance should be strengthened further and suspected [Covid-19-positive] persons outside containment zones need to be checked for Covid-19 with an RT-PCR test,” he said. Private health care providers cautioned that the move could endanger the lives of non-Covid patients in need of emergency or other life-saving care. Some associations plan to make a representation to the Delhi government on Monday and take legal recourse, if necessary.“The patients who had been delaying their surgeries and other planned procedures have started coming into the hospitals in the last one month, with most of the big private hospitals running at least 90% of their total ICU capacity. If you look at the statistics from these bigger hospitals in the last three months, they received about 2.5 times non-Covid-19 patients than Covid-19 patients. This means the government would be jeopardising the lives of these non-Covid-19 patients,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India).“Apart from that, this move is also penalising the private hospitals economically. When they say 80% of the ICU beds have to be reserved, it means the beds have to be reserved even if there aren’t any Covid-19 patients. But, the government would not be paying the hospitals. It is one thing to say ‘reserve 500 beds and we will pay for it’. Besides, why should ICU beds be kept vacant when someone else might need it,” said Gyani.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the 28 that has been directed to reserve beds, already has a high percentage of beds set apart for Covid-19 patients and the problem is one of sufficient staff, according to hospital authorities.“We had been asked to create a 100-bed ICU initially when we had met the health minister even before the June surge. So, we have been slowly able to ramp up our capacity. Now, we have 117 of 167 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, but with almost all big hospitals doing so there will be a problem for non-Covid-19 patients. For us, the challenge will be manpower, more staff is needed for Covid-19 ICUs so we are in the process of hiring more nurses. Our doctors are also exhausted now,” said Dr DS Rana, chairperson of the board of governors at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-surge-to-stabilise-in-2-weeks-govt/story-jzsKNDZGSCIp9z0fNBl65K.html
14-09-2020||Mumbai||Navy veteran assaulted by Shiv Sena workers in Mumbai: Congress claims BJP MP orchestrated attack on ex-Army man, slams party’s ‘double standards’||Amid criticism over the attack on a retired naval officer in Mumbai by six Shiv Sena party workers, the Congress, which is one of Sena’s ruling partners, claimed a Member of Parliament (MP) from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had orchestrated an attack on an army veteran four years ago and questioned BJP’s “double standards” on the issue. BJP leaders had criticised the Maharashtra government for the attack on the navy veteran, with former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis appealing to CM Uddhav Thackeray to end the ‘goonda raj’ in the state. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant has claimed that in 2016, an army veteran, Sonu Mahajan, was attacked at the behest of BJP MP Unmesh Patil in Chalisgaon area in Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district. “The then BJP government did not register an FIR (first information report) and in fact hounded him. Mahajan had to approach the high court to get the case registered. The BJP has not taken any action against Patil. In contrast to that, our government (Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) booked the accused and arrested them in the present case,” said Sawant. Mahajan in a recorded message spoke of harassment by the BJP MP. “Despite being attacked by Unmesh Patil’s men, I was locked up in prison. It was finally in 2019 that I was able to get the case registered on the orders of the high court. However till date, no action has been taken against Patil or his men who attacked me,” said Mahajan. The BJP was quick to rebuff the allegations as baseless. “Why didn’t the Congress raise this issue all these years? Even the FIR filed in the Madan Sharma (the retired naval officer) case was an eye-wash as all the accused got bail within no time,” said BJP legislator Atul Bhatalkar. On Friday, Sharma was attacked by six Shiv Sena workers in Kandivli after he allegedly shared a cartoon mocking Thackeray. The BJP led the onslaught calling the incident “state-sponsored terrorism”. On Saturday, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh had a telephonic conversation with Sharma and later tweeted that “attacks on servicemen were deplorable and unacceptable”. The Sena, however, said it was not right to drag the party into this issue. “The workers did not take permission from us. However at the same time, it was wrong to provoke people as they have high respect for their leaders,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut. ​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navy-veteran-assaulted-by-shiv-sena-workers-in-mumbai-congress-claims-bjp-mp-orchestrated-attack-on-ex-army-man-4-years-ago-in-maharashtra-slams-party-s-double-standards/story-talEygYL91zsW4pvsKtqtJ.html
14-09-2020||City||Stay away from politics or face consequences: Hizbul to J-K leaders||The Hizbul Mujahideen has allegedly threatened leaders in the Jammu region, including Union minister Jitendra Singh, to “get ready to face dire consequences” if they did not stay away from political activities, according to police.The threat has been issued through a letter written in Urdu on the proscribed terror group’s letterhead, officials said. HT has seen a copy of the letter.Police said the letter was addressed to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)’s Congress vice-president and former minister, Raman Bhalla. “It was delivered at the Congress office in Shahidi Chowk via post on Saturday afternoon,” said Anayat Ali, station house officer (SHO), Pir Mitha police station, Jammu.The two-page letter was signed by a self-styled divisional commander of the Hizbul. Apart from Singh, minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office, it mentioned 17 senior politicians of national and regional parties, including J&K Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ravinder Raina, National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana, Dogra Swabhiman Sangathan leader Choudhary Lal Singh, and other former ministers, legislators as well as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionaries.“We warn you to renounce politics and support our cause for freedom otherwise death warrants have been issued against you. No security cover will safeguard you from us,” the letter read.A case under sections 121-A (waging war against the government of India) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and sections 13 (unlawful activity), 16 and 18 (terrorist act) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA), 2019, has been registered, Ali said.The Hizbul also referred to the killing of public representatives in the letter. “Anyone who is on our target will be gunned down in their homes. This work has already been started. The people who can attack Parliament or Red Fort, can’t they kill you?” the letter read.Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita and BJP leader Waseem Bari were gunned down in the Kashmir Valley in June and July, respectively.Ravinder Sharma, a Congress spokesperson and a former member of J&K legislative council, said the letter was delivered at the party office by post on Saturday afternoon.However, a BJP leader, who did not want to be named, said the letter could be a prank, but he admitted that leaders from his party face threat from terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stay-away-from-politics-or-face-consequences-hizbul-to-j-k-leaders/story-DuzaSOiDzuA6Srb6jZo6mN.html
14-09-2020||World||US government confirms receiving Oracle bid for TikTok||Ahead of a deadline set by President Donald Trump over video sharing app TikTok, US officials will evaluate a bid that could see American tech giant Oracle become a partner to a Chinese company that has been called a national security risk.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Monday Washington had received a bid from Oracle concerning TikTok’s American operations after the video-sharing app’s parent ByteDance rejected a proposal from Microsoft.But key details about the deal were murky and it remained unclear whether the venture would pass muster with Washington regulators.Also read: Q&A: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?“I will confirm that we did get a proposal over the weekend that includes Oracle as the trusted technology partner,” Mnuchin said on CNBC, adding that the bid would be handled by a government panel that reviews foreign transactions for national security concerns. “We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data are secure, phones are secure, and we’ll be having discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams,” Mnuchin said.Oracle confirmed its submission, saying the company “is part of the proposal by ByteDance to the Treasury Department over the weekend in which Oracle will serve as the trusted technology provider.”Trump effectively ordered the sale of the Chinese company’s US operations by September 20, after which the app would shut down.However Chinese state media outlets CGTN and China News Service on Monday reported that ByteDance will not sell TikTok to Oracle, while The Wall Street Journal said the transaction is being structured as a partnership and probably won’t be an outright sale. All three outlets cited unnamed sources.Ban still a threat Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said Oracle’s description of itself under the venture was ambiguous and may not assuage national security concerns.“It is unclear what Oracle means by saying it will serve as ‘TikTok’s trusted technology provider.’ This idea is critical because one major reason for Trump’s executive orders was concern over the threat to national security from Tiktok,” Tobias said.Also read: Microsoft says ByteDance won’t sell TikTok’s US operations to it“Unless much more is done to clarify exactly what the contours of the deal are and how they will work in practice, many observers and I wonder whether the deal will be sufficient to prevent the app’s ban in the US.”TikTok’s brand of short, quirky videos made on users’ cellphones has grown popular in the United States and beyond, but Trump’s claims that TikTok could be used by China to track the location of federal employees, build dossiers for the purpose of blackmail and conduct corporate espionage has sparked a diplomatic storm between Washington and Beijing.TikTok has rejected the charges and sued over the crackdown, contending that the US order was a misuse of its International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform is not “an unusual and extraordinary threat.”Last month, China’s commerce ministry published new rules potentially making it more difficult for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American entity by adding “civilian use” to a list of technologies that are restricted for export.ByteDance had vowed to “strictly abide” by the new export rules.Microsoft bid nixed Downloaded 175 million times in the United States, TikTok is used by as many as a billion people worldwide. It has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing.Microsoft had indicated at the beginning of August that it was interested in acquiring TikTok’s US operations, but announced Sunday that bid had been rejected.“We believe Microsoft would only buy TikTok with its core algorithm, which the Chinese government and ByteDance was not willing to budge,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.“Given the need now to get a green light from Beijing after its export rules were changed a few weeks ago, TikTok’s days in the US likely are numbered with a shutdown now the next step.”S&P warned Monday that the transaction for TikTok could result in a downgrade of Oracle’s credit rating, depending on whether the company needs to take on significant debt for the transaction.“A deal in which Oracle is a technology partner rather than a full owner could lower the price,” S&P said. “And if Oracle has co-bidders, that could further reduce the financial impact.”Shares of Oracle were halted shortly after the open due to the pending news on the company but resumed trading later in the day. Near 1700 GMT, shares were up 4.6 percent at $59.61.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-confirms-receiving-oracle-bid-for-tiktok/story-qt8d2mLnVElYq7w1rHZlYJ.html
14-09-2020||World||Germany break ranks with China, shifts to adopting India-Pacific strategy||In a major diplomatic jolt to China, Germany has decided to focus on maintaining stronger partnerships with democratic countries in the India-Pacific region in order to promote the rule of law.Berlin’s drift towards the India-Pacific strategy comes as Europe has expressed concerns over China’s track record on human rights and its economic dependence on the Asian country, Nikkei Asian Review reported.“We want to help shape (the future global order) so that it is based on rules and international cooperation, not on the law of the strong. That is why we have intensified cooperation with those countries that share our democratic and liberal values,” German foreign minister Heiko Maas said on September 2.That day, Germany adopted the new guidelines pertaining to the India-Pacific approach, stressing the importance of promoting the rule of law and open markets in the region. The India-Pacific strategy has been endorsed by other countries including India, Japan, Australia and ASEAN members.According to Nikkei Asian Review, China had been Germany’s diplomatic focal point in Asia, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel visiting the country almost yearly. It also must be noted that China also accounts for 50 per cent of Germany’s trade with the India-Pacific region.However, as per expectations, economic growth has not opened the Chinese market. German companies operating in China have been forced to hand over technology by the Chinese government. Also, talks between the European Union (EU) and China regarding an investment treaty to resolve such issues have stalled, giving rise to concerns about Berlin’s increasing economic dependence on Beijing.This came amid growing criticism of China’s draconian national security law in Hong Kong and its concentration camps for the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, which has fuelled increasing resistance to Merkel’s pro-China policies.Germany’s new India-Pacific approach takes a tough stand on China, including criticism of the huge debt burden of countries participating in Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative (BRI).German firms have also expressed concerns about doing business and protecting their intellectual property in China, especially after Chinese appliance maker Midea Group bought German robot maker Kuka in late 2016.Europe is appearing to re-evaluate its diplomatic relations with China. Last year, the EU termed China a “strategic competitor”, focussing its trade and technological rivalry with Beijing.“A shift toward a more sober strategy on Beijing has occurred,” Patrick Koellner, at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, was quoted by Nikkei Asian Review as saying.Germany now plans to work with France regarding EU-wide strategy on India-Pacific. Berlin will be looking to strengthen its influence on this issue by having the bloc on its side.France and the United Kingdom have begun freezing Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of their 5G networks. Recently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had undertaken a five-nation official tour in Europe, but the visit did not gain traction and instead led to a growing rift between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-break-ranks-with-china-shifts-to-adopting-india-pacific-strategy/story-TmPmWHuaBQaid2jpbKxyPO.html

This situation has been building up for quite some time now. But with the collapse of the tourism sector due to Covid-19 pandemic, we are in a state of emergency. We need systemic changes and not short-term measures. The climate crisis is unabated. The promise of green recovery cannot be rhetoric,” said Lois Michele Young, a Belizean diplomat and ambassador of AOSIS.She called on donor, developed countries to honour their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. “Official development assistance is needed leading up to COP 26 in 2021. COP 2021 should have enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to keep global warming under 1.5-degrees C. We are on the trajectory for a 3 degree C rise now over pre-industrial levels. 2020 is a critical year, we have a ten-year window according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to correct the trajectory and we are at end of year one,” Young said.Also read: Won’t be enough Covid-19 vaccines till 2024: Serum Institute’s Adar PoonawallaMarla Dukharan, economist and advisor on the Caribbean, said, “Small island countries were in debt even before the Covid-19 pandemic. But now they have to borrow more and the debt to the GDP ratio is skyrocketing as economies are contracting due to the pandemic. They are in unsustainable territory and governments soon will be defaulting. A natural disaster or even Covid-19 can wipe out 40 percent of the GDP for any of these countries in a go.”Dukharan explained that high vulnerability to natural disasters, higher imports, lack of efficiency or achieving economies of scale for various public services have led to debt.According to Climate Action Tracker, only 8 countries have submitted updated NDCs; 2 have proposed updated NDCs; 7 have declined to update and 172 countries haven’t updated their NDCs.

By early June, however, daily fossil fuel CO2 emissions returned to within 5 percent below 2019 levels. But, this dip in CO2 emissions hasn’t made any impact on global co2 concentrations.The world is set to see its warmest five years on record and is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement targets to keep global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C or at 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, stated the report drafted by multiple agencies including the World Meteorological Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-and-debt-are-sinking-us-small-island-nations-cry-for-help/story-NPjBwZjHWspSQgF1wovgbI.html
14-09-2020||World||US lawyer says Julian Assange faces decades in prison if convicted||An American lawyer told an extradition hearing in Britain for Julian Assange on Monday that the WikiLeaks founder faces decades in prison if he is convicted on spying charges in the United States.U.S. prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 17 espionage charges, and one of computer misuse, over WikiLeaks’ publication of secret U.S. military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.Attorney Eric Lewis, appearing as a defense witness, said the scope of the indictment pointed to “a very aggressive approach to sentencing on the part of the government.”“All signs point to a very long sentence, measured in many decades,” said Lewis, a senior partner at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss in Washington, DC.“We are looking at a sentence somewhere between 20 years, if everything goes brilliantly, to 175 years, which the government could easily ask for,” he said.Assange’s lawyers say the prosecution is politically motivated and that he will not receive a fair trial in the United States, They also argue that the conditions he would face in prison would breach his human rights.Assange’s legal woes began a decade ago, when WikiLeaks published classified U.K. military documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has been in a British prison since he was ejected from his refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in April 2019.The extradition hearing began a week ago at London’s Central Criminal Court and is due to last until early October.On Monday, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser denied a request by Assange’s lawyers that everyone in the court wear masks to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus.The hearing was briefly suspended last week while one lawyer for the U.S. government was tested for Covid-19.

The result have not yet been published or reviewed by independent scientists.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The study tested baricitinib, a pill that Indianapolis-based Lilly already sells as Olumiant to treat rheumatoid arthritis, the less common form of arthritis that occurs when a mistaken or overreacting immune system attacks joints, causing inflammation. An overactive immune system also can lead to serious problems in coronavirus patients.All study participants received remdesivir, a Gilead Sciences drug previously shown to reduce the time to recovery, defined as being well enough to leave the hospital, by four days on average. Those who also were given baricitinib recovered one day sooner than those given remdesivir alone, Lilly said.Lilly said it planned to discuss with regulators the possible emergency use of baricitinib for hospitalized Covid-19 patients.It would be important to know how many study participants also received steroid drugs, which have been shown in other research to lower the risk of death for severely ill, hospitalized Covid-19 patients, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, former US Food and Drug Administration chief scientist now at Georgetown University who had no role in the study.Figuring out how to best use the various drugs shown to help “is something we’re going to have to work at,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-inflammatory-drug-may-shorten-covid-19-recovery-time/story-nMHTosXqlOnhbuQb7GdLxK.html
14-09-2020||World||Q&A: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?||TikTok’s parent company ByteDance has chosen Oracle over Microsoft as a new American technology partner to help keep the popular video-sharing app operating in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the deal.Microsoft, which had been vying for a deal, said in a statement Sunday that its bid to acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations was rejected. That came a week before the Sept. 20 deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American company or risk being banned in the U.S. over national security concerns.Q. What is TikTok?A. The app is a home for fun, goofy videos that are easy to make and to watch. That’s made it immensely popular, particularly with young people, and U.S. tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and hundreds of millions globally. It has its own influencer culture, enabling people to make a living from posting videos on the service, and hosts ads from major U.S. companies.ByteDance Ltd., a Chinese company, launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the U.S. and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users.Q. What concerns U.S. officials about the app?A. TikTok, like most other social networks, collects user data and moderates what’s posted. It grabs people’s locations and messages they send one another, for example, and tracks what people watch to discern what kinds of videos they like and how best to target ads to them.Similar concerns apply to American social networks, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could order companies to help it gather intelligence. In TikTok’s case, that’s a hypothetical threat, Samm Sacks, a researcher at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center has said.TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government. But experts say if the Chinese government wants information, it will get it.There are also concerns about TikTok censoring videos critical of China, which TikTok denies, or pushing propaganda. Some critics say the company is violating children’s privacy laws.The U.S. has given parent company ByteDance a Sept. 20 deadline to complete a sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets to an American company, or risk being banned in the country.Q: Is Oracle buying TikTok, and what assets are involved?Oracle was among the pool of bidders, including Microsoft and Walmart, to buy TikTok’s American operations. Microsoft on Sunday said that ByteDance will not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to the company. The person familiar with the deal, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Oracle will emerge the winner but an outright sale of TikTok U.S. is unlikely.However, it’s unclear at this point what assets Oracle would buy.TikTok has found popularity around the world thanks in part to its content-recommendation algorithm, which suggests videos to users based on their viewing history. But the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported Sunday, citing an unnamed person, said ByteDance will not sell the algorithm. China has tightened its controls and requires companies to get permission to export such technologies.“The Chinese government has implied it may block export of TikTok’s AI systems, so that might complicate a direct sale,” said Tiffany Li, a visiting professor at the Boston University School of Law. “One of TikTok’s competitive advantages is its AI-backed video recommendation system.”Q: What is Oracle’s relationship to TikTok likely to be?Oracle is known for providing enterprise software including cloud computing services. So it could provide cloud services such as storing TikTok’s data in the U.S., or computing services for the app.“Oracle could be a technology partner, but a sale or divestiture of the US operations for TikTok remains the focus,” Wedbush Securities analysts Daniel Ives, Strecker Backe and Ahmad Khalil said in an analyst note.Q: Will the Trump administration go for the arrangement, based on what we know so far?A: A TikTok-Oracle deal must be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals that may have national security implications.CFIUS earlier greenlighted Chinese PC maker Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s computer server business in 2014, after concluding the deal did not pose significant security risks. It also cleared SoftBank’s acquisition of Sprint in 2013, but only after SoftBank agreed not to use Huawei Technologies and ZTE equipment in the U.S.If Oracle and TikTok can show they can safeguard user data in the U.S., CFIUS and the Trump administration might accept the arrangement.A Chinese Foreign Ministry official said Monday that it had no comment on Oracle, but described the situation as a “typical government-coerced transaction.”Q: How much does Oracle’s closeness with the administration matter in this deal?A: Trump did not say if he prefered Oracle or Microsoft but he describe Oracle as “a great company” that could handle the sale.Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump.“Oracle’s connections with the Trump administration are interesting. It’s possible they may be able to negotiate an outcome that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. without a full sale, with ByteDance still retaining something,” said Boston University’s Li.Q: What might this deal mean for users?If it is finalized and approved by CFIUS, TikTok would be allowed to continue operating in the U.S.“Trump’s executive order that effectively banned TikTok’s U.S. business would likely no longer apply, as TikTok would no longer be owned by Bytedance,” said Li.“Executive orders can be revoked or modified at any time,” she said.However, Oracle’s plans remain unclear.“I doubt we’ll see the creativity and consumer-friendliness that we might expect with a different owner,” Li said.Paul Haswell, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, expects Oracle to strive to keep TikTok’s users.“If the app changes or the user experience changes then the users might abandon the platform which completely undermines the value of TikTok and Oracle’s acquisition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/q-a-what-does-a-deal-between-tiktok-and-oracle-mean/story-OFREhcpu7zdQH1ufGUXqCM.html
14-09-2020||World||US ambassador to China Terry Branstad to step down next month||The US ambassador to China will step down early next month, ending a three-year tenure marked by a trade war and increasingly bitter relations between the world’s two largest economies.Terry Branstad, appointed by president Donald Trump in 2017, confirmed his decision in a phone call with Trump last week, the US embassy said in a statement Monday. It did not give a reason for his departure.“I am proudest of our work in getting the phase one trade deal and delivering tangible results for our communities back home,” he was quoted as saying at an embassy staff meeting on Monday.Word of his departure leaked out earlier in the day when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Branstad on Twitter for his service.“Ambassador Branstad has contributed to rebalancing U.S.-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair,” Pompeo wrote in a follow-up tweet.China’s foreign ministry said before the embassy announcement that it was aware of Pompeo’s tweet but had not received any notification that Branstad was leaving.Branstad became embroiled in a recent controversy when China’s official People’s Daily newspaper rejected an opinion column that he had written.Pompeo tweeted last week that China’s ruling Communist Party refused to run Branstad’s op-ed while the Chinese ambassador to the United States “is free to publish in any U.S. media outlet.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded that Branstad’s article was “full of loopholes, seriously inconsistent with facts and wantonly attacks and smears China.”The US embassy had contacted the People’s Daily on Aug. 26 about the piece, asking that it be printed in full without any edits before Sept. 4, the People’s Daily said in a statement posted online.Branstad, 73, is a native of Iowa and was governor of the major farming state for 22 years over two spans, from 1983 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017.Early in his first term, he met Xi Jinping, now China’s leader, when the then county-level Communist Party official visited Iowa on a 1985 trade trip.Trump appointed him ambassador after a vacancy of several months, during which the embassy’s No. 2 official, David Rank, resigned after criticizing the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.Soon after arriving in Beijing in June 2017, Branstad welcomed American beef back to the Chinese market after a 14-year ban, saying “I know it is a key priority of the president to reduce the trade deficit, and this is one of the ways we can do it.”But trade relations quickly soured, as the US imposed tariffs on Chinese products and China retaliated in kind. Other disputes followed over technology, human rights and the response to the coronavirus pandemic.Branstad joined US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at trade talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing in May 2019.The phase one deal reached the following January represented a truce but did not address the more fundamental complaints of the American side.The US embassy statement also noted Branstad’s role in the effort to reduce the flow of fentanyl from China to the United States, including a 2018 pact in which China agreed to list the opioid as a controlled substance.Branstad also made a rare visit to Tibet in May 2019, where he expressed concerns about what the US called Chinese government interference in the freedom of Tibetan Buddhists to organize and practice their religion.“He encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences,” an embassy statement at the time said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ambassador-to-china-terry-branstad-to-step-down-next-month/story-29lp34dWkqIFDWs1Zis7EK.html
14-09-2020||World||Meet Yoshihide Suga, elected Japan’s next PM who begins and ends his day with 100 sit-ups||Yoshihide Suga won the leadership race of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Monday and in all likelihood is set to win a parliamentary vote later this week and replace outgoing prime minister Shinzo Abe.Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, said last month he would quit because of ill health, ending a nearly eight-year term.The 71-year-old Suga, known as Abe’s trusted aide, won 377 votes out of 534 votes cast, and 535 possible votes, in the LDP election by the party’s members of parliament and representatives of its 47 local chapters.Suga has a reputation for inscrutability, who has become a key government adviser, spokesman and policy enforcer. Suga has so far served in several key political roles, including most recently as chief cabinet secretary.He has also effectively been the face of Abe’s government, serving as its top spokesman and defending decisions in daily press conferences.Started from zeroSuga, the son of a strawberry farmer grew up in rural Akita in northern Japan. He came to Tokyo after high school and worked odd jobs to put himself through night college, before being elected to his first office in 1987, as a municipal assembly member in Yokohama outside Tokyo.Suga won a lower house seat in 1996 and was a long-time backer of Abe, pushing him to stand for a second term despite his disastrous first run in office, which ended after just a year.When Abe defied the odds and returned to power in 2012, he appointed Suga to the powerful chief cabinet secretary role, from which he is said to have helped push through several landmark Abe policies, including a loosening of restrictions on foreign workers.He has held the key post of chief cabinet secretary since 2012, acting as Abe’s top government spokesperson, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line. He made reference to his background in accepting the party’s nomination as the leader, saying he “started from zero”.“I, with this background, was able to become the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party with all its history and tradition. I will devote the whole of myself to Japan and the Japanese people,” he said.Suga notably advised him against a controversial 2013 visit to Tokyo’s Yasukuni shrine, which is viewed by neighbouring countries as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism.Eyes aheadSuga has said he would continue Abe’s signature “Abenomics” strategy of hyper-easy monetary policy, government spending and reforms while juggling the problems of Covid-19 and a slumping economy. He has also said he will confront longer-term issues such as Japan’s ageing population and low birth rate.Suga, whose resume is thin on diplomatic experience, faces geopolitical challenges such as building ties with the winner of the November 3 US presidential election and balancing concern over China’s maritime aggressiveness with bilateral economic interdependence.Neutral figureAccording to experts, Suga is pragmatic rather than ideological and he is seen by lawmakers along the political spectrum within the LDP as a neutral figure. But his rather anodyne image got something of a reboot last year with the declaration of a new imperial era to mark the ascension to the throne of Emperor Naruhito.It was Suga who unveiled the much-awaited name for the era: Reiwa. And the image of him holding up the hand-drawn calligraphy for the name earned him the affectionate nickname “Uncle Reiwa”.He has allowed only occasional glimpses into his personal life with his family far from the spotlight but revealed in interviews that he bookends his day with 100 sit-ups in the morning and 100 in the evening, and has a weakness for pancakes.Speculation is simmering that Suga will call a snap election for parliament’s lower house as soon as next month to boost his chances of winning a full three-year term as LDP chief next year. A vote for the lower chamber must be held by late October 2021.A Reuters poll showed that Japanese manufacturers remained pessimistic for a 14th straight month in September, underlining the huge challenge the next leader faces.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suga-japan-s-likely-next-pm-is-abe-s-trusted-aide-and-self-made/story-LOR0u7ZT0DsOXcDN7tb2HI.html
14-09-2020||World||Germany is calling the shots in Europe and Merkel isn’t sorry||When Berlin broke with its frugal tradition and opened the spending taps this year, a senior official in the German Economy Ministry was flabbergasted that the European Commission griped instead of showing gratitude.For years, Germany was reprimanded by the commission — the European Union’s powerful executive arm — as well as the US and the IMF for what’s been called a “fetish” for balancing its budget. Now that it had unleashed 1.2 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager complained it would give German companies an unfair edge.So Germany decided to assert itself. Rather than air displeasure in public, officials mounted a forceful lobbying operation behind the scenes in defense of spending plans, according to a senior figure familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It worked.“Everybody has been asking Germany to spend more and now Germany is spending,” Vestager said at an event in Berlin Sept. 7. “So I think we should make the best of it.”It’s a telling example of how Germany has become far more explicit, and unapologetic about calling the shots in Europe. It’s on display in its tightening of foreign-investment rules, its efforts to coordinate the response to an increasingly powerful China, and its willingness to challenge Russia over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.“The world has changed,” says Andreas Laemmel, leader for economic affairs of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling bloc in parliament. “If we continue as in the past, then Europe will become just an industrial museum.”Partly it’s a generational shift. Leaders who grew up in the shadow of World War II were content to confine Germany’s place on the world stage to the economic sphere but they are giving way to those who read about the Nazis in the history books: Merkel is the first chancellor born after the war. Enough time has passed that German strength is no longer a frightening proposition.And partly it’s a recognition that Germany has no choice but to step up to the plate with Europe caught in the middle of a growing conflict between the world’s two superpowers.Under Donald Trump, the US has become an unpredictable and even hostile ally, while Xi Jinping praises multilateralism as China becomes increasingly bold in its forays in international relations.Merkel had intended to make a summit with China the centerpiece of Germany’s EU presidency that runs through the end of this year, but coronavirus wrecked that plan. Instead, Merkel and Xi will hold a video conference on Monday along with senior EU officials.In a Sept. 10 interview, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz acknowledged the current landscape means Germany has to take on “more responsibilities,” which means maneuvering the Brussels machine especially with Brexit still a live issue.German officials worry that Vestager and her colleagues are locked in a mindset focused on rules drawn up for a different era, according to lawmakers from both Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the liberal opposition group.That way of thinking puts too much emphasis on the risk of internal tensions between EU states and underestimates the external threats, the lawmakers said. To confront those perils, the EU needs to do a better job of combining the economic power of its governments and its companies, the Germans have concluded.That means allowing more state intervention and investment, easing the competition rules that hamper giant mergers and tightening financial ties between member states.If the Germans get their way, it could trigger a wave of corporate alliances in sectors from telecoms to banking or defense. They are already funneling billions of euros toward new industries like batteries and cloud computing.“To the outside world, it must be astonishing to see how inward-looking Europe is,” said Matthias Heider, the Christian Democrat deputy chair of the Bundestag economics committee. “Europe needs to focus more of its attention outside of our borders and come up with answers to the increasing challenge posed by China’s growing economic strength.”Merkel’s increasing willingness to cajole her EU partners into accepting a more muscular German industry marks a break with Berlin’s historic relationship with Europe.The post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, handed the French a say in his industrial policy when he laid the foundations for what would become the EU. A generation later, Helmut Kohl’s memories of his wartime childhood helped persuade him to give up the treasured Deutsche Mark to forge a single European currency.When Germany did wield its influence in those days, it was focused on setting rules to constrain national governments. Kohl’s officials thrashed out the EU competition regime that Vestager now oversees in the late 1980s and fought to ensure it allowed no room for French-style interventionism.The seeds of the shift were sown in August 2016, when German officials felt obliged by EU rules to let China’s Midea group buy the robot maker Kuka. At the time, a senior German official involved in looking at ways to try to block the deal said he thought the Chinese were taking advantage of Europe’s liberal regime to snap up critical technology.The idea took root last year when Vestager blocked plans for Germany’s Siemens AG and Alstom SA of France to create a giant European trainmaker. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire then vowed to change the competition rules.Now the alliance between Germany and France is driving wholesale changes to the way Europe’s economy is run.Altmaier even tried to foster a tie up between Finland’s Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB of Sweden last year to counter China’s Huawei Technology Co., one official familiar with the discussion said, although the plan met with little enthusiasm from the companies — spokespeople for both declined to comment.The next plank of their strategy is to target the competition rules, the touchstone of the single market. The Germans aim to make progress toward bringing down the barriers to would-be European champions by the beginning of next year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-is-calling-the-shots-in-europe-and-merkel-isn-t-sorry/story-65ib6XjsVVSw2GEJYyPQVM.html
14-09-2020||World||Yoshihide Suga to succeed Shinzo Abe as Japan’s prime minister||Yoshihide Suga was elected as the new head of Japan’s ruling party on Monday, virtually guaranteeing him parliamentary election as the country’s next prime minister.Suga received 377 votes in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party election to pick a successor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who announced last month that he would resign due to health problems. The other two contenders received a combined 157 votes.The expected victory in the party vote by Suga, currently the chief Cabinet secretary of Abe’s government, all but guarantees his election in a parliamentary vote Wednesday because of the majority held by the Liberal Democrats’ ruling coalition.Despite his low-key image as Abe’s right-hand man, Suga is actually known for his iron-fist approach to getting jobs done as a policy coordinator and influencing bureaucrats by using the centralised power of the prime minister’s office.Suga says that he is a reformist and that he has worked to achieve policies by breaking territorial barriers of bureaucracy. He has credited himself for those efforts in achieving a booming foreign tourism industry in Japan, lowering cellphone bills and bolstering agricultural exports.Compared to his political skills at home, Suga has hardly travelled overseas, and his diplomatic skills are unknown, though he is largely expected to pursue Abe’s priorities.In addition to the coronavirus and the economic fallout, Suga stands to inherit several other challenges, including China, which continues its assertive actions in the East China Sea. He also will have to decide what to do with the Tokyo Olympics, which were pushed back to next summer due to the coronavirus. And he will have to establish a good relationship with whoever wins the US presidential race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yoshihide-suga-to-succeed-shinzo-abe-as-japan-s-prime-minister/story-c4FDv3t6fPBPmucf0Sf9lO.html

14-09-2020||World||China sends hardcore ambassadors to South Asia to push BRI and undermine India||By sending Nong Rong, a Chinese politician with close links to United Front Works Department (UFWD), as ambassador to Pakistan, Beijing is making an all out bid to influence South Asia in support of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and divide critics of the Xi Jinping regime. Ambassador Nong replaces career diplomat Yao Jing in Islamabad this week.A study of Chinese ambassadors posted in South Asia shows that Beijing’s present representative to Bangladesh Li Jiming and former Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan had links with the UFWD. This organisation, in which President Xi Jinping served for many years, is mandated with psychological operations with the task of influencing political, economic and intellectuals in other countries and the objective of systematic penetration into systems of targeted country.Even the Chinese ambassador in Nepal Hou Yonqi is an Asian affairs expert with an PLA intelligence background as she was Director, Department of External Security Affairs in 2012-2013. Fluent in Urdu, Ambassador Hou has been tasked by Beijing to keep the communist movement in Nepal together and not split between Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and party president Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Prachanda.Clearly the task of China’s ambassadors to South Asia is to push the BRI and aggressively undermine the Indian civilisational influence.The benign sounding UFWD is a unique organisation that has been formed to create a critical mass of support for the Communist Party of China (CPC) among non-communists. It has a domestic and international wing. Domestically its role is to build sympathisers among people who are not part of the 86 million strong CPC.For instance, ethnic minorities, religious groups within China especially in border provinces and regions have been its prime targets. In an attempt to foster CPC hegemony inside the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the UFWD has been tasked to build critical social support in Xinjiang, using soft power. Consequently, UFWD has been extremely active among the ethnic Uyghur community, with the objective of Sinicizing Xinjiang.Similarly, the UFWD has been very active among the Tibetan Buddhist community in Tibet. In fact, the UFWD has been openly activated after Xi Jinping’s latest ruling on Sinicizing Tibet, to foster greater social integration in China, to support the One-China principle.The UFWD was a key institution promoted by Mao, following the lead of the Soviet Union, where the concept of the UF was first floated during the Russian revolution by Lenin. The organization was revived by new paramount leader Xi Jinping in 2014.The UFWD always has played an important external role, focusing mainly on co-opting Overseas Chinese (OC) who are non- communists. In the 1980s, for instance, UF outreach was purposed toward attracting foreign investment and economic aid from OC businessmen and entrepreneurs, a strategy that was especially successful with those who still retained familial and ancestral ties with coastal provinces that had established “Special Economic Zones” which included coastal provinces such as Guangdong，Fujian ，and Zhejiang. But important influencers have also been tapped among foreigners.During Xi’s time, the overseas wing of the UFWD has been extremely active to create support for BRI initiatives , including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and the Gulf Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been identified as China’s bridgeheads to promote BRI.The modus operandi of UFWD is to target opinion makers and try to co-opt them to support China’s cause. Internally, the UFWD focuses on Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC), a Maoist era advisory body that is now a permanent fixture of the Chinese political system. The CPPCC’s political significance lies in the way it enables the Party-state to co-opt non-CPC elites, especially as two-thirds of its members—many of whom are co-opted religious, business, and artistic elites, among others - are not members of the Party. The UFWD is at the forefront for inviting opinion makers across generations in target countries by promoting fully funded academic conferences, media conferences and media trips, ang offering generous belt and road initiative scholarship especially in key developing countries in South Asia, poor ASEAN countries and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sends-hardcore-ambassadors-to-south-asia-to-push-bri-and-undermine-india/story-Oz8Aakf28IQJqHB1uJKOQL.html
14-09-2020||World||Xi’s aggressive moves against India ‘unexpectedly flopped’: Report||Describing Xi Jinping as the “architect” of the PLA’s recent aggressive moves against India, a leading US magazine has reported that the Chinese President has risked his future with the high-profile incursions into Indian territory that “unexpectedly flopped” in the face of ferocious fightback by the Indian Army.Xi, 67, already roiling the Communist Party with a “rectification” campaign and mass persecution of foes, will launch “another brutal purge” following the Chinese army’s failures on the Indian border, the Newsweek said in an opinion piece.“Unfortunately for Xi, he is the “architect” of these aggressive moves into India and his People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has unexpectedly flopped. The Chinese army’s failures on the Indian border will have consequences,” it said, adding that the recent developments give Xi an excuse to pick up the pace of replacing adversaries in the armed forces with loyal elements.“More important, the failures motivate China’s aggressive ruler- who as chairman of the Party’s Central Military Commission, is the leader of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the ruling Communist Party of China - to launch another offensive against Indian positions,” the magazine warned.Tensions escalated manifold along the LAC in eastern Ladakh after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.“China is thought to have suffered at least 43 deaths in the Galwan clash,” the magazine said.Citing Cleo Paskal of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, it said the number of Chinese killed could exceed 60.“Indian troops fought back ferociously. Beijing won’t admit the extent of the debacle,” it said.It said that late last month, for the first time in a half-century, India carried out an offensive against China, taking back high ground the Chinese recently grabbed.“China’s forces were surprised when Indian troops mounted their attempt to retake strategic high points. Stunned Chinese soldiers retreated,” it said.“China’s subsequent efforts to counter the Indian moves proved ineffective. At least for the moment, India’s troops, in the southernmost of the three areas of conflict, are in control of territory once in Chinese hands,” it added.It said the PLA Ground Force can move against undefended targets. However, it is not clear how effective it is in battle.“The Ground Force does not have a track record of success in contested situations. Its last major engagement was in 1979 when, in the effort to ‘teach Vietnam a lesson,’ the Chinese troops were repelled and humiliated by their much smaller neighbour,” the magazine noted.“India is not giving the invaders the opportunity to improve,” it said, adding that India’s troops are displaying “newfound boldness”.“The game has changed,” Paskal said. “You can say the Indians are more aggressive or more aggressively defensive, but they are in fact bolder and better.” “The setback in the Himalayas poses problems for Xi, which means it poses a problem for everyone else,” it added.It said that in China’s highly politicised system, the setbacks in Ladakh cannot be perceived as Xi’s fault, so he will almost surely purge elements of the military. “PLA leaders begin to see little choice but to undertake offensive military actions to avoid becoming a victim of Xi’s internal terror,” said Richard Fisher of the Virginia-based International Assessment and Strategy Center.The Indian Army and the PLA have been locked in a tense standoff in multiple areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since early May.Following fresh confrontation around the southern bank of the Pangong lake, India further bolstered its military presence in the region by sending additional troops, battle tanks and other weaponry. Amidst the very tense situation in eastern Ladakh, India and China reached an agreement to resolve their border row at a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC. It also mentioned that the two sides should expedite work to conclude “new confidence building measures” to enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

The virologist, who became the whistleblower against the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, was in December last year tasked with looking into a cluster of Sars-like cases coming out of mainland China. The top scientist working in Hong Kong claimed that she discovered a cover-up operation during her investigation and said that the Chinese government knew about the spread of the virus before publicly acknowledging it.Dr Li-Meng, who specialised in virology and immunology at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, was allegedly forced to flee to the United States over safety concerns. On September 11, she participated in an interview on British talk show “Loose Women” from a secret location and talked about her research on the coronavirus disease and the challenges she has been facing. Dr Li-Meng said that she conducted two researches on the “new pneumonia” in China between December and early January and the second one in mid-January, and shared the results with her supervisor, who is a World Health Organisation (WHO) consultant. She expected her supervisor to do the “right thing on behalf of the Chinese government and WHO” but to her surprise she was told to “maintain silence or else she would be made to disappear”, which the virologist said was common sense among the Chinese. Also Watch | ‘Will take Covid vaccine first if people have a trust deficit’: Dr Harsh Vardhan“No one responded, people are scared of the government and they are waiting to collaborate with the government and WHO to get more benefits to become safe but this is [was] something urgent,” Dr Li-Meng said. At the time of the Chinese New Year, big transportations take place from China to all over the world. So, she decided against keeping silent as “this is a high [highly] contentious dangerous virus. I mean, this is about human beings and global health.” Dr Li-Meng said that it was scary as she was facing threats but “I knew if I didn’t tell the world the truth I would be regretful.”On January 17, she said she contacted a famous Chinese YouTuber in the US. The expose, which was in Chinese, explained that: (1) the Chinese government was just covering the Covid-19 virus, (2) human to human transmission of the disease already existed, (3) Sars-CoV-2 is a “high mutant virus” that will become an outbreak soon, and (4) the Wuhan seafood market and the intermediate hosts for the virus were just a “smokescreen.”And the final thing, the scientist said was that “this virus is not from nature. This is based on the China Military Institute that discovered and owned some bad coronavirus named CC45 and ZXC41. Based on that, after lab modification becomes a novel virus.”Dr Li-Meng dismissed reports suggesting the virus originated in wet markets, claiming her intelligence is “from the CDCs in China, from local doctors, doctors and other people around China.”The virologist said she is working on a scientific report since January i.e. before leaving Hong Kong along with a small group of top scientists and will soon publish the findings. “We are going to publish it. There are two reports, the first one will come in several days and it will tell people about the scientific evidence,” she said. Throwing light on the unpublished research, she said, “The genome sequence is like our human fingerprint. So, based on this you can recognise and identify this thing. So, I used the evidence existing in the genome sequence of Sars-CoV-2 to tell people why this came from China, why they are the only one who made it.”She also said that anyone, even those without any knowledge of biology, can read it. “You can check, identify and verify it by yourself. It is the critical thing for us to know the origins of the virus. If not, it will be life threatening for everyone,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-made-in-wuhan-lab-controlled-by-china-govt-claims-virologist-offers-evidence/story-JJTyD7Ts61FLOzPvEQHHQL.html
14-09-2020||World||Search crews scour charred Oregon landscape, residents return to rubble as wildfires burn||Search and rescue teams, with dogs in tow, were deployed across the blackened ruins of southern Oregon towns on Sunday as smoldering wildfires continue to ravage the U.S. west and officials warn of mass casualties.A blitz of wildfires across Oregon, California and Washington has destroyed thousands of homes and a half dozen small towns this summer, scorching more than 4 million acres and killing more than two dozen people since early August.Tracy Koa, a high school teacher, returned to Talent, Oregon, on Saturday after evacuating with her partner Dave Tanksley and 13-year-old daughter to find her house and neighborhood reduced to heaps of ash and rubble.“We knew that it was gone,” Koa said in a telephone interview on Sunday. “But then you pull up, and the devastation of just every home, you think of every family and every situation and every burnt-down car, and there are just no words for it.”Crews in Jackson County, Oregon, were hoping to venture into rural areas where the Alameda Fire has abated slightly with slowing winds, sending up thick plumes of smoke as the embers burned. From Medford through the neighboring communities of Phoenix and Talent, an apocalyptic scene of charred residential subdivisions and trailer parks stretched for miles along Highway 99. Community donation centers popped up around Jackson County over the weekend, including one in the parking lot of Home Depot in Phoenix, where farmers brought a pick-up truck bed full of watermelons and people brought water and other supplies.After four days of brutally hot, windy weather, the weekend brought calmer winds blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, and cooler, moister conditions that helped crews make headway against blazes that had burned unchecked earlier in the week.Still, emergency officials worried that the shifting weather might not be enough to quell the fires. “We’re concerned that the incoming front is not going to provide a lot of rain here in the Medford region and it’s going to bring increased winds,” Bureau of Land Management spokesman Kyle Sullivan told Reuters in a telephone interview on Sunday.At least ten people have been killed in Oregon, according to the office of emergency management. Brown has said that dozens of people remained missing across three counties. There were 34 active fires burning in Oregon as of Sunday morning, according to the state’s office of emergency management website. A CLIMATE CHANGE ‘WAKE-UP CALL’Thick smoke and ash from the fires has darkened the sky over the Pacific Northwest since Labor Day, creating some of the world’s worst air-quality levels and driving residents indoors. Satellite images showed the smoke was wafting inland in the eastern direction, the Bureau of Land Management said on Twitter on Sunday.Drought conditions, extreme temperatures and high winds in Oregon created the “perfect firestorm” for the blazes to grow, Governor Kate Brown told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.“This is a wake up call for all of us that we’ve got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change,” Brown said.Trump, a Republican, was scheduled to travel to California and meet with federal and state officials on Monday. He has said that western governors bear some of the blame for intense fire seasons in recent years, as opposed to warming temperatures, and has accused them of poor forest management. In California, nearly 17,000 firefighters were battling 29 major wildfires on Sunday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Improving weather conditions had helped them gain a measure of containment over most of the blazes.More than 4,000 homes and other structures have been incinerated in California alone over the past three weeks. About three million acres of land have been burned in the state, according to the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-crews-scour-charred-oregon-landscape-residents-return-to-rubble-as-wildfires-burn/story-nmeGTGPF2BhPgdciZc6PhP.html

14-09-2020||World||Pfizer CEO says US could get Covid shot before year-end||Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said it’s “likely” the U.S. will deploy a Covid-19 vaccine to the public before year-end and that the company is prepared for that scenario, pushing back against more tepid expectations shared by health authorities.Bourla said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he’s “quite comfortable” that the vaccine the company is developing in partnership with BioNTech SE is safe and that it could be available to Americans before 2021, contingent on an approval from U.S. regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.“I cannot say what the FDA will do,” Bourla said. “But I think it’s a likely scenario, and we are preparing for it.”New York-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech are seen as frontrunners in the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, alongside Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc. Bourla said Pfizer and its partner have a 60% chance of knowing the efficacy of its still experimental vaccine by the end of October.“Of course that doesn’t mean that it works; that means that we’ll know if it works,” Bourla said. The timing of clinical trial results depends on enough people in the study getting Covid-19 to make a calculation. But positive results could clear the way for approval, he said.Bourla’s assurances come just as Pfizer and BioNTech have expanded the number of clinical trial participants they’re seeking in order to include more people with diverse backgrounds.Expanded EnrollmentThe companies said in a statement Saturday that they expect to enroll the 30,000 patients they originally sought for its final-phase clinical trial this week. They are also expanding that target to 44,000 participants to include people as young as 16, and to allow those with HIV and Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.Bourla said on CBS that they will also focus on recruiting more people of color, including African Americans and Latinos, to the late-stage trial in coming weeks. He said the study participants are currently 60% White and 40% people of color, and that older volunteers make up 44% of the cohort.The companies joined other vaccine developers last week in an unusual pledge to only submit applications with the FDA for vaccine clearance when the drugs have shown to be safe and effective in large clinical trials. That followed concerns that President Donald Trump is pushing the agency to cut corners to get a vaccine to market before the Nov. 3 election.Bourla said part of the reason Pfizer didn’t accept taxpayer dollars to fund its Covid-19 vaccine research and development was to avoid government bureaucracy and influence. “I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics,” he said.Political PressureTrump has said publicly that a vaccine could be authorized by the November election even though other top U.S. health officials, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, have said they think closer to the end of the year is more realistic. Even then, enough vaccine won’t be available to cover most Americans until well into 2021.Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, also speaking on CBS, said it’s “atypical” that the approval process of any drug or vaccine would be discussed within a political context.“I don’t think we’re going to see an authorization before the election,” said Gottlieb, who sits on Pfizer’s board of directors. He added that American’s distrust in a Covid-19 vaccine will likely dissipate after the election.The former FDA chief said he expects most Americans won’t be vaccinated until 2021 or later.“This is likely to be a very staged market entry,” Gottlieb said. He described a process in which regulators will first issue an emergency use approval providing a limited supply of shots to those at high risk of infection, including frontline workers. Then the FDA will “slowly walk down that approval” to make it more broadly available, Gottlieb said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-ceo-says-us-could-get-covid-shot-before-year-end/story-vMRpupqIxNn3sEvDtNxO8N.html
14-09-2020||World||Black scientists highlight racism in the lab and the field||University of Washington ecologist Christopher Schell is studying how coronavirus shutdowns have affected wildlife in Seattle and other cities. But when planning fieldwork, he also thinks about how he’s perceived in neighbourhoods where he installs wildlife cameras. “I wear the nerdiest glasses I have and often a jacket that has my college logo, so that people don’t mistake me for what they think is a thug or hooligan,” said Schell, who is African American. The recent episode of a white woman calling the police on a Black birder in New York’s Central Park shocked many people. But for Black environmental scientists, worrying about whether they are likely to be harassed or asked to justify their presence while doing fieldwork is a familiar concern. Tanisha Williams, a botanist at Bucknell University, knows exactly which plants she’s looking for. But after being questioned by strangers in public parks, Williams, who is Black, has started carrying her field guides with her. “I’ve been quizzed by random strangers,” she said. “Now I bring my wildflower books and botanical field guides, trying to look like a scientist. It’s for other people. I wouldn’t otherwise lug these books.” Overt harassment and subtle intimidation during fieldwork compound the discrimination that Black scientists and those from other underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds already feel in academic settings. Now researchers in the environmental sciences are increasingly raising issues of discrimination and marginalization in the wake of a national reckoning on race. They are also pointing out how a lack of diversity among scientists can lead to flawed or incomplete research. A National Science Foundation survey found that in 2016, scholars who identified as Black or African American were awarded just 6 per cent of all doctorates in life sciences, and less than 3 per cent of doctorates in physical and Earth sciences. Students who identified as Hispanic or Latino were awarded less than 8 per cent of doctorates in life sciences and about 5 per cent of doctorates in physical and Earth sciences. According to the most recent census, Black people make up 13.4 per cent of the population, and Latinos 18.5 per cent. “The issue is not lack of interest” on the part of students from the underrepresented groups, said the University of Washington’s Scott Freeman, who studies educational pipelines to degrees in science, technology, engineering or math. But many of those students come from families with fewer financial resources and face gaps in access to secondary education that is geared toward the sciences or college preparation. Those factors can influence how well they perform in freshman general chemistry — considered a gateway course for pursuing these so-called STEM majors. It’s possible to decrease the impact of these disadvantages by adjusting teaching styles, such as replacing traditional large lectures with hands-on learning, according to Freeman’s research. And students from underrepresented backgrounds who overcome initial obstacles are “ hyper persistent ” in their studies, continuing at higher rates in STEM fields compared with their white peers, he found. Addressing these gaps has taken on new urgency as the US confronts systemic racism in the wake of nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. At a meeting this summer of the Society for Conservation Biology North America, one panel was devoted to “why conservation science needs to prioritize racial and social justice.” Hundreds of scientists have joined a wider discussion among academics about racism, posting their personal experiences of discrimination under the Twitter hashtag #BlackintheIvory, referring to the ivory tower. But environmental scientists must confront discrimination not just in the halls of academia but in the field as well. Carnivore ecologist Rae Wynn-Grant, a fellow at the National Geographic Society, said she has to put her “feelings aside” when her fieldwork takes her to places where she encounters racist symbols. While driving in rural Maryland to study bears, Wynn-Grant, who is Black, passed several Confederate flags and a cloth doll of a lynched man hanging from a tree. “This is the extra labor Black people have to do in order to participate in something they’re interested in,” she said. Many researchers say that exposing middle school and high school students to scientists from diverse backgrounds is essential to combating systemic racism. “Growing up, the only Black botanist I’d heard of was George Washington Carver,” said Williams, the scientist at Bucknell, who helped organize a Twitter campaign to highlight the achievements of Black botanists. Itumeleng Moroenyane, a doctoral student at the National Institute of Scientific Research in Quebec, grew up in post-apartheid South Africa and said he was the only Black botany student in his university’s graduating class. Moroenyane now makes it a priority to mentor younger Black scholars. Corina Newsome said her passion for biology started during a high school internship at the Philadelphia Zoo, where a zookeeper who mentored her was the first Black scientist she had met. Now an ornithologist at Georgia Southern University, Newsome, who is Black, said institutions can promote diversity by helping students find mentors and offering paid internships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-scientists-highlight-racism-in-the-lab-and-the-field/story-kya4NipnlVuaA8m9BrXIqM.html
14-09-2020||World||Israel to reimpose nationwide lockdown as Covid-19 cases surge||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday announced a new countrywide lockdown will be imposed amid a stubborn surge in coronavirus cases, with schools and parts of the economy expected to shut down in a bid to bring down infection rates. Beginning Friday, the start of the Jewish High Holiday season, schools, restaurants and hotels will shut down, among other businesses, and Israelis will face restrictions on movement. “Our goal is to stop the increase (in cases) and lower morbidity,” Netanyahu said in a nationally broadcast statement. “I know that these steps come at a difficult price for all of us. This is not the holiday we are used to.” The tightening of measures marks the second time Israel is being plunged into a lockdown, after a lengthy shutdown in the spring. That lockdown is credited with having brought down what were much lower infection numbers, but it wreaked havoc on the country’s economy, sending unemployment skyrocketing. The lockdown will remain in place for at least three weeks, at which point officials are expected to relax measures if numbers are seen declining. Israelis typically hold large family gatherings and pack synagogues during the important fast of Yom Kippur, settings that officials feared could trigger new outbreaks. A sticking point in government deliberations over the lockdown was what prayers would look like during the holidays. The strict limits on faithful prompted Israeli Housing Minister Yaakov Litzman, who represents ultra-Orthodox Jews, to resign from the government. Israel has had more than 150,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,100 deaths. Given its population of 9 million, the country now has one of the world’s worst outbreaks. It is now seeing more than 4,000 daily cases of the virus. Israel earned praise for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak, moving quickly to seal the country’s borders and appearing to bring infections under control. It has since been criticized for opening businesses and schools too quickly and allowing the virus to spread unchecked. Much of that criticism has been aimed at Netanyahu, who has faced a public outcry over his handling of the crisis and has seen thousands of protesters descend on his Jerusalem residence every week. While lauded for his decisive response following the spring outbreak, Netanyahu appeared distracted by politics and personal matters, including his trial for corruption allegations, as infections rose over the summer. Netanyahu has also been lambasted for seeming to cave to pressure from various interest groups, including most recently his ultra-Orthodox governing partners, who appeared to have convinced him to abandon a pinpointed, city-based lockdown plan that would have mostly affected ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities. At the press conference Sunday announcing the lockdown, Netanyahu defended his response, saying Israel’s economy had emerged from the first lockdown in a better state than many other developed nations and that while cases were high, the country’s coronavirus mortality numbers were lower than other countries with similar outbreaks. The country’s power-sharing government, made up of two rival parties who joined forces in a stated aim to combat the virus, has also been chided for the new outbreak. The government has been accused of mismanagement, failing to properly address both the health and economic crises wrought by the virus and leading the country to its second lockdown. Some government ministers meanwhile have pointed fingers at what they’ve called an undisciplined public, who they have accused of violating restrictions against public gatherings and mask wearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-reimpose-nationwide-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-ZJSGRFhk0IfuqUyxaBVpRI.html

Lukashenko denied the polls were rigged and has blamed foreign powers for the protests. At least 250 protesters were arrested, police said. “Some 250 people were detained in various districts of the capital,” the interior ministry said in a statement, adding that those detained were carrying flags and “offensive” placards. Despite the crackdown, demonstrations show no sign of fading and Lukashenko has made no concessions.Putin, who hosts Lukashenko for talks in Sochi on Monday, is determined opposition demonstrators won’t topple the Belarusian president, said five people close to the Kremlin, who asked not to be identified discussing internal policy.The crisis engulfing Moscow’s closest partner echoes revolts that swept away pro-Kremlin leaders in Ukraine and Armenia since 2014, and comes weeks after Putin changed Russia’s constitution to allow him to extend his two-decade rule potentially to 2036.“Belarus is of huge importance,” said Mikhail Vinogradov, who heads the St Petersburg Politics Foundation. “Putin doesn’t want to end up on the losing side.” The Russian leadership was taken aback by the scale of the unrest in Belarus, the people close to the Kremlin said. While Moscow doesn’t trust Lukashenko, it can’t accept the opposition coming to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-protests-ahead-of-putin-lukashenko-crunch-talks-250-detained-by-security-forces/story-LcfC5GK1iPu22NksYWFwoM.html
14-09-2020||World||Covid-19 cases rise in Europe as anti-curb protests grow||Covid-19 cases continued to spike across Europe, with France reporting more than 10,000 new infections and Austrian leader saying his country is facing a second wave.Globally, 921,219 people died of the virus from among 28.8 million cases on Sunday. Rise in daily infections in France, the largest since the end of the country’s lockdown in May, came after Prime Minister Jean Castex ruled out another lockdown. “What we are experiencing at the moment is the beginning of the second wave in Austria,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Sunday. He urged citizens to comply with reinforced rules to keep down new cases and suggesting that companies keep employees working from home.The UK, which has suffered Europe’s deadliest outbreak, recorded more than 3,000 new cases for the third day running for the first time since May. The Department for Health and Social Services reported a further 3,330 cases on Sunday, taking the three-day tally above 10,000.In Lebanon, 90 UN peacekeepers tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a spokesman for the UNIFIL force said on Sunday, the first reported cases of the illness. Anger, protest in several cities against lockdownsAnger is growing over continued lockdowns and restrictions over the pandemic. Authorities in Melbourne, Australia, arrested more than 70 people for flouting stay-at-home orders to protest against lockdown restrictions on Sunday, with some demonstrators clashing with riot police at a market in the city. About 250 people attended the illegal protest - the second in as many days in the city - promoted by coronavirus conspiracy groups on social media. A prominent Israeli minister resigned on Sunday in protest over an expected government decision to impose another lockdown this week. Housing minister Yaakov Litzman, who was health minister during the initial outbreak of the virus in Israel, criticised the anticipated lockdown measure as extreme.Some 8,000 people marched against virus restrictions in Munich on Saturday, most of them ignoring a city ordinance requiring the wearing of masks. At least a thousand protested in Hanover, and there was another demonstration in the western city of Wiesbaden.In the Polish capital Warsaw, several hundred people joined a similar protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-rise-in-europe-as-anti-curb-protests-grow/story-rCYJpamj6guZoZnV2dUUNL.html
14-09-2020||World||UK parliament to vote on Boris Johnson’s plan to break Brexit divorce treaty||British prime minister Boris Johnson’s plan to break international law by breaching parts of the Brexit divorce treaty with the European Union faces a vote in parliament on Monday amid growing opposition from within his own party.The House of Commons will debate the Internal Market Bill, which the EU has demanded Johnson scrap by the end of September. After the debate, lawmakers will vote to decide if it should go to the next stage. That vote may come late.Johnson’s decision to explicitly break international law has plunged Brexit back into crisis less than four months before Britain is finally due to leave the EU’s orbit at the end of a post-Brexit transition period.The EU has ramped up no-deal Brexit preparations while Britain has dismissed an ultimatum from Brussels to scrap the main parts of the bill by the end of September.Johnson, who has a majority of 80 in the lower house of parliament, is facing a growing revolt from some of his own lawmakers. Former prime ministers John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Theresa May have criticised the plan. “When the queen’s minister gives his word, on her behalf, it should be axiomatic that he will keep it, even if the consequences are unpalatable,” Johnson’s former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said in The Times. “No British minister should solemnly undertake to observe treaty obligations with his fingers crossed behind his back,” said Cox, who was sacked by Johnson in February.British ministers say the bill, which explicitly states that it could be inconsistent with a host of international laws, is intended to clarify ambiguities and act as a safeguard in case the trade talks fall.“Having an insurance policy seems to me sensible,” junior interior minister Kit Malthouse said.But some EU diplomats say they think London is playing a game of Brexit chicken, inviting the collapse of trade talks to either get the deal it wants or to leave without a deal.The EU says it cannot trust those who break agreements and that if the bill is not effectively scrapped there will be no trade deal to cover everything from car parts to food.“Come back from the brink, re-establish trust and keep your word,” Ireland’s European Affairs Thomas Byrne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-to-vote-on-boris-johnson-s-plan-to-break-brexit-divorce-treaty/story-O7oIMgeU0wMybaZEO1pH0H.html
14-09-2020||India||JD(U)’s Harivansh re-elected as RS dy chairperson||NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (United) MP Harivansh was re-elected as the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha for a second consecutive term on Monday after defeating the Opposition’s candidate, the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Jha. The result was announced after a voice vote.Congratulating him on his win and appreciating how he conducts the House, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that with his re-election as the deputy chairperson, Harivansh, who hails from Bihar, will take forward the legacy of the state, which he dubbed as “the land of democracy”.“When anyone who is a seeker of democracy, from the land of democracy, Bihar, from JP’s (Jayprakash Narayan) and Karpuri Thakur’s land, from Bapu’s (Mahatma Gandhi) Champaran, steps forward to take responsibility, this is what happens… what Harivansh has accomplished,” the PM said.Commenting on his fair play and impartiality and referring to him as the “umpire” who has the challenging task of ensuring that all “rules are adhere to”, PM Modi: “We have seen attempts being made in the House to allow everyone to speak freely, to ensure work is not stalled … this enhances the dignity of the House of Elders and this is what our Constitution framers expected.”The PM said the way he runs the House shows that he has earned the respect he commands and had fulfilled all the expectations the members had from him. “Last time, I had said that I am hopeful that just as Hari belongs to all, Harivansh too will be fair to all sides... We have seen how it is more difficult for umpires than the players to ensure the games are played as per the rules. It is challenging to convince people to play as per the rules and he has shown his decisiveness and won the confidence of those who didn’t know him.”Commenting on the productivity of the House last year, which was the highest in a decade, the PM said many bills that changed the direction of the country were passed. “This House made a new record for being the most productive even when it was an election year. This is a great matter of pride that apart from productivity, positivity also grew in the House,” he said.Earlier in the day, Bihar chief minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar sought the support of BJD president and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik for backing Harivansh’s re-election. YSRCP, which is not a part of the NDA, also supported Harivansh. BJP president JP Nadda moved the motion to elect Harivansh as the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha and Thawar Chand Gehlot seconded it. From the opposition side, Ghulam Nabi Azad moved the motion that RJD’s Manoj Jha be chosen as the deputy chairperson and it was seconded by Anand Sharma. DMK’s T Siva and SP’s Javed Ali Khan also supported Jha. The Opposition, however, did not press for division of votes and the election was announced on the basis of a voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-s-harivansh-re-elected-as-rs-dy-chairperson/story-m3GJfkVuNhPafjdmgj4jHK.html
14-09-2020||India||Govt: No data on migrants’ deaths during lockdown||New Delhi: The Centre told Parliament on Monday that no data is available on the number of migrant workers who lost their lives during the 68-day lockdown enforced on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, but assured the House that it has acted to mitigate their hardship.At least 10 million migrant workers left the cities and returned home to the countryside in states such as West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh in the aftermath of the lockdown.On Monday, the labour ministry’s response was sought in the Lok Sabha to a question whether the government was aware that a number of migrants lost their lives during their return home; the questioner sought state-wide details of the deaths and wanted to know “whether the Government has provided any compensation/economic assistance to the victims’ family.”The labour ministry that no such data has been maintained; it added that the question of compensation did not arise in the absence of recorded data. It also said no data was available on job losses among migrant workers since the pandemic’s outbreak. “In order to mitigate the financial crisis of the migrant workers and protect them against the economic disruptions due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and country-wide lockdown, the Central Government has taken numerous measures to provide them financial assistance, food packages, ration and other benefits,” the labour ministry added.On May 30, Hindustan Times reported that almost 80 deaths took place on board Shramik Special trains (meant for stranded migrant workers and their families) between May 9 and May 27, citing data from the Railway Protection Force. The labour ministry also said more than 10.4 million migrants had returned to their home states; the highest number of returnees headed home to Uttar Pradesh (3.24 million) followed by Bihar (1.5 million) and Rajasthan (1.3 million). It added that Indian Railways operated 4,611 Shramik Special trains and they ferried 6.3 million migrants to destinations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and other states.The railway ministry said last month that many migrants have begun returning to the places where they worked, adding that this indicates economic activity is picking up after India began easing lockdown restrictions.“The unplanned lockdown created a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. The BJP {Bharatiya Janata Party} government has shunned its basic responsibility of not even knowing who bore the maximum brunt of the lockdown. Their response indicates their continued callousness towards the poor. What is worse is that there is still no announcement of any cash support or universalisation of rations,” said Rajendran Narayanan, an assistant professor at Azim Premji University.The labour ministry said states and Union territories were told to take adequate steps to streamline the migration of workers to mitigate their hardship.“The States/UTs have been advised to implement the advisory guidelines by quickly gearing up their labour law enforcement machinery and ensuring statutory compliance by all the stakeholders which could provide migrant workers much needed help to mitigate the financial crisis and empower them to deal with the pandemic. The States/UTs have also been advised to maintain updated data of the migrant workers to facilitate the administration to extend benefits of the welfare schemes of the Government to the migrant workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-no-data-on-migrants-deaths-during-lockdown/story-oKl2M0L3DZ9jlcoEf2CpdM.html
14-09-2020||India||Up to 78k lives saved due to curbs: Centre||The nationwide lockdown that followed the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic prevented between 1.4 million and 2.9 million cases of the viral infection, and 37,000 to 78,000 deaths, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday, the first day of Parliament’s monsoon session.India also has been able to limit coronavirus cases to 3,328 per million population and deaths to 55 per million, which is one of the lowest in the world, the minister said in a statement on Covid-19 management.The four-phase lockdown was enforced on March 25 and remained in effect until May 31. The first phase of Unlock began on June 1. India’s tally of infections has reached 4,926, 778 and death toll to 80,807 as of Monday night. Besides limiting the number of coronavirus disease infections and fatalities, the lockdown offered India a chance to reinforce its health infrastructure to tackle the disease, Harsh Vardhan said.The lockdown was used to enhance human resource and produce within India critical elements such as protective personal equipment (PPE), N-95 masks and ventilators, he said. “A case in point is increase in dedicated isolation beds by 36.3 times and dedicated ICU {intensive care unit} beds above 24.6 times to what existed in March 2020. Whereas there was no indigenous manufacturing of PPE, with the requisite standards, at that point in time, we are now self-sufficient and in a position, to even export the same,” he said.Health experts are divided on how effective the lockdown has been.““India has managed to keep the numbers low both in terms of cases and deaths considering India’s huge population and densely populated areas. More than the cases, what matters is how many lives we have managed to save, and the numbers say the country has done a decent job of bringing the fatality rate to below 2%. Measures such as implementing early lockdown were instrumental in giving the government adequate time to prepare to manage the outbreak. Lockdown wasn’t meant to stop cases, it was meant to give us the time to prepare to manage the pandemic, which we did successfully,” says Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital. Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, differed.“The lockdown has not been a lockdown in the true sense of the word in India because if it were then you wouldn’t see cases going up by leaps and bounds right under the lockdown,” he said.The maximum number of cases and deaths have been reported from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Bihar, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Kerala and Gujarat. All these states have reported at least 100,000 cases.“Many of the epidemiological parameters such as mode of transmission, subclinical infection, period of virus shedding, role of immunity etc are still being researched. Once a person is exposed to the infection, the disease may develop anytime between 1-14 days,” the health minister said in the Lok Sabha.The government has taken several measures to contain the spread of the disease, including creation of a group of ministers (GoM) on February 3, under the chairmanship of Vardhan. The GoM consists of the minister of external affairs, minister of civil aviation, minister of state for home affairs and minister of state for shipping, among other senior government functionaries, and has met 20 times since its inception.On March 29, 11 empowered groups were created to manage the Covid-19 pandemic. On September 10, the groups were restructured based on needs and the evolving scenario.The idea is to take an informed decision on issues ranging from medical emergency planning, availability of hospitals, isolation and quarantine facilities, disease surveillance and testing, ensuring availability of essential medical equipment, augmenting human resources and capacity building, supply chain and logistic management to coordination with the private sector, among other things.For appropriate management of Covid-19 cases, a three-tier arrangement of health facilities: Covid Care Centres with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; dedicated Covid Health Centres with oxygen supported isolation beds for moderate cases; and dedicated Covid Hospital with ICU beds (for severe cases) has been put in place.As of September 12, 2020, a total of 15,284 Covid treatment facilities with 1,314,646 dedicated isolation beds without oxygen support have been created. Also, a total of 231,093 oxygen-supported isolation beds and 62,717 ICU beds (including 32,575 ventilator beds) have been readied.“Constant monitoring of the disease trend, analysis of available infrastructure and planning in advance for the future has averted a major crisis as was faced by many developed countries. In addition, a total of 12,826 quarantine centres with 5,98,811 beds have been created,” Vardhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-78k-lives-saved-due-to-curbs-centre/story-Wl9pQY5UQSMXRygcNX2FsJ.html
14-09-2020||India||Kashmir’s feisty weddings bear lacklustre look amid Covid-19 pandemic||This season, Kashmir’s feisty weddings are looking lacklustre owing to the Covid-19 crisis. Besides the postponement of marriages, the pandemic has forced many people to go for innovations which they consider as ‘safeguards’ against the disease.Jammu and Kashmir has recorded more than 50,000 Covid-19 cases till date and around 850 deaths, forcing many to defer their weddings.In Kashmir, the peak marriage season falls between August to November. Those who are going for marriages contrary to past have drastically curtailed the number of guests. Needless to say, masks and sanitisers have become part of the wedding paraphernalia.“This season Kashmir is witnessing very few weddings and number of guests are limited to just 100 to 150,’’ says Haji Shabir Ahmad who works as a wholesale dealer of disposable wedding items.“Earlier for every average wedding we used to sell disposables worth around Rs 60,000 to 1,50,000. Now, our bills remain squeezed between Rs 20,000 to 30,000. Even the number of weddings has come down by around 70 percent.’’ He, however, says that now they have added sanitisers, masks and PPE kits in the list of items.Also read: Won’t be enough Covid-19 vaccines till 2024 - Serum Institute’s Adar PoonawallaDue to the rising number of Covid-19 cases, many families after mutual understanding have postponed their weddings for the next year. ‘’My brother was getting married this year and all arrangements were almost done but the growing number of Covid-19 cases have forced us to defer the marriage until next year as we don’t want to take the risk and a Kashmiri wedding without a big gathering looks very dull,’’ says Adnan Ahmad of old city.In Kashmiri marriages, the host serves a couple of feasts comprising seven to twelve course Kashmiri Wazwan served in big copper plates. Each plate is consumed by four people. While a simple marriage lasts for two days, affluent families stretch their marriage ceremonies to four to five days where quintals of mutton delicacies prepared by trained chefs (Wazas) are served. As a precaution, many families now serve Wazwan in single copper plates instead of bigger plates known as (Trami). Some have replaced even the plates with clay bowls to serve Wazwan in them. “I recently attended a marriage at Iqbal Nagar, Sopore, it was a simple function, the guests were served in clay pots instead of copper plates. Many people like the way our ancestors used to eat in the clay pots,’’ says Shiekh Haroon who attended the wedding. ‘For many, it was an innovative thing, besides, guests were also given masks and sanitisers.’’ Also read: 25 Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha MPs test Covid-19 positive - Here’s a listThe curtailment of the guest list has also made the marriages simple and easy, many even skipped the Wazwan and solemnised the marriage function serving tea or Khewa (green tea with saffron).“My cousin is getting married next week. Last time when we had a marriage in our house the function lasted for four to five days and we ended up serving seven quintals of meat to nearly 1,000 guests. This time we are preparing just 100 kilograms of meat and our guest list is not more than 100,’’ says Peer Ishfaq. ‘’My cousin will go with seven to eight guests to bride’s house which wasn’t possible earlier.’’“Earlier, people had to book chefs (Wazas) months ahead of the ceremony, the chefs are out of work from August 5 last year and now pandemic has hit our industry badly. The people who go for marriages have curtailed their expenses by around 80 percent as people don’t want to take any chances,’’ said Mohammad Yaqood, a chef from north Kashmir. “Kashmir’s wedding was a big trade, now it is at its lowest point. Hope situation will improve when the pandemic ends.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-feisty-weddings-bear-lacklustre-look-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-99QuijtTqruuzPBIc40snJ.html
14-09-2020||India||SG opposes same-sex marriage plea in HC||New Delhi: The Centre on Monday opposed a plea seeking legalisation of marriage for gay couples under the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act even as the Delhi high court observed that changes were taking place around the world and it needed to be examined whether it was applicable to India. The petition was filed last week by four members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community who invoked Article 14 (right to equality), Article 21 (right to life) and Article 25 (freedom of religion) to argue that right to marriage for same-sex couples was a part of that fundamental right.“These marriages run contrary to the provisions which are already in place in our society. Our values do not recognise a marriage, which is sacrosanct, between two people of same sex marriage,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told a bench comprising Chief Justice of the Delhi high court DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan. Mehta clarified that he was expressing his personal opinion.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed on September 8 claimed that Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not specify that the marriage must be between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman, but instead refers to marriage between “two Hindus”. “It does not concur with constitutional values,” Mehta said.To this, Justice Jalan said that changes have taken place across the world and when two men marry in a foreign country, neither is considered a wife. He further said that all aspects of the plea would need to be examined.The Supreme Court had decriminalised homosexuality, but not provided for anything further, Mehta told the court, referring to the September 6, 2018 judgment of a five-judge Constitution bench headed by the then chief justice of India Dipak Mishra, which read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.Mehta later clarified to the Hindustan Times that while he was yet to receive instructions from the Centre, he had pointed out to the court the legal provisions to show that the law did not permit same sex marriages. “I said culture of any country is codified in a statutory law like Degrees of Prohibited relationship, special or additional rights to “wife”, different age limits for “husband” and “wife”, use of the terms “husband” and “wife” (which cannot be determined in same sex marriage) etc, special protection to “wife” in criminal law such as section 498-A of the IPC etc. Unless several statutory provisions are altered (which the court cannot do) the relief as prayed for cannot be granted,” Mehta said.Appearing for the petitioners, Raghav Awasthi told the court that the fundamental rights of gay couples were getting hampered, even as there was no legal prohibition on such marriages.There are many benefits extended under the Hindu Marriage Act which cannot be availed by his petitioners, he said. “Today the matter was listed before the honourable Delhi high court. The learned chief justice has asked us to file details of people who have tried to get married and failed to do so after the passing of the Navtej Johar judgment. We shall be doing the same,” Awasthi told HT. The petition has been filed by intersex rights activist Gopi Shankar, founder of lesbian collective Sakhi Giti Thadani, transgender rights activist G Oorvasi and writer Abhijit Iyer Mitra.The bench stated that the aggrieved party could have moved court in their personal capacity instead of a filing a PIL, and asked the counsel to bring on record all persons whose marriages were not registered on account of being a same-sex marriage. The matter will be taken up for hearing on October 21.The petition pointed out that in 2018, the Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality.“The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is signatory to,” the petition stated.“Change in marriage laws has to be secular and broad-based. To contend that the Hindu Marriage Act should recognise same sex marriages because Hinduism does, suffers from two errors. The Hindu Marriage Act is decidedly anti-scriptural. It was brought in 1955 to amend Hindu law and undo the regressive elements of the scriptures which were incorporated in the law. The Act was an attempt at reformation, rather than incorporating venerated practices of the scriptures. Secondly, it matters little whether the Hindu scriptures recognise same sex marriage or not. There will be a lot of debate either was, but that’s beside the point. Marriage for members of the LGBTQI community has to be allowed because the Constitution demands it,” said Supreme Court advocate Saurabh Kirpal who appeared for the petitioners in the Navtej Johar case, which led to decriminalisation of homosexuality in 2018.(With inputs from Murali Krishnan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sg-opposes-same-sex-marriage-plea-in-hc/story-QWrhRtiQMiY0phHsQpc1yK.html
14-09-2020||India||Assam student bodies form political party||GUWAHATI: Two of Assam’s biggest student organisations, the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), came together on Monday to formally announce the formation of a new political party, Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), ahead of next year’s assembly elections. The new regional party is among several outfits that have formally launched recently or are in the process of being formed. Both the AASU and the AJYCP had earlier formed a 16-member advisory committee of prominent personalities to suggest a way forward. Based on their suggestions, the decision to form a new political party “to secure the future of Assam and Assamese people” was taken. “Work on our party begins from now. The organisation set up across all districts will be completed by October and the party’s state-level political convention will be held in November,” said Basanta Deka, former professor of Handique Girls College, one of the two convenors of the advisory committee. He added that the new party will follow the slogan, “ghore ghore ami (we are in each household)” with the aim of reaching out to every house across Assam ahead of the next polls in the eastern state ruled by a coalition of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF).“The constitution of the party is nearly complete and its aims and ideologies would be unveiled at a later date. The party’s flag, symbol and office-bearers would be announced at the November convention,” said former Gauhati University professor Krishnagopal Bhattacharya, the other convenor. This will be the second political party to be formed by leaders belonging to the AASU, after the AGP, which came into being in 1985 after the signing of the Assam Accord that ended the six-year-long anti-foreigner agitation that saw an active participation of both the AASU and the AJYCP. Both these organisations spearheaded the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stir in the state, opposing the Centre’s move to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan—which many in Assam feared would lead to large scale influx of Bangladeshis to the border state. Activist Akhil Gogoi’s Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), another outfit that took part in the anti-CAA stir, has announced its plan to launch a political party.Journalist-turned-politician Ajit Bhuyan, who became a Rajya Sabha MP earlier this year with support of Congress and the AIUDF, too has floated an outfit called Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM). Lawyer Arun Borbora launched the United Regional Party, Assam, last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-student-bodies-form-political-party/story-eJlnndqen3tVdeamSawE8H.html
14-09-2020||India||Bhushan files review plea in contempt case||Advocate Prashant Bhushan filed a review petition before the Supreme Court on Monday, challenging his conviction by the apex court in a criminal contempt of court case, hours after he deposited the fine of Re 1 imposed on him by the top court as punishment. Bhushan maintained that depositing the fine did not signify that he was in agreement with the top court’s verdict.“I am going to the Supreme Court registry to deposit Re 1 fine imposed on me in relation to the contempt of court case. That I am depositing the fine does not mean I am accepting the judgment. I will be filing a review petition against the judgment today,” Bhushan told journalists outside the Supreme Court on Monday morning.Later in the day, he filed the review petition. The apex court, on August 14, held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court for two tweets, one criticizing the Supreme Court and the other targeting Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The court then held a separate hearing on the punishment to be handed down to the activist lawyer. During the hearing on sentencing, Bhushan was offered opportunities by the court to apologise, but he stood his ground.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra pronounced its sentence on August 3,1 imposing a token fine of Re 1 on Bhushan. He was asked to deposit the fine with the registry of the court by September 15, failing which he would undergo three months’ imprisonment and be debarred from practising before the Supreme Court for three years.In his review petition, Bhushan challenged the August 14 judgment, contending that the judgment suffered from various errors and also rendered any criticism of the Supreme Court an offence of criminal contempt.The review petition said that a detailed reply was filed by Bhushan in defence of his tweets, but the court did not take into account the contents of his reply while convicting him. He also questioned the manner in which the court initiated the case and heard him, which he contended was in violation of the principles of natural justice because he was not afforded a proper opportunity to present his case.Bhushan highlighted the fact that court took note of his tweets after an advocate, Mehek Maheshwari, filed a petition before the Supreme Court on July 9, seeking the initiation of contempt of court proceedings against him for the tweets.“A copy of the petition of Mr. Maheswari that was the basis for initiating the suo motu {on its own motion} proceedings was not supplied to the review petitioner (Bhushan). It is respectfully submitted that this violation is fundamental and goes to the very root of the matter, as the review petitioner could not address before the court whether the basis on which the court formed its view was substantial or not,” the review petition said.Importantly, Bhushan submitted that the case should not have been heard by justice Arun Mishra given that the same judge had on previous occasions orally accused Bhushan of committing contempt of court when he had merely mentioned that it may be inappropriate for judges to hear cases in which conflict of interest was involved.Bhushan has already filed a petition before the Supreme Court on September 12 praying that an additional legal remedy should be provided in those cases where persons are convicted by the Supreme Court in original criminal contempt cases.Original criminal contempt cases are those which are heard directly by the Supreme Court in the first instance. In such cases, if a person is convicted, he or she is left with no further remedy as the Supreme Court is the highest court in the country.Bhushan argued that in such a case, the convict should be afforded the right to an intra-court appeal, i.e. a larger bench of the Supreme Court different from the bench which convicted a person, should hear an appeal against the conviction.There is a chance of “arbitrary, vengeful, and high-handed decisions” in such contempt cases where the apex court is not only the aggrieved party, but also the “prosecutor, the witness, and the judge,” raising the fear of bias, Bhushan’s September 12 plea said.Bhushan also told the media on Monday that he received Re 1 from various people across the country expressing their solidarity with him; this, he said, was part of larger campaign called “Rupee one, Everyone”. He said that the money so collected would be used to set up a fund called “Truth Fund” which will be used to fight legal cases for the benefit of people who have been arrested for speaking out against the government.“Yesterday, Umar Khalid was arrested only for the reason that he is in support of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The government in India today is cracking down on dissenters to silence them. The Truth Fund will be utilised to defend such persons,” Bhushan said.Activist Khalid was arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for the role he allegedly played in a conspiracy behind the February riots in the national capital.Earlier in the day, retired Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur spoke out in support of Bhushan and also decried the arbitrary use of sedition laws by the government machinery.Lokur was speaking at a video conference organized by the non-government organization, Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms, and the social and political organisation, Swaraj Abhiyan, in support of Bhushan. Lokur said many citizens who expressed their opinions are slapped with sedition cases while those who call for violence don’t face any state reprimand.“State is using sedition as an iron hand to curb free speech, which I think is an overreaction to people expressing their views. On the other hand, those who call for violence and breaking up things, nothing happens to them,” Lokur said.He also highlighted an episode from Uttar Pradesh in which a person whose speech called for unity of citizens was detained by the government on grounds that the speech threatened the integrity of the country.His reference was the detention of Dr. Kafeel Khan, who was imprisoned under the National Security Act because of a speech delivered by him in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on December 12, 2019 relating to the CAA.. The Allahabad high court quashed Khan’s detention on September 1, observing that his speech did not promote hatred or violence; rather, it deprecated violence and called for national integrity and unity.“He was kept under detention for six to seven months because his speech was misinterpreted. Thus, free speech is curbed is by misreading the statements of citizens,” Lokur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-files-review-plea-in-contempt-case/story-cy8ucutS541wwgRdyxVMrL.html
14-09-2020||India||Khalilzad to meet Jaishankar, discuss Afghan peace process||New Delhi US special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad will hold talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday on the intra-Afghan negotiations underway in Doha against the backdrop of calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war-torn country. According to diplomats in Doha and New Delhi, Khalilzad will share details of the latest developments in the Afghan peace process. He is also expected to express his appreciation for India’s role in the Afghan reconstruction process during his brief trip to India. Khalilzad’s visit to New Delhi follows a trip on Monday to Islamabad, where he held talks with the top civilian and military leadership. There was no official word from the US or Pakistani side on the discussions. The intra-Afghan negotiations were inaugurated in Doha on Sunday, six months later than planned due to disagreements over a prisoner swap agreed in February and the continuing Taliban offensive and attacks on high value targets in Kabul.Jaishankar laid down India’s expectations from the peace process in his address during Sunday’s inaugural ceremony. New Delhi expects that Afghan soil will never be used for any “anti-India activities”, and supports an “immediate, comprehensive ceasefire” since the rising levels of violence cannot be allowed to continue, he said. Khalilzad had been expected to impress on the Imran Khan government the need to pressure the Taliban to reduce violence in Afghanistan if the talks to end the 19-year war are to succeed. The US interlocutor wants to ensure the Pakistani military takes steps so that the Taliban stays on course in the peace talks. It is widely believed the Taliban, if it hadn’t been under pressure from the US military, would have preferred to militarily take over Afghanistan and turn it into an Islamic emirate as it had done in 1996. At the opening ceremony on Sunday, the Afghan government and its allies, including the US, called for a ceasefire. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the peace process for the Afghan government, said the Taliban could offer a ceasefire in exchange for the release of more jailed fighters. But there was no mention of a truce by the Taliban. Ahmad Nader Naderi, a member of the government’s negotiating team, tweeted on Sunday: “The first meeting between the contact groups of the two negotiation teams took place today. In this meeting code of conduct between two sides, schedules of upcoming meetings and relevant issues were discussed and progress [was] made.” Apart from the US, Afghanistan, the Taliban and Qatar, which is hosting the talks, Sunday’s ceremony was attended by representatives from India, Pakistan, Russia, Germany, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Norway and the UN. The event was attended by a delegation led by joint secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran) JP Singh of the external affairs ministry and including Deepak Mittal, the Indian envoy to Qatar and a Pakistan-Afghanistan expert. Singh also met Abdullah Abdullah in Doha over the weekend to discuss the peace process. During the meeting, Abdullah thanked India for its continued support. Pakistan has persistently opposed any role for India in Afghanistan but the US, its allies and the Afghan government have been deeply appreciative of New Delhi’s assistance to the reconstruction effort in the war-ravaged nation. The Afghan government’s 21-member negotiating team is led by Masoom Stanekzai, a former intelligence chief. The Taliban side is led by Abdul Hakim, the terror group’s chief justice and a close aide of the its chief Haibatullah Akhunzada. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who was in Doha for the opening ceremony, said the negotiations would be difficult. “We will undoubtedly encounter many challenges in the talks over the coming days, weeks and months,” he said, calling for the warring sides to “seize this opportunity” to secure peace. Khalilzad told Afghanistan’s Tolo News channel there some people in Afghanistan who prefer the current volatile situation to peace with the Taliban, while some are attempting to keep Washington engaged in war so that it could pay the price, “It is not acceptable and there is a solution to every problem, and a solution must be found. We are ready to help if the country’s interests come first and personal interests do not come first. I am confident a solution will be found and we will not allow personal interests to take precedence. This is the promise of the US to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalilzad-to-meet-jaishankar-discuss-afghan-peace-process/story-AiPI0ytrlQzmUH5ksldCSL.html
14-09-2020||India||Chinese envoy hails 5-pt plan||New Delhi Chinese envoy Sun Weidong on Monday said the five-point roadmap agreed to by India and China to address tensions on the disputed border provides “political impetus” to efforts to ease the situation, even as he blamed New Delhi for trespassing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and altering the status quo. Sun made the remarks in a lengthy statement issued by the Chinese embassy three days after the two sides finalised the five-point roadmap during a meeting of external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Moscow on Thursday. Despite the roadmap, sharp divergences remained between the two sides, with experts pointing out that the joint statement issued after the Jaishankar-Wang meeting made no mention of the restoration of status quo on the LAC as it existed in April. Sun said the five-point roadmap – which includes following consensus between the top leaders, easing tensions, maintaining peace and tranquillity in border areas, continuing diplomatic communications, and expediting work on new confidence-building measures – “is an important step towards the right direction, and will provide political impetus to ease the border situation and promote the bilateral relations”. He added: “I hope and believe that as long as the two sides earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two foreign ministers to the frontline troops and adhere to the correct means of dialogue and negotiation, the two sides will find a way to overcome the current difficulties.” The Chinese envoy contended that “public opinion in India” was generally positive towards the five-point roadmap, and was of the view that “both sides have demonstrated political will to resolve the border situation”. However, Sun referred to statements by relevant Indian ministries that Indian troops “pre-empted” Chinese military activity on the south bank of Pangong Lake, and contended this “obviously revealed that there are illegal trespassing the LAC and status quo change in the border areas.”. He noted that sections of the Indian media had quoted government sources to disclose that the “Indian Army fired shots on two different occasions”, and said, “For the first time since 1975, the calm in the border areas was broken by gunfire.” Sun further noted that Wang had reiterated during his meeting with Jaishankar that the “imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides”, and that it is “important to move back all personnel and equipment that have trespassed”. He added, “The frontier troops must quickly disengage so that the situation may de-escalate. The Chinese side supports enhanced dialogue between the frontier troops on both sides to solve specific issues, and will stay in touch with the Indian side through diplomatic and military channels.” The Indian side has blamed the tensions on the LAC on unilateral efforts by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to alter the status quo in the Ladakh sector. It has also blamed the latest flare-ups on the LAC on “provocative military manoeuvres” by the PLA. The external affairs ministry has said the PLA engaged in such manoeuvres during August 29-30 to change the status quo on the south bank of Pangong Lake and Indian troops responded with “appropriate defensive measures”. The Indian Army has accused the PLA of firing in the air when Chinese troops were prevented from closing in on an Indian forward position on September 7. The Chinese envoy said the “way ahead for [a] solution is very clear” – he pointed to the agreement reached by the two foreign ministers that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work on new confidence-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas. Sun said the top leadership of the two countries had reached a series of consensus, including the basic judgement that China and India are partners rather than rivals. “Therefore, we need peace instead of confrontation; we need to pursue win-win cooperation instead of zero-sum game; we need trust rather than suspicion; we need to move our relationship forward rather than backward,” he said. He reiterated Wang’s observation that it is normal for China and India to have differences, but it is important is to put these differences in a proper context vis-a-vis bilateral ties. “At present, the challenge we’re facing is to fight the epidemic, revive the economy and improve people’s livelihoods,” he said. There was no immediate response to the Chinese envoy’s remarks from Indian officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-hails-5-pt-plan/story-ynrNTjvZ3OTO7xN4tin86H.html

14-09-2020||India||‘Will not dismantle encroachment without joint decision of Centre, Delhi govt’: Railways||The ministry of railways on Monday said it will not dismantle any encroachment referring to demolition of slums situated along the city’s railway tracks, without a “proper decision” taken in consultation with the urban development ministry and the Delhi state government.The statement by the railways comes in the backdrop of a political storm caused by the Supreme Court’s decision on August 31 directing railways to remove the 48,000 slums situated in the railways safety zone within three months. The court further directed that no court in Delhi would stay the demolition process.“The railways have been taking all the measures for complying with the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order in M.C. Mehta v/s Union of India dated 31.8.2020,” a statement issued by the Northern Railways said. Railway officials are holding regular meeting with all stake holders including Delhi government; Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB)and the ministry of urban development to find means and ways to “comply with Hon’ble Supreme Court Order”, northern railways said.“Further, Railway will not dismantle any encroachment without proper decision along with MOUD and state government. The same stand has been taken by the Ministry of Railways in hearing of Ajay Maken’s petition in Hon’ble Supreme Court listed today. Railways have also started the drive in large scale and have removed 5-6% garbage lying along the track till date. The garbage cleaning will be completed within three months as given in the order by Hon’ble Supreme Court,” it added.The Northern Railways had submitted a report to the Supreme Court stating that the slums along the railway tracks were acting as a hindrance towards keeping them clean.The Congress last Friday had moved the Supreme Court against the demolition of around 48,000 slums near railway tracks in Delhi.“The removal order was passed without hearing the slum dwellers. If slums are removed, more than 2,50,000 people will be out on the roads,” Congress leader Ajay Maken had said in his petition to the apex court. The apex court on Monday, however, informed that the Centre and Delhi government are in the process of making a decision with regard to the clearing of 48,000 slums situated adjacent to railway tracks in Delhi.The Delhi government last week had written to the Northern Railway, urging it to not to demolish slums situated along the city’s railway tracks without first rehabilitating its dwellers.The letter, from the government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), said the slum dwelling units, which the rail utility is set to demolish in pursuance of a Supreme Court order, are protected under the provisions of the NCT of Delhi Laws (special provision) Second Act, 2011.It is estimated that around 2.4 lakh people live in slums in Naraina Vihar, Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri, Sriniwaspuri, Anand Parbat, Okhla and other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-dismantle-encroachment-without-joint-decision-of-centre-delhi-govt-railways/story-d9EihNkg090ol0v70UXnlO.html

The helicopter was shot down the day Pakistan launched its jets to target Indian installations in Jammu and Kashmir in response to an Indian airstrike on a terror camp in Balakot. The military court has stayed action against the officers till the matter comes up for hearing again on September 30, said counsels Ankur Chhibber and Karn Deo Baghel who are representing the petitioners at the AFT. Group Captain Suman Roy Chowdhury and Wing Commander Shyam Naithani, the two officers who moved the AFT, were then posted at the Srinagar air base. While the former was the chief operations officer of the base, the latter was in charge of the air traffic control. “Both the officers had challenged the CoI as well as its findings on the ground of violation of Rule 156 (2) of the Air Force Rules as well as issues related to the composition of the CoI,” Chhibber told Hindustan Times. He said after hearing the parties, the military court said there were violations in the conduct of the CoI and directed that no action be taken against the officers on the basis of the inquiry till September 30, the next date of hearing. The two officers, among the five held blameworthy for the incident, moved the AFT’s principal bench in January 2020 with the plea that the IAF be directed to provide them the entire proceedings of air force CoI into the February 27 incident. A surface-to-air missile brought down the Russian-origin utility helicopter and left six IAF personnel on-board and a civilian on ground dead, raising questions about whether ground crew, including air traffic controllers, had followed standard operating procedures. The IAF was on its highest alert levels the day when the helicopter was brought down. It expected Pakistan to respond to the unprecedented peace-time cross-border airstrike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-tribunal-stays-action-in-matter-related-to-mi-17-friendly-fire-incident-till-sept-30/story-PCCIGPwnyC8ZdNQwAnSqFO.html

There was a paucity of funds because of the lockdown and the work stopped,” said Amit Srivastava, deputy director of Uttar Pradesh tourism office in Agra.“The museum was to house historical artefacts from Mughal and Braj culture. It is located about 2 kilometres from the eastern gate of Taj Mahal,” added Srivastava.Reacting to the decision to change the museum’s name, Samajwadi Party’s Agra city president Wazid Nisar blamed the Yogi regime of focusing only on changing names instead of developmental works.“This Mughal Museum was the dream project of then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. The BJP government is not releasing the required funds for the completion of the project,” he said.Fadnavis welcomes Yogi’s decision Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly, welcomed Yogi’s decision on renaming the Mughal Museum after Shivaji. Soon after the Agra divisional review meeting, Yogi had tweeted in Hindi, “The under-construction museum in Agra will be named after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In your new Uttar Pradesh, there is no place for any symbols of subservient mentality.” Responding to Yogi’s tweet, Fadnavis tweeted, “Jai Jijau, Jai Shivrai !

The trust operates two bank accounts from the SBI’s main branch in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.On Monday, the trust tweeted from its official twitter handle, “The amount of 6 lakh rupees, which was fraudulently transferred from the bank account of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra using fake cheques & signatures, has been duly returned to the trust’s account by SBI. Our gratitude to SBI management for their swift action.”Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust, also confirmed the return of the money.Also read: ‘He was compelled’ - Raghuvansh Singh’s letter sparks row after his demise“The SBI has returned to the trust the Rs 6 lakh which was fraudulently withdrawn from the bank account of the trust,” said Champat Rai.On September 1, a fraudster had transferred Rs 2.5 lakh and on September 8 another Rs 3.5 lakh from the trust’s bank account at SBI, Ayodhya, through two cloned cheques and forged signatures into an account at Punjab National Bank, Lucknow. The fraud came to light when Rai received a verification call from the SBI regarding another cheque worth Rs 9.86 lakh on September 9 apparently issued by the trust. Rai, who was in Ayodhya, verified that the cheque, with the number quoted by the bank, was still in the trust’s chequebook. By then, two other cloned cheques had already been used to defraud the trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-cheque-fraud-sbi-returns-rs-6-lakh-to-ram-janmabhoomi-trust/story-XK8AOcILQXFB2dfBSkJYLI.html
14-09-2020||India||Good cinema can make a better community, says Vikram Kochhar||Actor Vikram Kochhar believes in portraying his characters realistic and relatable. And, to prepare for that he does a lot of homework. “Events and incidents from my own life, research on YouTube, narration of character and interaction with locals are my tools. I collect everything, I try to make it my own and then give my best,” said the multi-faceted actor.Probably that’s the reason his earthy roles such as Sanki Pandey in ‘Raktanchal’, Mattu in ‘Sacred Games’, Gulab Singh in ‘Kesri’ and Dukhi Daroga in ‘Sumit Sambhal Lega’ connected with audiences. An NSD alumnus, he talked about his training process. “In acting, it’s best to remain closest to truth but in films we need to create drama around reality. The fact is that viewers relate to real stories. That is why, more than big superstars, people relate more with actors like Naseer(uddin Shah) Saheb, Om Puri Saheb or Irfaan Saheb and connect with them — from the heart. “I personally believe that cinema has the power to change society. That power you have in your hand! The more you relate to people, the more they will relate to you. And, if we make good cinema, then we can become a better community.”The actor said that many times, it depends on the character sketch and on the scope you have to develop it within the story line. Inputs from locals play a big part in building a character, like he did in ‘Raktanchal’, where he got an open hand, he said.The son of an army official, he has travelled a lot which is helping him. “My maternal side is from Uttar Pradesh as my mother’s hometown is Jhansi. I am a Punjabi, born in Binaguri (West Bengal) and have lived in Saharanpur, Firozpur, Dalhousie, Bikaner, Gurgaon and Delhi,” he said.The actor has just wrapped up his shoot. “We finished the schedule of OTT series ‘Simple Murder’ in Delhi with actor Zeeshan Ayub, Amit Sial, Priya Anand and Sushant Singh. Here we largely did outdoor shoots and exteriors. The major shooting was done in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.” Last winter, he simultaneously shot for ‘Raktanchal’ in Varanasi and ‘Aashram’ in Ayodhya and is expecting to do its next seasons later this year. He is next shooting for a web film that stars Deepak Dobriyal. “Kafi time khali baithey rahe…ab paisa bhi kamana padega thoda! Besides, I have a good friend circle in which some are earning while some are not. So, our aim is that whatever work is coming we must do and earn so the support-system for everyone is maintained.”Kochhar is happy that he is getting to portray different kinds of characters on OTT. “Because of the lockdown, suddenly, the audience has increased which gave a boost to OTT releases. Releases of ‘Raktanchal’ during total-lockdown gave it a big viewership; now ‘Aashram’ is getting a lot of love.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/good-cinema-can-make-a-better-community-says-vikram-kochhar/story-MC6LeI9UtK0TB9vZdAoAwI.html
14-09-2020||India||Environment ministry allows virtual public hearings, email submissions||The Union environment ministry on Monday issued guidelines on holding public consultations for various large infrastructure projects like mining or industry which were on hold since March.Environmental experts have red-flagged certain clauses in the environment ministry’s office memorandum because they could dilute the consultation process in remote areas where local people have no access to internet or other means of submitting responses in writing.The guidelines state that 100 people can gather for a hearing while maintaining social distancing as per the home ministry’s order under Unlock 4. If more than 100 people are required to gather then hearings can be staggered to more than one hearing. The guidelines have also provided the option of holding online or virtual hearings in addition to physical public hearings. The guidelines also state that state pollution control boards can obtain responses from local communities in writing “from concerned persons having plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project or activity, through electronic means”. The guidelines do not clarify if the written submissions are in addition to physical hearings.On completion of the virtual or physical hearing the pollution control boards will submit a summary of the issues raised during the hearing in person or virtually or through email along with a response of the project proponent along with a certificate of the district magistrate or his authorised representative to the ministry or other regulatory authority, the guidelines, seen by HT state.“For the ministry or project proponents, public hearings may be just one step closer to the grant of an environment clearance. For affected people, these are not just platforms for receiving information but a rare and critical opportunity for a direct interface with their government. The guidelines are designed to push through public hearings and not take socio-ecologically informed decisions. Those who choose to attend them will do so at a grave health risk and for many others, particularly in remote areas the hearings will be efficiently wrapped online or offline, even before people can wrap their heads around these new guidelines,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.“Demand has reduced across sectors including mining leading to a slump. Public hearings had stopped. We had been demanding that public hearings should begin so that our operations can start again,” said Ashish Das, Federation of Indian Mineral Industries joint director.Senior environment ministry officials were not reachable for a comment on the clauses on Monday but press information bureau representatives confirmed that the office memorandum had been issued on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-ministry-allows-virtual-public-hearings-email-submissions-on-hold-since-march/story-tPpyzoXfR934D95M11zAMI.html

The statement would assume significance in the backdrop of demands made by the Opposition for a debate on the issue. Singh had met his Chinese counterpart Gen Wei Fenghe in Moscow recently.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had also met in Moscow a few days ago. Meanwhile, the Union Cabinet and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs are also likely to meet over video conferencing on Tuesday afternoon, government sources said. During the monsoon session, which began on Monday, the opposition is seeking to corner the government on its handling of the standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, the COVID-19 situation, economic downturn and unemployment, and is pressing for discussions on these issues. The Congress and other opposition parties raised these demands in the first business advisory committee (BAC) meeting for Lok Sabha chaired by Speaker Om Birla on Sunday, but no time has been allocated yet for these discussions.The BAC for Lok Sabha will be held again on Tuesday afternoon to further discuss the first week’s business schedule.Similar demands have been raised by the Congress in the BAC for Rajya Sabha as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-likely-to-make-statement-in-parliament-on-sino-india-issue-report/story-GPoE1WyEA8fTwTej0cnv8N.html
14-09-2020||India||China’s envoy cheers Jaishankar-Wang roadmap, then blames India for tension||Chinese envoy Sun Weidong on Monday said the five-point roadmap agreed to by India and China to address tensions on the disputed border provides “political impetus” to efforts to ease the situation, even as he blamed New Delhi for trespassing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and altering the status quo. Sun made the remarks in a lengthy statement issued by the Chinese embassy three days after the two sides finalised the five-point roadmap during a meeting of external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow on Thursday. There was no immediate response to the Chinese envoy’s remarks from Indian officials. Despite the roadmap, sharp divergences remained between the two sides, with experts pointing out that the joint statement issued after the Jaishankar-Wang meeting made no mention of the restoration of the status quo on the LAC as it existed in April. Sun said the five-point consensus – which includes following the top leaders’ consensus, easing tensions, maintaining peace and tranquillity in border areas, continuing diplomatic communications, and expediting work on new confidence-building measures – “is an important step towards the right direction, and will provide political impetus to ease the border situation and promote the bilateral relations”. He added, “I hope and believe that as long as the two sides earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two foreign ministers to the frontline troops and adhere to the correct means of dialogue and negotiation, the two sides will find a way to overcome the current difficulties.” The Chinese envoy contended that “public opinion in India” was generally positive towards the five-point roadmap, and was of the view that “both sides have demonstrated political will to resolve the border situation”. However, Sun referred to statements by relevant Indian ministries that Indian troops “pre-empted” Chinese military activity on the south bank of Pangong Lake, and contended this “obviously revealed that there are illegal trespassing the LAC and status quo change in the border areas (sic)”. He noted that sections of the Indian media had quoted government sources to disclose that the “Indian Army fired shots on two different occasions”, and said, “For the first time since 1975, the calm in the border areas was broken by gunfire.” Sun further noted that Wang had reiterated during his meeting with Jaishankar that the “imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides”, and that it is “important to move back all personnel and equipment that have trespassed”. He added, “The frontier troops must quickly disengage so that the situation may deescalate. The Chinese side supports enhanced dialogue between the frontier troops on both sides to solve specific issues, and will stay in touch with the Indian side through diplomatic and military channels.” The Indian side has blamed the tensions on the LAC on unilateral efforts by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to alter the status quo in the Ladakh sector. It has also blamed the latest flare-ups on the LAC on “provocative military manoeuvres” by the PLA. The external affairs ministry has said the PLA engaged in such manoeuvres during August 29-30 to change the status quo on the south bank of Pangong Lake and Indian troops responded with “appropriate defensive measures”. The Indian Army has accused the PLA of firing in the air when Chinese troops were prevented from closing in on an Indian forward position on September 7. The Chinese envoy said the “way ahead for [a] solution is very clear” – he pointed to the agreement reached by the two foreign ministers that as the situation eases, the two sides should expedite work on new confidence-building measures to maintain and enhance peace and tranquillity in the border areas. Sun said the top leadership of the two countries had reached a series of consensus, including the basic judgement that China and India are partners rather than rivals. “Therefore, we need peace instead of confrontation; we need to pursue win-win cooperation instead of zero-sum game; we need trust rather than suspicion; we need to move our relationship forward rather than backward,” he said. He reiterated Wang Yi’s observation that it is normal for China and India to have differences, but it is important is to put these differences in a proper context vis-a-vis bilateral ties. “At present, the challenge we’re facing is to fight the epidemic, revive the economy and improve people’s livelihoods,” he said. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-point-roadmap-gives-political-impetus-to-efforts-to-ease-border-row-chinese-envoy/story-1T7dYKte4v406HqXLFHuDP.html

14-09-2020||India||Ahead of 2021 assembly polls, AASU-AJYCP tie up to form Assam Jatiya Parishad||Two of Assam’s biggest student organizations, All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) came together on Monday to formally announce formation of a new political party, Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), ahead of next year’s assembly polls. The new regional party is among several outfits that have formally launched recently or are in the process of formation to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party-led ruling coalition comprising the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) in the April election. Both AASU and AJYCP had earlier formed a 16-member advisory committee of prominent personalities to suggest a way forward and based on their suggestions the decision to form a new political party “to secure the future of Assam and Assamese people” was taken. “Work on our party begins from now. The organization set up across all districts will be completed by October and the party’s state-level political convention will be held in November,” said Basanta Deka, former professor of Handique Girls College, one of the two convenors of the advisory committee. He added that the new party will follow the slogan-‘ghore ghore ami’ (we are in each household) with the aim of reaching out to every home across Assam ahead of next year’s assembly polls.“The constitution of the party is nearly complete and its aims and ideologies would be unveiled at a later date. The party’s flag, symbol and office bearers would be announced at the November convention,” said former Gauhati University professor Krishnagopal Bhattacharya, the other convenor. Incidentally, this will be the second political party to be formed by AASU leaders after Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which came into being in 1985 after signing of the Assam Accord that ended the six-year-long anti-foreigners agitation--in which both AASU and AJYCP played a key role. Both organizations had spearheaded the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stir in the state opposing the Centre’s move to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan—which many in Assam feared would lead to large scale influx of Bangladeshis to the state. “We have got very good response from the public and other organizations to the new party. Everyone who loves Assam and its people and even those in other parties with similar views are welcome to join us,” said veteran politician Jagadish Bhuyan, coordinator of AJP. Earlier, the leadership of both AASU and AJYCP had stressed that formation of the new party won’t affect the organizations and they would retain their non-political character. Incidentally, AJP isn’t the only political party that will make its debut in the next assembly polls. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), another outfit which spearheaded the anti-CAA stir has announced its plan to launch a political party. The outfit’s leader Akhil Gogoi, who is at present in jail since last December for his role in the anti-CAA stir, has urged all outfits to come under one umbrella. Journalist-turned-politician Ajit Bhuyan, who became a Rajya Sabha MP earlier this year with the support of the Congress and AIUDF, has also floated an outfit called Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM). Noted lawyer Arun Borbora had launched the United Regional Party, Assam last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2021-assembly-polls-aasu-ajycp-tie-up-to-form-assam-jatiya-parishad/story-dTLwHkIOcqMebPAceZs8GI.html

The petitioner is Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), a Dehradun-based NGO. Rakesh Thapliyal, counsel of Nishank, and Vikas Bahuguna, counsel of Vijay Bahuguna and Khanduri, said the court has given them two weeks to file their response in the matter. Kartikey Hari Gupta, counsel of the petitioner, said as the former CMs didn’t comply with the HC directions. RLEK filed the contempt petition against the three and the chief secretary, following which the court issued show-cause notices to them. Also read: 25 MPs test positive for Covid-19 on first day of Parliament’s monsoon session“Chief secretary Om Prakash has filed his response affidavit in the court in which he has stated that the state government has filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court in the case, hence the contempt petition may be deferred. The counsels for the three CMs also appeared and sought time to file A response. The court has given two weeks to them to file their response and ordered that the matter be posted immediately after two weeks for further hearing,” he said.On May 3, 2019, the HC had directed the ex-CMs to pay the market rent amounting to Rs 2.8 crore for the buildings occupied by them within six months. It had also directed that the amount payable towards amenities such as electricity, water, petrol, oil and lubricants be recalculated within four months and the same be intimated to the ex-CMs. The court asked the ex-CMs to pay the amount to the state government within six months.The HC had delivered the order on May 3 after hearing the PIL filed by RLEK. The PIL challenged free residence, car, security and other perks to the former CMs in 2010. On June 9, the HC declared several provisions of the Uttarakhand Former Chief Minister Facility (Residential and other facilities) Act 2019 as ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority), paving way for the recovery of pending dues from the former CMs at the market rate. In January this year, RLEK filed a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the Act passed by the state government in the winter session of the assembly in December last year. The state government, on January 15, issued a gazette notification regarding the implementation of the Uttarakhand Former Chief Minister Facility (Residential and other facilities) Act 2019, which was passed by the assembly in December and assented to by the governor on January 13. According to the notification, the appropriate rent of the government residences allotted to the ex-CMs would be recovered from the allottees from the date of the allotment. However, the notification added, the facilities provided to the ex-CMs by the state government, such vehicle along with driver, maintenance of vehicles, personal assistant/officer on special duty/public relation officer, fourth class employee, watchman, gardener, telephone attendant and security guard, would be free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-directs-3-former-cms-to-file-response-in-contempt-petition-case/story-DEYpwoNI5frvE3LKjZKB9H.html

14-09-2020||India||Offences against women and children: HC pulls up cops for shoddy investigations||The Bombay High Court at Goa has directed the state Director General of Police to hold an inquiry into the conduct of his officers while noting that there was “a certain element of casualness, insensitivity and at times, even apathy in investigations particularly in matters involving sexual offences against women and children.”Upholding the acquittal in yet another case where the alleged perpetrators of crime against children, especially the girl child, the court felt that “there is real danger of investigating agencies gaining an impression that this is tolerable or that this is the new normal.“Of late, we are coming across the cases of shoddy and insensitive investigations particularly, in matters involving sexual offences against women and children. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for the Courts to convict or sustain the conviction of perpetrators of such crimes,” the Bombay High Court bench of Justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar said.“Utmost vigilance and sensitivity is the need of the hour if we are to protect our children’s future,” the High Court said.Also read: Meet Japan’s likely next PM who begins and ends his day with 100 sit-ups“There should be a serious enquiry into the lapses in this matter and ultimately if any of the police officials involved are found to have misconducted themselves then some suitable action is taken against them in accordance with law. Such enquiry must be held and concluded as expeditiously as possible and in any case within six months from today,” the High Court noted, adding that it deliberately give an extended period in view of the pandemic.It was the second case in a matter of four weeks that the High Court came across wherein the accused were let go on account of a shoddy investigation by the police.In the first case, a man who allegedly raped an eight-year-old girl was acquitted owing to insufficient evidence both by the trial court as well as the High Court which upheld the acquittal.“The victim had earlier seen the said person in a carpentry shop near the temple [yet] no efforts were made to search him... no spot located or attempts were made to locate where the actual sexual assault took place… the Police has not made any inquiry with the younger brother of the victim who was alleged to be playing with the victim at the relevant time (when she was picked up taken to a lonely spot and allegedly raped)... no independent witnesses were called for panchanama on spot from where the victim was alleged to be picked up on a scooter… no mobile was ceased though it is claimed by the victim that the accused had shown her some obscene scenes,” the High Court noted.In the second case, wherein a family was accused of illegally keeping the custody of a minor girl as a maid, harassing her and thereby driving her to suicide, the Court pulled up the Goa Police for failing to record the girl’s statement while she lay in a hospital bed battling for life having consumed rat poison in a bid to end her life.“We found no explanation for failure to record the statement of the child [before] she, unfortunately, expired at the hospital [despite] the doctor having clearly opined that the child was fit to give a statement,” the High Court said.“There is no explanation as to why Magistrates were not contacted for the record of such a vital statement. In any case, there ought to have been less of such casualness and more sensitivity in the matter of record of statement of a minor girl who was admitted in hospital for consumption of rat poison,” the High Court noted.The High Court has now specifically asked the DGP “to take steps to see that the prosecutions against the perpetrators of crimes against minor children do not fail on account of shoddy and insensitive investigation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offences-against-women-and-children-hc-pulls-up-cops-for-shoddy-investigations/story-WhtqmnF2L4BzlkjnHKjCZM.html

PM Modi said the way he runs the House shows that he has earned the respect he commands.“The House is being run in very difficult circumstances due to corona.

14-09-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling probe: Industry minister EP Jayarajan’s son likely to be questioned||As the demand for the resignation of Kerala higher education minister KT Jaleel,who was interrogated by the Enforcement Directorate two days ago, is getting louder; the son of another CPI (M) minister who allegedly figured in one of the incidents related to the sensational gold smuggling case, is likely to be questioned by Central agencies soon. A senior official familiar with the multi-agency probe said national agencies will soon question Industry Minister E P Jayarajan’s son in connection with the alleged commission in the Life Mission project brokered by Swapna Suresh, main accused in the smuggling case. Considered as the number two in the ministry, Jayarajan is a central committee member of the party. The minister’s son also threw a huge party for Suresh in a star hotel in 2018, for settling his cheque case in the United Arab Emirates, said the official. He later emerged as an intermediary in the Life Mission project, funded by a Gulf-based organisation Red Crescent to build free homes for the poor, and reportedly accepted commission; the official said adding that he will be summoned to obtain more details about his association with Suresh. ALSO READ | As Kerala polls draw near, top CPM leaders in limelight for wrong reasonsBut chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has brushed aside these charges saying it was an attempt to sabotage a people-friendly project. “There is a concerted move to topple one of the dream projects of the government ‘Life Mission’ which is providing shelter to thousands of homeless. Opposition parties and a section of the media are busy cooking up half-baked stories to discredit the government,” he said. But the opposition Congress and BJP have raised another serious charge against the minister’s family members who are under quarantine after he tested Covid-19 positive last week. “Flouting quarantine norms, the minister’s wife had gone to the Kerala Bank last week and opened the locker. We have information that she shifted some valuables from there after her son’s name cropped up in connection with Swapna Suresh,” said BJP state president K Surendran. Later, the bank manager also confirmed that she visited the bank on September 10 and all employees were advised to go into quarantine. The minister’s wife PK Indira later admitted that she had visited the bank for her personal needs and she was not in quarantine at that time. Indira had retired as a senior manager from the same bank a couple of years ago. What has raised suspicion is the urgency with which she opened the locker breaking the Covid-19 protocol. There are reports the ED has sought details from the bank about her visit and transactions. As the multi-agency probe gathered speed more shocking details have emerged—the Customs department has found that between 2017 and 2018 about 17,000 kg dry dates was imported by the consular office. “The office had mentioned that dates were imported for personal use. But in the small office staff members are below 20 and they never need such a huge quantity that is fit to open at least a couple of dry date shops,” a senior Customs officer said. He said Customs will examine the details of all imports from October 2016 when the consulate was opened in the state. The Customs smelled trouble when large quantities of dry fruits, tinned food and bathroom fittings came to the consulate regularly. When one such consignment came in July the External Affairs Ministry sought the UAE permission to open the consignment (under Vienna convention permission is necessary) and seized 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings. Last week, the ED had grilled Bineesh Kodiyeri, CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son in connection with the Bengaluru drug haul. In a recent statement in the economic offences court in Kochi, the ED had said the gold smuggling case and drug seizure had close links. The gold smuggling case figured prominently in Parliament on the opening day. In reply to a question, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said the multi-agency probe was going in the right direction and one of the accused in the case was influential. Meanwhile, for the third consecutive day the state witnessed protests seeking the resignation of Jaleel. Many opposition party workers were injured in baton charging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-probe-industry-minister-ep-jayarajan-s-son-to-be-questioned-soon/story-lr9SYvJZ4LnKQNeOfGs4MP.html
14-09-2020||India||Prashant Bhushan deposits Re 1, files review petition against contempt of court conviction||Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan filed a review petition before the Supreme Court on Monday challenging his conviction by the apex court in criminal contempt of court case. This came hours after he deposited the fine of Re 1 imposed on him by the top court as punishment in the case. Bhushan maintained that depositing the fine amount does not signify that he agrees with the top court’s verdict.“I am going to the Supreme Court registry to deposit Re 1 fine imposed on me in relation to the contempt of court case. That I am depositing the fine does not mean I am accepting the judgment. I will be filing a review petition against the judgment today,” Bhushan told media persons outside the Supreme Court on Monday morning.Later in the day, he filed the review petition. The apex court had, on August 14, held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court for his two tweets, one criticizing the Supreme Court and the other against Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde.The court then held a separate hearing on the punishment to be handed down to the activist lawyer. During the hearing on sentencing, Bhushan was afforded opportunities by the court to apologise but he refused to do so and stood his ground.Also read: 24 Lok Sabha MPs test positive for Covid-19 on first day of monsoon sessionA 3-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra then pronounced its sentence on August 31 and imposed a token fine of Re 1. He was asked to deposit the fine with the registry of the court by September 15 failing which he would have to undergo imprisonment of 3 months and will also be debarred from practising before the Supreme Court for 3 years.In his review petition, Bhushan challenged the August 14 judgment contending that the judgment suffers from various errors and also renders any criticism of the Supreme Court an offence of criminal contempt.The review petition said that a detailed reply was filed by Bhushan in defence of his tweets but the court did not take into account the contents of his reply while convicting him. He also questioned the manner in which the court initiated the case and heard him which he contended violated the principles of natural justice since he was not afforded a proper opportunity to present his case.In this regard, Bhushan highlighted the fact that the court had taken note of his tweets after one Mehek Maheshwari, an advocate, filed a petition before the Supreme Court on July 9 seeking initiation of contempt of court proceedings against Bhushan for the tweets.“A copy of the petition of Mr Maheswari that was the basis for initiating the suo motu proceedings was not supplied to the review petitioner (Bhushan). It is respectfully submitted that this violation is fundamental and goes to the very root of the matter, as the Review Petitioner could not address before the court whether the basis on which the Court formed its view was substantial or not,” the review petition said.Importantly, Bhushan submitted that the case should not have been heard by Justice Arun Mishra since he has, on previous occasions, orally accused Bhushan of committing contempt of court when he had merely mentioned that it may be inappropriate for judges to hear cases in which conflict of interest was involved. The petition listed various instances wherein Justice Mishra had heard cases to Bhushan’s detriment.Bhushan had filed a petition before the Supreme Court on September 12 praying that an additional legal remedy should be provided in those cases where persons are convicted by the Supreme Court in original criminal contempt cases.Original criminal contempt cases are those which are heard directly by the Supreme Court in the first instance. In such cases, if a person is convicted, he or she is left with no further remedy as the Supreme Court is the highest court in the country.Bhushan has prayed that in such a case, the convicted person should be afforded the right to an intra-court appeal, i.e. a larger bench of the Supreme Court, different from the bench which convicted the concerned person, should hear an appeal against such conviction.There is a chance of “arbitrary, vengeful, and high-handed decisions” in such contempt cases where the apex court is not only the aggrieved party but also the “prosecutor, the witness, and the judge,” raising the fear of bias, Bhushan’s plea had said.Bhushan also told the media on Monday that he received Re 1 from various people across the country expressing their solidarity with him and this was part of a larger campaign called “Rupee one, everyone”. He said that the money collected would be used to set up a fund called “Truth Fund” which will be utilised to fight legal cases for the benefit of those who have been arrested for speaking out against the government.“Yesterday, Umar Khalid was arrested only for the reason that he is in support of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The government in India today is cracking down on dissenters to silence them. The ‘Truth Fund’ will be utilised to defend such people,” Bhushan said.Former SC judge expresses concerns over misuse of sedition lawEarlier in the day, retired Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan Lokur spoke in support of Bhushan and decried the use of sedition laws by government machinery at the drop of the hat.Lokur was speaking at a video conference meeting organized by non-governmental organization, Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms, and socio-political organisation Swaraj Abhiyan, in support of Bhushan.Lokur said that many citizens who express their opinions and views are slapped with sedition cases while those who call for violence don’t face any state reprimand.“State is using sedition as an iron hand to curb free speech which I think is an overreaction to people expressing their views. On the other hand, those who call for violence and breaking up things, nothing happens to them,” Lokur said.He also highlighted an episode from Uttar Pradesh wherein a person whose speech called for unity of citizens was detained by the government on the ground that the speech threatened the integrity of the country.The incident he was referring to was the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan who was kept in prison under the National Security Act concerning a speech relating to the Citizenship Amendment Act delivered by him at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on December 12, 2019. The detention order by District Magistrate said that Khan’s speech of December 12 instigated the students of AMU and there were continuous and violent protests by the students due to which public order in Aligarh was disturbed.The Allahabad High Court quashed Khan’s detention on September 1 observing that Khan’s speech did not promote hatred or violence, instead it deprecated violence and called for national integrity and unity.“He was kept under detention for 6 to 7 months because his speech was misinterpreted. Thus, free speech is curbed is by misreading the statements of citizens,” Lokur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-deposits-rs-1-files-review-petition-against-contempt-of-court-conviction/story-ORv8lxCNhIfdA18JqztLbP.html

The Sena, condemning the treatment meted out to the officer, asked what did ex-naval man Madan Sharma gain by mocking a constitutional authority and was it part of “national work”.The Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, also slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party and asked if the ruling party at the Centre will stage protests against the incident where ex-servicemen were beaten up in BJP-ruled states and by BJP representatives.“Will he [Madan Sharma] be given an award now?” the editorial asked. “They speak against the leaders of the state you live in, you earn, live happily, and if someone breaks your face, then they use ‘injustice, oppression, attack on freedom’ to politicise the issue,” it remarked.Sharma had allegedly shared a cartoon mocking chief minister Thackeray and subsequently Sena shakha pramukh and five others assaulted him in Kandivali, a northern suburb in Mumbai. The Sena workers were arrested and subsequently released on bail.“In Mumbai, a retired naval officer named Madan Sharma was attacked by the Shiv Sainiks, no one would support it, it should be condemned but what did the retired officer gain by sharing a satirical cartoon on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who has been elected by the people of the state,” Shiv Sena said. “Honor the person sitting in the Constitutional post, wasn’t this gentleman taught in the Navy?” Sena asked.The editorial also took a jibe at defence minister Rajnath Singh after he called the ex-servicemen to enquire about his health. Sena said it was surprising that the defence minister spoke with the ex-Navy person as if sharing a satirical cartoon on a chief minister was a “great national work” he did.Continuing the attack on the BJP, the editorial raked up the Dadri lynching case victim, Mohammed Akhlaq’s son who has been serving the army, and the Amethi lynching case in which retired Army officer Amanullah was killed. “This incident happened in the BJP-ruled state recently but we never read anything about the Prime Minister or the defence minister speaking to Amanullah’s wife,” it said.It added many unfortunate incidents have taken place in the BJP-ruled states but the national party never took to the streets.“Earlier, Jalgaon BJP MP Unmesh Patil forced a Border Security Force soldier, Sonu Mahajan, to vacate his house. Patil supporters also attacked Sonu with a sword. Why did the BJP, which took to the streets for the naval officer today, not protest in favour of an ex-soldier at that time? How many attacks on ex-servicemen have happened in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar?” Shiv Sena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-sharing-cartoon-on-cm-national-work-sena-on-attack-on-ex-navy-man/story-AoqClDwcj3KDRUDbEVMhjP.html

14-09-2020||India||Turkey’s Erdogan chases Ottoman dream, ends up unsettling West Asia | Analysis||The Recep Tayyip Erdogan government will establish a museum to honour Mehmed the Conqueror, the Ottoman Sultan who captured Constantinople and took the first big steps to expand the Ottoman empire. “For the first time in Turkey, a museum bearing the name of a sultan will be built in Edirne,” Professor Zekeriya Kurşun at the Istanbul-based Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakıf University told state-run news agency Anadolu Agency. The deadline is next year.The museum in Turkey’s Edirne province across the Bosporus strait - that forms the continental boundary between Europe and Asia - is seen as one of the continuing steps, big and small, to rebrand the Erdogan regime as a successor to the Ottoman one.Turkey’s 66-year-old leader has himself minced no words, declaring in 2018 that the Republic of Turkey was a continuation of the Ottoman empire. The son of a coast guard who lives in a 1,000-room presidential palace in Ankara, bigger than the White House or the Kremlin, Erdogan has been reinventing himself; from a model democrat in the Islamic world a few years earlier to the new champion of Islamism to fit the new role.This aspiration has pitted Erdogan’s Turkey against Saudi Arabia over its claims of global Islamic leadership. Saudi Arabia was one of the territories controlled by the Ottoman Empire during its heyday, apart from parts of Europe, northern Africa and other West Asian countries.It was also why Erdogan’s Hagia Sophia move was an unambiguous message to the Islamic world as well. It is a sign towards achieving “freedom” for al-Aqsa mosque in the old city of Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims, Erdogan said as the museum was reconverted into a mosque in July.Erdogan’s ambitions are expected to further complicate the situation in the Islamic world that is already witnessing increasingly divisive trends that include sectarian strife between Shias and Sunnis, Arabs vs non-Arabs and apprehensions around the political Islam of the Muslim Brotherhood.Erdogan has sided with Qatar in its ongoing dispute with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, closely engaging in regional hotspots against the two Arab majors, and has been hard at work to mobilise non-Arab Muslim countries.Also Read: Mike Pompeo urges diplomacy in standoff over Mediterranean gasNon-Arab Sunni majority countries such as Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia have joined forces with Shia Iran and Arab Qatar to counter the Saudi-UAE-Egypt axis in the Islamic world. These divisions are further compounded with Shia Iran’s support to Shia-majority Iraq, Syria and sections within Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen.At the first meeting hosted by Malaysia last year, 20 countries turned up at the summit designed to place the front powered by Turkey in competition with the Saudi-led Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC.Pakistan, which backs Erdogan’s effort, had dropped out of the summit at the last moment due to pressure from Riyadh. But Imran Khan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi did set up a diplomatic firestorm last month when he signalled that Islamabad could approach Erdogan’s Islamic front to discuss Kashmir at a ministerial-level if the OIC was unwilling. Imran Khan later appeared to back this approach when he explained, in a TV interview, that each country - he was talking about Riyadh - was entitled to act in its national interest. He left it unsaid that this principle would apply to Pakistan also.Over the past month, the Donald Trump-brokered pacts between Israel and first, the United Arab Emirates in August and last week, Bahrain, has presented Erdogan with the opportunity to criticise the kingdoms in the Gulf.Erdogan, styled himself as the defender of Palestinians, threatening to suspend diplomatic ties with UAE in retaliation. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1949 but this fact hasn’t stopped Erdogan from holding forth.“The move against Palestine is not a step that can be stomached,” President Erdoğan said last month as he spoke about the possibility of snapping ties with UAE, according to a Reuters report. Israel and its two new partners, Bahrain and UAE, will sign on the dotted line in Washington on Tuesday.Already, the Turkish President has been taking a more active role in regional affairs and flexing muscles.According to the Washington Post, Turkey has a military presence in Syria, Iraq, Qatar, Somalia and Afghanistan and peacekeeping troops in the Balkans and its navy patrolling the Mediterranean and Aegean seas where it has laid claim to energy and territorial interests.The Post, which mapped Turkey’s expanding military footprint, said Ankara has also invested in Sudan to let it build a naval base on the Suakin island, once ruled by the Ottoman Empire, that would give it direct access to the Red Sea.In South Asia, Turkey’s growing proximity with Pakistan, whose voice Erdogan echoes on Kashmir, has soured relations between Ankara and New Delhi. Like when President Erdogan launched a broadside at New Delhi in August last year at the United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled his visit to Ankara in October and didn’t hesitate to condemn Turkey’s military operation in Northern Syria.On the sidelines of the UNGA, PM Modi also scheduled meetings with Cyprus, Armenia and Greece, all Turkey’s rivals in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/turkey-s-erdogan-chases-ottoman-dream-ends-up-unsettling-west-asia-analysis/story-W9DE7qiTUDRPhfwLgioonO.html

14-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: Tourism ‘severely impacted’ by Covid-19, says Prahlad Patel||Minister for Culture and Tourism Prahlad Patel said in the Lok Sabha on Monday – the first day of the 18-day uninterrupted monsoon session of Parliament -- that the tourism sector has been “severely impacted” because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The minister was responding to an unstarred question in the Lower House of Parliament. In a written reply, Patel said: “no formal study has been instituted for assessment of the impact on the tourism sector and job losses.” Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: LS passes Homoeopathy and Indian systems of medicine billsHe added: “However, several rounds of discussions and brainstorming sessions with industry stakeholders indicate massive loss of revenue and jobs. In view of the highly unorganised nature of the tourism sector, the impact in numerical terms can only be ascertained in due course.” According to another written reply submitted by the minister, the contribution of tourism in the gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs in 2018-19 was 5% and 12.95%, respectively. Patel reached out to international tourists through his response. ‘The ministry of tourism through the India Tourism Offices overseas proposes to undertake various promotional activities which include participation in travel fairs and exhibitions; advertising in the local print, electronic, outdoor and digital media; organising webinars to highlight success stories about Covid-19 in India to build confidence among foreign tour operators and travellers.” There has been no arrival of foreign tourists to the country as international flights have been non-operational since March 22. Earlier, officials had told HT that the focus would increasingly be to boost domestic tourism, as the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to continue to deter people from travelling long distances. Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: No data available on migrant deaths during lockdown, says CentreThe ministry has also undertaken Dekho Apna Desh webinars, aerial photography of key cities and cultural assets in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Udupi, Aurangabad and iconic tourist sites across the country during the 68-day nation-wide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak. Patel said the ministry has launched SAATHI (System for Assessment, Awareness & Training for Hospitality Industry) for effective implementation of guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued in reference to Covid-19 and beyond for safe operations of hotels, restaurants, bed and breakfast (B&B) and other hospitality units. Patel said the ministry does not have “any regulatory authority to seek refunds of advance amount paid”. He added: “However, industry stakeholders have been requested to consider such issues and requests sympathetically.” The minister also cited the key steps taken by various ministries of the government to help the tourism sector recover. “Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended moratorium on term loans until August 31,” said Patel. “The government has further announced Atmanirbhar Bharat package through which a Rs 3 lakh crore collateral free automatic loan has been made available for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). The loan will have four-year tenure and a 12-month moratorium,” he added. Patel also said that a 16-member committee has been set up to look into Indian culture, spanning as far back as 12,000 years ago. The panel includes experts from a range of fields, including Archaeological Survey of India, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Vivekananda Foundation, Geographical Survey of India and Delhi University’s department of English, as well a representative from the ministry of culture. “An expert committee has been set up for conducting holistic study of origin and evolution of Indian culture since 12,000 years before present and its interface with other cultures of the world,” Patel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-tourism-severely-impacted-by-covid-19-says-prahlad-patel/story-HiIsFmNxsbS1r0YeshEWmI.html
14-09-2020||India||Our values don’t recognise same-sex marriage: Centre tells Delhi HC||The Centre on Monday opposed a plea seeking legalisation of marriage for gay couples under the Hindu Marriage Act (1955) filed last week by four members of the Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community.“These marriages run contrary to the provisions which are already in place in our society. Our values do not recognise a marriage, which is sacrosanct, between two people of same sex marriage,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre told a bench comprising Chief Justice of the Delhi high court DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan. Mehta clarified that he was expressing his personal opinion.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed on September 8 claimed that Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act did not specify that the marriage must be between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman, but instead refers to marriage between “two Hindus”. The petition invoked Article 21, which guarantees right to life, arguing that right to marriage was part of that fundamental right.Also read: Not made Delhi HC judge due to sexual orientation, says lawyerThe Supreme Court had decriminalised homosexuality, but not provided for anything further, Mehta told the court, referring to the September 6, 2018 judgment of a five-judge Constitution bench headed by the then chief justice of India Dipak Mishra, which read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.“It does not concur with constitutional values,” Mehta said.To this, Justice Jalan said that changes have taken place across the world and when two men marry in a foreign country, neither is considered a wife. He further said that all aspects of the plea would need to be examined.Mehta later clarified to the Hindustan Times that while he was yet to receive instructions from the Centre, he had pointed out to the court the legal provisions to show that the law did not permit same sex marriages. “I said culture of any country is codified in a statutory law like Degrees of Prohibited relationship, special or additional rights to “wife”, different age limits for “husband” and “wife”, use of the terms “husband” and “wife” (which cannot be determined in same sex marriage) etc, special protection to “wife” in criminal law such as section 498-A of the IPC etc. Unless several statutory provisions are altered (which the court cannot do) the relief as prayed for cannot be granted,” Mehta said.Also Read: Two years after Section 377: Judgement that said it with poetry and words from literatureAppearing for the petitioners, Raghav Awasthi told the court that the fundamental rights of gay couples were getting hampered, even as there was no legal prohibition on such marriages.There are many benefits extended under the Hindu Marriage Act which cannot be availed by his petitioners, he said.The petition has been filed by intersex rights activist Gopi Shankar, founder of lesbian collective Sakhi Giti Thadani, transgender rights activist G Oorvasi and writer Abhijit Iyer Mitra.The bench stated that the aggrieved party could have moved court in their personal capacity instead of a filing a PIL, and asked the counsel to bring on record all persons whose marriages were not registered on account of being a same-sex marriage. The matter will be taken up for hearing on October 21.The petition pointed out that in 2018, the Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality.“The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is signatory to,” the petition stated.“Change in marriage laws has to be secular and broad-based. To contend that the Hindu Marriage Act should recognise same sex marriages because Hinduism does, suffers from two errors. The Hindu Marriage Act is decidedly anti-scriptural. It was brought in 1955 to amend Hindu law and undo the regressive elements of the scriptures which were incorporated in the law. The Act was an attempt at reformation, rather than incorporating venerated practices of the scriptures. Secondly, it matters little whether the Hindu scriptures recognise same sex marriage or not.

14-09-2020||India||25 MPs test positive for Covid-19 on first day of Parliament’s monsoon session||Twenty-five members of Parliament tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the first day of the monsoon session, secretariat officials told Hindustan Times on Monday.Junior railways minister Suresh Angadi, the BJP’s Meenakshi Lekhi, Anant Kumar Hegde, Parvesh Sahib Singh, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Kaushal Kishore were among the 17 Lok Saha MPs who have contracted the viral disease.In the upper house, the Congress party’s Deepender Singh Hooda and Naranbhai J Rathwa, the BJP’s Ashok Gasti and Abhay Bhardwaj, the AIADMK’s A Navneethakrishnan, the AAP’s Sushil Kumar Gupta, the TRS’s V Lakshmikantha Rao and AITC’s Shanta Chhetri were found to be infected.Lekhi later tweeted that she is currently in good health. She also requested people who recently come in contact with her to get tested for the coronavirus disease.“After the routine Parliament test for COVID & genome test it’s confirmed that I have tested positive for the virus. I am currently in good health & spirits. I request everyone who has been recently in contact with me to get tested. Together We will fight & defeat Corona,” Lekhi tweeted.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it has carried out testing of more than 2,500 samples of members of Parliament and other officials “on a war footing” over the weekend.The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, considered the most accurate for the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, would continue till the next week for the members of Parliament, officials said.As the viral disease continues to pose a threat to the session, many senior MPs, cutting across political lines, have decided against attending the proceedings.On the first day of the delayed session that was attended by 359 members, nearly 200 were present in the Lok Sabha chamber and a little over 30 were seated in the visitors’ gallery located above the main chamber. Plastic shields were installed in front of the members’ benches in order to ensure distance.A giant TV screen in the Lok Sabha chamber showed very few members occupying seats in the Rajya Sabha chamber, the other venue where the lower house MPs have been accommodated keeping in mind physical distancing norms.Benches that usually accommodate six members had a numbered seating plan for only three.The Parliament session is being held in two shifts — the Rajya Sabha in the morning and the Lok Sabha in the afternoon — with members of both Houses spread across the two chambers and galleries. On the opening day, however, the Lok Sabha was held in the morning shift and the Rajya Sabha in the afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-lok-sabha-mps-test-positive-for-covid-19-on-first-day-of-parliament-s-monsoon-session/story-299dRDj5FHV7XBRnufoqfM.html
14-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: LS passes Homoeopathy and Indian systems of medicine bills||The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill 2019 and The National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill, 2019, were passed in Lok Sabha on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament on Monday. The bills were passed in Rajya Sabha in January, 2019, to regulate alternative systems of medicine on the lines of the National Medical Commission Bill, and create a new regulatory body for homoeopathy in the country. To introduce transparency and quality, the Indian System of Medicine bill proposes a common entrance exam and an exit exam for all graduates to obtain their license to practice Indian medicine. Catch LIVE Updates of Parliament’s monsoon session hereThe bill will replace the Central Council for Indian Medicine that regulates alternative systems of medicine. There is a provision for constituting four autonomous boards dedicated to providing Ayurveda education under Board of Ayurveda, and training in Unani, Siddha and Sowarigpa under Board of Unani, Siddha and Sowarigpa. Two common boards, which are, the board of assessment and rating to grant permission to educational institutions of Indian systems of medicine, and the board of ethics and registration of practitioners of Indian systems to maintain a national register and address ethical issues, will relate to practice under the National Commission for Indian Medicine. “This should help regulate the sector, but the idea of having an exit exam is likely to meet with some resistance,” said an Ayush researcher, requesting anonymity. The National Commission for Homoeopathy, Bill, 2018, aims to replace the Central Council for Homoeopathy, which is the current regulatory body for homoeopathy. It proposes a teacher’s eligibility test to assess the standard of teachers before appointment and promotions. The National Commission will have three autonomous boards entrusted with conducting overall education of homoeopathy by homoeopathy education board. The board of assessment and rating will grant permission to educational institutions, while the board of ethics and registration of homoeopathy practitioners will maintain the national register and address ethical issues. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan introduced the bills on behalf of Shripad Yesso Naik, the minister for Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy). The health minister also introduced the much-awaited assisted reproductive technology (ART) Bill in the Lok Sabha. “When we were introducing the Surrogacy Bill last year, we were told that we should also bring in the ART Bill as both go hand in hand. Therefore, I introduce the ART bill in the House,” he said.The bill aims to lay down guidelines for dos and don’ts of running ART clinics and conducting procedures in the country. It proposes constitution of a national board that will set the minimum standards of physical infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic equipment and expert manpower to be employed by clinics and banks. There will be a National Registry and Registration Authority to maintain a central database and assist the National Board in its functioning. The bill also proposes for a stringent punishment for those found practising sex selection, or involved in sale of human embryos or gametes, running agencies, rackets, and also organisations found violating the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-ls-passes-homoeopathy-and-indian-systems-of-medicine-bills/story-DyDnE5HvrQAQlJkef5nC7K.html

14-09-2020||India||No home posting for newly recruited doctors in Bihar||The Bihar government has deliberately posted 3,186 doctors, appointed as general duty medical officers (GDMOs) under Bihar health services on September 11, outside their home districts. Given the urgency during the coronavirus pandemic, their recruitment and posting was done simultaneously in a record time of 36 hours since the Bihar Technical Service Commission declared their result on September 10. The recruitment of 5,000 nurses last month was also done in 48 hours. In posting the newly recruited doctors, the health department has, however, ensured that most of them were posted nearest to their home district. For instance, those belonging to Patna were posted preferably in Vaishali, 32 kms north-east of Patna — considered to be “close” by Delhi’s standard. Alternatively, they have been posted in adjoining districts of Saran, Bhojpur, Jehanabad or Nalanda, all within 64 to 85 kms radius from Patna, with a travel time of around two hours. “Merit was the top criteria for posting doctors after which we considered their location. Only a small percentage who could not be accommodated at locations adjoining their home district were considered for posting in the same division as their home district and a negligible percentage may have been posted elsewhere,” said an officer privy to the decision who did not wish to be identified. The Patna division, for instance, comprises the districts of Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur. Bihar is divided into 38 districts under nine divisions, including Patna, Tirhut, Saran, Darbhanga, Kosi, Purnia, Bhagalpur, Munger and Magadh. “There are two reasons for not posting doctors in their home districts. First, there is an advisory of the state cabinet coordination department to not post class II employees in their home districts; and second, to ensure better efficiency among doctors,” said the officer. Absenteeism among doctors in government facilities is a common issue, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit, found after he inspected eight of the nine state-run medical colleges within a month of his posting on July 27. He is scheduled to visit the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri, this week. Amrit was drafted in place of Uday Singh Kumawat as Covid-19 cases were on the ascendancy and testing of samples was low. Bihar’s total Covid-19 case burden then was 41,111, having tested the highest 14,236 samples in a day (July 27), with a cumulative test count of 4,70,560. The comparative figures have now risen to a total 1,58,389 Covid-19 cases against 48,84,417 samples tested, with 1,10,500 samples tested on Saturday. Recruitment and shortage of doctors The recent appointment of doctors as GDMOs was against 4,012 vacancies advertised a year ago. The government had recruited last month around 950 specialist doctors, having post graduate degrees, against 2,400 posts advertised a year back. Bihar has been guilty of not appointing doctors in a time-bound manner, adding to a shortfall of around 5,000 as on date. As many as 4,115 of the 7,956 doctors appointed since 1990 were recruited in the last one month after Amrit joined the health department. Previously, 2,486 doctors were appointed in 2016. Prior to that, 1,355 doctors were recruited between 1990 and 2011 — 646 in 1990, seven in 1992, 29 in 1997, 12 in 2000, 272 in 2007 and 389 in 2011. “There are around 8,000-8,500 doctors against 13,500 sanctioned posts under Bihar health services. A shortage of around 3,000 doctors exists in the rank of senior medical officer to director-in-chief, even as most vacancies at the GDMO level have been filled up after this round of appointment in the basic grade,” said Dr Ranjeet Kumar, general secretary of the Bihar Health Services Association. Amrit was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-home-posting-for-newly-recruited-doctors-in-bihar/story-QqxFecASFYf016upfXWTqI.html
14-09-2020||India||Cured patients in Uttar Pradesh asked to follow Centre’s post-Covid protocol||The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday said it was implementing the post-Covid management protocol announced by the union ministry of health and family welfare. Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, said out of the three lakh Covid cases in the state, 2.39 lakh had recovered. At present, there are 68,122 active Covid cases in the state.The recovered patients had been directed to follow the post-Covid management protocol announced by the central government, he said.In its advice, the union ministry of health and family stated that after acute Covid-19 illness, recovered patients may continue to report a wide variety of signs and symptoms, including fatigue, body ache, cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, etc.A holistic approach is required for follow-up care and well-being of post-Covid recovering patients, it said.Prasad said the post-Covid follow-up protocol advised continuation of the appropriate behaviour — use of mask, hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, drinking adequate amount of warm water and taking immunity promoting Ayush medicines prescribed by a qualified practitioner of Ayush (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and homoeopathy).If health permitted, regular household work could be done and professional work was to be resumed in a graded manner, he said.The recovered patients were advised mild moderate exercises, including yogasana, pranayama, meditation, breathing exercises, daily morning and evening walk at a comfortable pace.The other suggestions include balanced nutritious diet, adequate sleep and rest, avoid smoking and consumption of alcohol and do self-health monitoring at home.“If there is persistent dry cough, do saline gargle and take steam inhalation. Look for early warning signs like high grade fever, breathlessness, SpO2 95%, unexplained chest pain, new onset of confusion and focal weakness,” he said. The protocol also advises recovered individuals to share their positive experience with friends and relatives using social media, take support of community-based self-help groups, seek psycho-social support from peers, health workers and counsellors, participate in a group session of yoga and meditation with social distancing.The first follow-up visit (physical/ telephonic) should be within seven days after discharge, preferably at the hospital where the patient underwent treatment. The subsequent treatment/visit should be with the nearest medical practitioner. If patients, who underwent home isolation, complained of persisting symptoms, they would have to visit the nearest health facility. The severe cases requiring critical care support would need more stringent follow-up, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cured-patients-in-uttar-pradesh-asked-to-follow-centre-s-post-covid-protocol/story-E8z0YM8JYPXdzccQ1SucuO.html
14-09-2020||India||In battle among doctors, patient care at Jammu hospital takes a hit||Amid a raging coronavirus pandemic, the Government Medical College (GMC) of Jammu, the major referral hospital in the Jammu region, has become a battlefield for senior doctors with patient care taking a severe hit. Peeved over indiscipline and chaos, the principal, Dr Nasib Chand Digra, a prominent surgeon, opted for a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) on Sunday evening. Dr Digra, in a two-page letter to the lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, offered to opt for VRS because of the interference in working of the hospital by “extra-institutional officials”. He, however, didn’t name them in the letter. When contacted by HT, he refused to share their names. “Let us wait and watch,” he said. In his letter to the L-G, Dr Digra said there were “few extra-institutional officers, one or two heads of departments and few faculty members who are bypassing the departmental hierarchy and approaching administrative departments in technical, professional and administrative matters”. “Such interferences in the internal working of the GMC Principal Office shall create huge space for anarchy, indiscipline and further demeaning of the office. This shall further create a space for the GMC employees to create nuisance and go scot-free from the administrative department by using all sorts of ways and means to influence the higher ups,” reads a part of his letter. It further read, “The work culture and interpersonal relations are already in deterioration mode that needs to be taken care of.” The principal also cited in the letter how the “extra-institutional officials” have severely hit his unblemished image in the society and demeaned the chair. “In view of this, if my services are not being liked by anybody, I offer to get voluntary retirement from the service,” Dr Digra’s letter concluded. Reports of shortage of oxygen cylinders at the hospital have sparked panic among the patients and their family members. Due to a spike in Covid patients in Jammu, the demand for oxygen has increased manifold and oxygen plant of the GMC is not sufficient enough to meet the requirement, said a doctor. To cater to the demand, the GMC authorities were compelled to purchase nearly 500 cylinders from outside. In a striking contrast to government claims of augmenting health infrastructure to effectively tackle Covid-19 pandemic in Jammu and Kashmir, the GMC in the winter capital has started bursting at the seams, said doctors. It may be stated here that since Friday, two patients, a four-year- old boy from Janipur and a 24-year-old woman from Karan Bagh, died due to alleged negligence of the doctors at the hospital. The minor had a head injury while the woman allegedly died in 10 minutes after she was administered an injection on Saturday in ward number 7. In the case of the woman, Jammu district commissioner Sushma Chauhan has ordered a magisterial probe to be conducted by a three-member panel within seven days. The GMC Jammu is a major referral hospital of Jammu region where patients from all the 10 districts are referred and treated. Till Sunday, the UT had total cases of 54,096 Covid patients, out of which 35,737 have been cured. However 878 have died so far. On Sunday alone, the UT saw 1,686 fresh cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-battle-among-doctors-patient-care-at-jammu-hospital-takes-a-hit/story-AyhNeBzHYjVfpiV5oL7IdN.html
14-09-2020||India||PM busy with peacocks as Covid-19 cases surge: Rahul Gandhi||Minutes ahead of the commencement of the monsoon session of Parliament, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rise in Covid-19 cases, saying he is “busy with peacocks” while the number of infections are set to cross five million in the country. Gandhi said the government had asked the people to become “aatmanirbhar (self-reliant)” which means they have to save their lives on their own. “Unplanned lockdown is the product of one person’s ego and because of it coronavirus has spread throughout the country,” he tweeted in Hindi. कोरोना संक्रमण के आँकड़े इस हफ़्ते 50 लाख और ऐक्टिव केस 10 लाख पार हो जाएँगे।अनियोजित लॉकडाउन एक व्यक्ति के अहंकार की देन है जिससे कोरोना देशभर में फैल गया।मोदी सरकार ने कहा आत्मनिर्भर बनिए यानि अपनी जान ख़ुद ही बचा लीजिए क्योंकि PM मोर के साथ व्यस्त हैं।“Modi government said become ‘aatmanirbhar’ which means save your life yourself because the PM is busy with peacocks,” Gandhi said in an apparent reference to a recent video showing the Prime Minister feeding the peacocks. He said the number of Covid-19 infections in the country will cross five million this week and active cases will surpass one million. The Congress leader has been critical of the government over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: Rahul Gandhi attacks Modi govt over Covid-19 management, GDP decline, job lossesThe Congress has been attacking the Prime Minister and his government for “failing to control” the spread of the Covid-19, with India surpassing Brazil to record the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world. The party has maintained that the Prime Minister should tell the nation his future strategy and the plans to contain the pandemic. India’s GDP shrank by the steepest ever— 23.9% —in the April-June period as the Covid-19-induced nationwide lockdown battered an already slowing economy. India’s Covid-19 tally crossed 4.8 million on Monday with 92,071 new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 79,722 with 1,136 people succumbing to the infection in a span of 24 hours. On Saturday, Gandhi had attacked the government on the decline in the GDP, job losses and the increasing number of Covid-19-related cases and deaths in the country. Taking a jibe at the Modi government, he had said its “well-planned fight against Covid-19 has put India in an abyss of 1.historic GDP reduction of 24%, 2.12 crore jobs lost, 3. Rs 15.5 lakh crore additional stressed loans, 4. Globally highest daily Covid cases & deaths. But for GOI and media ‘sab changa si’.” Apart from the ongoing India-China border standoff, the Congress and other opposition parties have decided to raise, among other issues, the Covid-19 situation and the current state of economy in the monsoon session of Parliament, beginning Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-busy-with-peacocks-as-covid-19-cases-surge-rahul-gandhi/story-naG3GPu3fHuJowj0Up3mVL.html
14-09-2020||India||Ex-member of Maoist faction killed by village mob in Jharkhand’s Gumla||Thirty eight-year-old Sandip Tirkey, a former member of the ultra outfit People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), was lynched by a mob of more than 80 villagers, including women with sticks, at Tesera village under Sadar police station in Gumla district, around 100-km from capital Ranchi, on Monday morning, police said. The PLFI is a breakaway faction of the CPI (Maoist). Gumla superintendent of police (SP) Hrudeep P Janardhanan said, “We have started identification of the villagers involved in the crime. Some people have been identified. FIR against them would be filed soon and arrests would also be made.” Janardhanan said, “Tirkey was a former member of the PLFI. He was often found roaming with PLFI members and used to threaten villagers. He was also involved in extortion in the name of PLFI. The villagers were annoyed with him. On Monday morning, over 80 villagers from his neighbouring village killed him.” The SP said, “Tirkey was involved in several crimes earlier and had also served a jail term in a case.” Tirkey, on Sunday evening, reportedly went to neighbouring village Bargaon and had beaten a youth there. He also allegedly threatened villagers with a weapon, said an eye witness. Bargaon villagers called a Panchayat on Sunday night where they decided to kill Tirkey the next day. As per the plan, they gheraoed his house at Tesera village around 6am on Monday but he was not at home. The villagers found him at a shop where he was reading a newspaper. Seeing the approaching villagers, he tried to escape, but was caught by them and was beaten to death. On the question of the panchayat planning the lynching, the SP said, “We are verifying the information. But if 70 to 80 people are coming to kill a man early morning, it is not possible without planning.” The mob lynching hogged limelight during the previous BJP government in Jharkhand, which put former chief minister Raghubar Das government on back foot several times. The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) has claimed that a total of 24 people were lynched by mob in Jharkhand from March 2016 to June 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-member-of-maoist-faction-killed-by-village-mob-in-jharkhand-s-gumla/story-ifDjqEuG0IrtgCHx0Dku4O.html

It is widely believed that the Taliban, if it had not been under US military pressure, would prefer to militarily take over the country and turn it into an Islamic Emirate as it had done in 1996.Also Read: Afghan forces, Taliban continue to clash even as peace talks startAt the opening ceremony for the talks on Sunday, Afghan government, and allies including the US, had called for a ceasefire. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the peace process for the Afghan government, said the Taliban could offer a ceasefire in exchange for the release of more of their jailed fighters. But the Taliban did not mention a truce as they came to the negotiating table.“The first meeting between the contact groups of the two negotiation teams took place today. In this meeting code of conduct between two sides, schedules of upcoming meetings and relevant issues were discussed and progress was made,” Ahmad Nader Naderi, a member of the government’s negotiating team, said on Twitter on Sunday.Apart from the US, Afghanistan, the Taliban and Qatar which is hosting the talks, the discussions over the weekend were also attended by representatives from India, Pakistan, Russia, Germany, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Norway and the United Nations.People familiar with the matter said this is the first time that India participated in the intra-Afghan talks at the level of external affairs ministry with joint secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran) JP Singh leading a delegation to Qatar’s Doha that includes Deepak Mittal, the Indian ambassador to Qatar and a Pakistan-Afghanistan expert.Also Read: ‘Peace process must be led, owned and controlled by Afghanistan’: India According to diplomats in Doha and New Delhi, Zalmay, in his short four-hour-long trip to India, will share details of the Afghan peace process, appreciate India’s constructive role in Kabul for the past 20 years. Pakistan has been deeply concerned about India’s participation in the intra-Afghan talks at Doha but the US, its other allies and the Afghan government have been deeply appreciative of India’s reconstruction effort.The Afghan government’s 21-member negotiating team was led by Masoom Stanekzai, a former intelligence chief. The Taliban was led by Mawlavi Abdul Hakim, the terror group’s chief justice and a close aide of the group’s chief Haibatullah Akhunzada.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Doha for the opening ceremony, said the negotiations would be difficult. “We will undoubtedly encounter many challenges in the talks over the coming days, weeks and months,” Pompeo said, calling for the warring sides to “seize this opportunity” to secure peace.Zalmay Khalilzad told Afghanistan’s TOLO News that there are indeed some people in Afghanistan who prefer the current situation to peace with the Taliban while some are attempting to keep Washington engaged in war so that it could pay the price, “It is not acceptable and there is a solution to every problem, and a solution must be found. We are ready to help if the country’s interests come first and personal interests do not come first. I am confident that a solution will be found and we will not allow personal interests to take precedence. This is the promise of the US to the people of Afghanistan,” Khalilzad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-special-envoy-khalilzad-to-reach-pakistan-today-new-delhi-next-stop/story-Kn3AyU9wOFiDVBzRna25kJ.html

14-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: No data available on migrant deaths during lockdown, says Centre||There is no data available or maintained on the number of migrant workers who lost their lives during the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25, in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, the Centre informed Parliament on Monday.The response by the labour ministry was on a question raised in Lok Sabha seeking information on whether the Government was aware that a number of migrant workers lost their lives during their return to their hometowns and if so, the details of the same, state-wise. It further added, “Whether the Government has provided any compensation/economic assistance to the victims’ families.”The labour ministry stated that no such data was maintained and it further added that the question of compensation does not arise in view of no recorded data available.ALSO READ | Parliament monsoon session: MPs should send our message the whole country is with the soldiers, says Narendra ModiIt also said there is no data on the job losses among migrant workers since the pandemic. The labour ministry said “no such data is maintained” to a question seeking a response on whether the government has done any assessment of the job losses among migrant workers due to the Covid-19 crisis.“In order to mitigate the financial crisis of the migrant workers and protect them against the economic disruptions due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown, the Central Government has taken numerous measures to provide them financial assistance, food packages ration and other benefits,” the labour ministry said.On May 30, Hindustan Times had reported there have been almost 80 deaths on board the Shramik Special trains (for stranded migrant workers) between May 9 and May 27, according to data from the Railway Protection Force. The ages of the dead ranged from 4 to 85. The data also mentioned the co-morbidities or accidents that caused the deaths in a few cases.The labour ministry also informed that more than 1.04 crore migrants have returned to their home state with the highest number of migrants returning to Uttar Pradesh (32.4 lakh) Bihar (15 lakh) and Rajasthan (13 lakh), in the first such centralized database record on migrants. It added that the Indian Railways has operated more than 4611 Shramik Special trains for ferrying migrant workers and more than 63.07 lakh have been shifted to various destinations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and other states.The trains were started from May 1 to ferrying migrant labourers during the lockdown to their home states. The railway ministry had last month said many migrants have begun going back to the places where they worked and added it indicates that economic activity has begun picking up after India began easing lockdown restrictions.“The unplanned lockdown created a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. The BJP government has shunned its basic responsibility of not even knowing who bore the maximum brunt of the lockdown. Their response indicates their continued callousness towards the poor. What is worse is that there is still no announcement of any cash support or universalisation of rations,” said Rajendran Narayanan, assistant professor at Azim Premji University.“The States/UTs have been advised to take adequate steps to streamline the migration of the workers to mitigate the hardships of migrant workers returning to the destination States/UTs,” the labour ministry told Parliament.“The States/UTs have been advised to implement the advisory guidelines by quickly gearing up their Labour Law enforcement machinery and ensuring statutory compliance by all the stake-holders which could provide migrant workers much needed help to mitigate the financial crisis and empower them to deal with the pandemic. The States/UTs have also been advised to maintain updated data of the migrant workers to facilitate the administration to extend benefits of the welfare schemes of the Government to the migrant workers,” it added.Another question was asked on whether the government failed in its in assessment of problems faced by migrant workers during the lockdown, including in Tamil Nadu.Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (MoS) with independent charge in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, said: “India, as a nation, has responded through the Central and state governments, local bodies, self-help groups (SHGs), Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), medical health professionals, sanitation workers as well as large number of genuine and bona-fide non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the nation’s fight against the unprecedented humanitarian crisis due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and country-wide lockdown, including in Tamil Nadu.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-no-data-available-on-migrant-deaths-during-lockdown-says-centre/story-9J8jtas3hEaeSFKsPSr0wJ.html

That I am depositing the fine does not mean I am accepting the judgment. I will be filing a review petition against it today,” he said.He had filed a fresh petition on Saturday, seeking the right of appeal against the original criminal contempt cases.Bhushan has demanded that his appeal should be heard by a larger and different bench of the Supreme Court.In the plea filed through lawyer Kamini Jaiswal, Bhushan has suggested procedural changes to reduce the chances of “arbitrary, vengeful and high-handed decisions” in criminal contempt cases saying that in such cases the top court is the aggrieved party, the “prosecutor, the witness and the judge” and hence they raise fear of inherent bias.“This would act as a vital safeguard against wrongful conviction and would truly enable the provision of truth as a defense,” Bhushan said in his plea.The Supreme Court recently held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his tweets criticising the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. The court had on August 31 imposed a token fine of Re 1 as a punishment.Bhushan was asked to deposit the amount by with the Supreme Court registry by September 15, failing which he would have to undergo three-month jail term and debarment from law practice for three years.Another contempt case against Bhushan, initiated by the top court in 2009 for his remarks that some past Chief Justices of India were corrupt, is also pending before the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-deposits-re-1-fine-in-contempt-case-but-says-filing-review-petition-against-supreme-court-judgement/story-smUjkVT6cG7LKLzmMNN7aK.html

Parliamentarians from Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) said that there are several issues like unemployment, NEET exams and national security should have been discussed. Union defence minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Rajnath Singh appealed to all parliamentarians present on day one of the monsoon session in the Lok Sabha to ensure the proceedings went smoothly.Singh outlined to the parliamentarians that the proceedings are being held under extraordinary circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to news agency ANI, “Leaders of most parties agreed over no Question Hour & Zero Hour for 30 minutes. We apprised you (Speaker) of it following which decision was taken by you. I appeal to all members of the House to co-operate as Session is being held in an extraordinary situation.”Few MPs including leader of the Indian National Congress in the House Adhir Ranjan Choudhury were concerned about the removal of Question Hour as well as the limiting of Zero Hour to 30 minutes.Choudhury said, “Question Hour is the golden hour but you say that it can’t be held due to the circumstances. You conduct the proceedings but single out Question Hour. You are trying to strangulate democracy.”NCP MP Supriya Sule said that India is not the only country facing the pandemic and discussions on important issues cannot be set aside. She said, “This is a global scenario & we’re not the only country going through it. But it should be the priority of govt. I don’t see this govt at the Centre talking extensively either about the economy or unemployment challenges. We should put it on priority.”The monsoon session is being held keeping in mind that the pandemic continues to affect the nation as it recorded more than a thousand deaths and registered more than 90,000 cases for almost a week in a row.Parliamentarians underwent Covid-19 tests, premises were sanitised on a war footing and the Upper House and Lower House proceedings will be held in two shifts.Opposition party MPs are protesting against the motion to scrap Question Hour and private member bills during the session. The government looks forward to introducing the motion on October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-ensues-over-removal-of-question-hour-on-day-1-of-monsoon-session/story-CbHGmtsSRh7ka2sIuh7wDM.html

Apart from ensuring no restriction was imposed on the intra and inter-state movement of oxygen tankers, the states were also directed to create hospital-wise oxygen inventory management and plan in advance for timely replenishment so that there was no stockout.The states will also have to ensure timely payment of the due bills to the manufacturers and suppliers to maintain uninterrupted supply of oxygen, and improve power supply infrastructure to have an uninterrupted supply to oxygen manufacturing units in the country.There is also the need to effectively coordinate with steel plants for oxygen procurement since steel plants provide approximately 550 metric tonnes oxygen per day in addition to oxygen manufacturers who provide 6400 metric tonnes per day, the states were told.In a virtual meeting held on Sunday, apart from the Union health secretary, secretary department of industries and internal trade, secretary pharmaceuticals, and state health secretaries and industries secretaries of seven big manufacturing states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh also took part.Oxygen therapy is an essential component to save lives of moderate to severe Covid-19 patients.“In moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, the lung cells don’t participate in normal functioning that results in lungs failing to take up oxygen from the blood and also not being able to remove carbon dioxide from the blood. It leads to oxygen levels dropping in the blood for which oxygen support is given externally to compensate for the impaired lung function. The virus attacks the lung cells and leads to extensive pneumonia,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.The health ministry had earlier on Friday written a letter to states asking them to make certain there was no interruption in the movement of tankers across borders so that there was no shortage anywhere in the country.Some states do not have oxygen manufacturing units and are dependent on other states. Delhi gets its oxygen supply largely from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Punjab gets its supply from Haryana; Madhya Pradesh gets it from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra; and Andhra Pradesh and Telangana get their supplies mostly from Karnataka.India’s actual oxygen consumption is about 2,000 metric tonnes per day, and the production capacity per day is about 6,400 metric tonnes that is also used by the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/provide-green-corridor-for-medical-oxygen-tankers-centre-to-states/story-YqLx7DoKSMo9rv3GYvGJJJ.html

Maharashtra continues to report maximum number of Covid-19 related deaths in the country, with 416 patients dying on Sunday alone, taking the total number of deaths in the state to 29,531. Also read: ‘Reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid patients,’ Delhi govt tells private hospitalsAnother worst affected state in terms of total number of deaths is Tamil Nadu with 8,381 cumulative deaths so far, and 74 new deaths reported in a single day. Karnataka reported second highest (104) new deaths, taking the Covid-19 death toll in the state to 7,265. India’s case fatality rate (CFR), the proportion of people who have died of the disease among all individuals diagnosed with it, has been improving steadily and currently stands at 1.64%, which is among the lowest in the world. The global CFR currently is nearly the double of Indian CFR at 3.18%. “Our aim is to bring country’s CFR further down to 1% or below. Most deaths and cases are concentrated in about 10 states, which have our special focus as far as containment measures is concerned,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting not to be identified. The Centre has directed states to focus on those districts that are reporting high case fatality rate, and the urgent need for them to refine as well as strengthen approach and strategies relating to testing, contact tracing, surveillance, containment, home isolation, availability of ambulances, hospital beds, oxygen, treatment protocols, etc. “There are some states that have certain districts that are not performing well, there is a need to look into specific problems of those districts to be able to better contain the disease spread,” the health ministry official added. While measures are being taken by both the Centre and state governments to cut the disease transmission, the total number of new cases being reported each day is inching closer to 100,000. On Sunday, 93,214 new cases were reported from across the country, taking the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the country to close to 5 million (4,844,977). Maharashtra also has the maximum of Covid-19 positive cases in the country as 22,543 people were on Sunday reported positive from the state, taking its total count to 1,060,308.

14-09-2020||India||Twelve of 13 members of GST Council preferred the Rs 97,000 crore borrowing option||Andhra Pradesh (AP) , Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Uttarakhand and Odisha have opted for the first borrowing option of Rs 97,000 crore to meet the Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall, while Manipur has preferred the second option of a loan of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, two Union finance ministry officials said.So far, 13 states have communicated their borrowing options and six states have indicated that they would convey their choice next week, they said requesting anonymity. The six states are Goa, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh (HP).Also Read: Gold cheaper by Rs 4,800, being sold at a discount despite fall in priceAt the 41st GST Council on August 27, the Union government gave two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall of about Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year. Two days later, it specified that under the first option, states would not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97,000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation bottlenecks. However, they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an “act of God”, which is the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Some states, where opposition parties are in power, such as Delhi, Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal (WB), Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, had initially opposed the Centre’s proposal. Also Read: Andhra govt hikes VAT on natural gas by 10% to offset revenue lossesAddressing a press conference on August 30, WB finance minister Amit Mitra had said a huge debt was being thrust on states in the name of “act of God” — a reference to the phrase used by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to describe the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism that HT had reported on August 31. Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31, “FMs of Punjab, Delhi, WB, Chhattisgarh,Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God, humans or nature , to be paid back by extending the period of cess.”“Initially, many states, where opposition parties in power, had some reservation related to borrowing. Now, they are weighing their options after the Centre has clarified its commitment to pay the entire compensation. They will also communicate their choices soon,” one of the officials quoted above said. On September 3, Union expenditure and revenue secretaries had met virtually with state finance secretaries to explain how the options would work.HT on September 9 had reported that following the Centre’s clarification the only option available to states to receive the GST compensation was to borrow. Most states, including some ruled by parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), were likely to opt for the first of the two options offered on August 27. Isaac had tweeted on September 9, “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times, ipso facto, is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.”At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law had assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products. States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year, an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue, as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions, the officials said.According to an official statement released on July 27, the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1,65,302 crore, while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95,444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20, which is the lowest in 11 years. The 41st council meeting had taken place in the backdrop of the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) for India on the compensation cess issue, where he had said there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue, the officials said. According to the AG, the GST Council was expected to find ways to meet the shortfall in compensation and not the Central government. “The GST Council offered two options to the states to borrow,” a second official said.“It was discussed in the recent GST Council meeting that in the current economic scenario it may not be possible to increase tax rates or do rate rationalisation to meet the compensation shortfall. However, borrowing could be an option to address this challenge,” he said.Even former FM Arun Jaitley had categorically stated that, if required, market borrowing could be an option to compensate in case of a shortfall and later the same can be repaid through the future collection of cess. “Fulfilling the same commitment, the Central government has, time and again, stated that the entitlement of the states would always be for full compensation and the entire compensation sum on account of shortfall in collections of GST will be paid and honoured,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twelve-of-13-members-of-gst-council-preferred-the-borrowing-option/story-7mPjab6gKzQaTLermjt89I.html
14-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: MHA to answer questions on nationwide lockdown||When Parliament meets on Monday for the 18-day uninterrupted monsoon session, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will face questions on various issues.The ministry has to answer questions on strict restrictions imposed for 68 days during the nationwide lockdown because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, police excesses to enforce the measures, several guidelines related to the viral outbreak issued by it, the investigation in the Kerala gold smuggling case and a rise in crime graph amid the contagion.The MHA has prepared a list of unstarred questions for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the basis of queries received from various members of Parliament (MPs).Also Read: For a meaningful monsoon sessionSeveral questions are expected to be raised on the imposition of nationwide lockdown restrictions from March 25, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) guidelines issued by the ministry periodically, handling of lockdown by police, treatment of migrant labourers, individual restrictions imposed by various states and the stimulus package announced following the Covid-19 outbreak.An interesting question has also been raised for the MHA regarding drug trafficking in Bollywood. The question becomes pertinent following the ongoing separate probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput (34). Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on June 14.Also Read: Monsoon session of Parliament: Over 1k officials being screenedThe NCB had last week arrested actress Rhea Chakraborty, who is at the centre of a raging controversy over Rajput’s death; her brother Showik and several others in connection with the supply of drugs.Some MPs have also asked about the number of deaths in the police and central paramilitary forces due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Several issues raised in previous sessions will also figure during the monsoon session such as the detention of political leaders in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, voting rights to west Pakistan and Bangladesh refugees, caste-based census, infiltration of terrorists via the India-Pakistan border, the impact of the removal of Article 370 from J&K, steps taken to check left-wing extremism (LWE) activities etc.Some MPs are expected to raise other issues for the MHA such as an increase in online fraud, circulation of fake Indian currency notes (FICNs), overcrowding in prisons and foreign funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs).Most of the queries raised by the MPs will be answered by two junior ministers in the MHA --- G Kishan Reddy and Nityanand Rai -- since home minister Amit Shah hasn’t been keeping well.The two houses of Parliament will sit in two shifts from Monday -- 9 am to 1 am and 3 pm to 7 pm --- because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Only those who have Covid-19 negative reports will be allowed to enter Parliament and wearing masks is mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-mha-to-answer-question-on-nationwide-lockdown/story-7KlnBgd0OLff7NnyFPQMvK.html
14-09-2020||India||25% excess rain recorded in peninsular India, NW India largely dry||A low pressure area has formed over west central Bay of Bengal off Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast on Sunday signalling a pickup in monsoon rains after a brief lull in September.Due to the formation of a low-pressure area, rain intensity and distribution will increase over Odisha; coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Yaman in Puducherry to begin with, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its bulletin on Monday.Also read: Low pressure area off Andhra coast to bring heavy rain in peninsular IndiaPeninsular India has recorded 25% excess rain this monsoon since June 1 and 67.1% excess until September 13.IMD in its long-range forecast in June had forecast above normal monsoon rain over northwest India at 107% and normal rains over peninsular India at about 102% of long period average (LPA) --- monsoon average for 50 years --- 103% over central India and 96% of LPA over east and north-east India.But due to several unique features of this monsoon including no low-pressure areas forming in July led to the monsoon trough -- a line of low pressure -- oscillating to the Himalayan foothills frequently bringing rains mainly to the peninsular region and north-east India in July leaving north-west parts of the country dry.Five low-pressure systems had formed in August, which had brought excess rains to the central and western region, but not much to the north-western region. Moving away from IMD’s long range forecast, north-west India has recorded rainfall deficiency of 13% since June 1, while north-east and eastern India has 0% deficiency; central India has 14% and peninsular India has recorded 14% and 25% excess precipitation, respectively.“Long range forecasts have a 9% error margin. They are only indicative,” said Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general (D-G), IMD.“In the first half, particularly up to July, north-west India had very large rain deficiency. Low-pressure areas didn’t form and a couple that formed did not move up to north-west India. We are not expecting any improvement in rain deficiency over north-west India because we are heading towards monsoon withdrawal. The long-range forecast doesn’t capture these peculiar patterns that can develop during the monsoon,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune.The monsoon trough -- the line of low pressure -- lies south of its normal position – from Ganganagar in Rajasthan to the Bay of Bengal. The eastern end of the monsoon trough is likely to shift further southward due to formation of a low-pressure area over west central Bay of Bengal off Andhra Pradesh (AP) coast by Tuesday.“We can expect heavy and widespread and heavy rains in AP, Telangana, Vidarbha, Marathwada and almost all parts of Maharashtra,” added Mohapatra.Heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Odisha, coastal AP, Yanam and Telangana on Monday and Gujarat on Wednesday (September 16).An off-shore trough at mean sea level is also running from coastal south Gujarat to north Karnataka coast. It is very likely to persist along the west coast during the next five days.Due to these favourable conditions heavy rain is very likely over coastal AP, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, coastal and north interior Karnataka, Kerala and Mahe until Thursday (September 17) over southern Odisha and southern Chhattisgarh on Monday. Extremely heavy rain is also very likely over coastal AP and Telangana on Monday .Monsoon rain since June 1 is 7% excess to date. IMD’s long range forecast has predicted it would be a normal monsoon with 2% excess rain (an error margin of +/- 4%)In September, there is 20.3% deficiency over the country, including 44.7% deficiency over northwest India; over east and northeast India (19.4%); and over central India (39.7%).However, the southern peninsula had received 67.1% of excess rainfall.Peninsular India has recorded exceptional rains this monsoon and is likely to record more until October when the northeast monsoon season begins. But this year there is a 60% chance of a weak La Niña event developing between September and November, according to the World Meteorological Organisation’s El Niño/La Niña update. “La Nina is good for south-west monsoon but it doesn’t have a favourable impact on north-east monsoon. Peninsular India may record below normal rain in the northeast monsoon season,” said Dr Mohapatra.Usually, the withdrawal of monsoon begins from September 17 when rains reduce across the country until completely retreating on October 15.But this year IMD’s extended range forecast shows extensive and heavy rains along the west coast between September 11 and 24 and then until October 1 over several parts of central India. “We haven’t got any indication as yet of monsoon withdrawal from north-west India. Another low-pressure area is likely to develop over the Bay of Bengal around August 17 but we need to assess the models further to be certain. Monsoon withdrawal can begin only once anticyclonic flow is established and moisture reduces significantly over the region,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-excess-rain-recorded-in-peninsular-india-nw-india-largely-dry/story-v0N7tBElLiL4qC52gXlpsJ.html

The man scoops up the dog in his arms and then flings him across the railing into the river. Afterwards, he is seen smiling for the video. It is not known to police as to who shot the video and if the dog was dead or alive. The friends of the accused told police that the video was an old one.The accused was identified as Salman Khan, a resident of Tila Jamalpura area in Bhopal city, is on the run and has a history of violence against animals.An FIR was filed against him on Sunday evening under section 429 (Committing mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act on a complaint lodged by Sunita Joshi, a resident of Shyamla Hills. Bhopal deputy inspector general (DIG) of police Irshad Wali said, “In the viral video the man was seen throwing a street dog in the upper lake and smiling. Police identified the man as Salman Khan who works in a photo studio.” The DIG said efforts are on to nab the accused.Shyamla Hills police station in charge Tarun Rathi said, “The date when the accused indulged in the crime is yet to be known. However, when a police team questioned his friends they said it was a very old video as far as they had knowledge about it. However, police couldn’t know immediately if the dog was dead or alive and who shot the act in the video.”While social media was agog with reactions from people who demanded severe action against the accused, a life coach, Manoj Gaur said: “Vicious act, this man threw a dog who was alive into the upper lake of Bhopal. He deserves a penal action as per law.” A student in Bhopal Asma Khan who lodged a complaint with Bhopal district collector Avinash Lavaniya against the accused demanded strict action against him and also the man who shot the video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-throws-dog-into-lake-in-bhopal-then-smiles-for-video-case-filed/story-K1E5HnkJha1T9bBhZYwBZI.html

14-09-2020||India||Govt allows gyms, yoga centres to open||The Delhi government on Sunday allowed gyms and yoga centres, which have stayed shut for more than five months under the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), to reopen. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued the order Sunday night. The trial period of weekly markets has also been extended to September 30. All these activities, including opening of gyms, are not allowed in containment zones, the order said. Delhi had 1,488 containment zones as on Sunday. There are over 6,000 gyms and fitness centres across the national Capital employing over 100,000 people.The Central government under its unlock-3 guidelines issued on July 29 had allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to open across the country from August 5. But the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) headed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal did not allow resumption of these services owing to the rising Covid-19 cases in the city. On August 6, the Delhi government had sent a file to open hotels, weekly markets, gyms and yoga centres in the city to L-G office. Following this, the DDMA on August 19 had allowed opening of hotels and weekly markets, but gyms and yoga centres continued to be prohibited.Sunday’s order stated that gyms and yoga centres will be allowed to operate with immediate effect only if they strictly follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) laid down by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. “In case of any violation, owner and manger of the premises shall be liable for persecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides sealing of such premises forthwith,” the order, seen by HT, read. It also directed all district disaster management authorities to ensure that gyms and yoga centres comply strictly the SOPs to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The SOPs for gyms issued by the Centre on August 3 restricted yoga and workout sessions to only such activities that do not require trainers to touch members and not more than 10 persons per 1,000 sq feet space.Facilities like sauna, shower, body massage and spas will also not be available until further orders. All other social distancing and preventive measures, like hand hygiene and thermal screening at the entrance, are to be strictly followed by members and gym/yoga organisers.Under the SOPs issued for gyms and yoga centres by the Union health ministry, face masks will be mandatory at all times within centre premises. Gyms and yoga institutes must ensure a minimum distance of 6 feet between individuals and plan floor area based on 4 metre square per person. They should try and utilise outdoor space by relocating or offering online training classes wherever possible. Gym owners will have to ensure specific entry and exit pathways by floor and/or wall markings and precautionary instructions on posters will have to be placed within closed spaces||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-gyms-yoga-centres-to-open/story-f0YRe9fVABLBaZFDiePqhM.html
14-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the 157th instalment of a daily column on the coronavirus disease I started writing on March 19. I started writing it because I pompously thought there needed to be a voice of reason on a disease that I was convinced would change the world. It’s the reason the HT newsroom started focusing on the disease early in January, and has retained that intensity of coverage; so much so that some of my colleagues have become experts, one on the health aspects, another on the science — not just behind the virus and the vaccine, but also such things as masks and lockdowns — and still another on the data side of epidemiology.Six months into the column, I’ll settle for faithful observer — I have got many things wrong about the pandemic, about the impact of various extraneous factors on the disease, and about how we are fighting it, to be the voice of reason.What started as a seven-days-a week column became six days a week after a few weeks, then five days a week, and is now back again to being six. I have no idea how long I will keep writing the column. This could be the last piece — or I may keep writing it till a vaccine is discovered, perhaps even till one has been administered to most Indians. A few fellow columnists and editors have called to comment on my stamina. I often get asked why I keep writing. The simple answer is that I keep writing because the column has become a part of my daily routine. And at times such as the one we are going through, it’s what all of us need — a routine that keeps us healthy, mentally and physically, and engaged. It is the solidity of the ordinary at a time when the world has been taken over by the extraordinary.There are some who naively believe that everything will return to the way it was once a vaccine is discovered and becomes widely available. That is not going to be. Lives and livelihoods have been lost. People, countries and their economies, and institutions and organisations, are going to take at least some time to return to where they were before the pandemic. And even when they do, it will not be the same. Toting up the impact on the economy, health (mental and physical), and many of the social rules and constructs that made up pre-pandemic life, it is clear that none of us, individuals, countries, institutions and organisations, are going to snap back into shape like a still-young spring. A few will, just as a few will break, but most will bend, losing a little bit of give (or springiness, to continue with the same metaphor).Which is why a routine is important. Some people may insist that it always was, even before the pandemic, and that it was the difference between the successful and the not-so. Perhaps it was: a thousand self-help books can’t be wrong; nor can a million people who bought these at airports and highlighted the same passage (before Indian commercial fiction emerged and spectacularly killed the self-help book). But the stakes are altogether different now. A routine, and all the rules (macro and micro) that go into it, could today well mean the difference between life and death, sanity and insanity, or, to be more prosaic, coping well with the pandemic and not coping well.In my case, the column, and preparing for it (which sometimes means reading scientific papers that mostly always exceed my grasp of science) is one component of my daily routine, and one I enjoy. Which is why I’m on Dispatch 157 today and will likely write Dispatch 158 tomorrow.Post script: India will cross the 5 million cases-mark early this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-hvYSr0gUKjlx1Vi9676GmM.html

14-09-2020||India||Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riots||Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid was arrested in connection with a case related to the conspiracy behind North East Delhi riots.The case is being probed by the Delhi Police special cell, which is looking into a “larger conspiracy angle” behind the riots that took place in February, in which at least 53 persons died and 400 others were injured. Khalid was called for questioning on Sunday, an officer, who did not wish to be named, said. He has been interrogated twice in the last two months for his alleged role. “We arrested Umar Khalid late Sunday night,” said a senior police officer associated with the probe, requesting not to be named. The officer refused to share further details. According to the special cell submissions before the court last month, Khalid along with the other accused persons -- former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi -- had hatched a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots, just before the visit of US President Donald Trump in February.In at least four charge sheets, police have said Khalid had met suspended and jailed Aam Aadmi Party’s councillor Hussain and Saifi on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site to allegedly plan the riots.Khalid was questioned for the first time on July 31 for his alleged role in the riots. “He was questioned regarding the purported provocative speeches he had allegedly delivered at two different places before the visit of US President Donald Trump in February. Khalid had allegedly appealed to the public to come out on streets and block the roads during Trump’s visit,” the officer said.In his earlier statement to the press, Khalid has denied the allegations. More than eight people, including Tahir Hussain, Jamia student Meeran Haider, Jamia Coordination Committee’s media coordinator Safoora Zargar, and Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, have been arrested under the Unlawful Activity Prevention Act (UAPA).The arrested persons have accused Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against them because they were prominent voices against the government’s Citizenship Amendment Act. Delhi police have said that the riots were planned by some leaders of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in the national Capital. Khalid was earlier arrested in February 2016 for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans inside the JNU campus along with former student union president Kanhaiya Kumar and others. They were charged with sedition. They had denied the charges and accused the police of using doctored videos to build a case against them. The case is being heard by a city court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/umar-khalid-arrested-in-connection-with-north-east-delhi-riots/story-pPNsHgYSCuFkd8fqf0Xb7J.html

On August 3, the suspended AAP councillor had reportedly confessed to his crime and told the police that he was given the task to collect as much glass bottle, petrol, acid, stones as possible during the violence.Communal violence broke out in Delhi between anti-CAA and pro-CAA protesters in February this year. Hundreds of people were detained in connection with the violence and police faced criticism for their slack management of protesters and ineffective handling of the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/umar-khalid-/story-lj2XPxkP50PNZ10oHIlACI.html

14-09-2020||India||GDP, LAC buzzwords as Covid-era session begins today||Parliament’s most extraordinary session will start on Monday, with a slew of health protocols in place amid a raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, and with several potential flashpoints between the government and the Opposition.The Centre has listed 38 bills — including 11 ordinances — for passage in the curtailed session during which opposition parties have demanded a debate on the India-China border conflict, an economic slowdown that caused a GDP contraction of 23.9% in the quarter ended June, job losses, delay in Goods and Services Tax (GST) payments to the states, and management of the pandemic.Amid severe restrictions put in place and a logistical overhaul in the functioning of both Houses of Parliament, the stage is also set for the first direct political confrontation between the National Democratic Alliance government and the opposition parties in six months, after the budget session ended abruptly on March 23 because of the spread of Covid-19. The virus continues to pose a threat to the session. At least five lawmakers may have tested positive in the last two days during the pre-session screening using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, considered the most accurate for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease, and many senior MPs, cutting across political lines, have decided against attending the proceedings. The session will be held in two shifts — Rajya Sabha in the morning and Lok Sabha in the afternoon — with members of both House spread across the two chambers and galleries. On the opening day, however, the Lok Sabha will be held in the morning shift, and the Rajya Sabha in the afternoon.In recent months, several issues have rocked the country’s polity. The ongoing India-China border conflict, the economic slump, massive job losses and the plight of migrant workers who fled the cities for the countryside, and allegations of a pro-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bias in Facebook’s Indian management team, have triggered political protests and attacks on the government. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will place a statement on the Covid-19 situation in Rajya Sabha, which may elect a deputy chairman on Monday. NDA’s Harivansh, who belongs to the Janata Dal (United), is pitted against opposition candidate Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in the election to the post. In light of this, the BJP has issued a whip in the Upper House. Sparks may still fly on the first day of the session, which ends on October 1. The government will bring a motion in both Houses to approve its decision to scrap Question Hour and private members’ bills during the session. The move has already sparked protests by the Opposition that may spill over in both Houses as well.The government will introduce the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, to replace related ordinances. The Congress, the Left, and some other parties, are vehemently opposed to the ordinances. Major farmers’ groups have also vowed to resist the Narendra Modi government’s agenda to free up the country’s antiquated agriculture sector with liberalising ordinances, calling for coordinated protests on Monday, when the government will table them in Lok Sabha for passage as Acts. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have lent support to the farmers’ groups, saying they planned to stall the ordinances in Parliament by attempting to have them sent to parliamentary select committees. “There are no ifs and buts. We are 100% opposed to the three farm-related ordinances and the banking ordinance. Our chief ministers have written letters to the PM expressing their concern. We are absolutely clear that these ordinances are not in favour of Indian farmers,” the Congress chief whip for the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh, said on Sunday. Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held two meetings with leaders of different political parties on Sunday to lay the ground for the session. While the political leaders appreciated the elaborate preparations made for the session, Opposition members also placed before Naidu and BIrla their demands for a debate on key issues. The Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha will take up a record number of 20 and 16 obituary references—including the ones on former President Pranab Mukherjee and former rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh before kickstarting their legislative agenda. A heavy legislative agenda awaits the first day of the session. While the Lok Sabha is set to pass the National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill and The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill without much discussion on Monday, a total of seven other bills will be introduced in the Lower House. In the Rajya Sabha, four bills will be introduced and two — The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill and The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Bill — will be passed. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the government was ready for a debate on all issues which will be decided in the business advisory committee meetings this week. When asked if the government is ready for a discussion on the military standoff between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, Joshi said it will be decided while keeping in mind national security and the country’s strategic interests.Former parliamentary affairs secretary Afzal Amanullah said:“The authorities have taken humongous efforts to arrange this session which will be historic in many ways given the fact that Indian Parliament has dared to meet amid Covid. But it is up to the political parties to make it an effective one. Already, the scrapping of Question Hour has dampened the mood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gdp-lac-buzzwords-as-covid-era-session-begins/story-zviwdNVj6bYW2gXdwMilSO.html
14-09-2020||India||Ex-defence secy played key role in AgustaWestland deal: CBI||Former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma was party to several key discussions that led to the February 2010 award of a controversial Rs 3,727 crore contract to AgustaWestland for 12 VVIP helicopters, according to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths handling the case, and investigation documents that will form the basis of a supplementary charge sheet in the case.Sharma was part of contract process in different capacities from March 2005, when the Indian Air Force (IAF) agreed to reduce the flying altitude of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres, until the eventual decision to award the contract to AugustaWestland five years later, according to documents prepared by CBI.The agency has contended that Sharma, as Joint Secretary (Air) in the defence ministry at the time, attended a crucial meeting on March 7, 2005 chaired by then deputy chief of air staff JS Gujral and attended by senior officials from the ministry and IAF including (now retired) wing commander SA Kunte, who was project officer for procuring the choppers for VVIPs such as the President, vice-president, Prime Minister and the other dignitaries.CBI last week sought sanction to prosecute Sharma, Kunte and three other IAF officers, while Gujral was named an accused in its first charge sheet in the case in September 2017.According to investigators, it was in the March 2005 meeting that the previous operational requirement (OR) of 6,000 metres flying altitude was reduced to 4,500 metres, and the cabin height of the helicopter was fixed at 180cm. It has been alleged that these changes in the OR made the AgustaWestland AW-101 helicopters eligible for the contract.Sharma later served as defence secretary between 2011 and 2013 and as Comptroller and Auditor General of India between 2013 and 2017.Sharma has denied all the allegations against him. “I had a long unblemished service record of over forty years and nobody can blame me for any malafide action or decision. I strongly and firmly deny any such frivolous allegation,” he told HT last week.According to CBI, when the defence procurement procedure (DPP) 2005 – a process that governs any defence purchase including helicopters for VVIPs – came into effect from July 2005, Sharma sought the Special Protection Group’s comments on the latest ORs.He was also part of the meeting in October 2005 in which SPG raised the requirement of helicopters from an original eight to 12 choppers, a demand endorsed by the IAF instantly, the investigation documents contend.By October 2005, the entire procurement cost of 12 VVIP choppers was assessed to be Rs 792.82 crores, CBI adds. The agency’s case documents suggest that after the defence ministry approved the proposal on February 22, 2006, a request for proposal (RFP) was drafted, which was examined by air force officers over the next few months, and later approved by Sharma, who had become director general (acquisition) in the ministry by then, on September 21, 2006.The documents show Sharma played a role in approving the technical evaluation committee (TEC) report in which deviations from the original proposal were factored in, and then in countering a finance ministry observation in 2009 that the cost for the choppers – negotiated at Rs 3,727 crore – was “abnormally high”.After getting the finance ministry approval, the final contract was signed with AgustaWestland in February 2010.“All this shows that SK Sharma played a key role in the whole deal from its initiation till it was signed,” said a CBI officer on condition of anonymity.The contract – alleged violations and kickbacks in the deal became one of the biggest controversies during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime – was eventually cancelled on January 1, 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-defence-secy-played-key-role-in-agustawestland-deal-cbi/story-Zp4hn8f1Is82pCJaRvFGmN.html
14-09-2020||India||Ayush focus in Centre’s post-Covid protocol||In its first detailed guidelines on managing post-recovery symptoms exhibited by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients such as fatigue, body ache, cough, sore throat and breathing difficulty, the Union health ministry has relied heavily on the “immunity promoting” Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) products.From starting the mornings with one teaspoonful of Chyawanprash and warm turmeric milk, to mulethi (liquorice root) powder, and Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) powder, many Ayurvedic medicines have found mention in the health ministry’s post Covid-19 management protocol.“These medicines are not just to build immunity and treat common post Covid-19 symptoms but also to improve lung health,” said Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, secretary in the ministry of Ayush.Manoj Nesri, advisor to the ministry, said the management protocol was based on evidence and the All India Institute of Ayurveda had proof of the immunity-promoting qualities of,medicines based on Ayush. All the medicines, whether based on allopathic or Ayush systems, need to be taken under strict medical supervision.Doctors of modern medicine say that Ayush medicines can be used as supplementary therapy, but shouldn’t be the mainstay of treating post Covid-19 symptoms.“We have our own set protocol, and as allopathic doctors we cannot prescribe Ayurvedic, homoeopathic or any other form of alternative medicines. We treat post Covid-19 complications symptomatically based on scientific evidence. Medicines from other systems can be used as a supplement to boost immunity etc. but treatment has to be done after a thorough examination and understanding of the complications experienced,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, senior respiratory specialist at Fortis Hospital. The health ministry guidelines also direct people to watch out for high-grade fever, breathlessness, oxygen saturation levels dropping below 95%, unexplained chest pain, new onset of confusion, focal weakness etc. and seek medical advice.Some recovered patients have complained of experiencing certain symptoms for an extended period post-recovery.Some people, especially those having suffered acute illness, complain of symptoms such as fatigue, bodyache, cough, sore throat, and breathing difficulty.However, the guidelines are not meant to be used as preventive or curative therapy, warned the health ministry.At the individual level Discharged patients should observe appropriate behaviour such as use of masks, maintaining hand and respiratory hygiene, and physical distancing, and should drink adequate amounts of warm water. “Take immunity promoting Ayush medicine… to be practiced and prescribed by a qualified practitioner of Ayush. If health permits, regular household work to be done. Professional work to be resumed in graded manner. Depending on the physical condition, mild to moderate exercise daily such as yogasana, pranayama and meditation… breathing exercises as prescribed by treating physician and daily morning or evening walk at a comfortable pace as tolerated,” the ministry advises. The guidelines also say that people should go for a balanced nutritious diet that is easy to digest ,freshly cooked soft diet; and have adequate sleep and rest. Smoking and consumption of alcohol should be avoided. Taking regular medications as advised for Covid-19 and also for managing comorbidities is important.Patients are advised to keep their doctor in the loop on all medicines that individuals are taking (allopathic and Ayush) so as to avoid prescription interaction. They are also counselled to monitor parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar (for diabetics), pulse oximetry and so on. For persistent dry cough or sore throat, saline gargles and steam inhalation helps. Cough medication should be taken only on the advice of a medical doctor or a qualified practitioner of Ayush.At healthcare facilities The first follow-up, whether physical or on telephone, should be within seven days of discharge, preferably at the hospital where the treatment took place. Subsequent treatment or follow-up visits may be with the nearest qualified practitioner of modern or Ayush medicine. “Poly-therapy is to be avoided due to potential for unknown drug-drug interaction, which may lead to Serious Adverse Events or Adverse Effects,” the guidelines say. Those under home isolation should visit the nearest hospital if the symptoms persist.According to experts, people who suffered severe illness or had some pre-existing illness are the ones who largely complain of long-term side-effects.“My experience has found while symptoms such as fever and breathlessness go away, what they keep experiencing for a longer duration is lethargy, disturbed sleep, body ache, loss of appetite, feeling feverish,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the pulmonary medicine department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayush-focus-in-centre-s-post-covid-protocol/story-JKaS0IUQhtauea3eTOC3HJ.html
14-09-2020||India||At least five MPs may have Covid-19||At least five parliamentarians may have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament, officials involved in the process said on Sunday. A second round of confirmatory tests is likely to be carried out shortly, they added.All MPs, and officers and journalists linked to the Parliament session were undergoing mandatory RT-PCR tests over the last three days as part of the Covid-19 guidelines to conduct the proceedings. The news of some MPs possibly testing positive came a day after at least 50 Parliament employees were said to have contracted the disease, the officials said.The results of the Covid-19 tests have not been made public but officials indicated that apart from a Delhi MP, an MP from Maharashtra may also need a second confirmatory test. “The Maharashtra MP had got his tests done in Mumbai but informed the secretariat about the results,” an official said on condition of anonymity.An MP from Uttar Pradesh, too, may have tested positive, the official added.“Some MPs would be tested again and a clearer picture will emerge in next few days,” a senior official involved in the process said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-five-mps-may-have-covid/story-dIkMP3Bmrqa430JgNvSEcJ.html
14-09-2020||India||Delhi HC to hear PIL on same-sex marriage||New Delhi: The Delhi high court is likely to hear on Monday a public interest litigation (PIL) that seeks a direction that homosexual couples have the right to get married under the 1955 Hindu Marriage Act, arguing that barring such unions was a violation of their constitutional rights. The PIL, filed on September 8 by four members of the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex) community and listed before a bench of chief justice of the Delhi HC DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan, said that nothing in the Hindu Marriage Act mandated that a marriage take place only between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman. The petition pointed out that in 2018, the Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality. “The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is signatory to,” the petition stated. This is the second petition to be filed on the issue of same-sex marriage rights. In January, a couple in Kerala – Nikesh Pushkaran and Sonu MS – filed a petition in the Kerala high court challenging the Special Marriage Act. The Delhi HC petition was filed by four people – Abhijit Iyer Mitra, Gopi Shankar, Giti Thadani and G Oorvasi. “In the 21st century, there is no reason that same-sex couples should not enjoy the same rights as others,” said Raghav Awasthi, advocate for the petitioners.“Equality is important. We have people from the diverse LGBTI communities who are refused by registrars to accept or register their marriage ceremonies. I want to marry my partner, too, and register our relationship,” said Gopi Shankar, one of the petitioners. Shankar pointed to a 2019 Madras high court judgment that upheld the marriage between a man and a transwoman, saying that the word ‘bride’ in the Hindu Marriage Act also included a transwoman. “The text of the law does not, on a plain reading, exclude same-sex marriages. However, in practice the law has been understood to exclude them. The court, however, should recognise same-sex marriages not merely as a legislative lapse, but as a positive fact,” said Saurabh Kirpal, a Supreme Court advocate who appeared for the petitioners in the Navtej Johar case, which led to decriminalisation of homosexuality in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-to-hear-pil-on-same-sex-marriage/story-xvrG4MazpZZ3I0JsfcMViM.html
14-09-2020||India||Farmers protest agri reforms, fear exploitation, monopolies||Major farmers’ groups have vowed to resist the Modi government’s plan to free up the country’s antiquated agriculture sector with three liberalising ordinances, calling for coordinated protests when the government will table them in Lok Sabha on Monday for passage as Acts.Though the new measures -- aimed at freeing up farm trade from restrictions, at guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices, and at laying down a new architecture for contract farming -- were hailed by economists, farmer groups fear that they will lead to exploitation by big food-trading monopolies.Also read: Farmers protest in Haryana and Punjab: What has happened so farOpposition parties, including the Congress, have lent support to these ’ groups, saying they plan to stall the ordinances in Parliament by attempting to have them sent to parliamentary select committees. An ordinance is a provision to enforce a law when Parliament is not in session.Farmers are already protesting these ordinances in food bowl states, such as Haryana and Punjab, and influential farmers’ unions are also preparing to square off with the government on the demand of making profitable sales in the form of minimum support prices, or MSPs, a legal right. The All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a front for nearly 200 farmers’ groups, will take out a protest march in the Capital on Monday. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh is also unhappy with the ordinances. It has demanded safeguards for the farming community. The leftwing All India Kisan Sabha has slammed the ordinances as “pro-corporations, anti-farmer”. The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is mobilising farmers from western UP, Haryana, Rajasthan to gather at Jantar Mantar Monday, according to farm leader Rakesh Tikait. Also read: BJP MPs meet farmers protesting in Haryana“The Modi government has used the corona crisis as an excuse to repress farmers’ protests against its anti-farmer and pro-corporate agenda which has manifested itself in the form of the three ordinances,” said VM Singh, convenor of the AIKSCC. The Union Cabinet on June 4 announced far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector, approving amendments to six-decades-old Essential Commodities Act, and two more ordinances. These measures, which bring the full force of liberalisation to the farm economy, were first announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 15 during the second of her series of briefings on the government Atmanirbhar (self-reliance) campaign, along with a Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package. Many economists welcomed the farm reforms, arguing that archaic restrictions have long choked the agriculture sector, which supports half of all Indians. While India’s overall GDP growth rates have ranged between 7-8% over past decade, agriculture has limped with growth rates between 2-3%. The opposition to the ordinances comes at a time when agriculture has emerged as the only bright spot of the economy, registering positive growth, while the broader economy contracted 25% in the first quarter. The new changes say that the government can invoke the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) ,1955, only if retail prices rise 50% in case of non-perishables and 100% in the case of perishable items from the average retail prices in the preceding 12 months or last five years, either case. “This is such a wide range for a price trigger to invoke the ECA. Many things are left vague. Price triggers or price levels should have a reference to a locality. Suppose that a big food exporter says it has an export order from Ethiopia of, say, 1 lakh tonne? How will the government verify if that is a fake indent or a genuine one?” asked Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA). Farmer groups said they feared the new changes would lead to big monopolies. This would be just as bad as current cartelisation in mandis known as agricultural produce market committees (APMCs). “We want the ordinances to be signed into law with appropriate safeguards, such as a national portal of farm trade corporations,” said Mohini Mohan Mishra, all-India secretary of the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh. To reform these APMCs, the government had passed the The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020. The ordinance effectively brings the curtains down on the decades-old APMC system that regulates buying and selling of farm produce. Kuruganti said while the APMC system was notorious, bypassing the system altogether without any oversight will make farmers vulnerable to exploitation. “The farmer is the weakest part of the supply chain, and the government has abdicated the data systems required to gather price and stocks intelligence.” The ordinances don’t consider the realities of interlocked markets, its opposers said. In India, farmers typically are “locked” in with middlemen because middlemen often loan money to poor farmers for cultivation. A key flaw of the contract farming ordinance is that it leaves dispute resolution to the bureaucracy, which can be very difficult for poor farmers to access. Economists say some of the farmers’ concerns of farmers were valid. “But if the assumption is that the current system is efficient, then there can be no discussion,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the Bengaluru Dr. BR Ambedkar School of Economics.“Ultimately, when we open up the market, we need to open it up in a big. What we need is a market clearing mechanism. The issue is to have effective regulation. The consultative process will I believe address this issue,” Bhanumurthy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-agri-reforms-fear-exploitation-monopolies/story-pQR46DJrD8r4sK2OGYMNKI.html
14-09-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine possible by 2021 first quarter, says Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said no date for launching the Covid-19 vaccine has been fixed yet. “It may be ready by the first quarter of next year,” the minister said as he addressed the first episode of his Sunday Samvaad — a social media interaction programme. Grateful to thousands of you who wrote to me for #SundaySamvaad !Great to have started a 2-way communication with social media friends. Learning a lot from the conversations. Hope we can keep up & further strengthen the dialogue👍https://t.co/su977PnzxkHis comments come a day after pharma giant Astrazeneca announced the resumption of its Covid-19 vaccine trial after it got a go-ahead from British regulators. Its India partner Serum Institute of India has paused the trials after it was issued a show-cause notice by the Drug Controller of India, following the red flags raised in the UK.Also Read | Serum Institute to resume Covid-19 vaccine trial after DGCI gives nodThe minister assured the government is taking full precautions in conducting the human trials of the vaccine. “Issues like vaccine security, cost, equity, cold-chain requirements, production timelines, etc., are also being discussed intensely,” he said.The vaccine, once ready, will be made available to those who need it the most. But the minister said he will be happy to receive the first dose of the vaccine. In his one-hour interaction, the minister discussed several issues related to Covid-19 as he replied to several questions posed by social media users.On which trial is most promising: “Several vaccine trials are going on in India. At present, we can’t predict which one will emerge as the most effective. But by the first quarter of 2021, we will definitely know the results,” the minister said.On availability: A vaccine expert group has been set up, which is overseeing the entire process. While the trial results get assessed, the manufacturers will be advised to begin mass-production so that no time is wasted, the minister said.On first dose: “Work has already started on prioritising vulnerable groups who will be administered the vaccine first. But if I need to take the vaccine to test the efficacy of it, I will happily take the first dose,” the minister said.On Covid-19 vaccine price: “It is premature to comment on the price of the vaccine which is still under trial. But the government of India will assure that the vaccine will be made available to those who need it the most, irrespective of their paying capacity,” Harsh Vardhan said.On emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine: “The government is thinking about this. If there is consensus, we may grant emergency authorisation of the vaccine for senior citizens, frontline workers. Normally, the third trial takes about six to nine months. But if the government decides, this period can be cut short by giving an emergency authorisation. Any emergency authorisation is always done by adopting reinforced safeguard so that people don’t worry about the safety. A high-level group has been formed to monitor the pace of the vaccine development under the direct guidance of PM Modi. There will be no shortcut on safety. Emergency authorisation will be given only if it meets the standards.”On what could have been done better: “We have put in our heart and soul. We have done our best. Now as I look back and think of the events that unfolded after I held the fist meeting on Covid-19 on January 8, it is difficult for me to think what could have been done better,” Vardhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-possible-by-2021-first-quarter-says-harsh-vardhan/story-jxZjWleOO5xiBwCezeahrN.html
14-09-2020||India||Kirori Singh Bainsla seeks 9th schedule cover for Gujjar quota, threatens fresh stir||Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla has threatened to revive the quota agitation in a month’s time if the central government did not offer constitutional protection to 5% reservation given to five more backward classes (MBCs) including Gujjars in Rajasthan by including the relevant legislation in the ninth schedule of the constitution.“I urge the government of India to include 5% reservation for Gujjars and four others in the ninth schedule of the constitution. The Rajasthan government has already sent the recommendation. I am hopeful that the prime minister will consider our request and provide justice,” said Bainsla. He said if the demand is not met then the Gujjar reservation agitation will be revived with a protest march towards Delhi in 30 days time. Member, Gujjar arakshan sangarsh samiti, Vijay Bainsla said the state government had made the recommendation to the Union government last year on February 22—a few days after amending the Rajasthan Backward Classes Act, 2017 to extend the quota provided to four backward classes to 5% from 1%-- to place the act in the ninth schedule of the constitution.“The PM and the Union cabinet is requested to kindly put the reservation act in the ninth schedule in the interest of Gujjars of Rajasthan and of India. The trust and faith in leadership should remain intact,” Vijay Bainsla said. He added that a delegation from the community had met central minister Prakash Javadekar in January with the above request and handed over a memorandum along with a copy of the recommendation letter sent by the state government.Also Read: Sachin Pilot writes to Ashok Gehlot raising Gujjar issues in RajasthanIn February 2019, the Rajasthan assembly amended the Rajasthan Backward Classes Act, 2017 to extend the reservation given to four more backward classes including the Gujjars to 5%, from the previous 1% provisioned by Vasundhra Raje government of the BJP.Also Read: At Rajasthan Congress feedback meet, slogans against minister, posters tornThe assembly also passed an administrative resolution to request the centre to include the Gujjar quota law in the ninth schedule of the Constitution that provides a protective umbrella to laws placed in it. However, the Supreme Court had ruled in 2007 that laws placed under the ninth schedule after the Kesavananda Bharati judgement in April 1973 are open to judicial scrutiny.Bainsla’s move comes close on the heels of former Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot shooting off a letter to CM Ashok Gehlot alleging the MBCs were not being provided 5% reservation in several government jobs as against the promise made in the party manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kirori-singh-bainsla-seeks-9th-schedule-cover-for-gujjar-quota-threatens-fresh-stir/story-3XzhSbLzmJE80TyaI3YAhK.html
14-09-2020||India||Raghuvansh babu, the architect of MGNREGA and India’s most influential rural development minister||Whenever former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh would stop his car to chat with journalists on his way out of the Parliament complex, it would be an anxious moment for his officials. No, India’s most influential rural development minister would not belt out any state secret. But his marathon encounters with journalists would inevitably lead to delays in important meetings in his office. And at least on three occasions, he missed his flight to Patna.Raghuvansh babu, as he was known, loved to talk. But he worked more. The 74-year-old socialist leader died at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi on Sunday, triggering an outpouring of grief across the political spectrum. He was admitted to the hospital due to post-Covid-19 complications and was suffering from breathlessness. His body will be taken to Patna for last rites.Singh was the unsung architect of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). India’s biggest welfare programme that came as its result has survived change of regime at the Centre, attracted a record fund allocation of Rs 1 lakh crore this year and emerged as a lifeline for millions of migrant workers in an economy battered by Covid-19. While Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had drafted the rural job guarantee scheme, Singh gave a critical push at a time when the scheme was facing a delay because at least three Congress heavyweights were not fully convinced of its utility and saw the programme as a leaky cauldron of public funds. One afternoon, as United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Gandhi was passing through the Central Hall of Parliament, a desperate Singh walked up to her and briefed her about the inordinate delay. Within a few minutes, Gandhi summoned the then defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, who headed the Group of Ministers on MGNREGA, and told him to expedite the project. The files started moving and India’s first job guarantee scheme was rolled out in 200 districts in February 2006, two years after the UPA came to power at the Centre. A man of unquestionable integrity, Singh was entrusted with the key social sector ministry amid a flurry of welfare activities that would soon transform welfare models for poor Indians and were hailed later as hallmarks of the UPA era. The rural welfare was also politically critical as the all-powerful NAC was sharply focused on the sector. Singh, a low-key politician who carved a niche in Bihar as well as national politics, once shot off a letter to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accusing a top cabinet minister of being “garib virodhi” (anti-poor). The then Planning Commission chairperson, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, tried to mediate. He met Singh to tell him the senior minister was pained about his letter and that he would want to accompany him to some of the villages to oversee progress in rural programmes. “No,” Singh replied, “he should come with me in the peak of summer in north Bihar and stay in an unelectrified village for at least three nights. Only then he would understand what it means to live in an Indian village.” At a cabinet meeting, Singh verbally made complex calculations for fund requirements for the rural job scheme, leaving nearly his colleagues gobsmacked. A minister, unaware that Singh held a doctorate in mathematics and taught the subject before joining politics, asked him, “When did you learn such good math?” Singh quipped, “I learnt it before you were born!” Raghuvansh babu was also instrumental in launching the pension scheme for the disabled and widows, and expanded the National Social Assistance Programme (rechristened as Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme) of 1985 to include all individuals below poverty line for the old age pension. This too, proved to be a key intervention for the rural poor who are no more able to work, and it continues till date. And it was during his tenure that the government initiated the process of amending India’s archaic land acquisition law to make it more farmer-friendly. The controversial new law, however, took final shape during the UPA’s second term. A five-term parliamentarian from Bihar’s Vaishali constituency, he was a prized upper caste asset of a party that survives on backward caste politics. He had been a loyal lieutenant of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad since the late 1980s till he resigned from the party on September 11 via a handwritten letter sent from his hospital bed at AIIMS. His political journey started as a secretary of the Samyukta Socialist Party (SSP) in Sitamarhi district of Bihar. He entered the Bihar assembly in 1977 and rose through the ranks as a minister and the deputy speaker before winning Vaishali in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections. Between 1996 and 1998, he was the Union minister of state (independent charge), animal husbandry and dairying, and food and consumer affairs in the United Front government. The party’s intellectual powerhouse, he rejected open offers from the Congress and others for a long time. In 2009, the Congress was keen to make him the rural development minister again, even though the RJD had ceased to be a UPA ally. But Prasad did not agree. Singh’s association with Prasad goes back over three decades. And, he is also perhaps the only leader who could openly criticise Prasad and get away unscathed. Once he was asked in an interview how he would rate Prasad’s achievements. Singh replied that in political management, his boss would score a perfect 10 out of 10 but as an administrator, he deserved nothing more than a zero. Singh’s baiters within the RJD pounced on the opportunity to paint him in poor light. They brought the paper clippings to Prasad, demanding action against the former mathematics professor. The RJD chief, however, disappointed them. “Yes, he should not have said such a thing publicly, but whatever he has said is also not incorrect,” Prasad said. The Rajput leader could win Vaishali one last time in 2009 but caste equations went against him in the next two general elections, leaving him confined to the party organisation as a vice president and an occasional visitor to Delhi for health check-ups. For many, he was the face of development in the RJD for his stellar work as the Union rural development minister between 2004 and 2009, but he would almost always get overshadowed by the more charismatic Prasad. But they bonded well. Prasad, after Singh’s his resignation, urged him not to join another party. “A letter written by you is circulating in the media. I cannot believe it. I, my family and the RJD family want to see you recover soon. We will talk after you recover. You are not going anywhere. Just mind it,” Prasad told him.A simple man (his brother saw Delhi for the first time after Raghuvansh babu became a Union minister), Singh once gave five pieces of advice, written on a paper napkin, on how to run the Bihar government to chief minister Nitish Kumar on a flight. He used to throw his only annual party in Delhi on Makar Sankantri, didn’t carry a cellphone for a long time and could amaze visitors at his office by reciting entire Trilokinath-katha—a religious hymn. This correspondent met him for the first time in 2002. At his office, Raghuvansh babu was having khichdi for lunch. I gave him my business card. He took it and started using it as a toothpick. Then, for the next one hour, the former mathematics teacher taught me intricate details of cultural and social similarities between Bengal and Bihar. He knew my state better than me.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raghuvansh-babu-the-architect-of-mgnrega-and-india-s-most-infulential-rural-development-minister/story-5fVSrl0jP44hBkbWCtJOqN.html
14-09-2020||Editorials||The Delhi Police is making a mistake||The Delhi riots in February 2020 marked one of the darkest chapters in the Capital’s political history. It reflected frayed social tensions between Hindus and Muslims. It came in the wake of a deeply polarised political climate — the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). It happened in the backdrop of the Delhi elections, where there was violent rhetoric — especially by functionaries of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was a deep embarrassment to India internationally with the riots taking place during United States President Donald Trump’s visit. And it reflected gross State failure, where for over 48 hours — before there was a de facto reshuffle in Delhi Police and national security adviser Ajit Doval walked the streets of northeast Delhi — the Delhi Police was unable to quell the violence. The Delhi riots saw violence from both sides, and in that aspect, it was different from the 1984 violence — which systematically targeted the Sikhs. But there is a lesson from 36 years ago. There has never been any meaningful justice in the 1984 violence, with perpetrators, often with political sanction, having got away. That, then, bred a culture of impunity — which enabled subsequent riots and pogroms. There has to be justice not just because it is the right of victims and for closure, but also to send a message that violence and promoting enmity between communities is unacceptable, and irrespective of political affiliations, there will be punishment. Instead of conducting an impartial investigation into the riots, the Delhi Police, however, has spun an elaborate theory — it rests on how those who were critics of the government in general and CAA in particular, including respected political leaders, civil society voices, students, instigated the riots. But the police has been unable to show direct evidence connecting their speeches with the subsequent violence. Instead, this theory appears to be the framework being used to intimidate critics of the government, even as the role of those who may be aligned with the ruling party is carefully sidestepped. The Delhi Police had a simple job — identify the perpetrators of the violence irrespective of their religion and political affiliation, review its own performance during the riots, and build a case. Instead, it has fallen for a legally dubious, ethically questionable, politically vindictive approach which will not help deliver justice. This may allow the real perpetrators — on both sides — to get away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-delhi-police-is-making-a-mistake/story-hPEY0ouHiaJGeUipMiH8TO.html
14-09-2020||Editorials||A productive Parliament||Parliament convenes today after a long period in what will be a shortened monsoon session which will last till October 1. While the pandemic has prevented the full functioning of many institutions, Parliament is the most important one and it is imperative that its functionaries meet with adequate precautions to discuss the many issues the country faces, and legislate on several pending laws. The very fact that Parliament is back in business is a positive step. The most important thing, despite the fact that there will be no Question Hour, is to ensure that this session is productive. There is far too much at stake for it to be frittered away in needless contention and disruptions. There are at 11 ordinances which the government is looking to push through, though once again the Opposition has expressed reservations about this form of legislation. The government must be clear on its Covid-19 strategy going forward, it must be transparent on the facts of China’s incursions on the border and the talks between the two countries. It has to address an economy which is faltering and discuss mitigating measures over and above the ones already taken to get things back on track. The issue of migrant workers and the massive job losses are a matter of concern and must be addressed with an aim of finding solutions which preclude party affiliations. The draft Environmental Impact Assessment policy and the aftermath of natural disasters like floods in many parts of the country all merit the attention of the lawmakers. It can only be hoped that the session does not get derailed by controversial issues including the one surrounding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput which has become highly politicised with many sections of the media and public becoming obsessed with the case. The Opposition has every right to raise matters of public good, national security, social welfare and point out the shortcomings on the part of the government. The government must act in a spirit of accommodation and respond in a comprehensive and mature manner. Given the crises that India faces on many fronts, there is really no time to lose. Constructive engagement is the only way forward and Parliament must use the limited time available to it to let all points of view be heard and find solutions for the greater common good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-productive-parliament/story-br6KPIknUgVxcaH6kOWpSJ.html
