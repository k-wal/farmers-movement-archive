04-09-2020||News||A blueprint for teacher recruitment and training||On Teacher’s Day, I would like to share a short excerpt from India’s second president, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan’s speech at a reception at the Royal Commonwealth Society, London, in June 1963. The words still resonate with me and motivate me to work for India’s progress.He said, “I, an ordinary commoner, started as a teacher and worked almost the whole of my life as a teacher. That I should have been elected Vice-President and President of my country shows how democratic our Constitution is and how it has given opportunities to all the people, not merely to political workers, to rise into some prominence and serve the country to the best of their ability.” I find a strong commonality with the path taken by Radhakrishnan and my own life. I started my career as a teacher. It is because of democracy that I am a Union minister today. There can be nothing as rewarding as empowering teachers to transform India. They, in turn, are then able to empower their students. Apart from being role models for students, teachers are the force which can change the future course of a country and its people. Teachers have a unique role in shaping the three Hs — the head, the source of knowledge; the hand, to earn a livelihood; and the heart, learning to live as enunciated by Mahatma Gandhi. The value of teachers has been emphasised over the millennia and they have played a crucial role in shaping the intellect of students and making them productive members of society. But along the way, the real worth of teachers seems to have got somewhat diluted. Therefore, it is absolutely vital for us to understand the role that teachers play in upholding and sustaining the socio-cultural ethos of the New India. This cannot be achieved by mere preaching; it requires structural reform. This need for reform becomes all the more imperative given that we are facing the Covid-19 pandemic which has brought about serious challenge to the teaching-learning process. I am happy to note that these trying times have made teachers emerge as iconic leaders who have taken upon themselves the task of driving remote learning in the era of social distancing. The creativity and innovation they have demonstrated across schools and higher education institutes are incredible. The real impact on teacher training through the National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers Holistic Advancement/Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching could be carried on in these tough times as teachers were able to modify their lesson plans to conduct classes through digital means — such as Google Meet, Zoom, mobile phone, television, or radio broadcast. To help them in this task, they used several learning apps — Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA), e – PG Pathshala, Free /Libre and Open Source Software for Education (FOSSEE) and National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER), among several others. I commend the spirit they have shown while drawing attention to the power behind Acharya Devo Bhava which equates the teacher with god. The pandemic has led to a re-evaluation of the role of teachers and their stewardship of the teaching-learning process. Under the leadership of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommends rigorous training of teachers within a learner-centric pedagogy. Along with the development of quality lesson plans, teachers will be empowered to create high-quality online content and also use online teaching platforms and tools. The ministry of education recognises the importance of teachers and clearly envisions a role for them in building on the concept of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). The respect for teachers and teaching must be restored to inspire the best to enter the profession. This is how we can ensure the best possible future for our children and our nation. Henceforth, teacher recruitment will be carried out through a more robust and transparent process. A common National Professional Standards for Teachers (NPST) will be developed by 2022, by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), in consultation with National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and State Councils of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs), teachers from across levels and regions, expert organisations in vocational education and higher education institutions. The standards will cover the expected roles of the teacher at different levels of expertise and the competencies required for each stage. Professional standards will be reviewed and revised in 2030, and thereafter every ten years.The education policy is in part a realisation of Radhakrishnan’s vision. I am sure that 21st-century teachers will not be just conduits but co-constructors of knowledge and nation development. We have set the foundation to realise the goals of the curriculum while building an equitable, inclusive, and plural society. Our aim must be to transform the very dynamics for enriching the value of teachers. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank is Union minister for education.

04-09-2020||News||The new avatar of India’s civil services||At the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Indian Civil and Administrative Services (Central) Association, scheduled for September 5, on the agenda is a proposal to change the association’s name to the Central (Indian Administrative Services (IAS) Association. Dropping the Indian Civil Services (ICS) from the nomenclature was long overdue. This would set aside some of the anomalies of the colonial-era ICS and IAS forever. First, contrary to what many commentators still believe, the IAS was not instituted by the colonial rulers. Rather, the then secretary of state wanted to end the covenant of the civilians well before the transfer of power. It was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who, as the interim home minister of the transition government, decided to create the IAS. This had the endorsement of eight of the 11 provinces in British India. Punjab, Bengal and Sindh were the three states that opposed his proposal as their political leaderships did not see their future with India. Patel launched IAS with the stirring words: “You will not have a united India, unless you have a good All India service, which has the Independence to speak out its mind.” Induction into the IAS started in 1948, and it had a different mandate from its earlier avatar. The two guiding leitmotifs were: Unity of India and independence of mind. While the former is clearly understood, the latter did not mean that service members were completely free to do anything of their choice. What it implies is that members of the service must put across their points of views without fear or favour, and must be non-partisan in their approach. In fact, Article 311, which gives security to the civil service members, has hardly any parallel in the world. It means that the service members are free to give their viewpoints, but they must also accept the mandate of the political executive as envisaged by the Constitution. All new entrants to the civil services take an oath, or make a solemn affirmation to this treatise framed under the chairmanship of BR Ambedkar. It’s also the time to break the myth that the ICS was the epitome of good governance. This is clear from the representations ICS members made to the secretary of state regarding supersession, adverse entries and unfair comparisons. In 1947, there was considerable resentment among the Punjabis against Lt Governor Evan Meredith Jenkins, who was junior to the financial commissioner. Many field officers felt that Jenkins conveyed to the Viceroys (Wavell and Mountbatten) only what they wanted to hear. Again, the unfair treatment meted out to Surendra Nath Banerjee and the first set of Indian officers has been well-documented. I would go as far as to say that the IAS is a cut above the ICS. It attracts the best and the brightest women and men. The ICS was a misogynist organisation, which refused to allow women into its fold. In fact, when the first woman IAS officer Anna Rajam Malhotra (nee George) cleared the exam in 1951, the four-member board of the Union Public Service Commission (all ex-ICS officers, led by Chairman RN Banerjee) tried their best to dissuade her from joining the service. But having won her spurs – in horse-riding as well as pistol-shooting, which were mandatory in those days – she got her first posting. Now, on average, women constitute over one-third of the strength of an IAS batch. It must be said that because the brightest and the best minds join the civil services, one can, and should, expect them to improve systems, deliver better results on the ground and strive for excellence as well as transparency. But it should also be kept in mind that they are not magicians. The context and vision are the driving force. Fortunately for us, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his address to the officer trainees at the Statue of Unity last year, gave the civil services a clear mandate. This, he said, was “to fulfil the dream of a New India with the 21st-century thinking … dreams are indispensable in our bureaucracy – a bureaucracy that is constructive, imaginative, innovative, proactive and polite, professional and progressive, energetic and enabling, efficient and effective, transparent and tech enabled the civil services can, and will deliver in a time frame.” In delinking our name from the ICS, the IAS has announced, once and for all, that we cannot be treated in the framework of the Raj. Like the Ship of Theseus, we have been completely transformed--our mandate, outreach, commitment, professionalism as well as the values inculcated in the academy--named after Lal Bahadur Shastri--are quite different from the ICS’s syllabus or the first decade when training took place in Delhi’s Metcalfe House. We have moved ahead a long way and we have moved away. We are now proud to say that we don’t any longer need to be tied to the apron strings of the colonial service.

04-09-2020||City||Noida: Rainfall to weaken as mercury set to rise, says IMD||Noida: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted light rain in certain areas of Noida and Ghaziabad over next two days – Saturday and Sunday. According to the IMD, the mercury will start rising above 35 degrees Celsius after September 6 as the monsoon weakens. Officials said that while the region was supposed to see moderate rainfall this week, unfavourable weather conditions prevented this. “For the next few days, the region will only see light to very light rainfall. The monsoon line of trough is currently to the south of Delhi and is moving northwards. Also there is lack of moisture in the region because there is no moisture convergence through the winds of Arabian Sea. After September 6, even the light rainfall is likely to stop and there is likely to be a clear sky,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He however added that the lack in rainfall is not the withdrawal of monsoon. “Due to the clear sky supposedly after September 6, the mercury is set to rise above 35 degrees Celsius and the humidity will drop below 70 percent,” he added. So far Noida has seen an average of 66 mm rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season, and suffered a 85 percent deficit rainfall. On Friday, the maximum temperature hovered around 35 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier, which is a degree above the season’s average. The humidity oscillated between 77 and 69 per cent. The Air quality index (AQI) on a scale of 0 to 500 for Noida was 79, considered ‘satisfactory’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-rainfall-to-weaken-as-mercury-set-to-rise-says-imd/story-2E6LXwVsepqyA2Si1Bk21N.html

Her accusation came two days after she was granted bail. In an interaction with mediapersons on Friday, she also presented the recording of her telephonic conversation with the MLA’s son.As per the woman, the man “took her in confidence and called her for a meeting in Sector 12 in Karnal on August 21” where the police arrested her and her husband for allegedly taking Rs 7.25 lakh to settle her complaint.The woman also accused cops of harassing and torturing her after the arrest, allegations which have already been rebuffed by the police. The MLA’s son also termed the allegations baseless and said that “the purported audio clip being circulated on social media platforms has been manipulated and she should have provided the entire clip”. “I was not there when she was arrested for extortion,” he said, claiming that her father had approached him so that the issue could be resolved mutually. “I did not talk to her after August 10. We tried to sort the matter out, but later we came to know that she was arrested for extortion,” he added.

04-09-2020||City||Noida: Langur in captivity rescued from high-rise||Noida: The forest department and an animal welfare NGO on Friday rescued a Langur from a Noida high-rise in Sector 134 which was allegedly kept in captivity.Officials said the rescue was made with the help of People for Animals (PFA) and a case had been registered against the management of the high-rise. The alleged handler of the animal fled after forest officials reached the high-rise.A schedule-2 species under Wildlife Protection Act 1972, Langur (Presbytis entellus), according to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, cannot be owned, traded or hired, and violation of the same invites three years of jail, fine or both. According to the Gautam Budh Nagar forest department, the animal was allegedly hired to scare away monkeys (Rhesus Macaque) which are in abundance in the area, including Sector 134.“The animal was rescued with the help of the NGO and is currently under our custody. We have kept it at the Surajpur reserve forest and soon a decision on its safe rehabilitation will be taken. A case under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 has been registered against three members of the high-rise’s management. The inquiry is going on and appropriate action will be taken. It is illegal to hire or keep a langur under captivity and action will be taken against anyone found in violation of rules,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.According to the PFA, the animal was allegedly tied to an under-construction apartment of the high-rise. The complaint was made by a resident, who wants to stay anonymous.“The animal had been tied and was under captivity in the high-rise for quite some time. The forest department was helpful in acting swiftly and providing us protection as our volunteers rescued the animal. There are a number of such langurs in the city which are kept under captivity to scare off the monkeys and several industries and high rises continue to take their services,” said Kaveri Rana, director, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-langur-in-captivity-rescued-from-high-rise/story-2ZiKlxLT3Z1acVGPIPRg3L.html
04-09-2020||City||Greater Noida to decentralise waste collection for 50 sectors, villages||Greater Noida: Aiming to decentralise solid waste collection for about 50 sectors and villages, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has decided to hire an agency to recycle the waste at five clusters. The processed compost will be used in sectors while the inert waste will be sent to a solid landfill site.The Authority has issued an expression of interest to hire an agency and the last date of application is September 18, 2020.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Authority, said Greater Noida has a mix of waste generator categories including urban residential, villages, commercial, industrial and institutional. “In order to holistically cover the region under effective waste management strategy, GNIDA has planned to adopt a hybrid model for managing municipal solid waste. This shall involve decentralised waste management in select 50 urban pockets, and centralised waste management in rest of the urban pockets,” he said.He added that sustainable waste management can be achieved through decentralised waste management strategy. “The new approach aims on waste reduction at source and also provides jobs to people,” he said.The Authority has divided the 50 sectors and villages into five clusters where solid waste will be decentralised. A cluster – also called Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) - will be developed in Sector Alpha 2 for collection of waste from sectors Alpha I, Beta I, Gamma I, Alpha II, Beta II, Gamma II, Rampur Jagir and Nawada village. Similarly, Sector Delta III MRF site will be used for waste collection from sectors Delta I, Delta II, Delta III, Eta I, Zeta I, KP 4, among others. The other three MRFs are in Xu I, Omicron I and Sigma II sectors.The Authority will allot land for setting up these clusters. It will also undertake civil works such as levelling, boundary fencing, construction of shed, utilities and other basic infrastructure such as water and power, and transport the inert waste from MRF to the solid landfill facility (SLF). The vendor/agency will be responsible to make door-to-door waste collection, carry out dry and wet waste processing, collect the user charges from people, etc.Greater Noida, spread over 380 square kilometres, is developed as an integrated industrial town. It comprises 100 sectors and 124 villages divided into eight work circles. The estimated population is five-six lakh and the town generates approximately 300-500 tons of waste every day. Presently, the solid waste management model in Greater Noida is centralised with no processing of the waste locally. A few bulk generators have started processing waste in Greater Noida west recently.Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1, said decentralised waste collection appears to be a good idea. “But GNIDA should ensure its enforcement in a good manner. The collection site should be away from residential areas and the waste should be timely recycled and processed. It should not become a dump yard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-to-decentralise-waste-collection-for-50-sectors-villages/story-CE1GTR5FMpgksQ7vrgebfN.html

Renu Agarwal, medical superintendent of the hospital, said, “The hospital has 160-bed for Covid patients. As the number of patients is increasing, the hospital has decided to increase the number of beds.” The hospital, which will function as the district hospital after the pandemic gets over, was inaugurated on August 8 by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “In the last one month, we successfully treated 100 patients, while as many others are undergoing treatment in the hospital. The admitted patients are in good health and we hope they will be discharged soon,” Agarwal said.The Sector 39 facility has come up in association with the Tata Trusts and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The hospital having a capacity of 400 beds has ground plus eight floors and three basement floors. “At present, the ground floor is used for administrative work while first, fifth and sixth floors are used for Covid treatment. The additional 200 beds will be set up on third and fourth floors,” the medical superintendent said. The hospital, at present, has 130 beds with oxygen, 20 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and 10 high dependency unit (HDU) beds which come under the L-2 category. However, the additional beds will be under L-1 category, the officials said. Agarwal said that Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary (health), had recently visited the hospital for inspection and decided to improve the infrastructure. “The government has written to Tata Trusts and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the 200 additional beds in two weeks,” she said.Abdul Bari, a Noida resident, said that he was tested positive for the virus on August 26. “I was worried. I was admitted to the Sector 39 hospital where I received good medical treatment. One week later, I recovered and was discharged,” he said. On Friday, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 148 new cases while 123 patients were discharged after being cured. The district has so far recorded 8,481 positive cases. Of which, 7,242 people were discharged, 46 died, while 1,188 are undergoing treatment. At present in the district, Greater Noida’s Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Sharda Hospital and Noida’s Child PGI and District Hospital have government-run Covid-19 care facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-govt-hospital-in-sector-39-to-get-200-more-covid-beds/story-Zb5c0CuGOEVDnSBvaKPTUJ.html
04-09-2020||City||Sero survey begins in Ghaziabad, sample collection falls short of day’s target||The first sero-survey study in Ghaziabad started on Friday and the health department was able to collect the required number of samples only from eight of 10 identified locations. The officials said the sample collection from the remaining two locations, which they refused to identify, will be taken up again during the course of the survey, which is spread over a period five days. The sero study is being taken up in Ghaziabad and other 10 districts of Uttar Pardesh to check the prevalence of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among the larger population. The identification of an immune response against the SARS-CoV 2 virus, in the form of antibodies in the blood of a random sample of the population, can help establish how far the disease had spread and how many people fought off the virus without showing the symptoms. The other districts included in the survey are Kanpur City, Varanasi, Agra, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Moradabad, Lucknow and BaghpatOfficials said overall, 1,440 samples will be collected from 45 locations in Ghaziabad. On Friday, 10 locations were assigned to as many teams but the number of valid samples sent to Lucknow at the end of the day was only 256, from eight locations. “We sent 256 samples, collected from eight locations, to Lucknow for testing. Likewise, all collected samples will be sent to Lucknow on a daily basis. At two locations, the sample collection did not meet the target and the re-sampling will be done in due course,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. A few of the health department officers HT spoke to said teams from outside the district were deputed for the sero-survey in Ghaziabad. “This led to lower collection of samples as locals could not be mobilised and encouraged to come to the collection centre. Had the local doctors and staff been roped in, the response from the local pupulation would have been higher,” said an official, who requested not to be named. Further, the teams which went for sample collection said the locals were wary of coming to the sample collection centre and required a lot of counselling and word of mouth publicity to get them to give samples. “We collected 32 samples, which were assigned to us, and these included 12 adult men, 12 adult women and eight children aged between five and 17 years. The area we went for sample collection was a containment zone in the initial months of the pandemic. So, the locals were suspicious of us and wary of giving samples. After counselling and encouragement, they agreed,” said Dr Manisha Srivastava, whose team collected samples from Masuri. During the initial announcement of the sero survey study, the government had mentioned the sample age group as 18-59 years. Later additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said the age group from 5-18 years will also be included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sero-survey-begins-in-ghaziabad-sample-collection-falls-short-of-day-s-target/story-6y6qqB0CB8HTWmjPFpfyFK.html

04-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Bars and pubs likely to open in a week||Noida: Bars and pubs in Gautam Budh Nagar, which have been closed for the past six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are likely to reopen in a week, officials of the district excise department said on Friday. However, the officials said that these establishments will have to follow Covid-19 guidelines to be issued by the Uttar Pradesh government. “The state government is planning to reopen bars and pubs in the region in a week, as the country is in unlock mode. The government will soon issue a standard operating procedure for these outlets to function. These guidelines will be strictly followed,” said RB Singh, district excise official, GB Nagar. The development comes a day after the Delhi government approved the reopening of bars and pubs from September 9. As per the Delhi’s plan, only asymptomatic staff and customers will be allowed entry and such establishments can’t use more than 50% of their seating capacities.In GB Nagar, there are 77 licensed establishments, including hotels, pubs and bars, which serve liquor, Singh said. He further said that customers need to compulsorily wear mask, use hand sanitizers and maintain social distancing in the bars and pubs once they open. Noida hoteliers and bar owners said that the government should give relaxations in the licence fee as more then six months have passed since the outlets were closed. Akhilesh Sakhuja, owner of The Patiala Kkitchen -- a restaurant-cum-bar in Noida Sector 18, said that he has planned to open the restaurant on Monday. “Initially, we will open for food only. The beverages (wine/beer) will be served once we get permission from the district administration,” he said. Sakhuja said that the coronavirus pandemic has badly affected the hotel and restaurant industry. “We pay ₹10 lakh as annual licence fee to serve liquor in the restaurant. But for the past six months, the restaurant is closed and there is no business. The government should relax the licence fee norms,” he said.The managing director of a leading hotel said that pubs and bars should be opened, but with all necessary precautions. “The hotels and restaurants have opened, but they are not getting the traction they used to get in the pre-lockdown times. The industry’s revival will depend on the number of footfalls in coming days. Opening pubs and bars is a good step, but the government and the operators must observe complete safety measures,” he said, requesting anonymity. According to the excise officials, the coronavirus has also affected the sale of liquor in the district. “In the current financial year, from April to August, the GB Nagar excise department has recorded the sale of 28.66 lakh Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) bottles and 71 lakh beer bottles this year. However, during the same period last year, 33 lakh IMFL bottles and 1.25 crore beer bottles were sold. In the first five months of financial year 2019-20, the department had collected ₹337 crore as revenue against this year’s ₹322 crore. The annual target of the district excise department is ₹1,240 crore,” Singh said. The government had closed all liquor shops in the district since the lockdown began on March 23. The liquor shops were reopened after 40 days, on May 4, when chaotic scenes were seen at different places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-bars-and-pubs-likely-to-open-in-a-week/story-UEMYzgFowETDBJEg8F0aOM.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||NHAI transfers Gurugram project director||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Friday transferred the project director for Gurugram, Ashok Sharma, and repatriated him to its parent body, the Union surface transport ministry, said officials privy to the matter. The decision comes a day after the contractor for Sohna elevated road project was debarred from participating in all future NHAI bids, following the collapse of a section of the under-construction flyover near Vipul Greens condominium on Sohna Road on August 22. At least two people were injured, although no casualties were reported from the site. The work at the site remains halted and a probe by a committee of experts is presently underway.Sharma has spent almost nine years as the project director of the project implementation unit of Gurugram. He has also overseen the construction of several key projects in the city such as underpasses and flyovers on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at Iffco Chowk, Signature Tower crossing, Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk. When asked about the development, Sharma confirmed his transfer and said that the NHAI has the right to repatriate an official to the parent department. “I have served in Gurugram for almost nine years and would be working with the parent department from now onwards,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhai-transfers-gurugram-project-director/story-YiM9bDOpVp7f40Uz4PN0hL.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Teachers embrace technology for new-age learning||Sonia Jain has been in the teaching profession for over 25 years. After all these years, the 53-year-old found herself relearning many new teaching practices when lessons went online necessitated by the sudden imposition of a countrywide lockdown in March. Like most others from the teaching community, she was caught off-guard by the rapidly evolving Covid-19 situation. Five months down the line, however, the initial disbelief has been replaced with a zeal to adapt and educate in newer tech-friendly ways. “When schools were asked to shut down in March, we were all enveloped by a feeling of disbelief. At our age, it is a little difficult to handle technology all of a sudden. Children today are born with technology whereas teachers like me are akin to dinosaurs when it comes to our familiarity with new-age technology. Despite these apprehensions, we got going and managed to learn the ropes,” said Jain, who teaches English to students of classes 11 and 12 in a private school.With schools shutting down in view of the coronavirus pandemic, teachers, along with students, were compelled to switch to online classes almost overnight. While students found hand-holding support from parents, teachers also had to rise up to the occasion and pivot towards newer forms of dissemination of lessons. From struggling with technology to embracing it and learning from students, the past five months, teachers say, have been a cycle of learning and unlearning for them. Starting out as a novice, Jain faced some glitches initially but soon started experimenting with different video platforms and other options, ranging from Youtube to Jamboard to quizzes. She even took her students on a virtual tour of a museum for a class. “After the initial apprehension, I was learning something new every day along with the children. If I get stuck anywhere, children also pitch in with inputs. We are also learning from students as far as technology is concerned. At my age, I have become quite adept at handling so many platforms and feel proud of myself,” said Jain. Manju Bala Bhardwaj, an English teacher at a government school, started recording her lectures on a mobile phone after schools were closed in view of the pandemic. Bhardwaj took help from her sons in the first few months of the lockdown but gradually learned to record and upload the lessons to her YouTube channel. The recorded lectures are shared with students via WhatsApp groups and are also telecast via the state government’s EDUSAT channel. “The past five months have been a roller-coaster ride for me. In the first few weeks of the lockdown, even recording a single video seemed a challenging process. Everything from YouTube uploads to video compression was new to me. But now, I have become adept at handling almost all tasks myself and have an active YouTube channel. What started as a small initiative for children of my school is now being used to engage with students across the state,” said Bhardwaj, who juggles multiple responsibilities at once. Her day starts early in the morning when she visits the school for paperwork, holds lessons via WhatsApp, calls students for feedback, and returns back in the evening only to record videos for the next lecture. “A lot of multitasking is involved. As government employees, we have certain responsibilities. These need to be handled together with lessons and household chores. While there is a growing sense of familiarity with technology, we are constantly evolving and putting in extra effort,” she said. Her sentiments were echoed by other teachers. Most teachers said that they were always on the lookout for newer resources that would give a fillip to their teaching methods. “There is so much more that goes into online classes since one is unable to meet physically. We work within an endless loop of meetings, webinars, assignments, and assessments while making an effort to adapt to the latest technologies,” said Deepika Chauhan, a private school teacher. School administrators say that while coronavirus had caused a big change in the ways of teaching, the teaching community had risen to the occasion and coped despite all the challenges. Sapna Dhawan, dean (student welfare), DPS, Sector 45, said that teacher across the country did not let technological challenges stall the teaching process. “Teachers continued with the lessons despite the tough circumstances. They are working hard to engage with students by learning different tools and platforms. Every teacher who is still connected with students needs to be applauded for not losing faith in these unusual times,” said Dhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-teachers-embrace-technology-for-new-age-learning/story-m16r0346EWW8hmF9ksrmNO.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||GMDA starts supplying water to 15 developing sectors||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has recently started supplying water to 15 developing sectors, from sectors 81 to 95, bringing much relief to the residents who were dependent on water tankers till now.Officials said two pipelines, spread over 80 km, have been laid down to supply water to the two sectors after the project had been delayed several times. “Water is being supplied from Chandu Budhera water treatment plant to these sectors and new pipelines, 1500 mm and 1600 mm in diameter, have been laid down for the purpose,” said SPS Rana, a consultant to GMDA.The residents of new developing sectors were completely dependent on water tankers and not getting canal water.Yashesh Yadav, a resident of Vatika India Next, a residential society in Sector 83, said that they were dependent on water tankers. “The quality of water was very poor and was not fit for consumption, but we were helpless. The water supplied by the tankers was a big safety hazard for the residents. With the GMDA water supply, we are at least getting quality water at home,” he said.Vikshit Sharma, a Sector 82 resident, said many people in these sectors have spent a huge amount of money on water tankers even though the supply was irregular. “We had to wait for days to get water sometimes, and if anyone wanted urgently, they used to charge us extra ₹300,” he said.Water supply in these 15 developing sectors was promised in March 2019, but the project missed several deadlines due to land acquisition issues and other hurdles. The deadline was first extended to March 2020 and then to July, 2010, but the supply was started only a few days ago, said officials.Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer GMDA, said the demand for water supply could not be met earlier due to delay in the construction of railway culverts necessary for the pipelines to cross. “Now the Indian Railways has completed the work on the culverts and the two pipelines have been laid down, ” he said. “Our prime objective was to provide water to the residents, and to reduce their dependency on water tankers which was the only option for them,” he added.Rana said that currently, the consumption in these 15 sectors is nearly 20 million liters daily (MLD), and it will be increased when needed.GMDA officials said they have reached out to the developers in the sectors to take new water connections by applying on the GMDA website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-starts-supplying-water-to-15-developing-sectors/story-Eq1xNpTywl5NfMDnlcA3vJ.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||Urban areas lead virus spread as Ggm records 10.8% in Haryana sero survey||Of the 844 people in Gurugram who were tested for antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, 10.8% showed a positive result, higher than the Haryana average of close to 8%.The Haryana government on Friday announced the results of the serological survey, conducted between August 19-21, that checked for antibodies in the blood among a randomly chosen sample population of over 18,000 people from across the state. In Gurugram, twice as many women surveyed tested positive (at 14%) for antibodies (seropositivity) than males. Urban areas (at 18.5%) showed more positive results as against rural clusters (5.7%). Officials and experts said this was along expected lines and barring a few districts, the state too followed a similar trajectory -- 9.6% in urban areas, and 6.9% in rural areas. Haryana health minister Anil Vij, speaking via video conference from his residence where he is currently in isolation after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for Covid-19 recently, said, “The findings are very encouraging compared to similar exercises in Delhi (29% seropositivity), Tamil Nadu (21%) and Gujarat (23%). The numbers indicate that measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 have been successful, be it through lockdowns, enforcement of social distancing, or public health interventions like effective testing, surveillance and containment.”Serological surveys , or sero surveys, have been conducted in many places across the world to estimate how prevalent the virus actually is in a community. They also capture asymptomatic individuals who may not have reported infections. “The exercise indicates that more than 7% of all infections in Haryana have been asymptomatic, and did not even appear on our radar. No testing or treatment was needed to manage them,” said Vij. Haryana’s additional chief secretary for health, Rajeev Arora, said the undertaking has helped to “determine the burden of Covid-19 at the community level”. The sero surveys will be held monthly in the state to test these levels again. NCR suffers mostThe study also shows the state’s national capital region (NCR) districts [Faridabad, Gurgaon, Mewat, Rohtak, Sonepat, Rewari, Jhajjhar, Panipat, Palwal, Bhiwani (including Charkhi Dadri), Mahendragarh, Jind and Karnal] to be more severely affected, with all of them exceeding the state average by a large margin. Faridabad (25%) and Nuh (20.3%) showed the highest seroprevalence, while Gurugram, despite having one of the state’s largest urban agglomerations, came in sixth at 10.8%.Speaking of the discrepancy between Gurugram and Faridabad, which share boundaries with each other and Delhi, Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, epidemiologist and professor of community medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said, “It is not surprising at all. Faridabad is more populated, and more densely populated at that. Housing in Gurugram is more planned and segregated.” Vij and multiple other health department officials also attributed it to frequent daily movement with neighbouring Delhi.Dasgupta pointed out that Gurugram and Faridabad have shown less seropositivity than other, larger metropolitan cities such and Mumbai, Ahmedabad or Pune. “This suggests a slower, more prolonged battle with Covid-19 for Gurugram,” he said. HOLES IN SURVEY?However, unlike sero surveys in some other states, Haryana’s does not arrive at the infection fatality rate (IFR) of Covid-19, a more accurate yardstick of the disease’s deadliness than case fatality rate (CFR). While IFR gives the number of deaths of all infected persons and not just known case, CFR gives it only for known cases.Rajeev Arora responded, “This is hard to quantify. For the purpose of the study, the department of community medicine and the school of public health at PGIMER, Chandigarh, have used 2011 census data when identifying the clusters for sampling, but there are no official estimates on population growth since then. So you can use 2011 data to arrive at a number, but the real IFR will still be lower than what you get.” The survey also did not segregate data based on age of the test subject.A senior doctor at PGIMER, who has been closely involved in planning the study but requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, said, “The authorities’ claims are completely in agreement with the outcome. However, interpreting the data should come with two important caveats: One, the blood samples have all been tested by a state lab. In a classical study one would typically have an external quality control component for lab testing, which is lacking here. The second is that ELISA antibody kits are not 100% specific or sensitive, and can indeed return the odd false result. This needs to be factored in to get an even more accurate picture of prevalence.” In the study’s executive summary, Dr. Arun K Aggarwal, professor of community medicine at PGIMER, wrote, “One district had started the sampling before the official launch of the project, (it) raises question on the representativeness (sic) of the survey in that district”. When contacted, Aggarwal declined to comment on which district he referred to, as did other officials in the health department. ‘Many still at risk’Experts said that while it is plausible to suggest that mitigation measures in Haryana (and Gurugram) have been more effective than in other states/cities, the survey shows a large chunk of the population remains susceptible. “(With 8% developing antibodies), it means that the rest 92% of Haryana is still at risk. It means that the state and districts have a much bigger challenge ahead of them in preventing a surge of cases. This will require immense public health vigilance over an extended period of time. It will be strenuous and exhausting for all those involved,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former head of the community medicine department at PGIMER Chandigarh. District level officials, including chief medical officer Dr. Virender Yadav and district surveillance officer Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, declined to comment on the survey’s findings. “It is entirely a state exercise. All the clusters, targeting and analysis of samples has been done by the state health department. We have only provided some support in field work. We cannot comment on the findings,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/urban-areas-lead-virus-spread-as-ggm-records-10-8-in-haryana-sero-survey/story-q7y6yBScUL0R4FYkI1TS3L.html

The recommendation has not been implemented so far.Even the ICMR had asked states and Union territories to conduct a survey of high-risk or vulnerable populations (health-care workers, frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals, security staff, prisoners) to know who was infected in the past and has now recovered.In this type of test, the blood samples are analysed for antibodies to detect and quantify antibodies in the blood that will determine a past infection due to the virus.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said, “There is no plan of conducting serosurvey in Chandigarh for now.”Requesting anonymity senior health officials said that since the pandemic is on the upswing and the health-care workers are busy dealing with Covid-19 patients, it is not suitable for them to divert more workforce towards the survey.“If the survey is conducted and a certain percentage of people already have antibodies, what change will it bring in our mitigation strategy? It will serve no purpose,” a senior health official said.Mohali (in containment zones) and Panchkula are among other districts where serosurveys have been conducted by the governments of Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-administrator-s-directions-chandigarh-has-no-plans-to-conduct-serosurvey/story-kTqTQtBEeW5fJu9phMwFJL.html

Of these 1,200 ICU beds, 870 were occupied. Of these 870 occupied ICU beds, around 70% were allotted to patients from other states,” said the official. The Delhi government spokesperson refused to share any further information . In June, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that private and Delhi government hospitals in the city should be reserved for residents of the city till the Covid-19 situation subsided.

04-09-2020||Delhi||Festivities to mark Teacher’s Day go digital as students plan online plays, musicals||From online musical and dance performances to an online play based on the role of the teaching community during the time of Covid-19 pandemic, celebrations to mark the Teacher’s Day on Saturday are taking a digital form this time. Class 12 student Ryan Suri and the eight-member student organising committee of The Indian School have been planning the festivities since July. “We had to think of online modes of celebrations since we knew that there would be Covid-related restrictions even in September. So far, we have lined up performances by students and even a drama based on the role of teachers in the time of the pandemic,” said Suri, who is also the head boy. Suri and his team wrote three drafts of the script for the online drama. Since in-person meetings were not possible, the students recorded videos of them rendering the dialogues and compiled those into a single video. “It took a lot of effort. But our teachers kept us going without compromising on our learning. We wanted to create something around that (online classes) with funny references that the teachers would enjoy,” he said. Principal Tania Joshi said, “Apart from the students’ programmes, we too have planned an online event wherein teachers will get together, play games, and enjoy performances by professional singers. Teachers have worked as corona warriors during these uncertain times.They have risen to the occasion and we are proud of them.” Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also praised government school teachers for their work. He said teachers had “worked above and beyond the call of duty during the Covid-19 pandemic”. The education minister said teachers have been sharing stories of how they connected with students in the absence of smart phones and internet connectivity. For instance, Sarita Rani Bhardwaj, a government school teacher in Paschim Vihar, used ration delivery and courier service personnel to trace every single student of her class and kept in touch with them through WhatsApp and phone calls. Sisodia also thanked teachers for their services towards Covid relief work at hunger centres and ration distribution centres. Alok Kumar Mishra, a government school teacher who was deputed at the Narela quarantine centre, said teachers were given multiple roles during the ongoing pandemic. “From working at hunger relief centres and ration distribution centres to preparing online lesson plans accessible to government school students, teachers have overcome a number of challenges over the past few months,” he said. Delhi schools also have a tradition of making higher secondary students don the hat of teachers for younger classes for the day, in a symbolic expression of their gratitude towards teachers. This time, such classes will be conducted online. Isha Jain, a class 12 student at Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, who will be one of the “teachers” on Saturday, said, “We will have interactive activities which will help them become aware of the challenges that teachers face every day. This might help the younger children realise the effort that goes into taking online classes and prompt them to do more to make the process smoother.” Principal Jyoti Arora said it was important to celebrate the Teacher’s Day, especially during the times of Covid-19. “The way teachers have discharged their duties during the pandemic needs graceful recognition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/festivities-to-mark-teacher-s-day-go-digital-as-students-plan-online-plays-musicals/story-u73zhLMRYlUSkZut97gNWO.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||GMDA installs meters in six sectors in Gurugram to keep an eye on water theft||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has begun a pilot project to track real-time water supply from the Basai water treatment plant to six sectors in the city. As part of this project, the authority is planning to link at least 38 connections in these sectors to the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) of the GMDA in Sector 44 using a GIS-based surveillance system, said officials on Friday. As per GMDA officials, the areas covered in the project include sectors 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and Palam Vihar. Last week, the authority also installed electromagnetic flow meters, level indicators and actuators — devices used to monitor and control water flow — at all the 38 points covered under the project. With these devices, GMDA aims to curb water theft in the city that leads to heavy revenue losses for the authority, said the officials. Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer GMDA, said that the main purpose behind installing these new flow meters was to keep a check on water theft and to closely monitor the water supply in these areas. “We also receive false complaints from consumers about not receiving enough water supply. There have been cases where consumers have made false complaints to avoid paying the water bills. We can now monitor the exact flow of water, consumption, and storage,” he said. GMDA officials also said that all the 38 connections will shortly be connected to the ICCC and will be monitored regularly to understand the consumption pattern of water by the consumer. Last year, a tender, worth ₹16 crore, was floated to connect 546 connections across the city. Out of these 38 connections are a part of the pilot project, the cost of which is₹1.5 crore. SPS Rana, consultant to GMDA, said the entire process of installing the electromagnetic flow meters, keeping a track of their readings, and sending the live feed to the ICCC will be monitored for three months. Once the pilot project is successful, it will be implemented across the city and all the 546 connections will be linked to the ICCC.Rana also said that a survey was carried out in these sectors to check the water flow, storage and consumption patterns, based on which the water connections linked to the ICCC will become operational. “The survey team checked the underground water capacity, how the flow meters would work, and how would they be connected to the ICCC. A ground report was prepared and submitted to the GMDA before the installation of these devices. The pilot project will be completed within three months. The project has been outsourced to a private company,” he said. The electromagnetic flow meter will be monitored by officials through the ICCC dashboard. The meter will send the reading after every five minutes and the flow will be calculated based on the live feed. The level indicator will give information on the depth of the water at underground tanks, said officials. Rana also said officials can watch all the connections from ICCC and anyone complaining about disruption in water supply can be tracked via a screen. Officials said the new system will resolve issues related to inflated water bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-installs-meters-in-six-sectors-in-gurugram-to-keep-an-eye-on-water-theft/story-OxMaIjyIT0vT3qFWTo5svK.html

The Supreme Court on Monday, while hearing a plea filed in the MC Mehta case relating to Delhi pollution, issued the directions after the Indian Railways informed the court that despite a special task force constituted to remove encroachments, political interference was stopping the removal of slums. To ensure compliance of its order, the apex court has also stopped any other court from putting a stay on the demolition. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta has written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting that the displaced slum inhabitants be provided housing at the government housing. Gupta said, “We request the CM to allot the available and vacant Rajiv Awas Yojana flats with the Delhi government to these residents on humanitarian grounds. As per our information, there are close to 50,000 flats lying vacant with the government.” Addressing a press conference on Friday, Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said the Congress government under the late Sheila Dikshit had established the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) in 2010 with a clear mandate to provide safe housing to residents of slum clusters. “In the past few years, the state and centre have done nothing,” Chaudhary said. A Delhi government spokesperson said, “It is inhuman that the BJP favours the demolition of slums during a pandemic. The Delhi government is exploring all options on how to help them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-chief-writes-to-kejriwal-urges-him-to-rehabilitate-slum-dwellers-displaced-by-sc-order/story-0c25Wy5dFrmr7VBhGNIp3H.html

On Thursday, they were arrested by the same crime branch team from village Bhangrola in IMT Manesar.The three suspects, Indravesh, 19, Dharmendra, 18, and Narender alias Soldier, 23,—all identified by their first names by the police— had allegedly robbed an SUV from Aliyar Chowk in IMT Manesar area on August 24 around 8.30 pm. According to the police, two of the suspects had got into the SUV, while the third suspect had followed them on his motorcycle to Pataudi. After the incident came to light, a crime branch team from Manesar had traced the location of the stolen car to Faridpur Karola road in Pataudi around 11 pm, the police had said.According to the police, when the crime branch team had reached the spot, Narender and Indravesh had rammed the stolen SUV into the police vehicle, dragging it for some 20 metres before pushing it off the road. The police team had fired two gunshots in retaliation, and one bullet had hit the bonnet of the SUV. As the doors of the police car had jammed due to the collision, the two suspects had escaped on foot into cotton and millet fields.While Dharmendra and Narender hail from Mahendragarh, Indravesh is from Charkhi Dadri. The police said Narender was recently released from jail after spending 17 months for allegedly uprooting an ATM in Mahendragarh.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “ Our probe revealed that after escaping, the two suspects had contacted their third aide (Dharmendra) and all three had fled on a motorcycle. Their plan was to sell the stolen SUV and buy a motorcycle with the cash, but it was foiled after their location was traced that night. Several FIRs have been registered against them in Gurugram, Mahendragarh, and Rewari. So far, we have traced at least ten cases against them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-of-gang-arrested-in-imt-manesar/story-G1u5GG4ltoB2MADhsqsa8O.html

However, in the absence of dog-catching vans and staff, the programme has remained toothless so far, with 2,690 dog bite cases reported over the last eight months. The stray dog population in Mohali has increased by approximately 1,000 over the last year. In June 2019, there were around 9,000 stray canines in Mohali, now there are approximately 10,000 dogs in the area, as per a rough estimate.Some of the worst affected areas where the strays reign the streets are Sectors 76 to 80, Phases 3-B1, 3B2, 4,5, 9 and 10. Such is the dog menace in these areas that residents are scared to step out of their homes. Dr Dinesh Chaudhary, who has been given the contract for the sterilisation programme says, the vehicle used to carry out the drive is being repaired. “The project is going at a slow pace as we are taking precaution in the wake of the pandemic,” Chaudhary says. Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg says, “We do not have enough staff to carry out dog and cattle sterilisation programmes due to Covid-19. However, I will direct the agency to speed up work as the number of stray dogs has gone up in Mohali.” Dummy operations In October 2019, the then chairperson of the stray dogs sterilisation committee Kuljeet Singh Bedi in a report had said the sterilisation programme only existed on paper. “Over the past two years it has been observed that the company tasked with the programme had been carrying out dummy operations,” the report had found.CL Garg, president, Confederation of Greater Mohali RWAs, the apex body of 65 RWAs, said, the civic body was not taking the stray dog menace seriously. “Officials do come to take the dogs but they hardly catch any and are often here only as a formality.” Civil Hospital Phase-6 nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar said, “Dog bite patients experience tremendous physical pain. Sometimes the bites can cause rabies, which can cause patients to become hydrophobic to the extent that even injecting a glucose drip becomes difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-vehicles-staff-crunch-mohali-s-stray-sterilisation-programme-goes-to-the-dogs/story-CYjE7KPWLncHCRGILtpNsJ.html

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||By scrapping post-matric scholarship scheme, Modi govt deprived weaker sections: Jakhar||Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar on Friday said the dual role of Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party stands exposed on the issue of scholarships to students with both parties protesting again. In a statement issued here, Jakhar said the Modi government had scrapped the scheme in 2017 and deprived the SC students of Rs 800 crore worth of assistance that was being disbursed every year but the SAD and BJP were playing politics on the issue now to cover up the failure of the NDA government. Assuring that the Punjab government will soon complete the ongoing inquiry into the controversy over distribution of scholarships, he said that by politicising the issue and shutting down the scheme, the non-Congress parties were trying to deprive the weaker sections of their right to education. The state Congress chief said that action will be taken against anyone found guilty but none can deny that the scholarship dispute was inherited from the previous government. The Post Matric Scholarship Scheme was started in 2006-07 by the then Congress Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led government to provide higher education opportunities to the children of weaker sections. “But in 2017, the Modi government arbitrarily scrapped the scheme. Those who were taking to the streets today should raise their voice with the Central government for resumption of the scheme,” he said Referring to 2016, Jakhar said that even during the tenure of SAD-BJP government, the state government had admitted in the Vidhan Sabha that there was a big mess in the scheme and the then deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal had assured a vigilance inquiry. “During the tenure of the present government, only the scholarships of the previous government for the year 2016-17 were distributed and no new grant was received from the Government of India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/by-scrapping-post-matric-scholarship-scheme-modi-govt-deprived-weaker-sections-jakhar/story-R3VaejZlWBa9FEHlnAnSMN.html

So, for all purposes the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 should be applicable in case of this disease.He alleged that in March 2020, after declaring covid a disaster, the Centre provided that in case of death due to the virus, ex-gratia relief of Rs 4 lakh will be provided to kin of the deceased, but later, the said clause was withdrawn.He added that Bihar is providing ex gratia compensation to families of covid victims.He suggested that relief can be provided from the State Disaster Response Fund maintained under the said Act or from the chief minister’s relief fund. Keeping in view the minimal number of deaths due to Covid-19 in state, it will not put much financial burden on the state to pay the ex-gratia compensation to families of covid victims.The petitioner asked the court to direct the state to devise a plan to provide financial help to the families of those who die due to Covid-19 and to provide ex-gratia or other immediate financial aid to families of those who died due to covid after the same was declared a disaster, as per provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Amid Covid surge, Centre asks Chandigarh admn to pull up socks||Expressing concern over the sharp surge in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh in the last one month, the Centre has directed the UT administration to create more quarantine centres, it is learnt.The administration in turn has sought a team of medical experts from the Centre to guide it in containing the spread of the disease in the city. The request was made in the review meeting on Covid-19 pandemic held with secretaries of Union health ministry and home ministry through video-conferencing on Friday.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “I made a request for a team of medical experts to help us decide on the strategy to handle the situation. The team will also guide us in how to contain the spread.”Of particular concern for senior central government officials was the sudden surge in the number of cases after relatively low rate of spread in comparison to the country for initial four months.“The central government officials asked the UT to create more quarantine centres in the city. We have also been asked to keep a stricter vigil on the self-quarantined people, and better facilitate their shift to hospitals or quarantine facilities as and when required,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.The Union officials also inquired about requirements of doctors, beds or any other equipment for containing the spread of the virus.“While stating that adequate beds are currently available in the city, the administration requested the Centre to ask the PGIMER to allocate more beds exclusively to the city. Currently, the PGIMER total bed capacity is being shared with Punjab, Haryana and other states too,” said the official.The UT also requested for the supply of 40 more ventilators from the Centre. Of these, 20 will be allocated to the PGIMER and 20 to GMCH, Sector 32. “As of now, the requirement is being met. The request has been made to meet any contingency. The 20 ventilators for GMCH will be shared with the Sector 48 civil hosptial,” the official said.ALARM BELLS RINGINGAugust proved to be the worst month for Chandigarh with 3,300 positive cases and 41 deaths being reported. This means that 75% of the total cases (from March 18 to August 31) were reported in August alone while more than 73% deaths were also registered the same month.The surge has continued in the first four days of September, with Chandigarh consistently reporting more than 200 new cases each day. As many as 922 cases have surfaced in this period, which is 17.5% of the total 5,268 cases. Also, almost 40% of the UT’s cases are still active.The city’s cumulative test positivity rate (TPA) is 15.6%. Positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive – is a crucial metric which suggests spread of infection in the community.“Apart from this, Chandigarh recorded 6% average growth rate of infections. The average growth rate essentially means the speed at which Covid-19 infections increases. The city’s fatality rate on Friday stood at 1.29%, while the recovery rate was 58.9% against the national average is 77.15%,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-covid-surge-centre-asks-chandigarh-admn-to-pull-up-socks/story-uO5bbtRrZycRdbVw2IsE9H.html
04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Trouble mounts for ex-DGP Saini as SIT gets more time to arrest him||With a second judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court recusing himself from hearing the anticipatory bail plea of ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in a 32-year-old case of the disappearance of Mohali resident Balwinder Singh Multani, the retired top cop is facing the biggest challenge of his life. The Special Investigating Team (SIT) is also making fresh efforts to arrest him. Over the past few days, the SIT has conducted raids across different states, including Saini’s ancestral farm house in Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh. He has evaded arrest and the SIT is clueless about his movements. The high court is yet to fix the next date of hearing for his anticipatory bail, but it has given more time to SIT to nab Saini. The SIT has consistently maintained that his custodial interrogation in the case is a must. A senior police functionary, monitoring the case, said special teams have been sent to at least ten locations to arrest Saini, including Delhi. “There is immense pressure on the SIT to arrest Saini,” admitted the police functionary.Uneasy calm outside Saini’s residence Holding Z-plus security, Saini has been underground for days, with an uneasy calm prevailing outside his private house in Sector 20. An HT team found a jammer vehicle stationed outside the house, with CRPF personnel standing guard. A few Punjab Police personnel, in civvies, were also found guarding the gate, but they refused to come on record. The entire Saini family is said to have gone underground for over the past two weeks at least. On Thursday, however, Saini’s wife had written a letter to the Punjab DGP and the chief secretary claiming that the security of her husband had been withdrawn. The government, however, denied the charges immediately and termed it as a tactic of the Saini family to divert attention from the case, as the high court was to listen to the ex-DGP’s bail plea on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trouble-mounts-for-ex-dgp-saini-as-sit-gets-more-time-to-arrest-him/story-Qq6nOjSiej98ihE52I5t2M.html

Timely testing and contract tracing helped. In addition, 18% of patients came out positive, when they had already reached level-2, with difficulty in breathing. Most of these patients had low oxygen levels, but many of them recovered. The rest 2% of cases were detected at level-3,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19.Till September 3, Punjab has reported 58,515 cases of Covid-19, of which 41,271 have recovered. The fatality rate is the third-worst in the country with 1,690 succumbing to Covid-19. At present, 68 patients are critical and are on ventilator support, while 470 are on oxygen support.Dr Bhaskar added, “At level-3, an hyper-activated immune system may cause injury to the heart, kidneys, and other organs. Most people, who have died due to the virus in the state, were in level 2 and 3. The rapid antigen test (RAT) is also helping us detect the virus at an early stage. Fatality rate will be controlled soon. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential.”“People should not ignore common symptoms like cough, cold and fever. Patients who came to hospitals at later stages succumbed to Covid-19 without getting any treatment. Many patients could have been saved, had they come to the hospital on time. We are trying to trace all contacts of each patient, before they get symptoms. People should not hide initial symptoms from the health department,” said Dr Amarjit Singh, assistant civil surgeon, Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/80-of-patients-detected-at-early-stage-helps-prevent-deaths-punjab-govt/story-67ymnfRosYI2UF8WKLe5dI.html

Reacting to the statements of some AAP leaders, the CM said they seemed more focused on launching a personal attack on him rather than on condemning the Covid disinformation being spread in the state’s villages. Amarinder said the Delhi CM’s announcement on AAP workers going around Punjab villages with Oxymeters “further exposed their desperation to woo the people in a state, where they have no political standing left”. He said unlike the Kejriwal government, which had to beg for help from the Centre when cases peaked in the national capital, Punjab was fully prepared to handle the crisis. He added that while 10,000 Pulse Oxymeters had already been distributed, a tender had also been placed for another 50,000 to support the frontline health workers, home isolation patients etc. AAP slams CaptPatiala: AAP slammed the Punjab CM for calling Delhi CM Kejriwal, a traitor, post his announcement to distribute oximeters in Punjab. Addressing a joint press conference in Patiala on Friday, AAP’s state unit president Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said, “Instead of thanking Kejriwal for helping the people of Punjab, the CM’s has made ridiculous comments against the Delhi CM.” Referring to Amarinder’s personal associations, the AAP leaders added, “The people of Punjab are well aware of who is the actual traitor is.” Mann went on to say the panchayats across the state have lost faith and confidence on Captain Amarinder and his government which is why they are reluctant to give samples for Covid testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-only-interested-in-furthering-political-agenda-says-amarinder/story-dbEis4rwjDVsQD74eKYeeJ.html

Many of our friends on the basis of the results of the evaluation process in July in arts and science faculties have already appeared for interviews with CVs.

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Antibodies found in 8% of Haryana’s population, says health minister||Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij on Friday said that antibodies against the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) disease were found in eight per cent of the state’s population after a sero-prevalence survey was carried out. A sero-survey involves testing blood serum of a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies against the infection to know who had been infected in the past and has recovered now.Overall, 18,905 samples were collected and the sero-prevalence study showed that the sero-positivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is eight per cent in the state, Vij said pointing out that the urban population was affected more than the rural population. “The sero-positivity observed that in urban areas the rate is 9.59 per cent and in rural areas it is 6.9 per cent,” the health minister said while addressing a virtual press conference. A total of 850 samples each were collected from 22 districts in both urban and rural areas of Haryana. As per the survey carried out, National Capital Region (NCR) districts of Faridabad and Gurugram had high sero-positivity rates.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (Health) emphasized that although sero-positivity rate is higher in NCR districts as compared to non-NCR districts, the reason for the same could be high density of population due to urban slums, high rises and daily movement of large population in the NCR region.Urban Faridabad had the highest positivity rate at 31.1 per cent and 22.2 per cent in rural areas, while the positivity rate in urban and rural sections of Gurugram was at 18.5 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. Districts such as Nuh and Sonipat too recorded positivity rate in double digits. In June, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had advised states to conduct sero survey to assess the proportion of population, including asymptomatic patients, exposed to Covid-19. Panipat (7.4 per cent), Palwal (7.4 per cent), Panchkula (6.5 per cent), and Jhajjar (5.9 per cent) were some of the districts which had lower sero-positivity than the state’s average. Meanwhile, according to the union ministry of health, Haryana’s has registered over 70,000 Covid-19 cases so far. The total cases include 13470 active cases, nearly 56,000 recoveries and 740 deaths.

04-09-2020||City||Rajasthan mulls quota for locals in government jobs||The Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government appears to have taken a cue from the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Madhya Pradesh’s dispensation and wants to give priority to local youths in public sector jobs.The government would bring a proposal to this effect before the state cabinet soon, said a minister. Also read: Assured of safe stay by Priyanka Gandhi, Kafeel Khan arrives in RajasthanUnlike MP, which has announced reservation for local youths in government jobs, Rajasthan is still exploring the legal options.“An amendment to the law will be brought before the cabinet soon. Chief Minister Gehlot has given directions regarding this to the officials,” said the minister, who is familiar with the development, requesting anonymity.The CM has asked the departments of personnel, administrative reforms and law to examine and explore the possibilities of reserving government jobs for the state’s youths in a bid to give the latter maximum employment opportunities. The minister said Gehlot issued directions in this regard during a recent education department review meeting.He hoped the new model is likely to be introduced during the upcoming Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET). The desert state plans to hire 31,000 grade-III teachers. In mid-August, MP CM Chouhan had announced that government jobs in the state would be reserved for local youths and necessary legal provisions would be made for their safeguard. In July 2019, the Andhra Pradesh (AP) government had passed a law making it mandatory for the private sector to hire 75% of local youths. Similarly, the Maharashtra and Haryana governments had also proposed to reserve up to 70% of private sector jobs for local youths.The Rajasthan government had started an exercise last year to introduce a law to reserve 75% of private sector jobs for local youths. The state government had also sought feedback from the Rajasthan Skill and Livelihood Development Corporation (RSLDC); the labour and industry department, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI), the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) etc on its proposal. Shiv Kumar Sharma, a former judge of the Rajasthan high court (HC), said reservation in jobs on the basis of region is unconstitutional.“No reservation can be based on region. Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution states that reservation cannot be based on caste, sect and region. If some states don’t give jobs to candidates from other states, the move can be challenged in a court of law,” he said. He suggested that if the state wants to encourage locals, then it is at liberty to adopt other measures such as holding examinations or conducting interviews related to Rajasthan, but reserving jobs for local youths is unconstitutional. Sharma cited Article 15 of the Constitution that prohibits discrimination on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (region). While Article 16 prescribes for equal opportunity for all citizens in the matter of public employment. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said many states have started reserving jobs for local youths in the past five-odd years. “When political parties do not have a development model they take refuge in the name of caste, region etc. Many states are reserving jobs for local youths as part of their political agenda,” he said. Mukesh Pareek, a spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) state unit, said the Gehlot government should come up with viable alternatives for the state’s unemployed youths. “If other states are giving priority to local youths, then Rajasthan should also follow suit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rajasthan-mulls-quota-for-locals-in-government-jobs/story-ju658wEy4tQHttStXxetCL.html
04-09-2020||City||Booked for provocative post, Bengal BJP MP alleges attack on house||Arjun Singh (58), the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore constituency in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, alleged on Friday that bombs were hurled at his house as well as an adjacent temple the previous night.Singh lives in the district’s Bhatpara area.The incident occurred two days after West Bengal Police registered a case against Singh for his September 1 tweet in which he had alleged that arson led to the destruction of an idol at a temple in another district in Bengal.However, the police released a letter written by the priest and caretaker of the shrine who stated that the idol caught fire accidentally from an oil lamp and there was no communal violence angle as alleged by Singh.“Legal action is being taken. Please don’t get carried away by misleading, provocative and mischievous post,” the West Bengal Police tweeted while attaching a screenshot of Singh’s post.On Friday, Singh released on social media a video purportedly showing two bombs going off near his home and on top of a roadside temple, emitting a lot of smoke.“The temple was not damaged and nobody was injured. The goons are backed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC),” said Singh.Barrackpore police commissioner Manoj Verma was not available for comment.“We are looking into the allegation that Singh has made,” an officer of the local police station said on condition of anonymity.On August 19, the police had searched Singh’s residence in connection with financial irregularities to the tune of Rs 11 crore involving the Bhatpara municipality and a local cooperative bank.Singh was the chairman of the Bhatpara municipality from 2010 to 2019 and also headed the bank’s board when the alleged scam took place. He had left the TMC and joined the BJP in March 2019.Singh, who was present at home during the search operation, alleged that he was being targeted by the ruling TMC.Considered to be a heavyweight leader, Singh was a four-time legislator of the TMC from Bhatpara before he joined the BJP and defeated TMC’s sitting Barrackpore Member of Parliament (MP) Dinesh Trivedi in the last parliamentary election.The election was marked by violence which continues intermittently on Singh’s home turf.Singh’s son and brother-in-law are also sitting BJP legislators in the Bengal assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/booked-for-provocative-post-bengal-bjp-mp-alleges-attack-on-house/story-99Bml46rC1FSd1uC43yY7K.html
04-09-2020||Chandigarh||No more affixing posters at entrance of Covid home isolation patients in Punjab||Covid patients in home isolation in Punjab will no longer have to suffer the fear and stigma of social isolation resulting from posters affixed at the entrance of their homes. In a major step towards mitigating the stigma attached to the pandemic, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday rescinded his government’s earlier decision of putting posters outside the houses of Covid patients under home isolation or quarantine. Posters where already affixed may be removed, he directed. The move is aimed at minimising the stigma resulting from the affixing of such posters at the doors of such patients, thus also negating the fear of testing, the chief minister, appealing to people to come out for early testing, diagnosis and treatment of Covid. The psychological trauma which patients were seen suffering as a result of these posters, which were meant to protect neighbours and others of such patients, was defeating the purpose, he said, adding that these posters were actually found scaring people away from testing. The undesirable and unintended consequences of these posters included social isolation and stigma, leading to anxiety and prejudices against the patients. People would refrain from getting tested to avoid this stigma instead of extending support and community to the patients and their families, which had prompted a rethink on the decision of affixing posters, Captain Amarinder Singh said. Continue taking precautions, says CM The chief minister urged people to continue taking necessary precautions and follow all applicable guidelines for home isolation/quarantine notwithstanding the removal of the posters. Violation of these guidelines is a punishable offence under Disaster Management Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and IPC, he said. The chief minister said his government was committed to ensuring the health and well-being of every person, and the community had an important role to play in this fight. They can do so by providing support, motivating and encouraging behavioural change that can help avoid the transmission of the disease and in preventing any rumours about the disease or its treatment, he said, calling for a collective fight against the pandemic. The Punjab government had recently allowed home isolation for asymptomatic/ mildly symptomatic Covid patients, who did not suffer from any co-morbidities, as per the protocol of the ministry of health and family welfare and recommendations of ICMR. In fact, as the number of cases in the state continued to rise, home isolation for these patients was actively advocated and facilitated, with constant monitoring by local health authorities. The monitoring was aimed at ensuring the best possible care for such patients in terms of environment and diet. To make the community aware and act as a check on possible violation by the patient of the home isolation guidelines, posters indicating that a positive patient was under home isolation were being affixed on the front door of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-more-affixing-posters-at-entrance-of-covid-home-isolation-patients-in-punjab/story-MMKKYV1QySGzzAivDfKO2K.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi to get back into high spirits: Restaurateurs elated to serve, foodies eager to order liquor||The news that Delhiites will now again be able to indulge in a glass of aged wine, or a sparkling mojito has made both the foodies and restauranteurs quite high! Hotels, restaurants and clubs in the national capital have been permitted to serve liquor from September 9, on a trial basis. “I feel this is a really good decision since liquor has already been available at retail shops, and people have been coming out to dine at restaurants where they do miss later. As long as people are sensible and keep safety in mind, I think we can all start getting back to a normal life,” says Abhiram Bidwai, owner, La Cantine Kitchen and Bar, Vasant Kunj, adding, “Liquor service for restaurants is necessary in more ways than one. It not only forms a major chunk of sales but also makes for a complete meal experience.”Restauranteur Priyank Sukhija, who owns Lord Of The Drinks and Tamasha, welcomes the move adding, it “should have happened sooner.” He feels, “It’s easier to serve beer, than make a mocktail! Opening up liquor services will save a lot of restaurants from shutting down, and will incentivise those who have shut shop, to reopen. For four months we had zero sales. In the last month, since we opened, we have been running on 7-10% of our pre-covid revenues. With alcohol, we expect the number to go up to 30-40%.”Delhiites who love alcohol are on cloud nine since this announcement. “For some of us, drinking at home isn’t really an option, so I’m glad that alcohol will now be served at my favourite restaurants. I can finally meet my friends over a pitcher of beer. And safe dining is entirely possible since most places have taken adequate precautions,” says Nivea Jain, a resident of Vasant Kunj. And Delhi-based food blogger Sonika Pandey, adds that the move will finally allow her to have a wholesome dining experience! “I am a foodie, and many of the restaurants that I frequented before the lockdown have closed down due to lack of revenue. When people out to have a meal, they do need a drink along even if not partying full on. So apart from being able to serve what thei patrons demands, restaurants will now be able to stay afloat at a time when there isn’t much income,” adds Pandey. The SOPs issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) state that no more than 50% of the approved seating capacity will be allowed inside the restaurant, hotel or club, so that social distancing norms are maintained. Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd, says, this move is “a lifeline for a beleaguered industry that has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic”. He adds, “The industry will serve responsibly and ensure all guidelines are followed. Most importantly this will allow a lot more restaurants to open up thereby significantly increasing employment. This will also help in driving more consumers to restaurants and bars and hopefully lead to a much needed increase in revenues.”Author tweets @Bhagat_MallikaFollow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-back-into-high-spirits-restaurateurs-elated-to-serve-foodies-eager-to-order-liquor/story-cfICYA5uPHaPpPbrBx3huN.html

The neighbour, Honey Singh, allegedly confined the father and son wrongfully and also asked the teenager to work as a “servant” to compensate for the damage.Also read: Lucknow man sets himself on fire at home, triggers blast“The man who tortured and humiliated the teenager, forcing him to attempt the extreme step, is absconding.

The injured teenager is undergoing treatment at the hospital.”The teenager was going to his father’s shop on a bicycle with his friend when he lost balance and hit a police bike and Singh. Singh’s phone fell and was damaged as a result of the collision, said a police officer, who did not want to be named, quoting the teenager’s statement.“After the police personnel left, Honey verbally abused and slapped the teenager and asked him to call his father to pay for the damage.

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||8% of Haryana’s population is infected with coronavirus; urban population more affected than rural||About 8% of the population in Haryana has been found infected with coronavirus. The findings were made on the basis of first round of a serological survey conducted by the health department. The survey conducted in collaboration with PGIMER, Chandigarh, measured the proportion of population exposed to coronavirus infection, including asymptomatic individuals. Health minister Anil Vij said that 18,905 blood samples from all 22 districts were put to immunoglobulin-ELISA test in August to determine how many people have developed Covid-19 antibodies. The health authorities took samples from 850 people, including 500 from rural areas of each district. Vij said the urban population was found to be more affected than the rural. “Seropositivity in urban areas was 9.6%, while it was 6.9% in the rural areas,” he said. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said that national capital region (NCR) districts have high seropositivity. “It is 25.8% (31.1% in urban and 22.2% in rural) in Faridabad, 13.3% (18% in urban and 10% in rural) in Sonepat and 10.8% (18.5% in urban and 5.7% in rural) in Gurugram,” Arora said. The ACS said the reason behind higher seropositivity in NCR districts as compared to non-NCR districts could be high density of population due to urban slums, multi-storeyed buildings and daily movement of people. Higher seropositivity than the state average of 8% was also noticed in some other districts like Karnal (12.2%), Jind (11%), Kurukshetra (8.7%), Charkhi Dadri (8.3%) and Yamunanagar (8.3%). Districts having lower seropositivity than the state average were Panipat and Palwal (7.4% each), Panchkula (6.5%), Jhajjar (5.9%), Ambala (5.2%), Rewari (4.9%), Sirsa (3.6%), Hisar (3.4%), Fatehabad (3.3%), Bhiwani (3.2%), Mahendergarh (2.8%) and Kaithal (1.7%). ‘Low prevalence means majority population vulnerable’ The ACS said that since 8% population of Haryana has developed antibodies, the low prevalence can be attributed to the proactive efforts taken by the government to prevent the spread of infection, including prompt lockdown, effective testing strategies, containment and surveillance measures such as contact tracing. Director health services, IDSP, Dr Usha Gupta said low prevalence also meant that majority of population is still vulnerable to the virus. “Thus, containment measures need to be enforced with the same rigor. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, cough etiquettes and avoidance of crowded places must also be followed strictly,” she added. Health officials said immunoglobulin antibodies generally start appearing after two weeks of onset of infection and last for several months. “We wanted to know how many people have already suffered from this virus, including asymptomatic individuals. Many people get infected but do not have any symptoms like fever, cough, and cold. In several cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed. The immunoglobulin-ELISA blood test tells us if they got this infection in the recent past,” the ACS said. Based on the results, public health interventions can be planned and implemented for the prevention and control of the disease. Dr Gupta said a stratified multistage random sampling technique was used. Sixteen clusters — 12 rural and four urban — were randomly selected for the collection of samples. HOW THE TEST IS DONE Immunoglobulin ELISA test for sero survey Five millilitre blood is taken for the sample from willing individuals. The test is not diagnostic.

The incident took place early on Friday.Police said no other person was injured in the blast. Locals said the incident had triggered panic in their neighbourhood. They said the blast also damaged the window panes of adjoining houses.The blaze was contained after two fire tenders reached the spot, police added.

It was decided to deploy these forces in the worst Maoist [insurgency] hit south Bastar district of Sukma and Bijapur for effective implementation of anti-naxal operations and developmental projects. In the selected locations, [money]...has been disbursed for setting up battalion headquarters and work has also been completed at most of the locations. I have learnt that 10 CRPF battalions have been removed from Jammu and Kashmir. In this case, providing the 7 allocated battalions to Chhattisgarh immediately will help in effective implementation of anti-naxal drive,” Baghel wrote in his letter to Shah.Baghel said the state government has adopted a three-dimensional programme involving trust, development, and security to win over the people of the Maoist insurgency affected regions. He added they were taking forward the development work to create a safe environment there and that the efforts have shown positive results.Baghel said 1,028 mobile towers were sanctioned for expanding the telecom connectivity in the region. He added a list of locations selected for them has been sent to the Union home ministry. Baghel said the towers should be established soon for the benefit of common people as well as security forces.Baghel requested Shah to organise a special army recruitment rally in Bastar and to form ‘Bastaria Battalion’ of the Central Armed Police Forces.In August, Baghel wrote to Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar seeking Rs 1,100 crores for construction of steel bridges to ensure rural connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhattisgarh-seeks-seven-battalions-of-crpf-for-south-bastar-districts/story-3AuHTQtghKcu3LMPQQjI5I.html

The girl’s body was found on Thursday in a sugarcane field near her village and police initially suspected the murder to be linked to enmity between two families.Also read: Ex-serviceman held for raping IAS aspirant in ChandigarhLakhimpur Kheri police superintendent Satendra Kumar said a panel of three doctors, who conducted the post-mortem, has confirmed sexual assault. He added the Indian Penal Code’s sections related to rape and charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act have been added in the First Information Report (FIR) filed in the case based on the post-mortem report.Kumar said the girl’s family had earlier alleged she was kidnapped and murdered due to old enmity and named one person from their village in the FIR.Another police officer, who has been involved in the investigation, said the girl went missing on Wednesday and her body was found with multiple injury marks on Thursday. He added the post-mortem report findings confirmed that the girl was strangled using some cloth after being raped.The second officer said a suspect was last spotted in the sugarcane field and disappeared after sensing trouble. He added the region is full of sugarcane fields, where the suspect is apparently hiding. The second officer said four teams were conducting a combing operation in the fields to arrest the suspect.Three minor girls have been raped and murdered in Lakhimpur Kheri since August 14, when the first such case involving a 13-year-old girl was reported. Two men were arrested in connection with the first case.

04-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Doctor held for issuing fake Covid-19 certificates||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak appears to have led to the alleged misuse of Hippocrates’ oath until the law caught up with a south Delhi-based doctor (34) and his aide. The duo would collect swab samples from suspected coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients or those seeking the viral infection tests for employment or travel reasons, dump their samples in dustbin and then issue them fake test results in the names of at least three diagnostic laboratories, the Delhi Police said on Friday.Both the accused are in police custody. The doctor and his aide have issued at least 75 such fake test results and charged Rs 2,400 from each of the recipients, said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (south), Delhi Police.“They did not have specific criteria for issuing the Covid-19 test results. If someone had symptoms, then they would issue a Covid-19 positive result. The asymptomatic people were issued Covid-19 negative results,” said DCP Thakur.The accused have been identified as Dr Kush Parashar, a general physician who holds a postgraduate degree in medicine from Russia, and his aide, Amit Singh.“Their cover was blown, when one of the recipients of the test results found a mismatch in his name and contacted the diagnostic centre to learn that the latter didn’t issue any such result,” said the DCP.Similarly, two nurses, who were seeking jobs, needed to undergo Covid-19 tests. Their employer recommended them to get tested at Dr Parashar’s clinic. “However, one of the nurses found her name to be spelled wrongly in the report. She called up the diagnostic centre, which had purportedly conducted the test, and sought a fresh report with the correction in her name’s spelling. The laboratory authorities perused through their records and found that her name didn’t exist in their records,” said the DCP. An official from the diagnostic centre had a hunch about alleged wrongdoing and approached the Hauz Khas police station, where a case of cheating was registered.“The chain of events was traced to Dr Kush Parashar. It turned out that he and his aide Singh were preparing fake Covid-19 test reports on their laptops and then sharing PDF (portable document format) copies on WhatsApp with their ‘patients’. The modus operandi didn’t raise any suspicion about the authenticity of the reports,” the DCP said.Police said Dr Parashar would recommend Covid-19 tests to most of his patients, irrespective of their symptoms. “Dr Parashar would tell his patients that he would collect the swab samples from them on behalf of a diagnostic laboratory and then send them to the laboratory to conduct Covid-19 test. But as soon as a patient left his clinic, he would dump the swab samples in dustbin,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-doctor-held-for-issuing-fake-covid-19-certificates/story-BN8whgwXGcBLYdUfqglyrK.html

He was reportedly boasting about it among his friends, which Armaan did not like. They had also fought over this issue,” an investigating officer said. DCP Sharma said that Armaan confided in Karan who agreed to help him in executing the murder. As per their plan, the duo allegedly lured Dharmender to a secluded spot near the water treatment plant on a motorcycle and hacked him to death using a sword.

04-09-2020||City||Life of poor important than employment of doctors: HC||The lives of the poor are more important than the employment of doctors, the Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench has ruled while rejecting a doctor’s review petition for his reinstatement after dismissal over dereliction of duty that allegedly caused an 11-year-old boy’s death in 2010.A bench of Justices TV Nalawade and Mangesh Patil on Monday dismissed Dnyaneshwar Borade’s review petition saying there was no arguable case for reviewing the earlier order upholding his dismissal.Borade was a doctor on duty at Shirdi’s Saibaba Hospital in June 2009 when the boy was brought to the charitable facility for treatment for snakebite. He transferred the boy to Sainath Hospital without administering an anti-venom injection. Sainath Hospital refused to admit the boy and sent him back, prompting Borade to refer him to a private hospital at Loni. But the child died on the way.Borade was dismissed from service in December 2010 after an inquiry. The court upheld his removal in January 2015. He approached the court last year seeking a review, primarily on the ground that he was acquitted of causing death by negligence in January 2019.In its order on Monday, the bench observed government-run and charitable hospitals are basically meant for the poor. “[But] these days, the approach of some doctors working in the government hospitals and Trust hospitals is such that they do not care for the life of poor persons,” it added. The bench said such negligent doctors “cannot be spared as the life of poor persons is more important than the service of such persons.” Unless a firm stand is taken by their employers and also by the court, the conduct of the doctors will not improve, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-of-poor-important-than-employment-of-doctors-hc/story-FTMT1dFq09ZGONNmbwXo8L.html

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Multani disappearance case: HC judge recuses from hearing Saini’s anticipatory bail plea||A Punjab and Haryana high court judge on Friday recused from hearing the anticipatory bail plea of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case. The case was listed for hearing before the bench of justice Suvir Sehgal, which without recording any reason for recusal referred the matter to the chief justice for listing it before another bench. On September 2, another judge, justice Amol Rattan Singh, had recused from hearing the second petition of Saini seeking either quashing or transfer of the Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). That plea filed in August 19, is now listed for hearing for September 7. It is immediately not clear when bail plea of Saini will now be taken up by the high court.“Right to hearing to an accused, which is a fundamental right, has been denied to an accused by successive recusals. Also other side (state) is appearing without any notice to them and interfering in the proceedings,” said senior advocate APS Deol, who is appearing for Saini hinting at ‘over anxiety’ from the state.In both the petitions, the Punjab government has roped in two Supreme Court senior advocates, Sidharth Luthra and Harin Rawal, besides law officers from the advocate general office. Sartej Singh Narula, the special public prosecutor in the case before the Mohali court, too is appearing.The additional district and sessions judge of Mohali had on Tuesday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of the former DGP. It is against this order that Saini had approached the high court.Saini was booked in May this year in connection with the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO). Multani, a resident of Mohali, had been picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh, in 1991. Punjab Police on August 28 had conducted raids at Saini’s Chandigarh house and other locations but he could not be found. However, hours later on the same day, the Mohali court had extended Saini’s interim bail till the final orders on his anticipatory bail plea, subsequently dismissed on September 1. Saini faces arrest as the court had on August 21 allowed Punjab Police to add the murder charge against him in this case after two former Chandigarh Police personnel, who were also co-accused in the case, turned approver. The police had claimed that Multani escaped from custody at Qadian in Gurdaspur district. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Multani’s brother, Palwinder Singh, who is a resident of Jalandhar. Initially, the case was registered against them under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali. In his plea, Saini says the first information report (FIR) is the result of mala fide act against him for launching probes against Congress leaders and their relatives to unearth scams due to which he had become an eyesore for political parties. He is demanding that the FIR be quashed or probe be transferred to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-judge-recuses-from-hearing-bail-plea-of-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini/story-U2H1BErA1BPd3Ao84fHo5O.html
04-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP MLA writes to JP Nadda, expresses anguish over lack of development works in his area||A ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker, Umesh Sharma Kau, from Uttarakhand has written to party president JP Nadda about his constituency being neglected as far as development work is concerned. The letter follows a similar complaint made by another party legislator and former Uttarakhand BJP chief Bishan Singh Chuphal, who had alleged that the bureaucrats were disregarding the elected lawmakers and also met Nadda on Wednesday to seek redressal for his grievances. Umesh Sharma Kau, who represents Raipur constituency in Dehradun district in the Uttarakhand legislative assembly, has written to Nadda, alleging that no development work has been carried out in his assembly segment in the past few years. He stated that the public has been sore with the state government for its apathy and drew the pitiable condition of roads in his assembly constituency to bolster his argument.Kau has sought an appointment with Nadda in a bid to apprise him in detail about the travails of his constituency and has also underlined that as an elected representative he is deeply hurt by Raipur’s neglect and the anguish of his party workers. He has blamed the bureaucrats, who, he alleged, refused to pay heed to repeated reminders from the ministers.However, Kau downplayed his “hurt” and tried to gloss over the contents of the letter with the media.“I have sent my letter to the national president (Nadda) through email. Yeh hamare parivar ka mamla hai (This is a matter of our family). I won’t talk about it in the media,” he said. Chuphal said he had discussed developmental issues with Nadda, especially regarding roads and mobile phone connectivity. “He gave me a patient hearing. In the end, he told me that all the (party) members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) have to work together to ensure the BJP’s victory in the 2022 Uttarakhand polls,” he said. He rubbished the insinuations that he was eyeing a berth in the Trivendra Singh Rawat-ruled state government. “If I wanted to be inducted in the cabinet, I would have raised my voice in 2017, when the government had come into power. Why should I want it now? I have contributed to the party in various capacities, including being the state president,” he said. He also refused to read into the timing of raising these allegations. “I just raised the issues in my constituency with the party’s national president. This should not be seen as that I am against the chief minister or I am mounting pressure to be inducted into the state cabinet,” he said. At present, three cabinet berths are lying vacant, which the CM hinted recently, would be filled soon. Another BJP MLA from Lohaghat in Champawat district, Puran Singh Fartyal, is also not happy with the government’s decision to re-allocate construction work of Tanakpur-Jauljibi (TJ) road to the same contractor, who was blacklisted after a probe in 2017. “The contractor has been given the contract again for the road project. Though he had won the case through arbitration, the government didn’t appeal against it. I also wrote about it to the national party president a few weeks ago. I’m not going to back down on this issue,” Fartyal said. Fartyal was served a show-cause notice for working against party discipline and was also summoned by BJP’s state president Bansidhar Bhagat on August 24. The rumblings within the lawmakers’ ranks come amid recent Bhagat’s call to action to the party legislators . He had urged them to work hard in their constituencies and not just bank on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name for getting votes. BJP state leadership doesn’t want to read into a section of MLAs’ correspondence with Nadda. It insisted that “all is well in the party” and the media’s interpretation is all “wrong”. Devendra Bhasin, state vice-president, BJP, said there was no dissent among the MLAs and nobody was challenging Rawat’s leadership. “If some MLAs have met Nadda or written to him about some issues in their constituencies that should not be interpreted in other ways. The MLAs are at liberty to interact with the national party president. What’s wrong in that?” he asked. The main Opposition, the Congress, has jumped on the bandwagon and alleged that the state government not only failed in meeting the aspirations of the public but also of its own MLAs as well. Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Indira Hridayesh said these developments show that now it is also apparent to the BJP MLAs that development has been elusive in the hill state during CMRawat’s rule. “Several lawmakers are apprehensive that they may lose elections because assembly polls are only two years away. They have woken up from their slumber and are raising their voice against the state government’s apathy and callousness,” she alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-writes-to-jp-nadda-expresses-anguish-over-lack-of-development-works-in-his-area/story-x5m0P8NP7iU6HzRLkMeVxH.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||While testing in Mumbai goes up, cases decline in August, but authorities expect further spike||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai’s governing civic body, anticipates a spike in Covid-19 cases because of relaxation in restrictions related to the pandemic and the Ganesh festival even as the number of infections has come down gradually with an increase in testing over the last three months. According to Maharashtra health department data, Mumbai reported over 36,000 cases in June, around 35,000 cases in July, and over 30,000 cases in August. The BMC has said the next week is crucial as the effect of festival season is likely to seen during the following seven days.Experts have advised caution saying the curve since last week of August has gone a bit upwards and added testing and tracing needs to be optimised. As many as 238,000 tests were conducted in August, 203,000 in July, 120,000 in May, and 132,000 in June, according to the BMC data.In May, around 3,872 tests were being conducted daily, 4,422 in July, and over 7,600 in August. The overall positivity rate came down to around 18% in August. As many as 792,000 tests have been conducted in Mumbai till date with a positivity rate of 18.74%.The BMC started screening people for Covid-19 on January 18 at the Mumbai Airport. It conducted the first test on February 3. The first positive case was reported on March 11.Mumbai had only around 7,000 cases until April 30. In May, it reported around 31,874 cases, 36,559 cases in June, 35,139 cases in July, and 30,474 cases in August.Mumbai has since August 26 been reporting between 1,100 to 1,800 cases daily.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 taskforce, said a small upward trend has been observed since the last week of August. “We have to ramp up the testing considering we are currently under testing and under tracing. We have to optimise the testing considering our capacity, which is not happening currently,” he said. “...we have liberalised testing where anyone can go and test, but if people are not coming out and testing, we will have to go to them and test them.”Madhav Sathe, a former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital, said he has been vocal about increasing the daily testing for two months now. “In September too, we are testing around 9,000 samples in Mumbai daily whereas we should be testing at least 15,000. We have given an option to citizens to get tested, but we should also enforce testing if that is required for increasing the testing numbers. Also, at least front-line staff or those who come in contact with multiple people daily should all be tested to control the spread.”Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional commissioner, said the spike they expected will not be huge. “There will be a little spike in the number of cases being reported daily, and it is because we are having many relaxations... During the Ganesh festival, many went out and this might increase our tally,” he said. “The active cases in the city are around 20,000 and in the coming days, it will be anything above 17,000. ...our constant effort has been to increase the testing. Our capacity is to conduct around 1,4000 to 1,5000 tests daily and we are doing around 9,000 now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/while-testing-in-mumbai-goes-up-cases-decline-in-august-but-authorities-expect-further-spike/story-Njw8cOrgf5Ts5t44vZmu0K.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||Water from artificial immersion sites, Plaster of Paris idols dumped directly into Thane creek by civic body||An environmental group has cited Thane Municipal Corporation’s practice of discharging water from artificial idol immersion sites and remnants of thousands of Plaster of Paris (PoP) Ganesh idols pushed into Thane creek as a result annually to highlight the damage it is causing to marine life and water quality.Muse Foundation, the group, first came to know about the practice in 2019 when it received a response under the Right to Information (RTI) Act from the corporation that they had been collecting Ganesh idols at 19 artificial ponds and dumping them at Thane Creek. The corporation cleaned the immersion sites using chemicals before releasing the treated water into the Thane creek.The group studied the situation during Ganeshotsav festival this year and found there was no change in the practice and filed complaints, including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Thursday, saying it was being done a gross violation of preventive water pollution control measures.“PoP idols and associated lead-based paint are toxic for marine life and water quality. Remnants of these idols are disastrous for the marine biodiversity of this creek, which passes through a protected flamingo sanctuary and finally meets the Arabian Sea, polluting an entire ecosystem,” said Muse Foundation founder Nishant Bangera.Muse Foundation on Thursday identified one of the locations where a heap of broken idols and decorative material was found dumped.The corporation said 45,000 idols were immersed in 2016, 42,000 to 34,000 from 2017 to 2019, and 21,000 idols this year.The corporation also, under RTI Act, said it spent Rs 11 lakh to construct one of the ponds. “If on an average, the cost of the artificial immersion site is about 10 lakh each, with 19 such sites, the total amount runs into crores of rupees. Thus, the current practice renders artificial immersions as a futile exercise using public money since the disposal is finally happening in the Thane Creek itself,” said Muse Foundation member Sushank Tomar.The group has requested the Maharashtra government to intervene and direct an end to the practice. “Innovative methods at the city level can be used to eliminate PoP from entering the creek...,” said Bangera.Manisha Pradhan, who heads the corporation’s pollution control department, said there has been an increase in suspended solids coming from decorative materials with idols. “For this, our treatment practice is effective as KMNo4 [used for the cleaning] acts as an oxidising agent... alum is used to reduce the suspended particles and increase dissolved oxygen in the water. Once discharged into the Thane creek, it does not affect the water quality in any manner as the water easily dissolves and does not affect the biodiversity.” Pradhan added this was being done as per MPCB guidelines.PoP contains chemicals like sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium and idols made of it are the cheapest and cost between Rs 500-Rs 1,000.“The toxicity from heavy metals in colour used to paint idols is a problem. Lead-based paints used on these idols are poisonous for phytoplankton’s [underwater plants] and the poison is further transferred to fish and higher animals,” said E Vivekanandan, a marine biologist.Pradhan said they were encouraging citizens to use clay idols and added in the case of PoP ones, they request them to use ammonium bicarbonate. “[People in] areas like [Covid-19] containment zones or located away from immersion spots were asked to follow this process wherein idols would be dissolved on site. 100kg ammonium bicarbonate was purchased from us by citizens this year. However, this is not feasible on a large-scale level which requires interventions from the state or Centre to ban the use of PoP completely,” said Pradhan.The Central Pollution Control Board in May banned the use of PoP, thermocol, and single-use plastic for making idols and the use of creeks and natural water bodies for immersion. But on May 22, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar deferred the ban by a year to help artisans hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.An MPCB official said they were unaware of the corporation’s practice. “We will check with our regional officer about the issue and based on his response, follow up directions will be issued to...”Forest officials said they would check whether water pollution was recorded post immersions at the 1,690 hectare Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary. “If we find remnants of any idols, we will take corrective action.

04-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC concludes second serological survey, results expected by next weekend||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) concluded the second phase of a serological survey on Thursday, and results are expected by the end of next week. In the second comparative survey, the civic body collected blood samples of 5,840 individuals—3,700 from slums and 2,140 from non-slum areas—in the same three civic wards as the first serological survey. In a sero-survey, a group of individuals undergo blood tests to detect the presence of IgM antibodies. Immunoglobulin-G (IgM) antibodies are produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a foreign particle like a virus. The sero survey will help identify individuals who were previously infected with the virus and have now recovered due to the presence of antibodies. The civic body, along with NITI-Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), conducted the first serological survey in July among 6,936 people living in the three wards—M-West (Tilaknagar and Chembur), F-North (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R-North (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar). As many as 4,234 individuals were surveyed at random in slums, of which 56.5% were identified with Covid-19 antibodies. In non-slum areas, antibodies were prevalent in only 419 (15.5%) of 2,702 people examined. In order to gauge the spread of the virus among the population, BMC needed to conduct the second study in the same civic wards a month after the first sero survey. “We are expecting results of the survey within a week. The researchers will have to analyse and compare data of the first sero survey with the second one to check the change in infection rate. This will give us a clearer picture of the spread of the virus in the population and how many have remained asymptomatic,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. As HT reported earlier, only 20% persons in non-slum residential areas cooperated with the volunteers in collecting samples in the first study. However, in comparison to the previous study, volunteers witnessed lesser resistance from non-slums individuals in the ongoing second study. “Before starting collecting samples, we sensitized people in different societies and buildings in the same three wards so that they cooperated with us in providing their samples,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bmc-concludes-second-serological-survey-results-expected-by-weekend/story-VlFno0XhwDfx5S7owjBqNO.html
04-09-2020||City||Ayodhya’s Ram ki Paidi set for major facelift by this Diwali||By Diwali in November, Ayodhya’s Ram ki Paidi, as the Saryu riverbank in the temple town is known, would be bigger, and better as the work on its extension is in its final stages and expected to be complete by this month or early October, officials aware of the matter said. The Uttar Pradesh tourism department is likely to market it as a major attraction to draw tourist to the town.The project is a part of the town’s makeover as the state government seeks to make its a major religious tourism hub over the next decade with the launch the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya last month. The Supreme Court paved the way for the construction at the site of demolished Babri Masjid after years of litigation and bad blood.Officials said Ram ki Paidi is being extended at the cost of Rs 56 crore. “Post-revamp, Ram ki Paidi would have more ghats [from five to nine] and more space [as the length of the remodelled bank is being extended from 500 metres to a kilometre], to accommodate devotees who want to take a holy dip in the Saryu river during major festivals and fairs,” said irrigation department’s engineer-in-chief, VK Niranjan, who is associated with the remodelling project.The first phase of the makeover was completed in October barely eight months after it began.Officials said it impressed chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who visited the place twice and performed rituals and ordered that the Ram ki Paidi be further extended.The river discharge flow around Ram ki Paidi, where the water was mostly stagnated, was increased from 40 cusecs since 1988 to 240 cusecs to ensure a continuous, steady flow of water with the help of a pump house. “To ensure steady flow, we approached the Irrigation Research Institute at Roorkee for suggestions. On the basis of those, the department started the challenging task of ensuring smooth water flow,” said Niranjan.He added in 1988, the water from the Saryu would be pumped into the Ram ki Paidi from one side and pumped out from the other. “This two-stage pumping meant that there was no flow as it was designed more like a water tank and slowly it became full of silt and dirt. The irrigation department would carry out cleanliness drive but every 15 days, things would be back to square one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ayodhya-s-ram-ki-paidi-set-for-major-facelift-by-this-diwali/story-BBOYXqBEjC31ZxujuBDu2H.html

They arrested the student on Wednesday.Since the woman’s photographs and mobile phone number were shared on these fake social media profiles, she was inundated with phone calls from strangers who would pass vulgar comments and seek sexual favours of her. Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south), said that when the woman complained on Tuesday, they first proceeded to contact the two social media companies, Facebook and Instagram, to request them to take down the profiles. Meanwhile, the police registered a case of stalking, insulting the modesty of a woman and criminal intimidation at Neb Sarai police station. “We used technical surveillance on the phone numbers used to open these fake accounts and that helped us zero in on the suspect, Umesh Kumar, who lives in Sangam Vihar,” said the DCP. Kumar was arrested on Wednesday and the mobile phone allegedly used in the crime was recovered from him. According to the DCP, Kumar said that he was friends with the woman’s older sister until March 2020. “He suspected her younger sister of being the reason behind their break-up and decided to take revenge,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-creates-fake-social-media-profiles-of-a-woman-to-harass-her-arrested/story-vcuL3RAV0rx9ejGRz8CNSK.html

The move came days after the central government, in its guidelines, allowed bars to open across the country.Thursday’s order comes with stringent safety protocols to be followed in all restaurants, pubs, clubs, bars and hotels. Here are six things one must keep in mind before making plans1. Wearing masks is compulsory for both customers and employees.2. It is better to get a reservation first because restaurants, bars, pubs and hotels will have to ensure that not more than 50% of their seats are occupied at any given point, which can lead to a long wait outside the premises.3. The dance floors will be missing and so will the bar stools – the idea is to ensure social distancing. Also, bars are not allowed to serve customers who are not allotted a proper table.4. All customers will be screened with thermal scanners and anyone with a body temperature above normal or with flu-like symptoms will be denied entry.5. Restaurants, bars, pubs and hotels will not be allowed to operate in containment zones. As of now Delhi has 922 sealed areas. 6. It is best to check the list of precautions on the Delhi government website before making plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/5-things-to-remember-before-making-plans-to-visit-a-restopub-or-club-in-delhi/story-zAVGF6Hm4PmqP0Nsc8Oo6K.html
04-09-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh weavers get Priyanka Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav’s support over power tariffs||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav have accused the Uttar Pradesh government of ignoring weavers’ demand for restoration of power subsidy for power looms run by the community in the state and not helping them tide over the difficulties faced during the lockdown.“Weavers from all over Uttar Pradesh, including Varanasi are currently facing a terrible crisis. The government has neither heard them on the issue of electricity bills nor has it helped them to overcome the crisis that has arisen from the lockdown. Weavers, who illuminated UP’s name across the world through their skill and art, are forced to go on strike today. The government should listen to the demands of the weavers,” said Gandhi in a post on her Facebook account.The UP government, in January this year, ended the flat electricity rate regime for handlooms and directed them to pay according to power consumption.In protest, weavers in Varanasi launched a fortnightly strike on September 1 by stopping power looms to demand restoration of the fixed power tariff arrangement. The strike call was given by Uttar Pradesh Bunkar Mahasabha and Varanasi based organization Biradarana Tanzim. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted to extend his support to the community, “Weavers are upset, but the government is unaware.” About 5 lakh weavers are engaged in the making of famous Banarasi sarees, stoles and other clothes in the city and they claim the government move was burning a hole in their pocket. A weaver said that it was impossible to pay heft electricity bills amounting to Rs 2,500 or Rs 3,000 with an average monthly earning of Rs 8,000 while meeting expenses of one’s family.The striking weavers’ groups have decided to suspend work between September 1 and 15. The effect of the strike was visible everywhere with powerlooms in all localities remaining closed. The community has decided to form a human chain and stage demonstrations from Friday. Also Read: In UP, Kafeel Khan becomes hot property for political partiesTop members of the Tanzim, Maqbool Hasan and Ishrat Usmani said the stir would be intensified further if the government does not accept their demands. Weavers from across the state will collectively apply to get their electricity lines disconnected.Social worker and master weaver Mateen Kaifee said: “Under the flat rate scheme, Rs 145 each was fixed for every powerloom. But now weavers are made to pay per unit of consumed electricity every month. For example, if a powerloom consumes 300 units, the weaver will have to pay the bill for all 300 units.” Also Read: Sero survey begins in 11 UP districts todayHe added that in the new arrangement, on consumption of 120 units by a half to one horse power motor-operated powerloom, the weaver will get a monthly subsidy of Rs 350 and Rs 240 respectively.

According to Sonipat Deputy Commissioner Shyam Lal Poonia, majority 65 workers tested positive at the Amrik-Sukhdev dhaba. Ten workers belonged to the other dhaba, he told PTI over the phone. Both dhabas are located in Sonipat’s Murthal and nearly 50 km away from Delhi. The DC said both dhabas have been sealed till further orders and efforts are on to trace as many contacts as possible of the positive cases. The DC said the district administration has ordered to sanitise the eateries. Murthal is famous for its eateries and is often thronged by people travelling on the Delhi-Ambala national highway. Many people from Delhi also visit Murthal as a getaway destination as the place has many famous dhabas. The DC said the Sonipat district administration has been running a special drive for the sampling of workers at the dhabas and it was during this process that these cases were detected. In view of the coronavirus pandemic, he said the district administration keeps carrying routine checks at dhabas to ensure that they follow all norms and guidelines, including those pertaining to social distancing.

The chief secretary held a meeting in compliance with the orders of the apex court with different stakeholders and directed all district officers to draw a comprehensive plan to achieve zero stubble burning target effectively. Asking officers of the agriculture department to focus on red zone areas in the districts having regular incidents of stubble burning, she said surveillance teams should be constituted and nodal officers be appointed. “To reduce the incidence of stubble burning, directions were also given to hold gram sabha meetings,” an official spokesperson said. Arora was apprised in the meeting of a decline of 68% in fire incidences of crop residues last year in comparison to previous years. She asked the officers concerned to identify the villages falling under red and yellow zones, which do not have custom hiring centres and are yet to apply for them. She further asked them to ensure that these villages move applications for it at the earliest. The chief secretary directed the office-bearers of panchayats to ensure utilisation of machinery provided at 851 custom hiring centres set up at panchayat-level to its full capacity while giving preference to small and marginal farmers. She further asserted that it is the responsibility of the state to prevent air pollution for which the villagers should be made aware and encouraged to play an instrumental role in preventing environmental pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-chief-secretary-sets-target-of-zero-stubble-burning/story-AuCyxAP7W2f3kR7tiI8UdM.html

04-09-2020||Chandigarh||‘Infections will go up till mid-Sept, priority to keep fatalities down’||The coronavirus infection spread from Haryana’s national capital region to the northern districts is likely to hit a peak by mid-September. There could be, however, a decline in the number of infections by September-end, additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora told HT on Thursday. Excerpts:Q: How do you see the virus trajectory shaping? Wherever there is an outbreak, the peak period having high number of cases accompanied by fatalities is for a month or so. Subsequently, there is a tendency to stabilise and then cases start declining. A lot also depends to what extent people adhere to safety protocols. Q: Case fatality rate has been rather low in Haryana. Is it plain luck? Testing more and isolating infected patients early has an impact on fatality ratio. Also, the strategy of strict surveillance and screening has paid us. During procurement season, we even tested drivers of harvesting combines, traders and commission agents.Q: The virus has started shifting to north and north-west. Majority of districts have over critical values of over 200 active cases or more than 15 cases per lakh population. What’s your strategy to counter fresh spread? There is so much movement of people. Our NCR district spike was connected with Capital cases. Once infection rate in Delhi stabilised, a similar trend was noticed in Gurgaon and Faridabad. Now the virus has moved northwards. We are hopeful that after mid-September, cases in the north will also get stabilised. Till September 15, we need to doubly ensure that fatalities are kept down.Q: Why is the sample positivity rate increasing? Haryana’s daily testing has increased substantially. The average per day testing in March was just 30. It was 880 in April, about 3,000 in May, about 5,000 in June, 11,300 in July, 17,500 in August and about 23,000 in September. On an average, the positivity rate has been about 5.65%. It meant that for every 100 cases tested, we get 5.6 positive cases. So, if you increase your per day testing by 6,000 between July and August and September, the per day increase of positive cases will be 375-400. Q: How has been the experience with rapid antigen testing (RAT)? RAT has been extremely useful in areas with a sudden spurt of cases including containment zones. It has helped us to immediately isolate infected persons in emerging hotspots. Antigen detection has also played a vital role in unlocking industrial clusters. Q: How would you explain the 3.7% positivity rate for rapid antigen test as compared to 6.4% for RT-PCR which is the gold standard test? The success rate for rapid antigen test is 75-80 %. But even with a lower positivity rate of 3.7%, it is effective in isolating cases very quickly. However, we are very careful in ensuring that testing ratio for RT-PCR and RAT is 60:40. RT-PCR remains our first preference. Q: Are we anywhere close to bending the curve? By September-end, the number of infections should see a decline in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/infections-will-go-up-till-mid-sept-priority-to-keep-fatalities-down/story-uhEWwta1WCUFLKWIavjiaL.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: That M word||He has been living in the Capital since 1974, “so I’m definitely not a migrant,” says Muhammed Zafar, uttering the M word in English. But this is also true that his entire family—his wife and five of his six children—live in his native village in Bihar, and have never visited him here.“To tell you frankly, I feel like a migrant when I go to visit my people in the village,” he says in a dead serious tone, as if his solemn expressions would add credibility to his arguments.In his late 50s, Mr Zafar sells ladies and children footwear on a central Delhi pavement. This morning he is sitting in the middle of the sandal rack, filled up with small and big sandals of all kinds of glossy varieties. Mr Zafar is actually sitting at the very centre of the sloping stall, his figure surrounded by the merchandise he is selling. A small table fan is placed next to him. The roof is a plastic awning that protects him and the sandals from rain and sunshine.This isn’t his shop though, he clarifies. He works on behalf of the owner.After decades of being in the city, Mr Zafar does not have a street stall of his own — it doesn’t make him feel unsuccessful, he explains. “My accomplishment lies in being able to feed my family.” That was the reason he left his village all those years ago. Mr Zafar calls the city his “asli ghar (true home)”, but he has no illusions about the indifference it shows to its dwellers. He cites the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, when all the markets had to shut down, “and suddenly I was out of work, out of money... and nobody here came to my help.”He went back to his family in Darbangha district “and for the first time in many years I stayed there for four months straight.” Usually, Mr Zafar would visit the place annually for a month, in the winters.There, despite being among his wife and children, he just couldn’t feel at ease. “Only in Dilli I feel at home. I feel sukoon (calm).”When urged to explain this dichotomy, Mr Zafar thinks hard for a while. Speaking slowly, he says: When I’m in the village, I’m always full of tensions, for there are few opportunities to earn, and spending my days there means I’m losing out on the money I could have earned in the sheher (city).”Mr Zafar points out that his eldest son lives in the Delhi region too. “He works in a restaurant in a mall in Noida.” They rarely meet but the son also supports the family in the village.Anyhow, the moment the footwear seller says he feels most content is when sending money to his family through mobile phone. “And that is possible because of this place,” he says, implying Delhi.Although these days there are barely any shoppers, “I’m back at work,” and theatrically gesturing his arm about the sandals, he says, “and here is my life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-that-m-word/story-70nTBWwyAweYrmpyKXXXsK.html

04-09-2020||City||Thane municipal commissioner attributes rise in Covid cases to increased testing||Covid-19 cases in Thane have been witnessing a surge from the past one week, after seeing a marked decline last month. Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has attributed the rise to the increased number of tests each day. For over a week, the city has been conducting 3,500 antigen tests each day, said civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma. The civic body has been laying special emphasis on testing vendors and commuters. The volunteers at the immersion sites, too, were made to take antigen tests. “If the cases are increasing, so are the number of tests that are being conducted. On Wednesday alone, we tested 4,374 people. We had also set up detection centres at immersion ghats during Ganesh Chaturthi, which helped us reach out to the volunteers. Each ward has set up at least two testing camps and we are making optimum use of our manpower and antigen kits.” At the antigen testing camps, senior citizens, comorbid residents, differently-abled residents and pregnant women are given a priority. The city had witnessed a surge of infections in mid-July, when the Covid-19 cases witnessed a daily spike of 400-417. However, by mid-August, the figures hovered between 200 and 250 each day and this week, the numbers have again witnessed a surge. On Thursday, the city had recorded 348 cases, higher from Wednesday’s 301 cases. The total cases in the city have now crossed the 27,000-mark, while the death toll stands at 973. The situation at Uthalsar and Majiwada-Manpada wards has been causing a worry to officials as the areas have recorded a growth rate of 1.1% as against the growth rate between 0.3% and 0.9% witnessed in other wards. As per TMC’s report, on Thursday, the Majiwada-Manpada ward had recorded 71 cases, followed by 55 cases registered in Naupada Kopri and 52 in Kalwa wards. “Earlier, we used to conduct around 50 tests each day, which has increased to around 700 tests now. On Wednesday, we set up three testing camps within the Uthalsar ward, which has led to an increase in the number of positive cases. Forty four new cases were recorded from Uthalsar alone on Thursday due to extensive testing,” said SR Patole, assistant municipal commissioner, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-municipal-commissioner-attributes-rise-in-covid-cases-to-increased-testing/story-r0fDifVh1IF34bHQpXynOO.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||2 students arrested in cheating cases from Mumbai’s Andheri area test positive for Covid-19||Two of the five students, who were arrested by Oshiwara police in cheating cases last month, were tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. “The students are undergoing treatment at GT Hospital. Five police personnel who were a part of the investigations were also tested and their reports came negative,” said senior inspector Dayanand Bangar from Oshiwara police station. According to the police, on August 26, a paan stall owner from Lokhandwala Market approached them and filed a complaint against an unknown person. He said on July 10 and 11, a student purchased cigarettes worth ₹77,800, for which he made the payment online. The complainant said after the payment was made, he received a message stating that the amount was credited to his account. However, on visiting his bank in August, he discovered that the transaction never happened. He then approached the police, and based on his complaint, a first information report (FIR) was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged [document or electronic record) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. On probing, the police discovered that the accused allegedly used a messaging platform to send a fake bank message to the paan stall owner, which stated that the money was credited. Further inquiry revealed that four more students were involved in the case and through two messaging platforms they had cheated several shop owners. The police wrote to the messaging platforms to ascertain how many total messages have the accused sent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-students-arrested-in-cheating-cases-from-mumbai-s-andheri-area-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-7ElEgeTdesHEfraO4eOOXK.html
04-09-2020||City||Scientists write to PMO, call for ‘immediate end to large-scale lockdowns’||Scientists from several scientific and research institutes across the country have called for an immediate end to large-scale lockdowns as an ongoing Covid-19 management strategy. The letter is expected to reach the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) soon. “Continuing restrictions on public transport, which impact economic activities, are cruel for the vast majority of the people, who do not have the financial reserves to sustain themselves through an extended period of economic inactivity,” stated the letter signed by 40 professors and scientists. The letter further stated that child malnutrition, which is already an immense problem in India, will worsen significantly owing to lengthy lockdown. “While Covid-19 is an important and a new health concern, we cannot afford to ignore other health concerns for so many months,” added the letter. All the signees have also collectively welcomed the Unlock-4 guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on August 29, except for some restrictions, especially on public transport. “Public transportation, long distance as well as local trains and buses must be opened immediately, in a phased manner... opening private transportation is highly insufficient as a vast majority of Indians depend on public transportation for their livelihood,” added the letter. “Covid should be addressed as a public health concern, rather than a law and order problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scientists-write-to-pmo-call-for-immediate-end-to-large-scale-lockdowns/story-PqXScZwPPUQeK7wAL161vI.html

04-09-2020||Mumbai||Focus on non-Covid work: Mumbai civic body tells its staffers||In a bid to complete its annual civic works as well as to meet the financial targets, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has asked its employees to focus on their parent department’s duties and continue with the Covid-19 relief work alongside. The civic body wants to ensure that crucial works related to roads, solid waste management, bridges, storm water drains and other departments are not hampered. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said, “The monsoon period was expected to be a crucial time and the staff had to focus on Covid. Now the monsoon season is almost over and so the staff has been asked to prioritise work of their respective departments.” Every year, BMC takes up massive road repair and civic works across the city post-monsoon. Since the pandemic broke out, all the civic staffers were directed to focus on Covid-19 relief work. As the fifth month of the financial year ended in August, the BMC has little time left to meet its annual targets. Also, the civic body has gradually begun to close down several Covid-19 centres, as the number of daily Covid-19 declined to less than 1,000 last month. The staff working for the centres have also been redirected to focus on their designated department’s work. With around 70% Covid Care Centres (CCC) now empty, the BMC has been handing over the lodges, schools, auditoriums and hotels, which were converted as Covid-19 centres, back to their owners. Currently, Mumbai has 333 CCCs for high-risk contacts, which collectively have a bed capacity of more than 48,300. There are 176 CCCs for positive asymptomatic patients, with over 23,534 beds. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,562 Covid-19 cases, which took the city’s total count to 150,095. The city has been reporting more than 1,100 cases in the past nine days. Civic authorities had expected a surge in cases in the last week of August in the wake of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. There were also 37 deaths reported on Thursday, following which the total toll has risen to 7, 764, according to the Maharashtra health department data. As per BMC’s data, of the 37 people who died, 27 were above 60 years of age, while the other 10 were between 40 and 60 years old. The BMC data has further stated that 1, 859 patients were discharged after recovery on Thursday. A total of 120, 561 patients have been recovered in the city now and the city has reported 80% recovery rate. There are 21, 439 active Covid-19 cases in the city currently. Dharavi, India’s largest slum area, reported eight cases on Thursday, taking the total number of cases in the area to 2,800. Until Wednesday, 7.92 lakh tests had been conducted in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/focus-on-non-covid-work-bmc-tells-staff/story-DwX1hAhpFnQk1QfoIUnROM.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor gives nod: Final-year students can write their exams from home||The schedule of final-year examinations for professional and non-professional courses is likely to be declared by early next week as Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Thursday approved the state government’s plans to allow students to appear for final-year exams from home. He also approved vice-chancellors’ recommendation to seek time up to October 31 from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to complete the examination process. Koshyari also directed vice-chancellors to conduct practical examinations at the universities from mid-September. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said they are working to ensure that students can appear for practical exams from home.The vice-chancellors’ committee will submit its report on holding final-year exams to the state government on Friday. They will also be convening meetings of the Board of Examinations and Academic Council within the next two-three days to finalise exam schedule as directed by the Governor. A proposal will then be placed before the state disaster management authority, headed by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, by Tuesday for final approval.Samant said, “Allowing students to appear for exams physically will not be possible this year as there are chances of them getting infected with Covid-19. More importantly, the Governor has approved to allow students to appear from home.”He was interacting with media persons after his meeting with the Governor along with vice-chancellors of all universities in the state on Thursday. A statement issued by Raj Bhavan also stated that the Governor, in his capacity as the chancellor of universities, asked the vice-chancellors to consider conducting examinations using the best possible mechanism including multiple choice questions (MCQ), optical mark recognition (OMR) method and to think of conducting offline examinations only in exceptional cases. He also directed them to complete the entire process of examinations including declaration of results by October 31.“The Governor asked all universities to start practical examinations from September 15,” stated the release. “Students can appear for practical exams from home. We are working to ensure that they won’t have to step out of home for that as well,” Samant told reporters. He also added that the state will see that the students intending to go abroad for higher studies won’t have to face any difficulty.The Governor interacted with all vice-chancellors and reviewed their preparations. He is satisfied with the progress on the issue so far, the minister said.Considering the shortage of time available for setting question papers, Koshyari has also asked universities to coordinate with Savitribai Phule Pune University, University of Mumbai and other universities for preparing question banks, said the Raj Bhavan statement.On August 31, Samant declared that students will be allowed to appear for final-year examinations for professional and non-professional courses from home. He had also said that the exams were likely to start from first week of October and the state can seek extension up to November 10 from the UGC for completing the process.The Supreme Court had last week ruled out that students cannot be promoted without writing final-year exams and upheld a July 6 directive of UGC to hold exams by September 30. However, it has given liberty to the states to approach UGC if they wish to postpone holding the examinations beyond the September 30 deadline in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Following the apex court’s order, the state has formed a committee of vice-chancellors to suggest measures to safely complete the examinations process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-gives-nod-final-year-students-can-write-their-exams-from-home/story-TKQr4mS5iwHJsPAfnlC91M.html

04-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM was against lifting lockdown curbs in Pune hastily: Sanjay Raut’s statement indicates differences between Shiv Sena-NCP||In an indication of the differences between state’s ruling allies Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut said that Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray was against the “hasty” decision to lift the lockdown in Pune district. Raut’s statement is seen as an indirect blame on the NCP for the rise in Covid-19 cases in Pune, which is now the most-affected district in the state with more than 54,000 active cases. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and his party hold sway in the Pune region. Thackeray has been advocating a cautious approach while lifting curbs to prevent a situation which would force the government to re-impose the lockdown across the state. After restrictions were eased in June, the district and civic authorities in Pune imposed a 10-day strict lockdown from July 14 to break the chain of transmission, as the region started witnessing an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases. The city, rural areas as well as the Pimpri-Chinchwad region within the district have seen a spike in cases over the past 40-45 days and recorded 182,212 total Covid-19 cases. “Since the beginning, Uddhav saheb had maintained that more attention has to be given to [the Covid-19 situation in] Pune. CM had even opposed the hasty easing of lockdown restrictions in Pune. But now they are following the Mumbai pattern,” Raut told reporters. State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik, from the NCP, however, denied any differences between the two parties. “There is nothing like that. Decisions are not taken by an individual, but they are taken collectively as a government,” he responded to Raut. The Opposition has been targeting the state government over its alleged poor preparedness at Covid centres, built to tackle the rising number of cases. The Opposition parties have blamed the state government for the death of a Pune-based television journalist Pandurang Raikar who succumbed to the virus. Raikar’s family alleged that there were lapses from the end of the authorities in proving him timely treatment. Raut also claimed that the Covid centre in Pune, where Raikar was admitted, was recently commissioned by Ajit Pawar and it did not have complete facilities before it was open to people. He also added that the state government needs to pay attention to see if medical facilities are adequate in a city like Pune. “The Covid-19 centres constructed by the Maharashtra government are functioning properly. But as they are being built at a large-scale, some shortcomings might have remained. I saw that the Pune Covid-19 centre was built before all the facilities were ready... it is unfortunate that there was a delay in getting ambulance for Raikar. The government will have to take some measures if ambulances are not available in a city like Pune,” said Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-was-against-lifting-lockdown-curbs-in-pune-hastily-sanjay-raut-s-statement-indicates-differences-between-the-ruling-shiv-sena-and-ncp/story-3W7gz6ZTsCjCRbtqazBgmO.html

The hospitals will also depute a nodal officer or a public relations officer to act as the point of contact for the families of patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-mohali-hospitals-to-provide-health-updates-to-kin-of-covid-19-patients-twice-daily/story-spjb8pY6iVhCKr3iMTuinO.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||After letter from Mahatma Gandhi’s kin, Maharashtra govt to re-examine tree felling near Sevagram Ashram||The Maharashtra government will re-examine the feasibility of completion of a road-widening project from Wardha to Mahatma Gandhi’s Sevagram Ashram. As many as 70 trees have already been cut for the project, which requires felling of 168 trees.The decision comes after three generations of Mahatma Gandhi’s family wrote a detailed letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, requesting that the project be called off to protect the green cover.On July 27, Wardha forest range officer issued an order for the felling of 168 trees along a nine-kilometre (km) stretch from Wardha to Sevagram based on a proposal by the state public works department (PWD) for widening the road from the existing 10 metre to 14 metre. The project was proposed to ease traffic and facilitate movement of tourists to the ashram ahead of Mahatma Gandhi’s 151st birth anniversary next month on October 2.PWD minister Ashok Chavan said, “Appropriate permissions had been taken to widen the road since a large number of people go to Sevagram every year. The idea was to accommodate high footfall and traffic. Now, we will have to re-examine the matter. It is my understanding that Wardha guardian minister Sunil Kedar is also supportive of the project. However, in consultation with him and considering the sentiments expressed by citizens, we will see to it that there is a way out of this.”The letter by six members of the Gandhi family led by Bapu’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi and his (Tushar’s) daughter and environmentalist Kasturi, highlighted that some of the trees slated to be felled were much older than the ashram itself. “We, the descendants of Kasturba and Mohandas Gandhi, write to you with folded hands to kindly use your good offices to order the stopping of tree felling on the road from Wardha to Sevagram,” the letter read adding, “These trees bore witness as history was made on a daily basis at Sevagram during the years running up to our freedom, unfortunately we have lost many of these historic heritage trees already, our plea to you is please no more.” Mahatma Gandhi had been invited to Wardha in 1934 by industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj. The ashram had been set up in village Segaon, which was later named Sevagram, based on Gandhi’s directions in 1936. “These particular trees were planted with a purpose that they would provide shade and shelter for visitors who arrived at Wardha and made the five mile trip to Sevagram by foot,” the letter read.Speaking to HT, Tushar said these trees were the only source of shelter when Bapu’s followers would walk miles to visit him at the ashram, and that on April 30, 1936, Gandhi and his followers walked to Sevagram in summer heat taking shelter at bamboo huts and Guava trees. “The state’s proposal to cut trees is an unnecessary requirement to increase tourism in the district. This is the first time that three generations of the family came together to appeal against this environmental disaster. Both my aunt and my father had spent many years with Bapu at Sevagram when these barren patches were converted into green zones by planting trees between 1932 and 1934. At the time, Wardha was in the water scarcity area, and all the children were actually given one paisa each to take responsibility for carrying water to each planted tree to ensure they survive,” said Gandhi.He added that some places need to be left in their pristine condition. “That itself is the charm. However, there is a lack of vision. On one hand, Wardha has been declared a ‘no industry zone’ due its ecological fragility that has led to a lot of discontent among the youth due to lack of employment. On the other, trees are being mercilessly hacked for widening of a road. It is absolutely illogical,” said Gandhi. Meanwhile, the district administration said they had held a public consultation and there was no opposition following the order. However, after 70 trees were felled by PWD, large protests by local citizens and environmental groups halted further tree felling since the second week of August. “The matter is seized with the government. We have had two meetings with the guardian minister on this issue and discussed the possibility of saving maximum trees. Altering the alignment by a few metres can help save many trees. We have informed the PWD about this, and they are examining it. We are awaiting their feasibility report. Till then no trees would be felled,” said Vivek Bhimanwar, district collector, Wardha.Three villages were involved in the public consultation and issuing of no-objection certificates (NOC), said Tushar. “While local authorities convinced the sarpanch of Sevagram village to give NOC, later the deputy sarpanch and gram sabha wrote to the collector objecting to it saying not all members were consulted. Remaining two villages refused to issue NOC,” said he adding that tree consultants appointed by PWD have also advised against cutting these trees.Apart from the 168 trees for the section till the ashram, another 100 trees are proposed to be felled for the entire Wardha-Samudrapur Road, a PWD official said.District guardian minister Sunil Kedar and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray did not comment on the matter.EXCERPTS FROM THE LETTER Mahatma Gandhi’s descendants include his granddaughter and former Member of Parliament in South Africa, Ela Gandhi; grandsons Rajmohan Gandhi (historian) and Arun Gandhi (socio-political activist based in the United States of America), and Gopal Krishna Gandhi, former governor of West Bengal. The letter was led by Bapu’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi and his (Tushar’s) daughter Kasturi.Following are messages from each one of them:Ela Gandhi: I am deeply concerned about environmental issues and particularly now when we, throughout the world, are facing the Covid-19 pandemic which has brought into sharp focus the need to conserve both our environment and water. Trees are a source of water and it is important to do everything in our power to conserve as many trees as we can.Arun Gandhi: When Bapu acquired the land from Jamnalalji it was not only barren but was almost a desert. It was the toil of the people who lived in the ashram under Bapuji’s supervision that Sevagram became verdant and a testament to preservation of the environment and ecology. Today the world is suffering the effects of years of abuse of the environment and ecology. Future generations will curse us for destroying their future by wanton abuse of the environment and ecology.Rajmohan Gandhi: I fully support Tushar Gandhi’s efforts to protect the trees that form a precious part of that sacred environment in and around Wardha from where Mahatma Gandhi strengthened the momentum for India’s freedom.Gopalkrishna Gandhi: On learning from Tushar Gandhi that hundreds of trees are to be felled on the road to Wardha, ostensibly to widen the paths to facilitate tourists to Sevagram, I am reminded of Gandhiji’s clear and uncompromising code about not harming trees ‘in the least’. When such was the priority he accorded to trees in the height of a major public struggle, we can well imagine what his reaction would be to the information that trees are to be felled to facilitate travel to Sevagram.Kasturi Gandhi: In the case of Wardha, and the larger issue of the expansion of the state highway, the total opposite has happened — where there was a need to increase green cover, there has been mindless hacking of historically and geographically significant trees; there is no damage mitigation plan for forest areas and tiger habitats that the project passes through; and no intention has been expressed to remedy the destruction that is being wrecked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-letter-from-gandhi-s-kin-maharashtra-govt-to-re-examine-tree-felling-near-sevagram-ashram/story-pXVlG5w6cYAKcSm6mIXctN.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||Don’t hide Covid symptoms: 31% die in 24 hrs of admission, reveals Mumbai civic corporation data||Months after the Covid outbreak in the city, the fatality rate stands at 5.1%. Reason? According to the death audit committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), delay in hospitalisation is to blame as 31% of the deaths take place within 24 hours of admission. Last week, the death audit committee concluded the third analysis of 5,200 deaths in the city. Of them, 1,615 died within 24 hours, while 59% died within four days of hospitalisation. In Mumbai, since March, 148,569 people have been infected with Covid-19. Of them, 7,724 have succumbed till September 2. The city’s fatality rate is higher than the state, which stands at 3%. To reduce the fatality rate, the death audit committee has recommended earlier admission of suspected and confirmed patients, especially those with comorbidities and aged above 50 years. “There are two sets of people. First, who avoid symptoms considering it as a general seasonal flu and take medicines over the counter, which deteriorates their condition. Second are those who despite having underlying health issues try to hide the infection which delays the hospitalisation,” said Dr Avinash Supe, in-charge of the death audit committee. When HT spoke to health volunteers, they complained that often people hide information about their symptoms during inspection. Fearing quarantine, people also take fever-reducing medicines. “When we try to do door-to-door inspections, especially in buildings with infected patients, people even refuse to come out for thermal scanning. If they have aged people, they don’t even tell us. Then we have to check the voters’ list to find them,” said a health volunteer from R-North ward that covers Dahisar. Dr Supe laid emphasis on people’s cooperation. However, the death rate varies from ward to ward. For instance, L ward covering Kurla (west), Andheri Sakinaka and Powai has the highest mortality rate of 7.44%, followed by 7.37% at B ward (Dongri, Masjid Bunder), 7.21% at H (East) ward (Bandra, Khar and Santacruz) and 7% at M (West) ward (Chembur). G-South (Worli and Prabhadevi), F-North ward (Sion, Matunga, Wadala and Dadar-east), M (East) ward covering Chembur east, K (East) ward covering Marol and Andheri East, G (North) covering Dadar, Dharavi and Mahim, Parel, have all registered death rates ranging between 6-6.7%. R-Central (Borivli) and T (Mulund) wards have recorded 3% and 2.7% fatality rate, respectively. BMC has come up with three steps to control the fatality rate in Mumbai— timely admission, intensive supportive therapy and oxygenation. The civic body has instructed hospitals to take note of the onset of symptoms among patients, date of the test conducted and time taken for admission. “Patient-wise data is being collected for analysis of the death audit committee. We check if the patient was refused admission by other hospitals, or there was a delay in detection of the virus. This data is maintained ward-wise, which also helps us understand why certain wards report higher fatality rates,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. City doctors on Covid-19 duties also highlighted that often unavailability of essential drugs such as Tocilizumab and Remdesivir delays the treatment of patients. “Although the situation is better now in comparison to July, patients’ families are still struggling to arrange for life-saving drugs. This often takes away a lot of time,” said an epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-hide-covid-19-symptoms-31-die-in-24-hours-of-admission-reveals-mumbai-civic-corporation-data/story-t1hW3FK4q3Mt6HPznGPxpM.html

The five departments are solid waste management, insecticide, water, community health volunteers, and contractual employees carrying out routine maintenance work of roads or storm water drains. If these personnel come across any residents with Covid-19 symptoms, or senior citizens with comorbidity, they will report the house number to their supervisors, who will, in turn, inform BMC health officials.The BMC control room will then get in touch with these residents for more details, or to shift them to quarantine centres or offer medical help if needed. Currently, such door-to-door surveys are carried out by ward level staff and community health workers. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, who is in-charge of the health department, said, “I am examining how staff from these departments can be activated to carry out surveys. All they have to do is ask a resident – “Are you feeling okay?” or ‘Is anyone unwell in your home?” It can be a civic employee who regularly visits a locality, or lives in a nearby locality. This exercise will take time, as we will work out the logistics, and also train these employees. It is not necessary that each employee will have access to homes, so it will be a herculean task.” BMC will soon start training the staff. Senior citizens will be the first target group for such surveys, who are at a greater risk for a delay in detecting or reporting Covid-19. According to BMC’s Covid war room dashboard, the civic body has so far screened 17,405,181 citizens, of which 926,982 were senior citizens. Of these, 3,119 senior citizens were found with low oxygen saturation and were given medical help. This is part of the long-term plan to handle the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai, especially when non-Covid work will also take priority and civic staff from all non-health departments may not be able to focus on relief work. In the long run, staff from these departments will help in disaster relief. “A person who visits housing societies everyday to collect garbage, or do repair work can help BMC identify dilapidated building, or point out other hazards in a structure and report back,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/staffers-of-mumbai-civic-corporation-s-five-departments-to-keep-a-tab-on-citizens-health-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-55aVQlWXcZwmmbk8huyZnN.html

The petition against the varsity’s move was filed by Nikhil Thamman, a fifth-year student of UILS. “The notice has been issued for October 5. However, court refused to stay the impugned order,” university’s counsel Vijaypal said. The petitioner had challenged the August 8 order of UILS wide which students were told to pay full fee for the August-December semester. Students were told to deposit advance payment of Rs 51,000 and other charges by August 31. “This has been done even as fee deposited for the February-May semester was not utilised as after March 15, no classes were held,” the court was told, adding that the varsity be asked to adjust this fees towards the next semester.FINAL EXAMS OF LAST SEMESTER FROM SEPT 17Chandigarh PU has decided to conduct the final exams of the last semester of various courses from September 17. “Students will download the question paper, fill up the answers and submit the scanned copy of the answer sheet,” sources said.

04-09-2020||Mumbai||80% FYJC seats in SEBC, EWS quotas in Mumbai Metropolitan Region vacant||Over 80% of the seats reserved for socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are likely to go vacant this year in the first round of general admissions to first year junior colleges (FYJC). Seats that remain vacant can only be surrendered after the third round of general admissions. According to the education department, against 17,844 seats reserved for SEBC students in MMR this year, only 2923 (16%) students have applied for admission. For 14,688 seats reserved for students from economically weaker sections (EWS), only 168 (1%) have applied. In 2019, 30% and 6% seats were claimed from SEBC and EWS quotas respectively. In 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) allowed 12% reservation in education under the SEBC category. Earlier that year, the Centre had announced a 10% reservation in education and jobs under the EWS quota for those with annual incomes of less than Rs 8 lakh. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state education department has again allowed students to seek provisional admissions under these quotas and submit original documents at a later date. City principals said few had applied through the two quotas. “Some students still mark EWS as a category while filling forms but when they actually proceed for admissions, we realise they have marked it by mistake,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund. This year, students must also submit a non-creamy layer certificate in addition to the SEBC certificate for admission under the quota. However, the education department has not received any queries about the certificate. “It seems like the numbers are small because many students from the category might have filled their forms from the general category, fearing they might not get the necessary certificates. The government has, however, given students additional time to produce documents,” said Rajendra Ahire, deputy director, Mumbai region. The education department extended the deadline for confirming admissions under the first round of admission to 5pm today. The second round of admissions would begin on September 5 and the second merit list would be declared on September 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/80-fyjc-seats-in-sebc-ews-quotas-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-vacant/story-cYiBuLgQK9C8I1h0TSB6qO.html

Pandav will replace Deepak Apte whose term ended on July 31. However, Apte was appointed as interim director till the latest announcement was made.With 30 years of experience, Pandav is involved in teaching herpetology, mangrove and wetland ecology to post-graduate students and is a wildlife management specialist. His efforts contributed to the discovery of sea turtle mass-nesting along Odisha beaches as early as 1994.Pandav was appointed by an interview panel consisting of BNHS office-bearers under the governing council (GC) president Bittu Sahgal and external panel of wildlife biologists. “We are happy to get a dynamic and outstanding scientist on board who will be able to strengthen BNHS’s research and conservation activities both in the corridors of power and on ground,” said Debi Goenka, secretary, BNHS.Some governing council members said they were surprised with the decision. “Some of us were not aware of who the current BNHS office-bearers were. We were surprised that a new director was appointed immediately after the lockdown. There was a notice for the new director’s post on the website but we were informed that it was only procedural,” a lifetime member said.Pandav will take charge on January 1, 2021. Till then naturalist and GC member Isaac Kehimkar would be the interim director. “It is appalling for an organisation where an elected GC member is made an interim director with executive powers,” said another member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-based-conservation-group-appoints-wii-professor-as-director/story-viDWwBqWAlTdJECXZwNdGI.html

Stating that the Chinese are surreptitiously encircling the Indian subcontinent from all directions, he said the Central government needs to keep a close watch on affairs of neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal.In the wake of the recent Indo-China border dispute, the former defence minister had invited Bhushan Gokhale, former Air Marshal of the Indian Air Force; Vijay Gokhale, former foreign secretary; and an expert on Indo-China relations to discuss the issue in detail on Thursday.After expressing his experiences of his visits to China in the early 90s as the then defence minister, Pawar said he is concerned over a larger strategic and political thinking of China that aims to halt economic growth in India.“I highlighted the fact that the Chinese are surreptitiously encircling the Indian Sub-Continent from all directions and also expressed my concern over their presence in the South China Sea,” the NCP chief said in a series of tweets. “I hinted at the need to keep a close watch on affairs of Sri Lanka and Nepal and also the Chinese interventions in general,” he added.Air Marshal Bhushan Gokhale emphasised that the country must ponder over the new era of parallel warfare that include cyber, information, perception creations and the war on economic fronts. Gokhale also explained the history of Indo-China relationship, especially the border disputes, and shared his views on the current face-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and skirmishes on the border in the past few months.NCP Members of Parliament Praful Patel, Supriya Sule, Vandana Chavan and Dr Amol Kolhe were also present in the meeting.Earlier in June during his interaction with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, Pawar had pointed out that the high ground occupied by the Chinese army in Galwan Valley in East Ladakh may force closure of Darbuk–Shyok-DBO Road on the Indian side which may prove catastrophic to military operations of the Indian defence forces near LAC.He had suggested that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) must be evacuated by holding compulsory measures and also advised the Central government to strategise things using diplomatic channels to diffuse tension on the border and to make China see reason.Pawar was one of the leaders invited by the PM to discuss the issue following aggression and intrusion by the Chinese army at Galwan Valley.Explaining the significance of Darbuk–Shyok-DBO Road, he said that the road connecting Darbuk to DBO is entirely on the Indian side of LAC. It is crucial for India, as DBO is an advanced landing ground and provides an airfield for the Air Force to quickly respond to any emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/china-encircling-india-from-all-sides-govt-must-kee-close-watch-sharad-pawar/story-b6MAb3SJQ5UHceJ3CymX1L.html

The 12 crew members on board ‘Abraham’ – the vessel, were unharmed in the collision but the boat’s bow broke.The fishing boat, owned by Dennis Francis Munis of Uttan, had left from Uttan on August 28. The crew had caught a good quantity of fish and was set to return soon. On August 31, the boat dropped anchor, and most of the crew went to sleep, while two members were on night vigil. Around 1am, an unidentified cargo ship collided with the trawler and no horns were blown by the ship as a warning, said Bernard D’mello, a fisherman from Dongri-Chowk village in Uttan, who was alerted by the pilot of the trawler.“We immediately alerted nearby trawlers, and they reached out to the boat which had a damaged bow. Water was into the vessel and it was tilting to one side,” said D’mello.The boat was towed back to Uttan on September 1 evening, and the owner has suffered nearly ₹4 lakh in damages, said D’mello. The Dongri-Chowk Fishermen’s Sarvodaya Sahkari Society, Uttan, have written to the state fisheries department for ₹4 lakh as compensation for the damages suffered.The owner of the vessel approached the Uttan police station to file a complaint and was directed to Yellow Gate police station. “We received a complaint from the owner and we have directed him to complain to Yellow Gate police station as all incidents beyond 12 nautical miles come under their purview,” said assistant inspector Satish Nikam of Uttan police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cargo-ship-travelling-from-gujarat-towards-jnpt-collides-with-anchored-uttan-trawler-12-crew-members-safe/story-E8O5by01tS3iOxIStDrfgK.html

Police have seized a total of ₹18 lakh worth items, including the cargo vehicle and a car used in the crime. The incident took place on August 12 when the truck was heading from a Bhiwandi warehouse to a supermarket in Pune. At night, the truck driver parked the vehicle at Diva Junction in Navi Mumbai and went home to rest. Three accused, Champalal Chaudhari, 30; Prakash Chaudhari, 20, and Nasim Pathan, 20, arrived at the junction in a car, looking for trucks to steal. Champalal, who used to run a rationing shop previously, and was also previously arrested in a forged currency case, hatched the plan with another accomplice, currently at large.“The men had planned to steal trucks randomly. Pathan, a keymaker, made a duplicate key for the truck and drove off with the vehicle. They unloaded half of the goods at Champalal’s Borivli house, while the rest was stored in Ghatkopar at the house of the fourth arrested accused Naresh Bhanusali, 37,” said Sagar Gawsane, assistant inspector at Rabale MIDC police station. According to police, Bhanusali, then rented a godown in Ghatkopar and sold the stolen goods at a discounted rate. Officers said the men were allegedly looking for any loaded trucks in-transit which may have goods in them. After emptying the stolen goods, the men dumped the truck worth ₹10 lakh, at a creek in Navi Mumbai, from where it was eventually recovered. During the probe, police recovered ₹3 lakh worth stolen goods stored at Borivli. They also seized the car that the men used to arrive at the crime scene. Based on CCTV footage, police managed to identify the car in which the men had arrived at the spot. Police trace the men and they were arrested on August 23. Officers said Pathan has a case of theft against him in the past. During interrogation, Champalal also allegedly confessed to stealing a mini-van from Kasturba Marg, Borivli (East). Police said they are in the process of verifying the details with their counterparts from there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-arrested-for-stealing-truck-with-6-lakh-groceries-from-navi-mumbai/story-Yu8mN5zT5hV9mhzT1QZMNL.html

The pilot project will begin from the Vakola nullah in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), and the entire project will be completed in 18 months.Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who was present at the event on Thursday morning, tweeted, “This morning, we launched 2 projects of the @MMRDAOfficial to improve the water quality of the Mithi river:• Bioremediation & Phytoremediation by bioengineering components• Partnership betn MMRDA & UNTIL to clean the marine debris floating in the mithi (sic).”Officials said that MMRDA will also be collaborating with the University of Mumbai to improve the water quality of Mithi.RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “A process of bioremediation and phytoremediation will be used to improve the water quality. We will also share the technology with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) during the project.”Saurabh Gupta, founder Earth 5R, one of the organisations involved in the partnership to clear the floating materials in Mithi said, “The project has two components. One is where we conduct training programmes for citizens on waste-management and the second is where we look at reducing waste from the river.”The 17.84-km Mithi river falls under the jurisdiction of both, BMC and MMRDA. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had conducted a water quality assessment of eight major state rivers in 2018, which was published in the Maharashtra Economic Survey Report 2018-19. It stated that Mithi river was Maharashtra’s most polluted river and contained human and animal excreta almost 15 times the safe limit. The 2005 floods that killed more than 1,000 people in the city was caused mainly because the river was clogged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-mithi-river-clean-up-gets-boost-as-mmrda-ties-up-with-green-group/story-4emFkoHy8b00LZrIQWOtOL.html
04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab carpenter’s wooden cycles create a buzz||Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the clarion call for Atmanirbhar Bharat, 40-year-old Zirapkpur-based carpenter Dhani Ram Saggu set an example for his peers by designing and building a wooden cycle amid the lockdown.Saggu was among those rendered jobless after the lockdown was imposed in March. However, he says rather than give in to depression he used the time to work on his idea and innovate.For Saggu necessity was the mother of invention, he says, “I always wanted a cycle but our finances were such that we could not afford one. Therefore, I decided to make one for myself.” He sold eight cycles between July 27 to August 30 and five more are in the works.Saggu’s wooden cycles have created a buzz and he has received orders from as far as South Africa, Canada, Jalandhar and Delhi. “Hard work always pays and changes one’s fortune,” say Saggu, who was stoked to receive a call from Hero Cycles managing director Pankaj Munjal congratulating him. A company from Chennai has also gotten in touch with him and he is, at present, preparing samples to show them.TRIAL AND ERROR Saggu started off by measuring a regular cycle. He prepared drawings and then carved one cycle using plywood but the cycle was heavy as its wheels, too, were made of plywood.He then sought feedback from cycling enthusiast Rakesh Singh, an administrative officer at PGIMER, who became one of his first customers, and improvised the cycle.The improvised cycle had regular tyres, a mud guard, re-designed handlebar and a basket in front. He made his second cycle with the help of kail wood from Canada , which he got from a neighbour. “The wood is light and inexpensive but strong like teak. However, I am still improvising the cycle,” says Saggu, who has now rented a workspace over a showroom with orders steadily pouring in. He is also in talks with suppliers from Ludhiana for better brakes, saddles.NOVELTY PRODUCT “The cycle weighs between 20-22kgs but I am working on making it lighter. I now use disc brakes rather than rim and am working towards putting in gears as well. I am also designing a cycle for children,” said Saggu.“The cycle can cover up to 25km a day but people are mostly buying it for its uniqueness,” added Dhani Ram.These customised cycles are being sold under the name ‘Noora Interiors,’ the same name under which Saggu picks up woodwork for palatial houses and takes orders for doors, windows and cupboards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-carpenter-s-wooden-cycles-create-a-buzz/story-CEDprgaX4lOyodBO2a8XZM.html

Vilatra was arrested late on Wednesday night and produced before a metropolitan magistrate’s court on Thursday. He has been remanded in NCB’s custody till September 9. NCB recovered ₹9.55 lakh, as well as some foreign currency, including USD 2,081. The agency said Vilatra has stated the seized amounts were sale proceeds from the marijuana he had supplied to many persons. In its application before the court, NCB said Vilatra “has revealed so many names with whom he was dealing in drugs” and for that purpose, his custody was needed. The application seeking Vilatra’s custody further says that through this investigation into “the drug angle in Sushant Singh Rajput’s case”, NCB hopes to “uproot [the] drug citadel in Mumbai especially in Bollywood”. Vilatra was arrested on the basis of information NCB got from Bandra resident Abbas Ali Lakhani, 21, who was arrested on August 28 with 46 grams of ganja; and Lakhani’s alleged supplier, Karn Arora, who was arrested in Powai with 13 grams of ganja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-ncb-arrests-bandra-resident-zaid-vilatra-on-drug-charges/story-eXpPTDJK56T2Ue4g8AVItM.html
04-09-2020||Chandigarh||Speeding caused 95% of all road fatalities in Chandigarh in 2019||Speeding was the cause of 95% of all fatal road accidents reported in Chandigarh in 2019. Not only this, the city recorded the highest percentage share of speeding-related fatalities among all states and Union Territories in the countryAs per the Accidental Deaths and Suicides Report in India 2019 released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) this week, out of a total 104 fatalities caused in road accidents, 99 were caused by speeding alone, while five were caused by dangerous or careless driving and overtaking. Nationally, speeding caused 59.6% of all road accident deaths; among UTs, the figure stood at 42%.Road-safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “Chandigarh has wider and better roads in comparison to many cities, which is why speeding is such a menace here. Rather than widening, road infrastructure should be focussed on building traffic-calming devices and speed tables. Roads can even be narrowed down in some places to prevent speeding.”Meanwhile, the traffic police have said that checking speeding is their priority and they are using technology to counter it. Officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manoj Kumar Meena said, “Driver feedback systems were installed on six roads in December last year, which have been effective in changing people’s driving habits. These six patches have not reported a single fatal accident since.”Issuing of e-challans using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems has also begun. Mounted on tripods, these machines are equipped with cameras and sensors to measure the speed of the vehicles and click a picture of those crossing the speed limit. The device can also be used at night and is portable.“The machines eliminate the need to speak to drivers or stop them. Total 15,537 e-challans have been issued since May,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Traffic) Kewal Krishan. In just four months, more challans for speeding have been issued than those collectively issued in 2016, 2017 and 2018.Kamal Soi, who is a member of National Road Safety Council, said, “Even if challans are being issued by cameras, the fear of being caught is witnessed only when traffic cops are posted on roads, which helps bring speeding down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/speeding-caused-95-of-all-road-fatalities-in-chandigarh-in-2019/story-AXXC9SmtolKqr0fIMML2VJ.html

The larvae of the dengue mosquito have recently been found at various places in the district, he said, adding in addition to curbing the spread of coronavirus, the health department had been going door-to-door to check the presence of larvae and sensitise people about the disease.The civil surgeon said that people should clean coolers, flowerpots, fridgeback trays, water tanks and other containers that can be potential breeding sites for mosquitoes. District epidemiologist Dr Renu Singh said dengue fever is a treatable disease and if symptoms appear, the nearest health facility should be visited or the helpline number 104 may be contacted for medical guidance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/urgent-need-for-protection-from-dengue-mohali-civil-surgeon/story-g5YaRJ8kz6xyBF4qZP6VaI.html

Indrajit reached the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guesthouse at 10.20am and was questioned till 5pm. CBI is also exploring any possible links between the deaths of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and celebrity manager Disha Salian’s death. The agency questioned Bunty Sajdeh, chief executive officer of Cornerstone company, where Salian worked for approximately three hours. CBI also questioned Niraj Singh and Keshav Bachner, who were employed as Rajput’s domestic staff, and Siddharth Pithani, who was Rajput’s friend and flatmate. The agency’s teams have been in Mumbai since August 20 and have collected evidence from Mumbai Police, which had registered a case of accidental death after Rajput was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14.

We have zeroed in on locations that have a high footfall, where there will be a demand for cycles,” said Sharma.The cycles will be made available at the Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT), Sector 43; Sukhna Lake, Sector 17; Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16; Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Sector 12; Sector-22 mobile market; Panjab University, Sector 14; and the Sector-34 market.“Dock stations that are being installed for the PBS project have been chosen for the project,” said Sharma. The firm implementing the PBS project will also provide 100 cycles for the IndiaCycles4Change challenge. The firm will be allowed to charge rent for the cycles but it has not been permitted to advertise at the dock stations.Chandigarh is one of the 95 cities to have registered for the India Cycles4Change challenge, an initiative of the Smart Cities Mission. The challenge aims to encourage cities to implement cycling-friendly initiatives in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.600 CYCLES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AT 60 DOCK STATIONS COME NOVEMBER Under the PBS project, 600 cycles will be made available at 60 dock stations across the city. The project is expected to be completed by June 2021, after which 5,000 cycles will be rented out at an hourly basis at 617 dock stations. The firm implementing the project on CSCL’s behalf will execute it in multiple phases over the course of the next 18 months.

Environment activists, while welcoming the decision, reiterated that the Metro Bhavan and car shed must not be a part of Aarey. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is looking at constructing a ground-plus-27 floor Metro Bhavan, a command and control centre on 2.03 hectares in Aarey. The state had invited suggestions and objections, on the change in land-use from no-development zone to ‘Metro Bhavan and Metro Rail allied users’, in August 2019. Following which, it had received 2,563 objections on the notification. AB Patil, deputy director, town planning said, “We had conducted the hearings online recently. The report will soon be sent to the state government.” On Wednesday, the state used sections under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, to notify 600 acres near the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) as a reserve forest. Milind Mhaiskar, principal secretary, revenue and forests said, “The 600 acres has been drawn in such a way that it does not include the planned infrastructure projects or any other structures. The adivasis who need to be rehabilitated will be compensated accordingly.” As per estimates, there are close to 2,000 tribal families in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and around 25,000 families in Aarey. For Metro-3, the state is said to be looking at options in Pahadi Goregaon but there has been no decision on it yet. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray stalled the car-shed project in November 2019. Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti, said, “It is a welcome decision as Aarey was not recognised as a forest in the past seven years. With regards to Metro Bhavan, it is a building which can be constructed in any part of the city. They do not need to enter Aarey.” Zoru Bhathena, another environment activist from the Aarey Conservation group, said, “If the state is positively looking at shifting Metro-3 car shed from Aarey, it does not make sense to build a Metro Bhavan in Aarey. We will continue to fight to protect every parcel in Aarey.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aarey-colony-land-use-maharashtra-government-s-stance-on-metro-bhavan-car-shed-unclear/story-dh9DjAE0fZpimwQaHN18SM.html

04-09-2020||City||Delhi Riots: Bail plea of murder accused dismissed||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail application of a murder accused in the north-east Delhi riots, stating that the offence was very grave, where one innocent person was brutally murdered just because he belonged to a different community.From the evidence of a number of witnesses recorded in the matter, the judge said, “It is prima facie apparent that the ‘riotous mob’ armed with ‘weapons’ had abducted the victim, Suleman, to murder him merely because he was from a different community”.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, who rejected the bail application of one Hemant Pratap Singh @ Himanshu, said the post-mortem report of Suleman showed he bore as many as 11 injuries, out of which as many as seven were so grave that they were independently and collectively sufficient to cause the death of any person. This, the judge said, speaks volumes about the intensity of the “dastardly act committed by the mob”.Singh was arrested for the kidnapping and the murder of 45-year-old Suleman, who was killed near Prem Vihar puliya in Karawal Nagar and his body was thrown into a drain.According to the prosecution, investigations showed that 30-40 persons confronted Sanobar, Sunil Kumar and Suleman on February 26 morning near Shree Ram Chowk with sticks and rods in their hands.Kumar was forced to leave from the spot even though he said that he would not leave his friends, while Sanobar and Suleman were brutally assaulted, the prosecution said.The judge said Sanobar and Sunil had identified the accused.Singh, through his counsel, argued that he was falsely implicated and all the witnesses were “planted”.Communal riots in north-east Delhi in February led to the deaths of 53 people and left more than 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-bail-plea-of-murder-accused-dismissed/story-XG5zpkVC2vP12N9CGlM5LM.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Borrow money, compensate states, Manish Sisodia writes to FM Nirmala Sitharaman||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to consider that the Centre borrow money and compensate states to meet Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall, instead of asking states to do so.A senior government official said Sisodia wrote the letter on Tuesday, hours after he attended a meeting through video conference facility with his contemporaries in several non-BJP ruled states — including Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal and Kerala — to discuss alternatives to the two borrowing options presented to states by the Union finance ministry on August 27.On August 27, at the 41st meeting of the GST Council, the Union finance ministry offered states two options to plug a shortfall in their revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the financial year that ends in March 2021.In the first option, states can borrow ₹97,000 crore at reasonable interest rates from a special window that will be opened in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Both the principal and the interest payments under this option will come from cess collections.Under the second option, the states can borrow the entire ₹2.35 lakh crore, but will have to bear the interest cost. The Centre has defined losses arising from the implementation of GST at ₹97,000 crore and the balance as losses arising from an “Act of God” (referring to Covid-19).In the letter, which HT has seen, Sisodia said the Delhi government cannot accept any of the two options. “Delhi on its part is therefore not in a position to accept either of the two options… The GST Council may authorise the government of India to borrow on its behalf and also consider to extend the levy of cess for meeting the repayment obligation of both interest and repayment (principal amount) beyond 2022. Earlier that day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to consider a “viable” alternative to the two borrowing options provided to the states by the Union government on August 27 to meet the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) revenue shortfall, which, according to the CM, would “put an extremely onerous burden on the states”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/borrow-money-compensate-states-sisodia-writes-to-fm/story-d5fUOk8IdixLJhCEpiCEIK.html

The CM said that this shift of hotspots from Mumbai-Thane belt to western Maharashtra was worrisome. Mumbai, Thane, and Pune region have 97,397 active cases, while the remaining 108,031 active cases are from the rest of state.“The high rate of transmission of Covid-19 in western Maharashtra is worrisome. The shift of focus of the coronavirus from Mumbai-Thane belt to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur adds to the responsibility,” he said in a statement. The three districts contributed 1,983 new infections on Thursday, with Satara district clocking 670 new cases, 486 in Kolhapur district and 845 cases in Sangli district. The three districts collectively added 79 fatalities on Thursday.Thackeray, in a statement, said that the government was commencing a statewide health check-up of people. This campaign, officials say, does not involve tests, but a door-to-door inquiry to check people if they have any symptoms, note down co-morbidities, movement of family members from or to any hotspot, etc.The state would engage accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers, its group leaders, district medical officers, and civic employees for the survey where they would be asked about any symptoms, if any member of their family or relative has travelled and come back home, if they follow measures such as social distancing, use mask and sanitisers, etc.The CM said that the challenge before the administration is more, as unlike other countries, the country has several festivals and monsoon-related ailments, which add to the stress on the administration and medical infrastructure. “Muharram and Ganeshotsav were celebrated in the last few days. Now, Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali will come. Therefore, our challenge becomes greater. This is a testing period,” Thackeray told collectors and civic officials during the review meeting.The chief minister directed district officials to follow the laid down protocol, including tracing maximum contracts of a Covid positive patient, strict implementation of rules inside containment zones, etc. “No matter how many facilities are created, but in the end, if attention is paid to key points of the protocol, then results will show in 15 days. These protocols include tracing maximum contracts of a patient, diligent implementation of the ‘Chase The Virus’ campaign, increasing number of testing, door-to-door survey, etc.”Meanwhile, Pune city continued to clock a high number of cases with 1,873 new infections, taking the tally to 106,428.

04-09-2020||Delhi||Three RTO officials suspended over irregularities in issuance of driving licences||The Delhi government has suspended three motor licensing officers (MLOs) for “irregularities” in the issuance of driving licences, transport officials said Thursday. The action came after the state transport department found an “abnormal rise” in the issuance of driving licences from the regional transport offices (RTOs) in New Delhi (IP depot), Vasant Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. The MLOs of these three RTOs were suspended on Wednesday by chief secretary Vijay Dev. HT has seen a copy of the three suspension orders.“We conducted inspections at all 10 RTOs in Delhi after receiving a few complaints, one of which was taken cognisance of by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). It was found that these three RTOs, which in pre-Covid times used to issue the lowest number of driving licences, among all the zonal offices, suddenly showed a spike during the unlock period which began from June 8,” special commissioner (transport) KK Dahiya said. Apart from colluding with touts, it was found that over 1,000 driving licences were issued from these RTOs over the past two months without conducting the mandatory video recording of the driving test given by applicants, the transport department said. These three RTOs are among the five RTOs in Delhi which do not have an automated test track for applicants seeking a permanent driving licence. RTOs in Sarai Kale Khan, Burari, Mayur Vihar, Wazirpur and Vishwas Nagar have automated test tracks, which make the entire process more comprehensive and stringent as it reduces manual intervention. Dahiya said the remaining five RTOs will have automated test tracks by the end of the year and no manual driving tests shall be allowed thereafter. He further stated that prima facie, the investigation also shows that the SARATHI software, developed and maintained by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), could have been tampered with by certain “lower rung officials”. The Delhi government has now also written to the NIC director general, seeking a vigilance inquiry into the matter. “It has come to our notice that there were some gaps in the SARATHI software and there is a likelihood that the shortcomings in the software were shared with touts and applications of other zones were entertained at these places without any pin code restrictions… You are, therefore, requested to order a vigilance inquiry to ascertain whether the lapses in the software were genuine errors or the result of tampering by any of the NIC developers. Accountability should be fixed for this major lapse in the system,” read the letter sent to NIC by the state transport department. The government has also urged the NIC to “replace” all NIC officials at its RTOs with new staffers in order to rule out the possibility of “connivance of any official at any level” and also to facilitate a fair inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-rto-officials-suspended-over-irregularities-in-issuance-of-driving-licences/story-PCBXLZT4FgLQoFsUtu3nBN.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt notifies Metro SOP||The Delhi government on Thursday issued orders to commence Metro operations in the city and notified the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the Central government and the Delhi Metro rail corporation (DMRC). The order was issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev after transport minister Kailash Gahlot held a review meeting with DMRC officials, including its chief Mangu Singh on how train services will be resumed. “The DMRC today presented its SOP before the Delhi government. I directed the corporation to carry out an extensive campaign where people are informed about the new norms of the Metro. The DMRC MD informed the government that some of the stations may be skipped if sufficient passengers are not likely to use them. Decision on which station will be skipped will depend on the number of people waiting there. It will have to be communicated by the operations control centre (OCC) from time to time,” Gahlot said after the meeting. The DMRC’s SOP, seen by HT, also stated that stopping time of trains at each station will be increased so that passengers have sufficient time to board and alight. “Train doors shall remain open at terminal stations to let fresh air infuse in the train… Even penalties on violation of any norm under the Delhi Metro rules will be taken only through digital payment methods… Validity of all parking passes will be extended as parking will remain operational at stations which have such facility… Alcohol based sanitiser cans provided at stations will be kept at 2-3 well ventilated locations/rooms equipped with fire detection and suppression system,” the Delhi Metro’s SOP read. It further said DMRC officials shall be deputed at every station initially for two weeks to monitor that social distancing is strictly observed by the commuters, all of them wear masks and that all things are being run in order with cleanliness being maintained. “After two weeks, the concerned station manager will continue the monitoring. Train operators will monitor crowd inside trains through CCTV for ensuring social distancing,” the document read. CCTV CAMERAS AND GPS IN ALL BUSES BY NOVEMBER Gahlot also said that the Delhi government will install CCTV cameras and GPS trackers in 5,500 of its Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses by November this year. “We are trying to bring our focus on petty and unnoticed crimes faced by women commuters in the buses. Today, I have personally inspected the working of the Command & Control Centre and I am glad that even the smallest incident of any crime can be captured and recorded. The presence of our Bus Marshals, have already reduced crimes in buses. Now, with this initiative, we are confident that commuters in Delhi can confidently use public transport any time of the day,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-notifies-metro-sop/story-lJrNnJPJutqGQqZ3JoNdfM.html

A protest was also organised by over 70 members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) outside the Haryana education department. But, no case was registered in this regard till the filing of the report.Held under the banner of the Haryana Sharirik Shikshan Sangarsh Samiti, the first protest saw PTI candidates demanding that the recruitment examination held on August 23 be cancelled as “the paper was leaked” and an inquiry be marked by a sitting judge of the high court.The ABVP was protesting against fee hike at higher educational institutes and their refusal to refund excess fee charged.

Take the case of the Bhalswa landfill. The BJP-ruled north civic body has been spending Rs 5 crore a month on it but has failed to reduce its height even by an inch. It’s the same story with the other two landfills. Their height today reflect the extent of corruption in the MCDs,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of MCD affairs.Besides Bhalswa, Delhi has two big landfills in Okhla and Ghazipur.Pathak said, “The landfills can lead to a major accident any day. It looks like the BJP is waiting for that to happen. People of Delhi shall give them appropriate response in the next municipal elections.”The next municipal elections are likely to be scheduled in 2022.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Mr Pathak’s statement on the landfills and alleged corruption is nothing but a bunch of lies. As far as the Bhalswa landfill is concerned, he claimed that the north MCD is spending Rs 5 crore per month on reducing its height. North DMC records show that the civic body has been spending Rs 90 lakh on 15 trommel machines to bring down the landfill’s height. The height of the landfill has gone down.”AAP TO PROTESTThe AAP on Thursday said that party leaders would join demonstrations from Monday in groups at the Civic Centre, which is the headquarters of the civic bodies in Delhi, demanding immediate payment of pending salary to the employees.“In times of pandemic, not paying salary to employees is an inhuman act. The BJP should immediately release the salary of their employees immediately or resign,” said Pathak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-alleges-corruption-in-mcds-bjp-terms-it-bunch-of-lies/story-TYZkCbjbdNUtUbP7PjIxHN.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||No bail for Jamia student Asif Tanha in north-east riots case||A Delhi court has rejected the bail plea of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha, who was arrested under a stringent anti-terror law — the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — in a case related to the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left 53 people dead. The court, while rejecting the bail, said the statements of the protected witnesses in the case reflected the role of many suspects, including Tanha, regarding the protest sites and how everything was planned.“The statements clearly point out the role of the accused, Asif lqbal Tanha, as also other co-accused persons and various actions taken by them in pursuance of the conspiracy. He was part of a conspiracy for doing chakka-jam, leading to the riots. His name comes out in statements of witnesses as one of the main coordinators in the entire conspiracy,” additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said in his order dated September 2.“……considering the statement of such witnesses regarding the role of Tanha and other accused persons, I have no hesitation to hold that there are reasonable ground for believing that accusations against the accused are prima facie true...,” the judge said in his order.Tanha, a BA third-year student in Persian, was arrested in May in connection with the north-east Delhi riots. Tanha, who is in judicial custody, had been earlier arrested in connection with the violence outside Jamia Millia university during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in December last year. The 24-year old student was arrested for the second time on May 19 .Dismissing his bail plea, the court said the freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India granted Tanha the power to oppose any legislation and peacefully protest and it was subject to reasonable restrictions.“Thus, what has to be seen is the context, manner of expressing the dissent and various acts associated with it. It has to be some acts in pursuance of a conspiracy by various means,” it said.Appearing for Tanha, advocates Siddharth Aggarwal and Sowjhanya Shankaran, said he was falsely implicated in the case. They said the invocation of UAPA against him was bad in law as there was no unlawful association or terrorist organisation with which he was associated.They said Tanha was not a member of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) WhatsApp group till February 24, and therefore, the messages on February 23 regarding the alleged planning of riots were not relevant to him. There has been no recovery of the money trail and no payment has been ascribed to him from any objectionable source, Tanha’s lawyers said. Police say members of the JCC, a group of Jamia students and alumnus formed in December 2019, planned the riots. The group has denied the allegations. Tanha said his premises were not searched and no evidence was collected against him. No incriminating material or arms or ammunition was recovered from him, he said.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for Delhi police, opposed the bail plea, saying Tanha was one of the conspirators and involved with other accused persons and that there was sufficient material for establishing a prima facie case against him.The public prosecutor said there was a conspiracy hatched to cause communal riots in Delhi and it was multi-layered and deep-rooted.Communal riots had broken out in north-east Delhi in February this year, leaving 53 dead and over 400 injured. The Delhi Police in their reports before the court have said that the riots were planned at the Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest sites by some student leaders, activists, and local politicians. The arrested suspects have accused police of targeting anti-government voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-bail-for-jamia-student-asif-tanha-in-north-east-riots-case/story-aOwsNULLzXEm1Zyz6292VK.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Author of book on Delhi riots files police complaint||The co-author of a book on Delhi riots, which sparked a row on the day its launch last month, has filed a police complaint against publishing house Bloomsbury India, Delhi university professor Nandini Sundar, author William Dalrymple, two media publishing companies and others on September 1, accusing them of cheating, criminal intimidation, retention of stolen property and promoting enmity between classes.On August 21, Bloomsbury India had backed out from releasing the book, ‘Delhi riots 2020: The untold story’, ahead of its virtual launch, after a photograph of the virtual invite of the event showing Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra as one of the guests kicked up a controversy on social media. The authors had then said there was a campaign on social media to stifle their free speech and stop the book’s release. Bloomsbury said they were withdrawing from publishing the book, saying they were uncomfortable with the participation of some people.One of the authors, Monika Arora, said on Thursday that she sent a complaint to Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava’s email id, sharing evidence of their correspondence with the publishing house. Arora said they had informed the company of the virtual launch, along with details of the guests, and received an acknowledgment from them. She said while 100 copies had been already distributed, the company informed the authors about its decision to withdraw their book on August 22.In her complaint, Arora said a PDF of the book was stolen, circulated before release and Sundar was among those who had received it but did not report about receiving the stolen item. “Our script was stolen by some people and circulated on social media. It was a venomous campaign by the people I named in the report. How did they receive the PDF of our book? They started a false campaign against our free speech. The police have assured us they will take appropriate legal action,”Arora said.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said police were looking into the allegations. HT contacted Dalrymple via calls and text messages but there was no response until Thursday night. Bloomsbury too did not offer a response till Thursday night.  Delhi university professor Sundar released her statement on social media, terming the complaint as “absurd.” “...If Arora or Bloomsbury have not complained about any stolen property, what business is it of mine to take any appropriate legal measures to bring it to the notice of the authorities.”Sundar said that on August 22, the chief guest at the book launch had tweeted -- “The book is public now.”“Monika Arora, who was best situated to judge whether these reports were based on stolen property, has chosen to keep quiet about it till now,” she said in her statement.After Bloomsbury withdrew from publishing the book, the authors held a virtual launch with Kapil Mishra as the guest of honour. Apart from Mishra, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri and OpIndia editor Nupur Sharma were invited as guests of honour. BJP national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav launched the book.Ahead of the February riots, Mishra had delivered a speech that people would take matters into their own hands if the police did not remove anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act demonstrators near the Jafrabad Metro station. Clashes between pro- and anti-CAA groups later snowballed into a Hindu-Muslim communal riot. Mishra was not charged by police for his speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/author-of-book-on-delhi-riots-files-police-complaint/story-BXZgv47BpO5PF2tnkhobNI.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Most cases in 67 days after record 32k Covid-19 tests||The national capital on Thursday witnessed two extremes with the government conducting a record 32,834 daily tests for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the city registering 2,737 new infections — the highest single-day spike in 67 days.This was the second day in a row that the city has set a new record in single-day Covid-19 tests. The boost in testing numbers comes a week after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that Covid-19 testing in the city would be doubled to 40,000 a day with the city seeing a resurgence of cases since mid-August.As testing increased, 2,737 new cases were reported in Delhi — the highest single-day case count since June 28, or 67 days — keeping with the trend of resurgence of daily infections in the city. There were 2,889 new cases on June 28. The seven-day average of daily cases, which peaked at 3,446 on June 26 before falling to 983 on August 4, has now been rising for the 17th consecutive day and stands at 2,100. The total number of cases in the city is 182,306. The death toll from Covid-19, meanwhile, touched 4,500, with 19 new deaths lodged on Thursday. As many as 160,114 people have recovered from the disease so far.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that the current rise in cases “cannot be called a second wave” of the virus. “You can’t say it is a second wave. We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would’ve started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi,” he said. People “should not stress about the numbers”, he said, as he attributed the spike to the increased number of tests in the city.Members of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday, in a meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, discussed the rising infections in Delhi, senior government officials said. “Principal Secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt informed the DDMA about some probable reasons for the increase in positivity rate Delhi. The possible reasons included lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour; impact of festivals in the month of August; late testing by Covid suspects; cross-infection; return of migrants and unlock measures,” a DDMA official, who did not wish to be identified, said.In a statement issued late in the evening, the DDMA said the L-G advised that besides the entry points to the city (ISBTs and railway stations), large-scale construction sites should also be covered through special camps for targeted testing. These camps are to be set up within a week. Besides, he has also directed the government to prepare a policy to introduce a “test on demand” programme wherein people could call at a helpline number and fix an appointment at the nearest Covid testing centre without having to wait in a queue. The share of antigen tests continues to be over 70% of the total daily tests. According to Thursday’s health bulletin, 24,512 rapid antigen tests (75%) and 8,322 RT-PCR tests were conducted in the past 24 hours.Antigen tests generally provide results within hours and are relatively cheap, but they can give false negatives (in other words, they can miss positive cases). RT-PCR tests, on the other hand, is the most definitive test currently available for Covid-19 and experts say it should be used to the extent possible, especially if authorities have the capacity to do so. The downside is that they can generally take 24-48 hours and need specialised machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-most-cases-in-67-days-after-record-32k-tests/story-xh2Oj1Ys9NkIfAG1rZgKcK.html

The disciplinary action has been taken following the collapse of a span of the under-construction elevated road on August 22 between two piers opposite the Vipul Greens condominium on Sohna Road. The NHAI said in a statement released on Thursday evening that action against the concessionaire, Rajiv Chowk–Sohna Highway Pvt Ltd and its promoters Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt Ltd, has been taken after the authority found the submission given by the company not satisfactory. The NHAI said that following the collapse of span on the project, the concessionaire was issued a show-cause notice to explain on the violation of the obligations under the concession agreement. “The explanation furnished by the concessionaire was found to be unsatisfactory. Moreover, lapses were found in implementation of the safety measures/workmanship/adherence to construction methodologies/procedures, which were highlighted time and again to the contractor before the said incident. Therefore, it was established that concessionaire failed to discharge its obligation to construct a safe structure and to ensure the safety of the user and pedestrians on the previous occasions and during the accident as well,” the NHAI stated.The authority further said that with immediate effect, the concessionaire has been debarred from participating in any NHAI bids involving major structural works until they demonstrate reliable construction methodologies/designs and adequate safety measures at sight; and demonstrate that such type of accident does not occur in other part of their works.A senior official of Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt LTD, when asked about the matter said that all directions issued by NHAI in this matter like barricading, deploying marshals and installing nets have been carried out. “Additional safeguards have been taken but we are not aware about the decision taken to debar the firm from future bids. We will take all steps to prevent such accidents in future,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhai-debars-sohna-elevated-road-contractor-from-future-bids/story-ktf7inmSOSWVhonGa9N3XJ.html
04-09-2020||Chandigarh||High court asks for status quo on compost unit in Kalka||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday asked the Panchkula administration to maintain status quo on the construction of compost manure unit in Kalka area.The high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma acted on the plea of 25 villagers of Bitna Seuri and Vasudev Pura, who have challenged the Panchkula administration’s decision to set up a dumping ground and compost manure unit in the area. While issuing the notice for October 6, the high court has asked administration to maintain status quo with regard to construction of the unit.They had sought directions to ensure safety of residents living around the dumping ground being set up and steps to be taken to prevent outbreak of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea malaria and dengue due to unhygienic conditions, after the unit is set up in the area.The court was told there are residences, shops, hotels, schools and a hospital around the land chosen for the unit and area is densely populated. Hence, it should be shifted elsewhere. The MC has already obtained land at Jhuri Wala village for setting up waste processing unit, but still this unit is being set up, the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-asks-for-status-quo-on-compost-unit-in-panchkula/story-2ZIh9SkAszD8pZf3KwwmjO.html
04-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Bhondsi Jail inmates to be tested after they return from court or doctor visits||Gurugram: After 33 inmates at Bhondsi Jail, which houses prisoners from at least three neighbouring districts, tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease earlier this week, jail authorities said all inmates who travel outside the premises (either for medical examinations or court proceedings) would be tested twice using rapid antigen kits during their mandatory quarantine period, before they are returned to their barracks.“We have created a separate isolation barrack for inmates who return to the jail after attending court proceedings or from hospitals. Earlier, we would place them in quarantine before moving them to their respective barracks if they did not show any symptoms during those two weeks. It has now been decided that a quarantined prisoner should be tested once each week to rule out Covid-19,” said Sanjay Kumar, assistant jail superintendent, Bhondsi Jail. He added that all new inmates are being mandatorily tested before incarceration.He added that all inmates will be monitored for Covid-19 symptoms, and that they would be isolated and tested on priority, should they develop any signs of illness including fever, chills, sore throat, dry cough or others. He said all barracks are now being sanitised at least once daily, while the two barracks, from which the 33 positive cases emerged, were cleared out and sanitised soon after the first reports were received.“The contact tracing of suspected patients has been completed by the health department. We have also requested them over the phone to administer rapid antigen kits for all 2,200-odd inmates that are here. The authorities will do what is needed. Meanwhile, we are trying to ensure social distancing and will remain vigilant,” Kumar said.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “From the initial two inmates who tested positive, and the handler who was travelling with them, we have traced 255 contacts. Ideal as it may be, we cannot conduct tests for the all the residents. Testing resources have to be used optimally. I have not received any such request in writing.”According to data from the health department, three people tested positive for Covid on Sunday after which 80 of their contacts were traced and 172 further contacts were traced by Tuesday. Out of these 255, a total of 33 confirmed infections were reported. The patients have been shifted to a Covid ward in a government medical college in Sector 9.Of the 33 confirmed cases, all are in the approximate age group of 30-45, jail authorities said. “They are all asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,” Kumar said. The first cases were detected when two inmates, who were supposed to be shifted to a jail in Delhi, had tested positive, following which RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests were administered to inmates on Sunday. This was followed by a large antigen testing drive on Tuesday, which gave results on the spot and allowed the health department to isolate positive cases faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-bhondsi-jail-inmates-to-be-tested-after-they-return-from-court-or-doctor-visits/story-6EXoKi1hxCsAnBzaMtrvnN.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||To assist DMRC in metro ops, admin to appoint supervisors, nodal officer for coordination||The district administration will appoint a supervisor each for all five metro stations in the city falling on the Yellow Line for close coordination with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) so as to ensure smooth operations when the metro service restarts on Monday. The district administration held a meeting with DMRC officials on Thursday and discussed measures to prevent crowding at metro stations and also to ensure screening of passengers is done effectively for Covid-19.In the meeting, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said local authorities will accord full cooperation to DMRC to ensure smooth operations while enforcing safety norms strictly to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.Khatri said a supervisor will be appointed for each of the five stations — Guru Dronacharya, Sikanderpur, MG Road, Iffco Chowk, Huda City Centre — to coordinate with local DMRC officials and a nodal officer will be appointed to coordinate the entire exercise of resuming the operation and safe movement of passengers. “All efforts would be made to prevent crowding and to ensure safe movement of passengers,” said Khatri.He further said steps would also be taken so that autos and rickshaws outside stations are regulated in a proper manner and the commuters do not face any problem in last mile connectivity.Virender Yadav, civil surgeon, Gurugram, said that the health department will provide a list of all health centres that are near the five metro stations in the city. “If any passenger shows flu-like symptoms, they can be sent immediately to the public health centre,” said Yadav.Rishab Singh, a DMRC official, who was present in the meeting, said preparations have been made for thermal scanning of all passengers, and those commuters, who show flu-like symptoms, will be asked to visit the nearest health centres.DMRC will also motivate passengers to download the Aarogya Setu application on their mobile phones and there would be signages for entry and exit, standing and keeping distance, he added. Each passenger will be allowed to sit on an alternate seat inside the train and tickets will be issued only through digital transactions. The trains would be sanitized after every trip, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-assist-dmrc-in-metro-ops-admin-to-appoint-supervisors-nodal-officer-for-coordination/story-g5EQBdkD0LIxHbDOPVSNDO.html
04-09-2020||City||Flu season drives up people coming to get tested for Covid-19, says Gurugram health dept||Gurugram: The onset of the annual flu season, categorised by a peak in prevalence of flu -- caused by strains of the influenza virus which begin to rapidly circulate due to seasonal changes in weather and temperature -- has resulted in a larger number of people seeking tests for Covid-19 due to overlapping symptoms, health department officials said. The typical season for flu in Gurugram, they added, lasts from July to October every year.“There are several strains of viruses which begin to circulate more efficiently between the months of October and July due to changes in temperature, humidity and so on. Influenza, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, para-influenza viruses... they affect the body in different ways depending on biological factors, but like Covid-19, they target the respiratory tract and cause ‘common cold’ symptoms like fever, loss of taste and smell, and so on,” said Dr Piyush Goel, a pulmonologist at Columbia Asia hospital overseeing treatment of Covid-19 patients.While in a pre-Covid world, a person may not have paid much attention to a small cough, this year people are on high alert due to the ongoing pandemic, said Goel as well as health department officials. Anantha K, a laboratory technician with the health department who has been supervising sample collection at testing camps since the start of the outbreak in the district, said, “It’s hard to put a number on it, but these days we do see more people coming for tests because of flu-like symptoms. And in most cases it is the flu, not Covid-19.”While officials did not state how many more tests they are conducting due to flu season, Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, pointed out that ICMR guidelines state that all people with influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) need to be tested. “Depending on the nature of symptoms, we conduct an antigen test and then an RT-PCR test if it returns negative. A runny nose and a wet cough with expectoration, for example, are not typical Covid-19 symptoms. A dry cough or breathlessness on the other hand would certainly require a confirmatory RT-PCR test. The challenge for us is that there is a larger pool of patients for whom we have to rule out whether they have Covid-19 or not,” Sharma said. He added that in early July, before flu season began in earnest, “We were collecting about 1,500 samples a day. Now it is up to 2,500 samples per day for both antigen and RT-PCR tests. People with ILI symptoms make a sizable portion, though it’s not possible to recall the data offhand.”The chief medical officer in Gururgam, Dr Virender Yadav, concurred. “It is, but natural. People will be more wary of the slightest fever these days. It’s necessary to remain that vigilant also. My advice to anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms is that they come forward for a test,” he said, adding that anyone needing a test could contact the health department via its website or helpline numbers, and get their samples collected at any number of testing camps or primary healthcare centres. However, officials and doctors also said that the number of flu cases on the whole this year is not as much. “We generally get a lot more people visiting our flu clinics every year. This time, flu season has pushed up the number of samples we are collecting for Covid, but by and large, number of people coming with symptoms of common cold is less,” said Dr Ram Prakash Sharma, district epidemiologist in Gurugram, adding that the health department is now collecting close to 2.500 samples a day to meet the demand for tests.According to Goyal, “This may be due to wearing masks. Influenza also spreads faster in close proximity to someone who is already ill. Wearing masks, social distancing, staying at home... these are not just protections against Covid-19 but also against other viral illnesses too.”Gurugram collected 72,199 samples in August for Covid. So far, 1,73,775 samples have been collected for Covid in the district since the disease broke out here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/flu-season-drives-up-people-coming-to-get-tested-for-covid-19-says-gurugram-health-dept/story-8fuXDOBSjk2Ttnegxib2KM.html
04-09-2020||Gurugram||Liquor shop owner murdered, shot 16 times; another critical||A 42-year-old liquor shop owner was killed while his friend suffered critical injuries after a group of armed men allegedly opened fire on their car as they were returning to their house in Jatauli, Haily Mandi, on Wednesday night. The police said the shop owner was shot at least 16 times and died on the spot, while his friend suffered three bullet wounds and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. The police said, prima facie, personal enmity over a court case is suspected to be the reason for the alleged murder. Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manesar, said, “Five teams including crime branch have been formed to nab the culprits. An FIR has been registered and several suspects have been identified. At least 12 people, all locals from Jatauli village, have been named in the FIR.” According to the police, the incident took place around 10pm when the victims, identified as Inderjeet, Vikram and Vishal, who have a liquor business in Haily Mandi, were returning to their residences in a car. As their car entered a lane, a herd of cattle blocked their path. According to Inderjeet’s cousin, Jai Bhagwan, who witnessed the incident, at least five suspects on three motorcycles, were closely following the car. “I was taking a stroll in the same lane with a cousin when I noticed that their car had been blocked by cattle. I tried to move the cattle when suddenly several armed men alighted from motorcycles and surrounded the car from two sides. They started firing indiscriminately at the victims. I rushed towards a wall nearby to evade the gunfire,” said Bhagwan, adding that he heard at least 20 gunshots and saw the suspects escape on motorcycles, while firing several shots in the air. The police said Inderjeet, who was behind the wheel, was declared dead on arrival by doctors at a hospital in Pataudi. Vikram, 40, seated on the co-driver’s seat, sustained three bullet wounds on his arm and waist and was referred to a private hospital in Sector 38, where he underwent surgery on Thursday. Vishal was on the back seat and survived the shooting unscathed, the police said. The police said probe had revealed that in July 2019, some of the accused men had fired gunshots at Inderjeet in a shooting incident in Jatauli. Karan Singh, station house officer (SHO), Pataudi police station, said, “In the last year’s incident, at least two suspects were arrested. Their aides had been threatening the victim to settle the cases. So, there was enmity related to that incident. No arrests have been made so far.” Jai Bhagwan, who is the complaint in the case, said, “A week ago, one of the accused men had threatened to kill Inderjeet and tried to extort money from him. The accused had mentioned that he was connected to some criminals. On several previous instances, the accused men have attacked our family due to business and personal reasons. There was enmity related to one of our associates getting elected in a municipal election too.” Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert, who conducted the autopsy, said, “The deceased was shot at least 16 times, out of which seven bullets were found lodged inside his body.” A case was registered against the suspects under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object, 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and relevant sections of the Arms Act at the Pataudi police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/liquor-shop-owner-murdered-shot-16-times-another-critical/story-eeZRZbQ61ggoX0w9EA1FIK.html
04-09-2020||City||Gurugram sees spike in hospital bed occupancy by Covid-19 patients||Gurugram: At least 31.30% (472) of the 1,511 hospital beds, earmarked for coronavirus (Covid-19) patients, are currently occupied in Gurugram, according to the district health department data, an increase from the 23.29% (352 BEDS) occupied up to August 27. This figure was 22% in July.Health officials cite simultaneous increase in the hospitalisation of patients, who are residents of Gurugram and those from other parts of Haryana and other states, has led to an increase in the bed occupancy.The last one-week’s hospitalisation data prepared by the district administration shows that from August 27, hospitalisation of patients who are residents of Gurugram, increased from 84 to 123, up to September 2.Simultaneously, the number of outstation patients admitted to Gurugram hospitals climbed from 268 to 350 during the same time. The health department report shows that most of the outstation patients are from Uttar Pradesh. In at least 41 hospitals, where 25% of beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients, at least 136 are from Uttar Pradesh, 98 from other states, 75 from rest of Haryana and 41 from Delhi, the report shows.Currently, the administration has reserved 1,511 general isolation ward beds — including 197 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 94 beds with a ventilator support system — across 41 government and private hospitals in the city. Health officials said that based on the hospitalisation trend of the next few days, they might think of preparing a strategy for Gurugram residents.A senior state government official privy to the matter, on condition of anonymity, said: “The burden is on Gurugram. Many patients from Panchkula are getting admitted to Gurugram as PGIMER Chandigarh has not been able to take patients from Haryana. There are many patients from Uttar Pradesh too. But at present, we have enough beds in the district. Only after noticing active cases and hospitalisation trends of the next few days, we might prepare a strategy.” Notably, PGIMER Chandigarh’s Covid-19 beds are getting occupied by outstation patients coming to emergency ward for other health issues and testing positive for coronavirus disease.Currently, no step towards expansion of the bed capacity has been taken. Private hospitals have reserved 25% of their bed capacity for Covid-19. “The capacity can be further escalated to additional 30% in case there is a surge in the number of cases. Hospitals have also been directed to prepare their respective facilities,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said. According to a state government order, a maximum of 60% beds can be reserved in private hospitals.“The hospitalisation should not be more than 15% of the infected patients. For every thousand active cases, 150 people getting admitted to the hospital is normal. Only those with symptoms and underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are shifted to hospitals. This helps in controlling the fatality rate too,” said Yadav. Gurugram’s current fatality rate is 1.07%, while the recovery rate is at 88.18%.According to the district health bulletin, nearly 86% of the active cases are currently home isolated, while only 11.93% are hospitalised. At least 1,088 patients are in home isolation while 151 are in hospitals, according to the district health bulletin. Gurugram’s current positivity rate is fluctuating at 7%. On Thursday, 224 new Covid-19 cases were reported, taking the total count of infected persons to 12,521 in the district, of which 1,265 are active cases. In the last 24 hours, 102 patients have recovered, taking the total count of the recovered patients to 11,121. With two more Covid-19 deaths, the death toll of the district stands at 135. Out of this, 94 deaths are due to co-morbidities and 41 are without co-morbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-sees-spike-in-hospital-bed-occupancy-by-covid-19-patients/story-S24nCCFV3OphyCw3hRcwxM.html

04-09-2020||Gurugram||Farmhouses in Raisina and Sohna under municipal scrutiny; likely to face action||Farmhouses, amusement parks and other commercial ventures, which have come up in the revenue estates of Sohna and Raisina after 2015, are under scanner by the Municipal Council of Sohna. Their owners are likely to face action as they have not obtained the change of land use permission and sanction of building plans, said municipal officials on Thursday. The area came under the Municipal Act in 2015 and the civic agency will now probe the constructions that have come up in violation of urban local development rules as per the Municipal Corporation Act in these two revenue estates, said Vinay Pratap Singh, district municipal commissioner, Gurugram, who is also in charge of the Sohna Municipal Council. A visit to Sohna reveals that a large number of farmhouses have come up deep inside the hilly areas of Aravallis on the rear side of Sohna town developed by private builders. Many of these structures have been constructed on several acres of land. A road has also been constructed to provide access to these farm houses. “The revenue estates of Sohna and Raisina villages came under the Municipal Act in 2015. As such, we will look into violations that were carried out after that year. The land owners need to get permission from the Municipal Council for construction and to change the land use. We will analyse the satellite pictures of 2015 and find out the constructions and other related violations that came up after 2015 under the Municipal Act,” said Singh, adding that, as per his information, none of the land owners have applied for approval of the building plan. Singh also said that the Municipal Council of Sohna, had given notices to the farmhouse owners, who have replied. “This month, these replies will be analysed and action would be taken. Earlier, Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed that Municipal Council, Sohna, will decide on the replies submitted by the owners,” he said. Referring to matter, Singh said that as per the NGT directions the category of land on which these farmhouses have come up in Raisina has been changed from ‘gairmumkin farmhouse’ to ‘gairmumkin pahad’ to ensure that owners don’t use the legal loophole to carry out construction on their land. “When the change of land use was granted by the Department of Town and Country Planning in 1988, the revenue estate was not under controlled area and the licence was for orchards and farms. However, the owners have constructed houses in these farms in violation of the rules,” said Singh, adding that different agencies of the government have issues noticed to the farmhouse owners for these violations. As per Municipal officials of Sohna, 330 notices were issued to farmhouse owners in revenue estates of Sohna and Raisina in May this year and replies of 175 owners have been received. Additionally, a total of 195 farmhouse owners in Raisina have been issued notices for violations by the Gurugram district administration. National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on August 27 issued directions to Haryana government that it should restore the forest in Raisina in the next five months. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that a survey had already been carried out in the area regarding illegal structures and to identify the character of the land. “We will take corrective measures as directed by the NGT,” he said. RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram said that they will soon start a survey in Raisina to check the status of farmhouses. “A report will be prepared in collaboration with Municipal Corporation of Sohna and other departments concerned,” he added. Last week, at least 19 farmhouses were demolished in Bandhwari by the Department of Town and Country Planning in three-day drive against structures that had come up without permission in the Aravallis .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmhouses-in-raisina-and-sohna-under-municipal-scrutiny-likely-to-face-action/story-mwuoVdyqBsoCDPDDZl9U5L.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Covid patients from neighbouring states travel miles for treatment in Delhi||Om Prakash did not want to risk it any more at the private hospital in his hometown in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly. It had been three days that his brother, Sushant Kumar, had been admitted to the hospital and his condition was deteriorating daily. Kumar was admitted to the private hospital in Bareilly after testing positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. But he soon developed pneumonia. “We found the treatment provided there to be inadequate. We also worried that if his condition turned worse, the hospital would not be able to manage his condition,” said Prakash.On Saturday morning, Prakash decided to put his brother in a car and take him to Max Hospital in Saket,Delhi. He called the hospital and was told that an ICU bed was available.“I didn’t want to waste time waiting for an ambulance, so I simply loaded my brother in my car and drove off to Delhi,” said Prakash.It took Prakash about five hours of non-stop driving to cover the 270 kms to reach Delhi. They didn’t stop for meals, scared that the patient might infect someone on the way. “Kumar spoke little along the way and mostly spent the journey sleeping, but thankfully he held on,” said Prakash.However, when they reached Delhi in the afternoon on Saturday, they were in for a rude surprise. “At Max Hospital, we were told that the vacant ICU bed had been occupied,” said Prakash.The next few hours were spent looking for another private hospital in Delhi-NCR with a free ICU bed . “Finally, we found an ICU bed at a private hospital in Noida, but we didn’t like the facilities. It felt like we had travelled all this way for nothing,” he said.They were mulling their next course of action when they got a call from Max Hospital answering their prayers. An ICU bed there had been vacated minutes earlier.Sushant, who is a chief pharmacist at a government hospital in Bareilly, is yet to recover. But Prakash now is confident of the treatment being given to his brother . “The Covid-19 situation is bad in UP, but we kept reading that it is under control in Delhi. We were more likely to find an ICU bed and receive better treatment in Delhi than in UP,” Prakash said.The siblings are not the only people from other states choosing private hospitals for ICU care -- doctors of many private Covid-designated hospitals attributed their nearly full occupancy of ICU beds to this emerging trend of patients opting for hospitals in the national capital.Delhi has been witnessing a spike in Covid cases after a lull over nearly eight weeks. On Thursday, Delhi added 2,737 new infections and 19 fresh deaths, taking the total number of positive cases so far to 1,82,306 and its fatality count to 4,500. The number of patients occupying hospital beds too has increased to 4,477 as on Thursday as compared to 2,973 on August 3.At Max hospital, Saket, another patient, Gaurav Aggarwal, has been in the Covid-19 ICU ward for the last one week. His family had driven him in their car from Meerut to Delhi the moment they received his Covid-19 report last week. As they made the three-hour journey, in Delhi his brother Saurav had confirmed an ICU bed at Max Hospital.“The facilities are good at the hospitals in Meerut as well. But nothing can match Delhi. Moreover, I stay in Delhi and can personally monitor whether he is receiving the kind of attention he needs,” said Gaurav’s brother, Saurav. On Thursday, Gaurav received plasma therapy at the hospital.But both the patients were lucky to find ICU beds in the city’s top private hospitals. As of 9.16 am on Thursday, the Delhi Government’s ‘Delhi Corona’ app showed that none of the 32 ICU beds equipped with ventilators at Max hospital, Saket, was vacant.The story is similar at other private Covid-designated hospitals in Delhi as well. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had in June this year raked up a storm by announcing by announcing that beds in the city’s private hospitals and in hospitals run by the state government will be reserved for residents of Delhi until the Covid-19 pandemic subsides. The order, which created much furore, was later struck down by Delhi L-G Anil Baijal.According to doctors at Max Saket and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, their ICU beds reserved for Covid patients are completely occupied — mostly by patients belonging to other states.“Eighty per cent of our ICU beds are occupied by patients from other states, such as Uttar Pradesh and even Bihar. While the non-serious patients don’t mind staying back in their home states, those whose conditions worsen prefer to come to Delhi hospitals if they can afford it,” said Dr Nevin Kishore, head of the bronchology department at Max Saket.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of respiratory medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital said that patients in other states are opting for Delhi hospitals because they “are not happy with the treatment they receive there”.“There are not enough private hospitals in some of these states and patients are being forced to seek admission in government hospitals, which lack the necessary medicines or care. About 40% of our ICU patients are from other states such as UP and Madhya Pradesh,” said Dr Chawla, adding that all ICU beds at Indraprastha Apollo hospital were occupied on Thursday.Relatives of patients had varied reason seeking treatment in Delhi. But they all agreed on one thing — the facilities in Delhi were better.At Tughlaqabad’s Batra Hospital, where all 15 ICU beds were occupied at 4.31 pm on Thursday, Ghaziabad-resident Ruchi Pathak sat in the lawn with her mother and sister-in-law, while her 41-year-old brother remained admitted in the ICU inside.Pathak said that the family chose Delhi over Ghaziabad or any other UP city because they had been reading about Covid cases reducing in Delhi and the availability of beds here.“Our experience in Ghaziabad was not good . When my brother fell sick a week ago and we took him to a private doctor, a Covid test was not recommended by the doctor. His fever subsided in a couple of days, but he again developed a cough. This time when we took him to a private hospital, the doctors recommended home quarantine with oxygen support, but not a Covid test. When his pulse began to drop, we got him tested for Covid and when the result returned positive, we decided to take him to Delhi,” said Pathak.The family did not want to get Tripathi admitted to GTB Hospital where ICU beds are available, due to lack of facilities. Their next choice, after a long hunt, was Batra Hospital.“We first called two private hospitals in Delhi, but both said that their ICU beds were occupied. Then my brother’s employer (he works at a finance firm) made a request to Batra Hospital authorities and procured a bed here,” said Pathak.When her brother was admitted to the hospital on Thursday morning, it appeared that he had made it just in the nick of time. “When another patient arrived immediately after us, the hospital had to refuse them admission as my brother had occupied the last bed,” said Pathak.The only pleasant experience, her mother said, was finding an ambulance in Ghaziabad. “We had an ambulance at our door within five minutes of making a call,” she said.One of the expectations of this family was that it would be easier for the patient to receive plasma therapy if need be. He has been reporting low pulse and is on a ventilator. “We have already found a plasma donor,” said Pathak’s mother on Thursday afternoon, adding that all the members of the family who accompanied the patient will be tested for Covid.The situation is not very different at government hospitals either. Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said that 20% of all Covid admissions at this Delhi government hospital were from other states, mainly UP and Punjab.“The state borders opening have also contributed to this factor,” said Dr Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-patients-from-neighbouring-states-travel-hundreds-of-miles-for-treatment-in-delhi/story-5bXPogiBwMvYwzYO9rCS4M.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||No order on fining people driving alone for not wearing masks: Delhi Police||While the Delhi Police have been fining people for not wearing masks even while driving alone in their cars, the health ministry on Thursday said it is not compulsory for a person to wear a mask if they are not accompanied by any other person.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday said the guidelines released by the Union health ministry do not say anything about whether a person driving a car on their own has to wear a mask.“As for exercising, you must have seen there has been an increased awareness about physical activities among people. You must have seen people cycling and jogging in groups of two or three,” Bhushan said.He said, when such activities are taking place, people should wear masks and maintain social distancing to ensure they do not infect one another. “However, if you are cycling alone, then the guideline does not say anything about wearing a mask,” Bhushan added.When asked, a senior Delhi Police officer said till date they are following guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), dated June 13, which say any person who is not wearing a face mask in a public place shall be liable for fine of ₹500. “Because a car is considered a public place, we are issuing fines. Any officer of the rank of a sub-inspector or above can issue the fine. We are yet to receive any written order that states otherwise. As soon as we receive the new directives, we will start following them,” the police officer said.On an average, the Delhi Police have been issuing fines against 1,200 to 1,500 people every day for riding a vehicle without face masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-order-on-fining-people-driving-alone-for-not-wearing-masks-delhi-police/story-nWHWkeJ9t0sjTHzm0sfIiK.html
04-09-2020||Delhi||Weekly markets to continue on trial basis, inter-state travel to remain prohibited: DDMA issues Unlock 4.0 order||Several weekly markets in the Capital will continue operating on a trial basis till September 13 but inter-state buses are prohibited from plying and gymnasiums and yoga centres cannot open in the city at this point.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday issued an order implementing its un-lockdown plan for September, in adherence to guidelines issued by the central government last week.The order, which HT has seen, also mentions the phased re-opening of the Delhi Metro services from Monday and operation of bars from Wednesday.The government had first allowed weekly markets to operate from August 24 on a trial basis and an assessment report was submitted to the chief minister’s office on August 31. The assessment was done on parameters of social distancing and safety measures in the light of Covid-19 guidelines. Based on the report, the DDMA decided to extend the trial operations up to September 13 before taking a final call on whether these markets can be opened permanently, said a senior government official.Under the trial run, one weekly market per municipal zone is allowed to function each day. Delhi has 12 municipal zones.However, in the light of the spike in new cases, the DDMA decided to take some more time on re-opening of gyms and inter-state transport, the senior official said.The DDMA is chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, its vice-chairperson is Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Gyms and yoga centres had been closed since March 22. Recently, the AAP government had sent a proposal to L-G Baijal to allow gyms and yoga centres to reopen but the L-G rejected it citing the prevalent situation where number of Covid cases have been rising in the Capital.Delhi on Thursday recorded 2,737 new COVID-19 cases, the city’s highest single-day spike in 67 days, taking the infection tally to over 1.82 lakh, while the death toll mounted to 4,500, according to the daily bulletin issued by the Delhi government.This is the third successive day in September when the city has reported over 2,000 new cases.On August 29, the Union Home Ministry had issued the Unlock 4 guidelines under which Metro trains have been allowed to resume services from September 7 in a graded manner, while political, social and religious congregations of up to 100 people have been permitted from September 21.However, schools, colleges and other educational and coaching institutions will remain closed for students till September 30, with some relaxations for students of classes 9 to 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekly-markets-to-continue-on-trial-basis-inter-state-travel-to-remain-prohibited-ddma-issues-unlock-4-0-order/story-XseGwZnTCLKMhRKKZO9wxJ.html

04-09-2020||Delhi||Man held for posing as IFS officer in PMO office, duping people||Delhi Police have arrested a 43-year-old man who was allegedly impersonating as an Indian Foreign Service officer posted in the Prime Minister’s Office and allegedly duping people on the pretext of providing them government and non-government contracts. Police said the man had recently duped a Gujarat-based businessman of Rs 36 crore.The arrested man was identified as one Piyush Bandopadhyay, who lived in Noida and claimed to be an M.Tech graduate from IIT-Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Joint commissioner of police (economic offences wing) OP Mishra said they got a complaint from a bio-toilet company alleging that its representatives met a woman, Shweta Sorout, who introduced herself as the India head for the Intellectual Innovation Think Tank (IITT), a company engaged in the sale of patent technology to government and non-government agencies all across the world.“She also claimed that her husband Piyush Bandopadhyay was an IFS officer presently posted in the PMO and arranged a meeting of the representatives of the company with her husband in Ashoka Hotel, New Delhi. The complainant said Bandopadhyay informed them that all projects related to Make-in-India, smart city, solar energy, etc. were looked after by him and claimed he could get any proposal of the company passed by the government of India,” Mishra said. The joint commissioner said the complainant’s company was lured by Bandopadhyay and his wife and its representatives then convinced another company based in Dubai, to purchase the patent technology from Intellectual Innovation Think Tank (IITT).“As per their mutual discussion, an initial amount of $3.1 million was transferred by the Dubai-based company to the account of IITT, of which Sorout is a trustee. Later, another sum of money was also transferred and the total amount paid to IITT turned out to be Rs 36 crores. But after the payment, when Bandopadhyay and his wife stopped responding to calls and messages from representatives of the two companies, they turned suspicious of the couple and lodged a police complaint,” he said.Mishra said, during initial probe, it was learnt that two more complaints have been filed before a central investigating agency against Bandopadhyay. “On this, he was put on surveillance and following a raid at his Noida residence, he was arrested. A beacon-fitted car, in which Bandopadhyay travelled for his meetings with his targets, was also seized from his house. We also seized from him documents related to properties that he had bought using the money earned through cheating,” he said.The officer said, when questioned, Bandopadhyay said he always used to have business meetings in five-star hotels to make it look authentic. “In order to give an impression about his coveted status as a senior government functionary, he would get the phones of all his visitors and clients deposited beforehand. He would often drop names of senior officials before the clients during business conversations to create an impression and used to mention government initiatives to make his targets believe that he played important role in policy-making,” Mishra said.Role of Bandopadhyay’s wife Sorout’s and other suspects are being investigated, the officer said. Bandopadhyay’s educational background is also being verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-held-for-posing-as-ifs-officer-in-pmo-office-duping-people/story-wBIS5hyl0ooVveiR4jMmGN.html
04-09-2020||City||Sealing and demolition drive against illegal constructions in south Delhi||New Delhi: The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday conducted a sealing and demolition drive in south Delhi’s Chhattarpur, Greater Kailash-II and Khirki Extension, taking action against as many as eight properties for illegal constructions. According to officials in SDMC’s building department, the civic body has cracked down on nearly 71 unauthorised properties in Chhattarpur, Vasant Kunj, Khirki Extension, GK-II, Panchsheel Vihar, Neb Sarai in one month. Entire properties built illegally at some places in Chhattarpur Enclave and Khirki Extension were sealed, the officials said “Action was taken against illegal construction in residential areas. The violations include construction without map sanction, construction beyond permissible limit, encroachment and violation of Master Plan of Delhi-2021. At some properties in Greater Kailash-II, people constructed rooms in the stilt space that can only be used for parking. All such illegal constructions were demolished and some parts were sealed. Cases were registered against 55 property owners for unauthorised construction,” an official of the building department said.The official quoted above said out of 71 unauthorised properties, 24 were sealed and 47 were demolished in a period of more than a month.The Supreme Court had on August 14 this year ruled that civic bodies would have the authority to take action against illegal construction. It had also specified that the court-appointed monitoring committee could take action only against commercial units in residential areas and encroachment on public land and not illegal constructions in residential dwellings. On Thursday, two properties in Chhattarpur Enclave, and one property each in Lado Sarai, Khirki Extension, Panchsheel Vihar, Hauz Rani, Toot Sarai and GK-II were either sealed or demolished.Municipal officials said the demolition staff faced stiff resistance from owners and local residents during the drive. The SDMC said in a statement that the demolition drives were conducted to discourage unauthorised construction by unscrupulous builders.The properties, SDMC said, have been left in an uninhabitable condition so that these cannot be used again and there is no scope for further constructions. “The drive is aimed at bringing the constructions in properties within the parameters of Master Plan-2021 and Unified Building Bye-Laws-2016, which contain the notified regulations applicable for construction activities in the Capital,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sealing-and-demolition-drive-against-illegal-constructions-in-south-delhi/story-RtA2QfFLToPVl1NX6HOfqN.html
04-09-2020||Mumbai||Report Sushant Singh Rajput case as per investigation: Bombay HC to media||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked news media to exercise restraint in its reportage of the investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. The court has also asked representatives of news channels to be present for the hearing of two petitions filed by former police officers and activists. The petitioners have alleged television news channels are maligning Mumbai Police and prejudicing the general public. The case will be heard next on September 10. A division bench of justices AA Sayed and SP Tavade was hearing two petitions. In the first, filed by activists Nilesh Navlakha, Mahibub Shaikh and Subhash Chander Chaba, advocate Devadatt Kamat that the petition had a limited prayer for directing various media houses on their reportage of the the Rajput case. Kamat said some news channels had overstepped the guidelines laid down in Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, and were conducting a media trial by exposing names and details of those named in the case. He submitted that that some had also gone on to name police officials and pass judgements on the accused before the investigation has been completed. Advocates Dr Milind Sathe and Chetan Kapadia informed the bench that their petition was on similar lines and had been filed by police officers, including former director generals of police (DGP) PS Pasricha, K Subramaniam, D Shivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal, Satish Chandra Mathur; former commissioners of Mumbai Police Mahesh N Singh, Dhananjay N Jadhav; and former anti-terrorism squad (ATS) chief K P Raghuvanshi. Dr Sathe submitted that the media coverage of the Rajput case was irresponsible, aimed to prejudice the general public and also maligned the image of Mumbai Police. He urged the court to restrain the media and also direct the government and media regulators to lay down guidelines for the coverage of pending investigations, like the one probing Rajput’s death. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh appearing for the Union of India asked for time to respond and submitted that as the petitions involved the media, media houses should be allowed to defend their actions before the court passes any order. After hearing the submissions, the bench passed a short order in which it observed, “The media should practice restraint and report the case as per the investigation.” The bench also directed the media channels named in the petition of the activists to be present for the hearing on September 10 and asked the News Broadcasters Association to file their reply before the next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/report-sushant-singh-rajput-case-as-per-investigation-bombay-hc-to-media/story-adzWtXtRsoDxMXQcwJuAyH.html

04-09-2020||Pune||Former Pune mayor passes away due to Covid after his family struggles to get bed||Former mayor Datta Ekbote passed away around midnight on Wednesday in the city though his death brings in focus shortage of beds and lack of coordination among agencies. Ekbote (84) was admitted at government-run Sassoon hospital on August 22 after his family members and other Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders failed to get a bed at a private hospital. Ekbote’s grandson Gaurav said, “Three persons from our family were admitted in a private hospital on July 27 and recovered on August 18. As Ekbote once again complained of discomfort, he was admitted at Sassoon hospital along with another son Ravindra, who passed away on August 31, at Sassoon.” His death came after three more patients passed away at the recently inaugurated jumbo facility in the city on which the government and PMC together spent Rs 80 crore. Many questioned why are people facing difficulty in getting beds despite administration setting up an 800-bed jumbo facility at College of Engineering, Pune, at Shivajinagar. While the facility is proposed to have 800 beds all are not operational. As per the PMC dashboard status at 7 pm on Thursday, total ICU beds with ventilator were shown as 753 of which 48 were vacant. While the Covid cases are increasing, fatalities have also gone up with each day reporting deaths within the range of 40 to 50. Meanwhile, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Thursday inspected the jumbo facility developed at College of Engineering Pune and expressed unhappiness over various lacunas in the facility.While many citizens and politicians are complaining about the jumbo facility, the death of a journalist Pandurang Raykar there triggered sharp reactions from opposition leaders.Taking serious note of Raykar’s death, Kumar wrote a letter to the Pune Metropolitan Region Development (PMRDA) commissioner Suhas Divase and pointed out his observations. Kumar mentioned in the letter, “Though the jumbo hospital is planned for 800 beds all beds are not operational and there is not enough manpower in the hospital.

If the 800-bed hospital was not complete they should have alerted the state government. PMC had only funded it but the work was carried out by PMRDA.”“It is the PMRDA’s responsibility to check whether all things are placed or not. Now it is a challenge in front of us to create confidence among the residents to vail service at the jumbo facility.

The passenger response on the first day was lukewarm as most buses were empty and regulars were those involved in essential services. Regular commuters trickled slowly at Swargate and Pune station and were happy to see buses at stops. “I used the service after five months as I had to reach Pimpri from Katraj,” said Anish Balgude, a banker. While the service of PMPML was shut, it was operating limited buses in Pimpri-Chinchwad and parts of Pune for essential services. According to PMPML officials, 2,548 trips were made by buses plying 34,443 passengers earning a revenue of Rs 5,56,924 till Thursday evening. “We have been planning to restart the services post Ganeshotsav and held a meeting to discuss the plan. We began today with 25 per cent of the fleet on 190 routes covering major trunk routes through the city,” said PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD) Rajendra Jagtap. Bus stops and buses were sanitised before making trips. Every bus were equipped with a pedal sanitiser and a plastic screen was placed to cover the driver’s space. The 35 seats of buses were marked and could accommodate only 17 passengers. Officials said buses were cleaned at the start and the end points of its journey twice as well as the terminal bus stop. “650 drivers, 760 conductors/checkers have been deployed to regularise the public transport. We had several passengers during the morning time at Swargate between 8.30 am and 9.30 am, but since it is the first day, we are hoping numbers would pick up slowly,” said Jagtap. Jagtap said citizens above 65 years of age and children below 10 years would not be allowed to board buses, that will run between Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. For bus conductor Manohar Koli, it was a five-month wait to rejoin. “I am on a bus route to Balewadi, Mhalunge and am happy to be back on duty. We are taking every precaution and hope that we will get more passengers soon and everything will return to normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmpml-restarts-service-lukewarm-response-on-first-day/story-FNtjeq17CxJ84AhkH8Pu1I.html

She said freight and parcel trains were running during the Covid-19 lockdown restriction period. “Our division operated 110 special parcel trains with 3,696 tonnes of essential commodities, medicines, medical equipment and also signed a special memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the postal department for door-to- door service,” she said. Sharma said that the Pune division ran 144 Shramik trains to facilitate migrant workers, students, pilgrims, tourists and other stranded persons stranded, facilitating 180,000 passengers to 16 states from five originating stations (Pune, Uruli, Satara, Miraj and Kolhapur). “We provided them with food packets, snacks and water bottles arranged by railways, state government and NGOs at the originating station and their food requirement was taken care at enroute stations till the destination,” Sharma said. Saharsha Bajpai, additional divisional railway manager, presented the progress report on the electrification of Pune-Miraj-Kolhapur section which was delayed due to the Covid situation. “The division has also executed many infrastructure and safety works which would have required major blocks with lot of traffic disruption during normal circumstances, like working on the overhauling of 24 level crossing gates and dismantling of the foot over bridge (FOB) at Talegaon and launching the girders of new FOBs at Kadethan and Chinchwad,” said Bajpai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/railways-waits-for-state-government-s-nod-to-restart-passenger-trains/story-zsbG9qG6kZKdF07RhocTyI.html

But two months have passed since June. There is no possibility of campus activities starting this month, Singh told PTI.The institute has started online classes as the new semester began in September.“We had considered their request earlier as they are our children. But this cannot go on indefinitely. The director himself had also requested them to leave. They must be aware of the pandemic situation,” Singh said.He said that 12-13 people including five students staying in the campus have been tested positive for COVID-19 in less than two weeks.“We cannot risk the health of our students, the registrar said.IIT Kharagpur had asked all students, who got stranded because of lockdown, to leave the campus by June 30, but a few of them remained there.The first COVID-19 case was detected in the institute when one of them tested positive on August 19.The authorities then asked all the students staying in the campus to vacate their rooms by August 23.Asked about the condition of those who have been infected with the virus, the registrar said, “They had all been admitted to a hospital in Kolkata. Several of them have already recovered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/internet-snapped-in-students-hostels-iit-kharagpur-says-given-them-enough-time-to-leave/story-QwtRlmYBIKxYt7kr8GWNtJ.html

The Bombay HC had granted them bail in the money laundering case registered against them by Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Yes Bank scam.An apex court bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul while staying the Bombay HC’s August 20 judgement, said that it would examine the legal issues involved in the Wadhawans’ bail plea.The HC had granted bail to the Wadhawans on the ground that ED had failed to file its charge sheet within the 60-day stipulated time frame in line with the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).The brothers were remanded to custody on May 14 and the 60th day expired on July 12. ED had filed its charge sheet on the following day, July 13.According to section 167 of the CrPC, an accused will be entitled to bail by default, if the investigating authority fails to file charge sheet within 60 days from the date of remand.The agency contended that the day on which the accused is remanded should be excluded while calculating the 60-day period. However, the Wadhawans’ counsel argued that the 60-day period would start from the day on which the accused were remanded to custody.Earlier, the HC had ruled in favour of the brothers and had stated that “excluding the first day of remand while computing the period of 60 days cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside”.On Thursday, Justice Kaul said that the legal questions relating to the remand period must be examined threadbare.“There are two issues. The first issue is whether the date on which the accused is remanded should be excluded while computing the 60 days. The second issue is whether weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) should be excluded. These are the issues we would like to examine and interpret,” he said.The Wadhawans had not been released from jail even though the HC had granted them bail since they are also accused in another case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-stays-bombay-hc-order-granting-bail-to-kapil-and-dheeaj-wadhawan/story-bO03N4ttdwcUtT3vITkEYK.html

The Dasgupta household has braved storms in the past as well. Adversity plants the seeds of kindness and you become your best version, they say. “We were a regular middle-class family. We were hit with financial trouble when my dad was diagnosed with cancer I was just 11. The treatment took a toll on us,” she says. Her father picked up whatever work he could and her mother also took up a teaching job at a nursery school. In her late teens, Ankita started giving tuitions to kids in the neighbourhood. “My parents and teachers always taught me that no job is small,” she says. Keeping tenants also helped ease the situation, but it wasn’t enough. Read: Spectator by Seema Goswami: Home truthsOnce her younger sister completed her education and her parents settled in their relatively relaxed roles, the 31-year old PR professional moved to Mumbai to work last year. “I got an apartment and enrolled for dance classes as dance is something that really makes me happy. But that was till the pandemic hit. I came back in March thinking this will all be under control in a month or two,” she says. Her first reaction was to wait and gauge the situation as no one knew what was to ensue. It was her boss who encouraged her to leave well in time as the possibility of a curfew in Mumbai was very high. “En route to the airport, I heard on the cab radio that curfew has been imposed. I was lucky to have my changed my plans on time,” she says. Her parents were relieved upon seeing her reach home safely. But soon, even they caved under the mass hysteria. “My father started worrying about the smallest of things. A task as simple as going to the bank became a war drill for us,” she recalls. Ankita continued working from home, but after about two months, as expenses kept rising, she contemplated going back to Mumbai and wrapping up her apartment. “It is crazy because 3/4th of my salary goes in paying rent for an apartment I don’t live in. I’m also paying my maid in Mumbai.” Her house-help, whom everyone calls Aaji, is a senior citizen with no steady income. “Initially, Aaji was in denial about the pandemic and told me not to worry about her salary. These are self-respecting people who wouldn’t take money for work they have not done. I insisted and kept paying, and would continue doing so till this pandemic ends,” she says.

They also have a pet at home. “My sister and I have been feeding strays for about five years. What used to be a minimal amount to feed a few dogs has gone up astronomically because the dhaba that used to give them roti is shut due to the pandemic and we have to figure out dog food for them. The rotis would cost about ₹3,500 but the dog food comes down to about ₹12,000,” she says. All these costs, plus the cost of running her household, have taken a toll on her. “It is nobody’s fault that the pandemic has hit. These are trying times, but will end soon. Kindness for all is the only way to get through this,” she says. “There are very limited options for alternative sources of income; Cutting down is the best way forward,” she concludes.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/this-family-believes-that-kindness-is-what-will-save-us/story-sAXjcIhKAkz3upxafco0UI.html

A day earlier, it had asked the developer to issue a no objection certificate (NOC) for transferring all parks in the colonies and DLF Phase 3 to the civic body.The notices are the latest in a series of moves by the civic body to acquire the three colonies home to upscale residential plots and important commercial sectors, following many requests from the residents. Earlier, it had pushed the developer into completing many of the maintenance works, much of it still pending.Even in the latest notices, both which HT has reviewed, the MCG has not issued a deadline.MCG joint commissioner Hariom Attri to DLF issued the notices to David Amal Raj, senior vice president, DLF Estate Developers Limited.Attri said in the notice that resurfacing of roads work had been pending for long “due to which residents of the area (are) facing great difficulties” and to start work “at the earliest”. Further, he directed DLF to submit a compliance report. As per the MCG’s detailed project report (DPR) prepared in 2017, DLF1 required Rs 14.12 crore to fix deficiencies, Rs 9.43 crore for DLF Phase 2 and Rs 11.89 crore for DLF Phase 3. MCG officials privy to the matter said that more than 80% of the sum was for re-carpeting roads.“They have been given a three day period to submit the compliance report, while we have also asked them to issue an NOC and handover all the parks as we want to upgrade them and provide optimum civic amenities to the residents of the three colonies,” Attri said.“These matters were also brought up in last month’s meeting with DLF officials. However, despite following up with them repeatedly over the phone, nothing was undertaken. Hence, we decided to send them a reminder in writing.”Attri said the MCG had the resources to maintain and improve the parks and improve its quality in short time. “We have received a large number of complaints from residents of the three colonies that the roads had deteriorated significantly during the monsoon and are riddled with potholes. I am arranging a meeting with DLF for next week, where the matter will once again be taken up,” said Attri.If the NOC is issued, it would mark the first time that any civic amenity has been transferred by DLF to the MCG.“We have completed around 70% of road re-carpeting work in DLF Phase 1, 55% in DLF Phase 2, and 40% in DLF Phase 3. For the last one year, work had been progressing at full swing but due to the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent monsoon season, where bituminous related work cannot be carried out, it was suspended. However, we will be resuming it from next month after the monsoon season is completely over,” said David Amalraj, director, DLF Estate Developers Ltd.Amalraj said that DLF would issue an NOC to the MCG only for upgrading the parks, but will not hand them over. DLF will, however, continue to carry out maintenance of the parks.“In our compliance report, which would be submitted within this week, we will be clearly mentioning this,” said David Amalraj.RS Rathee, councillor of ward 34, said that the local MCG ward committee had approached Attri regarding both matters last week.“DLF had reserved less than Rs 50 lakh to upgrade parks, which is very minuscule. We have also asked DLF to issue the NOC immediately so that we can start development work right away,” said Rathee, who is also the chairperson of the MCG ward 34 committee. The transfer of the three colonies to the MCG has been pending since February 2016. Prior to transferring the colony, DLF decided to repair the existing civic deficiencies in the three colonies, instead of paying the sum required to do so, and handover the colonies to the MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-dlf-told-to-re-carpet-roads-hand-over-parks/story-KWIZ6v4L2B4Lde95fIPecJ.html

The European Union failed for nearly a decade to broker a thaw in relations.The US effort focused on business and commerce, however, with Serbian negotiators insisting they would not go as far as recognizing Kosovo as a fully-fledged state. “It took decades because you didn’t have anybody trying to get it done,” Trump said of the deal. “There was a lot of fighting and now there’s a lot of love.” Vucic said Trump had done a “great job” and praised the US president’s commitment to the region, inviting him to visit Serbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-announces-historic-accord-between-former-foes-serbia-kosovo/story-VvU0iDnPR8V1hj73NBbMaM.html

04-09-2020||World||NATO agrees nerve agent used to try to kill Alexei Navalny||NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday condemned the “appalling assassination attempt” on Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny and called on Moscow to answer questions about the poisoning to international investigators.Navalny, a Kremlin critic and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to Moscow on Aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk. He has been in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany for treatment more than a week ago.German authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities previously identified the Soviet-era Novichok as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018.“There is proof beyond doubt that Mr. Navalny was poisoned using a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok group. The use of such a weapon is horrific,” Stoltenberg said after chairing a meeting of NATO ambassadors during which Germany briefed its allies on developments.“Any use of chemical weapons shows a total disrespect for human lives and is an unacceptable breach of international norms and rules. NATO allies agree that Russia now has serious questions it must answer,” he told reporters.Stoltenberg said Moscow must cooperate with the international chemical weapons organization in “an impartial, international investigation” and provide information about its Novichok program.After the March 2018 attack on the Skripals in the English city of Salisbury - territory of a member of the 30-nation alliance - NATO withdrew the accreditation of seven staff members at Russia’s mission to the military alliance and rejected the applications of three others. No such action was announced Friday.Russian authorities have appeared reluctant to investigate what caused Navalny’s condition, saying there had so far been no grounds for a criminal investigation. Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said Friday that a preliminary inquiry was ongoing but added that he saw no signs of a crime in what happened to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most determined critic.Putin’s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and said Thursday that Germany had not provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician’s condition.“We have nothing to hide,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday, asserting that German authorities had stonewalled Russian requests for information.Lavrov said the failure to provide information about Navalny’s poisoning could indicate a lack of evidence.“Our Western partners allow themselves to make arrogant demands in such a tone that suggests that they have nothing but pathos to put on the table,” he said.The Berlin prosecutor’s office said Friday that judicial authorities in the German capital are examining a request for information from Russian law enforcement and will decide whether to grant it, if necessary in consultation with German federal authorities. It didn’t specify how long a decision might take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-agrees-nerve-agent-used-to-try-to-kill-alexei-navalny/story-ttN8gE9iZJOd2u82MI8AbO.html

04-09-2020||World||Madrid struggles with Europe’s acutest 2nd wave of Covid-19||A mix of worry and resignation is discernible behind the masks of parents picking up school textbooks in a working class Spanish neighbourhood with a steady rise in new coronavirus infections.Authorities in Madrid, the European capital experiencing the worst second-wave outbreak, are introducing new curbs on social gatherings starting Monday. The restrictions coincide with the opening of most schools, which is perceived as a potential tipping point in the battle against the virus.The focus is especially on areas like San Diego, a culturally diverse neighbourhood of narrow streets and small apartments where many residents continued commuting to work over the summer, often to do manual labor and unstable jobs.“The south of Madrid is where the north’s cheap labor crams into small apartments,” said Simona Filip, 44, a migrant from Romania whose 6-year-old son is set to go back to school on Tuesday.Her son struggled with online learning ever since Spain went into lockdown in mid-March and a non-profit organization gave the family an electronic tablet for the boy to use.“The kid needs proper studies because I can’t help him and my husband needs to work,” Filip told The Associated Press this week. “We have no other choice but to hope that the school will keep him safe.”In the past two weeks, Spain has had a cumulative incidence of nearly 213 confirmed virus cases for every 100,000 residents, four times the European average. But in the southern Vallecas district with San Diego at its centre, that index closely watched by pandemic experts rose to 1,300 last week and remained on Friday above 1,000 cases.Jorge Nacarino, president of the local neighbours’ association, said that poverty and years of inadequate investments for the area are behind the spike. Tiny, cheap apartments built five to eight decades ago have not been replaced and now house extended families or groups of migrants who can’t afford real estate price hikes in other neighbourhoods.As happened during the first wave, social distancing is again difficult in the apartments, and many of those who had contact with people already infected with the coronavirus can’t afford to quarantine and miss work, Nacarino said.“We need a serious plan of public investment in the area, from health centres and sports facilities to social programs,” he said. “It’s been through decades of neglect that San Diego has fallen behind the development seen in surrounding areas.”With Spanish unemployment on the rise in the wake of virus-induced lockdowns, “narcoflats,” or vacant apartments taken over by gangs as drug distribution and consumption dens, are likely to spread, Nacarino said. So are gambling parlors, which are seen as a source of social problems in the area, with at least seven establishments operating along a short stretch of one of San Diego’s main streets.Since most of new recent infections have been tied to gatherings in private homes, the regional government on Friday extended to indoor meetings a ban on outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people. Attendance to funerals, burials, weddings or religious celebrations, as well as group visits to museums or guided tourism will also be restricted starting on Monday, authorities said.That comes on the heels of a crackdown on nightlife entertainment, early closure for the city’s parks to prevent youth from drinking alcohol and partying in large groups, and a ban on outdoor smoking, all of them measures announced in response to Madrid’s spiral of new cases since mid-July.The Spanish capital, home to 6.6 million and a magnet for workers from around the country, accounted last week for one-third of Spain’s new virus infections. At least 16% of beds in Madrid’s hospitals are currently occupied by patients with Covid-19, the highest rate of all Spanish regions.The situation “has nothing to do with what we went through a couple of months ago,” on Friday said the region’s health chief, Enrique Ruíz Escudero, referring to the peak of the pandemic in April, when makeshift hospitals had to be built and intensive-care-units expanded to cope with the influx of Covid-19 patients.“The pandemic in the Madrid community is stable and is controlled,” the official said at a press briefing, arguing that some of the effects of recent measures are starting to have an effect. “We are worried ... but we are not alarmed.”Madrid is also expanding the number of contact tracers, one of the weakest links in dealing with the new wave of outbreaks, and purchasing two million kits of rapid coronavirus tests.Spain, which is edging to a half-million confirmed cases since February, is leading the pandemic’s second wave in Europe. At least 29,234 people have died in Spain during the pandemic, although the real number is believed to be higher because many who died during the March and April peak of the outbreak were never tested.The northern region of Navarra was Spain’s first to launch a new school year on Friday, with masks mandatory for all students aged 6 or above and social distancing measures in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrid-struggles-with-europe-s-acutest-2nd-wave-of-covid-19/story-rIrkIOLSeLBJSaY5lnGJNO.html
04-09-2020||World||Canada: 5 found dead after shooting in Ontario home, say police||Police said five people were found dead and another with serious injuries following an early morning shooting Friday in a home east of Toronto.A spokesman said multiple calls came in around 1:20 a.m. reporting the sound of gunshots from a home in Oshawa, Ontario.Constable George Tudos said four of the deceased are believed to be men and one of them is believed to be a woman, but added that police are waiting for the coroner to confirm ages.Tudos said officers also found another woman in the house with a gunshot wound and she was sent to a local hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.Investigators said they believe the shooter is among the dead. Police were not looking for any more suspects and there were no community safety concerns.Police initially believed there were four people dead and one injured, but later updated that another person had died.Tudus told reporters that police were waiting for the homicide team to arrive to get a better understanding of what happened.Carol Gibson, who lives down the street from the crime scene, said she was startled awake by the incident.“The first shot woke me up, and then I heard about four or five more after that,″ Gibson said. “Then a woman screamed and there were two shots after that.”Gibson said she had known the family in the house for around 20 years.“They were a family that cared for each other quite a bit,” said Gibson. “If they weren’t playing baseball, hockey or shooting hoops on the driveway, they were out raking leaves and they did it as a family. A very caring family.″Rob Mitchell, another neighbour, described them as kind and outgoing.“They are very very involved with their kids and what they are doing in the community. It definitely doesn’t make any sense at all,” Mitchell told CBC news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-5-found-dead-after-shooting-in-ontario-home-say-police/story-NpZtJZLYsC8LmLsiGBdjpI.html

Bajwa, who is also chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority, had earlier said he would continue in that capacity but withdraw from the information portfolio.His resignation came after a story was published by an online investigative news platform that catalogued the retired general’s rise to riches along with that of his family members.According to a report published on ‘Fact Focus’, Asim Bajwa’s brothers, wife and two sons “own a business empire which set up 99 companies in four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 restaurants worth an estimated $39.9 million.” I strongly rebut the baseless allegations levelled against me and my family.Alhamdolillah another attempt to damage our reputation belied/exposed.I have and will always serve Pakistan with pride and dignity. pic.twitter.com/j185UoGhx1The report said that out of the 99 companies, 66 are main companies, 33 companies are branch companies of some of the main companies while five companies are dead.“The Bajwa family’s companies spent an estimated $52.2 million to develop their businesses and $14.5 million to purchase properties in the United States, while Asim Bajwa and his department were encouraging Pakistanis to invest within their relatively undeveloped country,” said the report.Bajwa announced in a TV program on Thursday that he would resign from his position as Special Assistant while at the same time he denied the allegations made in the news report. But on Friday, prime minister Imran Khan said in a statement that he is satisfied with the evidence and explanation presented by him. Bajwa had accused anti-Pakistan elements of being behind the report.In what is being described as a related development, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Joint Director Sajid Gondal went missing from Islamabad on Thursday night, his family confirmed on Friday.Human rights minister Shireen Mazari took notice of the incident and said in a tweet that the police have been directed to register a first information report (FIR).Local media has speculated, however, that Gondal may have supplied information on General Bajwa’s companies to the reporter who filed the story against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-s-top-aide-asim-bajwa-resigns-after-report-on-corruption-allegations-surfaces/story-khvS62ZCo9st27KDxAc4vJ.html
04-09-2020||World||US unemployment rate falls to 8.4% even as hiring slows||The US unemployment rate fell sharply in August to 8.4% from 10.2% even as hiring slowed, with employers adding the fewest jobs since the pandemic began.Employers added 1.4 million jobs, the Labor Department said Friday, down from 1.7 million in July. The US economy has recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic.Friday’s report from the Labor Department added to evidence that nearly six months after the coronavirus paralyzed the country, the economy is mounting only a fitful recovery. From small businesses to hotels, restaurants, airlines and entertainment venues, a wide spectrum of companies are struggling to survive the loss of customers with confirmed viral cases still high.After an epic collapse in the spring, when the economy shrank at a roughly 30% annual rate, growth has been rebounding as states have reopened at least parts of their economies. Yet the recovery remains far from complete.Many economists think significant hiring may be hard to sustain because employers are operating under a cloud of uncertainty about the virus. Daily confirmed case counts have fallen from 70,000 in June to about 40,000. The decline has leveled off in the past week and the viral caseload remains higher than it was in May and June.As a result activities like restaurant dining and air travel are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Most economists say a meaningful economic recovery will likely be impossible until the coronavirus is brought under control, most likely from the widespread use of a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-rate-falls-to-8-4-even-as-hiring-slows/story-RXp6ZDm6irs2VboARJMAVK.html

Vystrcil also met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.Wu said Taiwan is looking into starting direct flights between Taipei and Prague using its flagship airline, China Airlines.Vystrcil has faced strong anger from China, which issued multiple warnings over the week about the visit, as well as criticism from the pro-China Czech president.China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and objects to any official contacts between other countries and the island.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned on Monday that China will “definitely make them pay a heavy price” for the visit, which Beijing sees as support for Taiwanese independence.Throughout the visit, Vystrcil and others have emphasized the shared democratic values of Taiwan and the Czech Republic.Relations have soured between part of the Czech government and China in the past year.Prague canceled a sister cities agreement with Beijing last year after the Chinese side insisted on adding a clause to the deal stating that Prague supports the “one-China principle,” which says Taiwan is part of China.In reaction to Prague’s decision to sign a new sister cities’ agreement with Taipei, China canceled the tours of several Prague classical music ensembles and orchestras.Part of the dispute is over trade.“There were a lot of promises of China investment roughly around the year 2013, 2014. However, all those promises turned out to not be fulfilled,” Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prague-taipei-announce-new-areas-of-cooperation-as-controversial-czech-visit-ends/story-5hkanENihi7iZcYo8JhYGP.html
04-09-2020||World||Tying aid to foreign policy: New UK dept begins work||Declassified documents show that past British governments have been uneasy about admitting UK aid’s links with foreign policy objectives, but the Boris Johnson government has now institutionalised the link in a new department.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been merged with the Department for International Development (budget: £15 billion), inaugurated by foreign secretary Dominic Raab this week under the new name: Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office.The merger as part of Johnson’s post-Brexit idea of ‘Global Britain’ has attracted criticism, including from Labour, former prime minister David Cameron and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said abolishing the department was an “extraordinary mistake”.Raab marked the new department’s launch by announcing a £119 million aid package to tackle the threat of coronavirus and famines in countries such as Yemen, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Central African Republic, the Sahel, South Sudan and Sudan.The UK by law is committed to spend 0.7 per cent of its national income on aid. The amount has dwindled after the coronavirus pandemic severely impacted the economy, raising concerns among campaign groups and other stake-holders.According to Tim Durrant of think-tank Institute for Government, there is still a long way to go before it is known how the new department will manage both aid and diplomacy. While previously the two departments worked closely, they are very different organisations, he said.“Many in the development sector have expressed concern that the new department will not value development expertise as much as DfID did, and that this will lead to an exodus of talent. To stop that happening, ministers and senior officials will have to show that the expertise and experience of officials from both the predecessor departments is valued in the FCDO,” Durrant wrote.The top civil servant in the new department is Philip Barton, who was briefly the British high commissioner in India until recently. He said: “I look forward to bringing together our diplomats and development experts to deliver for the people of the UK and act as a force for good around the world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tying-aid-to-foreign-policy-new-uk-dept-begins-work/story-QsdMaWzndXl9poElVCtUxM.html
04-09-2020||World||Russia presses Germany for more detail on Navalny, urges ‘transparency’||The Kremlin said on Friday that it wanted dialogue with Germany over the case of opposition politician Alexei Navalny and that Russian doctors who treated him initially were much more transparent than the German doctors treating him now. Germany, where Navalny is in hospital, has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent and wants the perpetrators held to account. Russia has until now not opened a criminal investigation and said there is no evidence yet of a crime.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow wanted to find out from Germany what exact substance caused Navalny to fall ill in Siberia last month.“According to the version of our doctors it wasn’t a poisoning,” Peskov said. “The German specialists managed to establish some kind of poisonous substance. We’re counting on a dialogue with our German colleagues.”He added: “Investigative actions are being carried out by our specialists, and if there is confirmation of the presence of poisonous substances in the biological material of the patient (Navalny), then of course legal consequences will follow. We ask everyone to rely on the facts.”Navalny is the most popular and prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, and the German announcement this week that he was poisoned by a nerve agent has raised the possibility of further Western sanctions against Moscow.Separately, a Russian court said on Friday it had rejected a complaint filed by allies of Navalny accusing a top law enforcement body of inaction over what they said was his attempted murder. One of Navalny’s allies accused the Investigative Committee, which handles probes into major crimes, of inaction following a statement they filed to it on Aug. 20 demanding a criminal investigation be opened into Navalny’s attempted murder. The court said the Investigative Committee had passed on the statement by Navalny’s supporters to one of its regional branches in Siberia and asked for it to be reviewed. Kira Yarmysh, Navalny’s spokeswoman, said the court had said their statement had been treated as a “citizen’s appeal”, a legal nuance she said meant it could take up to 30 days for it be looked at. “Anything so they don’t have to start an investigation,” she wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-presses-germany-for-more-detail-on-navalny-urges-transparency/story-ufPWZb43yGOSALavDNb6EJ.html
04-09-2020||World||Russian vaccine trials show strong immune response: The Lancet||Results from two early-phase Russian non-randomised vaccine trials (Sputnik V) released on Friday show that two formulations of a two-part vaccine have a good safety profile with no serious adverse events over 42 days, and induce antibody responses within 21 days.The two-part vaccine includes two adenovirus vectors – recombinant human adenovirus type 26 (rAd26-S) and recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5-S) – which have been modified to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, medical journal The Lancet reported.SARS-CoV-2 causes Covid-19.These types of recombinant adenovirus vectors have been used for a long time, with safety confirmed in many clinical studies. Currently, several candidate Covid-19 vaccines using these vectors and targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been tested in clinical trials.These include an adenovirus type 5 vector-based vaccine (CanSino Biological/Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, China), an adenovirus type 26 vector-based vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, USA), and a vaccine containing a simian adenoviral vector (AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, UK).Also Read: Trust in Covid-19 vaccines could turn on a knife edgeIn July, results from the Oxford vaccine trial showed no early safety concerns, inducing strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system.The journal said secondary outcomes (planned outcome measures that are not as important as the primary outcome measure, but are still of interest in evaluating the effect of an intervention) from the trial suggest the vaccines also produce a T cell (antibody) response within 28 days.The paper reported the findings from two small phase 1/2 trials lasting 42 days – one studying a frozen formulation of the vaccine, and another involving a lyophilised (freeze-dried) formulation of the vaccine.The frozen formulation is envisaged for large-scale use using existing global supply chains for vaccines, while the freeze-dried formulation was developed for hard-to-reach regions as it is more stable and can be stored at 2-8 degrees centigrade.Also Read: Widespread Covid-19 vaccines not expected until mid-2021, says WHOExplaining why they used two adenovirus vectors, lead author Denis Logunov of the N F Gamaleya National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia, says: “When adenovirus vaccines enter people’s cells, they deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, which causes cells to produce the spike protein”.“This helps teach the immune system to recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To form a powerful immune response against SARS-CoV-2, it is important that a booster vaccination is provided”.“However, booster vaccinations that use the same adenovirus vector might not produce an effective response, because the immune system may recognise and attack the vector. This would block the vaccine from entering people’s cells and teaching the body to recognise and attack SARS-CoV-2. For our vaccine, we use two different adenovirus vectors in a bid to avoid the immune system becoming immune to the vector.”The trials took place in two hospitals in Russia, involving healthy adults aged 18-60 years, who self-isolated as soon as they were registered for the trial and remained in hospital for the first 28 days of the trial (from when they were first vaccinated).The authors noted that more research is needed to evaluate the vaccine in different populations, including older age groups, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and people in at-risk groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-vaccine-trials-show-strong-immune-response-the-lancet/story-vKpraD2DskoinjE0lSF9qI.html
04-09-2020||World||Palau invites US military to build bases as China seeks regional clout||The tiny Pacific nation of Palau has urged the United States military to build bases on its territory -- which lies in a region where Washington is pushing back against growing Chinese influence.US Defense Secretary Mark Esper visited the island nation last week and accused Beijing of “ongoing destabilising activities” in the Pacific.Palau President Tommy Remengesau later revealed he told Esper the US military was welcome to build facilities in his country, an archipelago about 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) east of the Philippines.“Palau’s request to the US military remains simple -- build joint-use facilities, then come and use them regularly,” he said in a letter to the US defence chief that his office released this week.The note, addressed to Esper and marked “by hand delivery, Koror. Palau,” said the nation of 22,000 was open to hosting land bases, port facilities and airfields for the US military.Remengesau also suggested a US Coast Guard presence in Palau to help patrol its vast marine reserve, which covers an area of ocean the size of Spain and is difficult for the tiny nation to monitor.While Palau is an independent nation, it has no military and the US is responsible for its defence under an agreement with Washington called the Compact of Free Association.Under the deal, the US military has access to the islands, although it currently has no troops permanently stationed there.“We should use the mechanisms of the Compact to establish a regular US military presence in Palau,” Remengesau said.“The US military’s right to establish defence sites in the Republic of Palau has been under-utilised for the entire duration of the Compact.”- ‘Predatory economics’ -He said bases in Palau would not only increase US military preparedness but also help the local economy, which is struggling as the Covid-19 pandemic has halted tourism, its main industry.Palau was the scene of bloody fighting between US and Japanese forces in World War II but Washington focused on bases in the Philippines and Guam after the war.A US military radar facility is planned for Palau but construction has been suspended because of the pandemic, with the island nation keen to retain its virus-free status.In addition to its close US ties, Palau is also one of Taiwan’s four remaining allies in the Pacific and only 15 worldwide.China, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, has set about trying to win over Taipei’s allies in the Pacific, persuading the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to switch sides last year.Palau has refused, prompting Beijing to effectively ban its tourists from visiting the country in 2018.“It would appear that President Remengesau sees this, in part, as a potential economic solution to counter Palau’s significant dependence on tourism -- including Chinese tourism” said Anna Powles, an expert in Pacific security at New Zealand’s Massey University.“Palau is also feeling the pressures of proximity with respect to China and Beijing’s efforts to persuade Palau to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China,” she told AFP.While not naming China directly, Remengesau told Esper “destabilising actors have already stepped forward to take advantage” of the virus-related economic crises that small island nations were experiencing.“Mr. Secretary, it has been a great relief to hear you, and other top US officials, recognise the complex reality of Indo-Pacific security -- which is as threatened by predatory economics as it is by military aggression,” he wrote.During Esper’s visit last week, which lasted barely three hours, Remengesau said China was offering cheap loans to island nations to win their loyalty.“That has an impact on how people view the relationship with those who help them,” he said.str-ns-arb/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palau-invites-us-military-to-build-bases-as-china-seeks-regional-clout/story-cEO0wecSAdp0aTUzluyavO.html
04-09-2020||World||August cost of gourmet UK: £522 million for 100 million meals||A scheme that ran through August to revive the UK’s hospitality industry hit by the Covid-19 pandemic cost the taxpayer over £522 million for 100 million meals that were 50 percent paid by the Boris Johnson government.Chancellor Rishi Sunak launched the ‘Eat out to Help Out scheme’ under which nearly 85,000 restaurants (including Indian) and other food-serving establishments offered 50 percent discount up to £10 per person Monday to Wednesday in August.Civil servants initially expressed doubts over the scheme’s value for money, but it has been widely hailed a success after attracting thousands of people who lined up outside restaurants across the UK after being hunkered down in homes for months, repositioning the ‘weekend atmosphere’ to Monday-to-Wednesday.Sunak said on Friday, “From the get-go, our mission has been to protect jobs and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before. Today’s figures continue to show ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ has been a success”.Also read: Widespread Covid-19 vaccines not expected until mid-2021, says WHO“I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery. The scheme is just one part of our Plan for Jobs and we will continue to protect, support and create jobs to ensure we come back stronger as a nation,” he added.The £522 million cost to the taxpayer is likely to increase with restaurants having until the end of September to claim back the 50 percent government-funded discount applied to bills. Buoyed by the spike in business, several restaurants have continued to offer the discount on their own.According to Sunak, the scheme’s popularity had helped protect the livelihoods of the 1.8 million people working in the hospitality sector and drive the nation’s economic recovery from Covid-19.According to industry data, restaurant bookings increased by an average of 53 percent on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays throughout the whole of August, compared to the same days in 2019. In July 2020, restaurant bookings were down 54 percent on an average from Mondays to Wednesdays compared to July 2019.On August 31 - the final day of the scheme - bookings were up 216 percent compared to the equivalent day in 2019.Kate Nicholls of trade association UK Hospitality said, “The ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme has been a great success for hospitality. Our members have reported very strong bookings throughout August at a time when the sector really needed a boost”.“It has helped provide a lift in consumer confidence which is going to be key for hospitality businesses as they look to reopen and help rebuild the economy. The scheme has provided a timely boost in trade which will have helped many businesses safeguard jobs all around the UK”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/august-cost-of-gourmet-uk-522-million-for-100-million-meals/story-2CxxAMY2ONax1jMkEiYNuO.html
04-09-2020||World||Mexico struggles with US water debt, suggests audit from United Nations||As Mexico struggles to pay a water debt to the United States, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Thursday he might personally appeal to President Donald Trump for clemency, or invite United Nations experts to audit water payments.Mexico has fallen behind in the amount of water it must send north from its dams under a 1944 treaty, and time is running out to make up the shortfall by the October 24 deadline. But farmers in the northern state of Chihuahua want the water for their own crops.The water treaty has become a burning political issue in northern Mexico, with conspiracy theories and violent protests springing up.López Obrador has advocated paying the debt, noting that Mexico receives four times more water under the treaty from the Colorado River than it contributes in the Rio Grande area. He claims Mexico has enough water in dams to supply local farmers and repay the debt, which built up over a number of years.“I am asking people to help us and trust us,” López Obrador said. “If there is a problem of a lack of water, I will go to Chihuahua immediately and speak to the US president and seek, as I have done in other cases, understanding of our situation.” Given that conspiracy theories have sprung up in Chihuahua that the United States may have overstated it water payments, or paid with infrastructure improvements instead of water, López Obrador said he would be open to a review by outside experts.“On whether the accounting is bad and whether we are in agreement with the UN verifying whether things are being done correctly, of course we are willing to accept that, but we do not want these to be dilatory practices, legal maneuvers that would delay us fulfilling our commitement,” López Obrador said.The US Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, the bilateral body that oversees treaty issues, said it “has not received any proposals from our Mexican counterparts to have the UN come in to audit water deliveries.” Under the 1944 treaty, Mexico owes the United States almost 345,600 acre-feet (426 million cubic meters) this year that must be paid by October 24. Payment is made by releasing water from dams in Mexico. Mexico has fallen badly behind in payments from previous years and now has to quickly catch up on water transfers.In mid-July, the US Commissioner of the water commission, Jayne Harkins, said “they need to increase their water releases to the United States immediately,” adding “Mexico has failed to implement releases promised earlier and continuing to delay increases the risk of Mexico failing to meet its delivery obligation.” The issue is a difficult one for López Obrador, who said he fears the US government could impose tariffs on Mexican products or close borders in retaliation.“Imagine that, for failing to comply, they close the border on us,” the president said.A danger lies also in the series of angry protests the issue has sparked.In late July, demonstrators in Chihuahua burned several government vehicles, blocked railway tracks and set afire a government office and highway tollbooths to protest the release of water from local dams to pay the US.López Obrador has said the protests are being fanned by opposition politicians for their own motives.The expansion of water-hungry crops has meant that Mexico has used 71 per cent of the northward-flowing Conchos River, while under the treaty it should use only 62% per cent of the water, letting the rest of it flow into the Rio Bravo, also known as the Rio Grande, on the border.In the past, Mexico has delayed payments, hoping that periodic tropical storms from the Gulf would create occasional windfalls of water. But while Hanna made landfall in Texas in July, the storm’s rains did not reach far enough inland to fill dams in Chihuahua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-struggles-with-us-water-debt-suggests-audit-from-united-nations/story-wSgwCeaF7fvFtqHHIx8e4O.html
04-09-2020||World||Trust in Covid-19 vaccines could turn on a knife edge||Finding a vaccine against Covid-19 that works and can be distributed widely enough to help stop the pandemic is a global priority. Given the urgency, governments are doing all they can to fund research and incentivize firms to ramp up trials — pre-ordering doses, lowering regulatory barriers to market and granting manufacturers immunity from costly future injury-related lawsuits.But when does the scramble for supply start to look like corner-cutting?Even in a pandemic as deadly as this one, public trust in a vaccine is vulnerable. A July-August Ipsos worldwide poll for the World Economic Forum found that while three in four adults were interested in getting a Covid-19 vaccine if it was available, only 37% had a “strong” interest in doing so. That’s a far cry from the estimated herd immunity threshold of 55% to 82%. The top two reasons cited for not wanting to take a Covid-19 vaccine are a fear of side effects and doubts it will actually work — not extreme “anti-vaxx” sentiment.While an effective vaccine would be an unquestionable public good, you can see how fears of a rush job might take hold. Vladimir Putin’s shock approval last month of a vaccine before large-scale patient trials had been completed is a gamble that could actually set back Russia’s response to Covid-19, as my colleague Max Nisen has argued. In the U.S., Donald Trump wants a vaccine rolled out before Election Day, sparking worries that an eventual green light will be seen as a political decision rather than one based on comprehensive data. On top of that comes the practice of offering legal immunity to makers of vaccines and emergency treatments. While helpful in keeping companies from getting bogged down in court battles, it isn’t exactly conducive to building public trust.For example, the U.S.’s existing “PREP” pandemic legislation shields firms from almost all injury-related lawsuits unless the cause is deemed willful misconduct (a high bar). That’s an “extraordinarily broad” view, explains Wendy Parmet, professor of law at Northeastern University. While financial compensation is available, it is covered entirely by the taxpayer, capped at a lifetime maximum of $311,810 regardless of the injury and decided by a special panel with no opportunity for judicial review. It has served to pour fuel on anti-vaxxers’ outrage, rather than silence them.No wonder some patient advocates have been spooked by lobbying pressure in Europe — where the burden of liability is seen as less favorable for drugmakers — to adopt a system closer to the U.S. one, as reported by the Financial Times. While the European Commission insists it won’t compromise on safety, or change liability rules, it has suggested governments could take on “certain” legal claims.This has led to public anger in the past. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many European governments took on liability risk in exchange for fast-tracked vaccines, some of which ended up being recalled over links to narcolepsy. A withering Council of Europe report at the time warned such deals privatized vaccine profits and socialized the risk of injuries, calling for more balance in future.The race for a Covid-19 vaccine could therefore do with a few speed bumps in the name of trust. The need for large-scale patient trials hasn’t gone away, and more data and disclosure on the road to approvals for public use might help win over an important priority group — health-care workers. They aren’t immune to vaccine skepticism: In France, the birthplace of Louis Pasteur, a 2014 survey found one-quarter of doctors thought some recommended vaccines were useless, and one-fifth thought children were being given too many shots. Given they have the ear of their patients, this is an issue.It should also be possible to preserve an effective supply of vaccine doses without tipping the scales of liability completely away from manufacturers.One idea floated by a British Institute of International & Comparative Law research project is for a new Covid-19 compensation fund designed to deal both sympathetically and efficiently with injury claims without having to go through the courts. Instead of being funded entirely by the taxpayer, it could be part-financed by the private sector, thereby ensuring pharma firms have some skin in the game. This won’t cure vaccine hesitancy overnight, but it might allay some fears.There are limits to engaging with vaccine critics, of course, and no quarter should be given to hardened anti-vaxxers — vaccination has a 200-year history and played a critical role in eradicating the likes of smallpox and polio. But there’s still time to extend a hand to the hesitant.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

It also highlighted the undermining of the independence judges and lawyers in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.“We underscore that general assertions of conduct that threatens ‘national security’ without proper definitions and limitations may severely curtail civic space, the right to participate in public affairs, the rights of minorities and the work of human rights defenders and other civil society actors and their right to associate,” the human rights experts said in the letter dated September 1.The group of experts are independent human rights monitors who work with the UN human rights office, including Fionnuala Ni Aolain, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.Hong Kong imposed a national security law — approved by Beijing — on June 30, following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year against a now-withdrawn extradition bill which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.The national security law makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has insisted that the law will help bring stability back to Hong Kong after months of unrest.Critics say the law effectively ends the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy after it was passed from British to Chinese rule in 1997.The law extends beyond Hong Kong, and targets anyone overseas who violates the legislation, although it is not clear how the law would be enforced. Suspects arrested in Hong Kong under the national security law could also be sent to mainland China to stand trial in exceptional circumstances.The sweeping legislation has drawn criticism for stipulating that the destruction of government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive, while damaging public transportation facilities constitutes an act of terrorism.In the 14-page letter, the experts called on China to address the concerns of the UN, including its plans to enforce “extra-territorial jurisdiction,” to ensure that it complies with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights treaty that China has signed.The document sent by the UN is known as an “other letter,” a communication with governments that examines draft or existing legislation, policy or practice that is deemed out-of-step and noncompliant with international human rights norms.The letter follows the first in-depth appraisal of the Hong Kong security law from the UN human rights system, though officials including UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, have previously expressed concerns about it.Unlike other types of communications from the UN human rights system with governments, which remain confidential for nearly two months to give them time to respond, “other letters” give governments only two days advance notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-raise-concerns-over-hong-kong-s-national-security-law/story-wQhXp8KFsB2Gd6zO2tPDoJ.html
04-09-2020||World||Widespread Covid-19 vaccines not expected until mid-2021, says WHO||The World Health Organization does not expect widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of next year, a spokeswoman said on Friday, stressing the importance of rigorous checks on their effectiveness and safety.None of the candidate vaccines in advanced clinical trials so far has demonstrated a “clear signal” of efficacy at the level of at least 50% sought by the WHO, spokeswoman Margaret Harris said.Also read: ‘India at forefront of research for Covid-19 vaccine’, says PM Modi at US-India summitRussia granted regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine in August after less than two months of human testing, prompting some Western experts to question its safety and efficacy.U.S. public health officials and Pfizer Inc said on Thursday a vaccine could be ready for distribution as soon as late October. That would be just ahead of the U.S. election on Nov. 3 in which the pandemic is likely to be a major factor among voters deciding whether President Donald Trump wins a second term.“We are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,” Harris told a U.N. briefing in Geneva.“This phase 3 must take longer because we need to see how truly protective the vaccine is and we also need to see how safe it is,” she added. This referred to the phase in vaccine research where large clinical trials among people are conducted. Harris did not refer to any specific vaccine candidate.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine frontrunners will soon see their moment of truthAll data from trials must be shared and compared, Harris said. “A lot of people have been vaccinated and what we don’t know is whether the vaccine works...at this stage we do not have the clear signal of whether or not it has the level of worthwhile efficacy and safety...,” she added.The WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance are leading a global vaccine allocation plan known as COVAX that aims to help buy and distribute shots fairly. The focus is on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country such as healthcare workers.COVAX aims to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021, but some countries that have secured their own supplies through bilateral deals, including the United States, have said they will not join.“Essentially, the door is open. We are open. What the COVAX is about is making sure everybody on the planet will get access to the vaccines,” Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/widespread-covid-19-vaccinations-not-expected-until-mid-2021-says-who/story-SwPCBsijF3VjePozsqokjI.html
04-09-2020||World||Will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuse in Tibet if elected: Joe Biden||Slamming China’s plan to further tighten control over Tibet, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if voted to power, his administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in the remote Himalayan region.Noting that the Chinese government recently announced plans to further tighten control over Tibet, thereby continuing to erode the human rights, religious freedoms, and dignity of the Tibetan people, the former US vice president said that these are only the latest efforts by Beijing to crush ethnic minorities that seek to preserve their distinct culture, language and beliefs.“My administration will sanction Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Tibet, and step up support for the Tibetan people, including by expanding Tibetan language services at Radio Free Asia and Voice of America to get information from the outside world into Tibet,” Biden said.Biden vowed that as president he will meet with the Dalai Lama, appoint a new Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, and insist that the Chinese government restore access to Tibet for US citizens, including American diplomats and journalists.“Where (President Donald) Trump has turned a blind eye, a Biden-Harris administration will stand up for the people of Tibet,” Biden said.In his statement, Biden alleged that Trump has been weak on his China policy.“Once again, the silence from President Trump has been deafening, as he focuses instead on his empty trade deal with Beijing and protecting his ‘very good friendship’ with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It’s disgraceful, though not surprising, that Trump is the first American president in three decades who has not met or spoken with His Holiness the Dalai Lama,” he said.“Trump hasn’t even fulfilled the statutory requirement to appoint a Special Coordinator to lead America’s efforts on this vital issue. It’s no wonder China’s leaders believe they have a free hand to deepen repression in Tibet, just as they have in Hong Kong and Xinjiang,” Biden said.A day earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called upon Beijing to enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives without preconditions, to reach a settlement that resolves their differences.“We’re also concerned about Chinese actions in Tibet, in light of the general secretary’s recent calls to ‘Sinicise’ Tibetan Buddhism and fight ‘splittism’ there,” Pompeo told reporters on Wednesday.Chinese President Xi last week said that efforts must be made to fully implement the party’s policies on governing Tibet for a new era. Xi, also the General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party, also spoke of “sinicisation” of Tibetan Buddhism.Tibet remained deeply devoted to Buddhism where the Dalai Lama is revered as the spiritual head despite his self-exile to India since 1959 after China took control of the remote region in 1950. While Beijing views the Dalai Lama, 85, as a separatist who seeks to split Tibet from China, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate says he only seeks greater rights for Tibetans, including religious freedom and autonomy. China also opposes any foreign leader meeting with the Dalai Lama. Since 1959, Tibet has been witnessing periodic incidents of violence, unrest and protest against Beijing. China asserts that Tibet has been its part since the 13th century and will remain so forever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-sanction-chinese-officials-responsible-for-human-rights-abuse-in-tibet-if-elected-joe-biden/story-WV0qo0tyQyVkzd7Z51gR9N.html
04-09-2020||World||New Zealand records first Covid-19 death in over three months||New Zealand recorded its first Covid-19 death in more than three months on Friday when a man in his 50s succumbed to the virus.Health officials said the man was part of a second-wave cluster of infections that emerged in Auckland last month, ending a spell of 102 days free of community transmission in the South Pacific nation.The death at Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital on Friday afternoon takes New Zealand’s death toll from the virus to 23, with the most recent previous fatality on May 24.“I acknowledge the anxiety New Zealanders may be feeling about today’s news, both in the wider community and also for the family and whanau (relatives) grieving over this death,” health chief Ashley Bloomfield said in a statement.“Our thoughts are with his family and community at this time of loss and grief.”The man was reportedly the youngest to die from Covid-19 in New Zealand.Health authorities did not say whether he had a pre-existing medical condition.The Auckland cluster emerged in a family of four and has since grown to 152, including three new cases recorded on Friday.It has proved difficult to eliminate despite a two-and-a-half week lockdown in Auckland that ended on Sunday night.“We have always recognised that further deaths linked to Covid-19 were possible,” Bloomfield said.“Today’s news reinforces the importance of our shared vigilance against Covid-19, the very serious consequences the virus can carry with it.”‘Caution required’While Aucklanders were allowed out of their homes this week, the government limited non-school social gatherings in the city of 1.5 million to 10 people and made masks compulsory on public transport nationwide.Authorities said earlier on Friday, before the latest death was announced, that the restriction would remain in place until at least September 16.The source of the Auckland cluster remains unknown but genome testing indicates it is not linked to the virus strain that New Zealand experienced earlier this year, which was largely eliminated in a seven-week lockdown that began in late March.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said indications were that the Auckland cluster was contained but there was no room for complacency.“We’ve been prepared and, by going hard and early, particularly with Aucklanders pitching in, we look at this early stage to have contained our resurgence,” she told reporters.“But (there are) also areas which suggestion caution is very much required... every country has faced second outbreaks in this global pandemic, and some have turned into significant second waves.”New Zealand, with its low death rate of 23 in a population of five million, has been hailed as one of the countries most successful in handling the virus.Its response to the latest outbreak has included a blitz of around 600,000 tests in recent weeks, accompanied by extensive contact tracing and the pre-emptive quarantine of close contacts linked to confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-records-first-covid-19-death-in-over-three-months/story-czeih8KfW2bYQ2h3JZ8McL.html
04-09-2020||World||President Trump urges Iran to spare life of popular wrestler||President Donald Trump has urged Iran not to execute a popular wrestler who authorities say killed a man during 2018 anti-government rallies. Citing reports on the death sentence for 27-year-old Navid Afkari, Trump said in a Thursday tweet: “... To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him. Thank you!” Judiciary authorities in Iran say Afkari was sentenced to death for the death of Hassan Torkaman, a water supply company employee in the southern city of Shiraz, following an anti-government protest over economic problems. A provincial court in Shiraz sentenced Afkari to death and his brothers Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari to 54 and 27 years in prison, respectively. All three were construction workers. The July verdicts that were reported in August prompted an outcry both in Iran and internationally. Earlier this week, the Afkaris’ mother, Behieh Namjou, in a video that circulated on social media, claimed the three men confessed to the killing under torture. She pleaded to authorities for mercy for her children. The news website of Iran’s judiciary, Mizanonline, on Monday denied Afkari had been tortured and called the Greco-Roman wrestler a “murderer of an innocent citizen.” Hassan Younesi, Afkari’s lawyer, told the semiofficial ILNA news agency that there is no evidence showing Afkari had a role the victim’s death and has requested a retrial. In 2018, protests broke out in several Iranian cities over the country’s falling currency and economic woes that led to a violent encounter between police and protesters. It came after Trump in May that year pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that has sent the country’s economy into free fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-urges-iran-to-spare-life-of-popular-wrestler/story-uixCB2CxeXCLaaYl7A4lBL.html

It noted that following the Iowa caucuses earlier this year, Russian outlets claimed that the result was “fixed in favor of establishment candidates” and that voting system problems had resulted in “ballot manipulation.”The Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment. Russia has denied interfering in US elections.Adam Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the bulletin validated his concern that Russia is seeking to “sow distrust in our democratic process.”By attacking US mail-in ballot integrity, Schiff said, “Russia is echoing destructive and false narratives around vote by mail that President Trump and his enablers, including Attorney General (William) Barr, have been aggressively promoting.”Trump has repeatedly criticized mail-in voting, saying in one July 30 Tweet: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-homeland-security-warns-that-russia-is-trying-to-undermine-confidence-in-mail-in-voting/story-eok8reKvP3hNInszGaUELM.html

04-09-2020||World||Tracing apps may stem Covid-19 spread even when only a few use them: Study||Contact tracing apps can sharply reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus even when only a few people use them, a study published on Thursday by researchers at Google and Oxford University showed.An app used by 15% of the population together with a well-staffed contact-tracing workforce can lead to a 15% drop in infection rates and an 11% drop in Covid-19 deaths, according to statistical modeling by the Alphabet Inc unit and Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine.With a 15% uptake of contact tracing apps alone, the researchers calculated an 8% reduction in infections and 6% reduction in deaths.The findings were based on data from a digital tracing system similar to one jointly developed by Google and Apple Inc.The app made by the two tech giants tracks interactions through Bluetooth signals and anonymously notifies a person if someone they met contracts Covid-19. Six U.S. states and about two dozen countries have launched exposure notification apps based on the Apple-Google technology in recent weeks without major hitches. The researchers simulated the spread of Covid-19 based on interactions at homes, offices, schools and social gatherings in Washington State’s King, Pierce and Snohomish counties.“We see that all levels of exposure notification uptake levels in the UK and the U.S. have the potential to meaningfully reduce the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the population,” Christophe Fraser, the study’s co-lead author and group leader in Pathogen Dynamics at Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Medicine, said in a statement. The researchers noted that a contact tracing app is not a stand-alone intervention. They also said their model still represents a “dramatic simplification of the real world”, and does not take into account cross-county movement of people contributing to disease spread. The research has not been peer-reviewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tracing-apps-may-stem-covid-19-spread-even-when-only-a-few-use-them-study/story-gCI6kOe0S0Mv8nwdj1UC7O.html
04-09-2020||World||Rochester Mayor suspends seven Police officers involved in man’s suffocation death||Seven police officers involved in the suffocation death of Daniel Prude last spring in Rochester, New York, were suspended Thursday by the city’s mayor, who said she was misled for months about the circumstances of the fatal encounter.Prude, 41, who was Black, died when he was taken off life support March 30. That was seven days after officers who encountered him running naked through the street put a hood over his head to stop him from spitting, then held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing.Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren announced the suspensions at a news conference amid criticism that the city kept quiet about Prude’s death for months.Prude “was failed by the police department, our mental health care system, our society, and he was failed by me,” Warren said.The mayor said she only became aware that Prude’s death involved the use of force on Aug. 4, and that Police Chief La’Ron Singletary initially portrayed it as a drug overdose, which is “entirely different” than what she witnessed in body camera video. The mayor said she told the chief she was “deeply, personally and professionally disappointed” in his failure to accurately inform her what happened to Prude.Warren said the seven officers would still be paid because of contract rules and that she was taking the action against the advise of attorneys.“I understand that the union may sue the city for this. They shall feel free to do so,” she said.Warren did not announce any action against Singletary. Approached at a community event, Singletary declined to comment but said he would speak later.Messages left with the union representing Rochester police officers were not immediately returned Thursday.Prude’s death happened just as the coronavirus was raging out of control in New York and received no public attention at the time.His family held a news conference Wednesday and released police body camera video obtained through a public records request that captured his fatal interaction with the officers.The videos and other records detailed how police had gone looking for Prude after he bolted from his brother’s home early on March 23, hours after receiving a mental health evaluation at a hospital.When officers found Prude he was completely naked, on the street in a light snow. He lay on the ground as they handcuffed him, then grew agitated, shouting and writhing and demanding that the officers give him a gun.Officers put a hood over his head because he had been spitting and then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, police video shows.The hoods are intended to protect officers from a detainee’s saliva and have been scrutinized as a factor in the deaths of several prisoners in recent years.The videos show Prude, his voice muffled by the hood, begging the white officer pushing his head down to let him go. As the officer, Mark Vaughn, says, “Calm down” and “Stop spitting,” Prude’s shouts became anguished whimpers and grunts.“OK, stop. I need it. I need it,” Prude says.The officer lets Prude go after about two minutes when he stops moving and falls silent. Officers then notice water coming out of Prude’s mouth and call over waiting medics, who start CPR.A medical examiner concluded that Prude’s death was a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” The report lists excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, as contributing factors.In his final months, Prude, who was known to his Chicago-based family as “Rell,” had been having mental health problems and had been going back and forth between his Chicago home and his brother’s place in Rochester, relatives said.“My father should have been met with a mental health specialist. He should not have been killed in the street,” his 18-year-old daughter, Tashyra Prude, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “He did not deserve that. He was treated like an animal. And I want this to be a step toward justice for not only my father, but justice for people like Breonna Taylor, who were killed by the police.”New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office took over the investigation of the death in April. It is still not complete.“The Prude family and the greater Rochester community deserve answers, and we will continue to work around the clock to provide them,” James said in a statement Thursday.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement that he watched video of Prude’s fatal encounter with police Wednesday night.“What I saw was deeply disturbing and I demand answers,” he said, adding that he was confident James’ investigation would be thorough. “For the sake of Mr. Prude’s family and the greater Rochester community I am calling for this case to be concluded as expeditiously as possible.”Demonstrators came out on Thursday evening for a second straight night, about 200 of them gathering near the street corner where Prude was restrained by police. Some activists felt suspending the officers was not enough.“This is a cover up and honestly our mayor, our police chief, they should be bought up on criminal charges,” said Justin Morris.Earlier Thursday, Prude’s brother, Joe Prude, said all his younger brother wanted that morning was “somebody to grab him up and help him.”“No matter how you look at the situation, the man was absolutely in his birthday suit, handcuffed behind his back, on the ground already, in freezing weather,” Prude’s brother, Joe Prude, said. “How could you sit here and label that man a threat to you when he’s already cuffed up? How could you throw a bag over his head?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rochester-mayor-suspends-seven-police-officers-involved-in-man-s-suffocation-death/story-mMs89KiNNG2z3fhiGEoUPN.html
04-09-2020||World||New York pushes ahead with more reopenings as Covid-19 cases rise in US Midwest||Casinos statewide will welcome back visitors in New York and malls in New York City will reopen doors to shoppers as new coronavirus infections remain low in what was once the U.S. hot spot of the pandemic, even while cases mount in Midwestern states.Next Wednesday, New York City malls will be allowed to reopen at 50% capacity and casinos statewide can reopen at 25% capacity, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday.“Thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers, we are at a point in our fight against this virus where we can safely reopen malls in New York City as long as they adhere to strict health and safety protocols,” Cuomo said. “Masks, enhanced air ventilation systems, and social distancing will be mandatory.”The governor also waded into the hotly debated issue of indoor dining in New York City, saying during a conference call with reporters that the final decision rested with the state.New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson came out on Wednesday in favor of allowing indoor dining in the city, which is home to a thriving restaurant industry that was battered by the pandemic.“It’s time to allow indoor dining in New York City with reduced capacity and clear guidance to ensure social distancing and safety,” Johnson said in a statement.Cuomo said he would like to see restaurants reopen for indoor dining in the city but that compliance and enforcement remained a major hurdle in doing so.“We open restaurants, that’s going to complicate by the hundreds if not thousands the number of establishments that need to be monitored,” he said.Indoor dining is allowed in New York state with the exception of New York City, where more than 300 restaurateurs recently filed a class-action lawsuit seeking $2 billion in damages, according to media reports.On Wednesday, gyms in New York City opened for the first time in months. They must operate at 33% capacity, with floors rearranged so patrons can exercise more than 6 feet (1.8 m)apart.SHIFTING TRENDSNew York has seen by far the most deaths from COVID-19 of any U.S. state, more than 32,000, but its rate of new infections has dropped to among the lowest in the country.Nationally, new cases of coronavirus have fallen for six weeks in a row, but infections are surging in the Midwest. Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting the highest percentage of positive test results in the country - over 20% in each state.Iowa, with a population of more than 3.1 million people, saw over 8,300 new cases last week, up 116%. That compared with about 4,400 new cases in New York state, which has more than 19.4 million residents, according to a Reuters analysis.Cases also rose 27% last week in Minnesota and 34% in Indiana.Bars were ordered shut in certain Iowa counties last week. But in Michigan, a Midwestern state where infections have held steady at about 5,000 new cases a week, residents will be able to enjoy gyms, swimming pools and organized sports starting next Wednesday, albeit with safety measures in place.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told state officials across the country to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as early as October, according to documents made public by the agency on Wednesday.The vaccines would be given first to healthcare workers, national security personnel and nursing homes, the agency said in the documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-pushes-ahead-with-more-reopenings-as-covid-19-cases-rise-in-us-midwest/story-UKjMYElUvTw6SYNifSFCfO.html
04-09-2020||World||US to allow Air India to conduct ground handling at airports: Official||The United States has announced that it plans to restore Air India’s ability to self-conduct its ground handling operations at American airports. Issuing an order in this regard, US Department of Transportation reversed its previous order of July 2019 that had suspended the right of Air India to self-handle at US airports. The Department and other US government agencies have continued to work with the government of India towards satisfactory resolution of this matter. In that connection, recent positive developments have led the department to tentatively determine that the public interest now calls for removal of the permit condition we had imposed in order 2019-7-9, said the order issued by Joel Szabat, Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs.“We therefore have tentatively decided to amend Air India’s permit to remove that condition,” the Department of Transportation said. Stakeholders and public have 21 days to respond to this proposal, before it can be finalised and enforced. The order comes a day after the Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, had a conversation with the Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. “India and the US have partnered in Aviation sector during these difficult times,” the ambassador tweeted.The order also relieves Air India of any further reporting requirement regarding its ground handling arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-air-india-to-conduct-ground-handling-at-airports-official/story-QU716NtR6hPTayGuLHEFmK.html
04-09-2020||World||Brazil hits 4 million Covid cases while life gets back to normal||Brazil reached the mark of 4 million confirmed coronavirus cases, doubling the infection count in two months as large parts of the Latin American nation emerge from isolation.The country reported 43,773 new cases on Thursday, pushing the toll to 4,041,638. Deaths rose by 834 to 124,614, according to data from the Health Ministry. Globally, the nation lags only the U.S. in both cases and deaths from the disease, though India is fast closing in when it comes to infections. On a per capita basis, though, Brazil recently passed the U.S. and Chile for most deaths per million people and is primed to overtake Italy for the 5th spot globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Brazil has been adding about a million cases a month -- in mid-July, it had 2 million confirmed infections -- as the virus hits areas of the country that were spared earlier in the pandemic. But the pace of new infections appears to have slowed since mid-August. After four weeks with over new 300,000 cases, figures for the past two weeks have been closer to 265,000. The number of weekly deaths fell to below 6,500, the lowest since May.The rich Southeast region of the country, home to highly-populated states like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, continues to be the hardest hit region, with more than 1.4 million cases, followed by the Northeast with 1.1 million. The North of the country, largely blanketed by the Amazon rain forest and where hospital beds are scarce, has the highest mortality rate in the nation: 73.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the rate seen in the more developed South.Brazil’s response to the pandemic -- no national approach, a shortage of testing and a push to reopen before the disease receded -- turned the country into a global hotspot.President Jair Bolsonaro pushed the scientifically-unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as a solution to the outbreak and criticized severe lockdown measures implemented by governors. Contradicting policies made predicting when the infection rates would recede even more difficult than it already was in a country of 210 million people where some states are the size of France and where many live in poverty and can’t afford not to work.Researchers from the PUC University in Rio say the virus’s reproductive rate rose to 1.01 after more than a month of decline, though it varies wildly across the country. It’s below 1 in 20 states and the Federal District, and above 1.5 in Santa Catarina, which was largely spared early on in the pandemic but has seen cases spike to over 180,000 from 87,000 in the past month.The group forecasts cases will top 4.55 million by mid-September, with deaths reaching 136,000.The pandemic brought on the largest economic slump on record, a 11.4% decline in the second quarter from a year ago. But Bank of America said last week that its internal data indicates there was a strong rebound in Brazil’s economic activity. The bounce was so significant that BofA says growth as measured by the central bank’s economic activity index, or IBC-Br, may have returned to pre-Covid levels as social isolation measures wane and mobility indicators continue to rise.Over recent weeks, local media have repeatedly shown pictures of packed beaches and parks, and crowds gathered at recently reopened bars and restaurants. The state of Sao Paulo, which has been the epicenter in the country since the first reported case in late February, has seen isolation rates fall to around 40%, from as high as 60% back in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hits-4-million-covid-cases-while-life-gets-back-to-normal/story-F3oQnuSXg0LxehfAzklQVO.html

So far, 76 wealthy nations committed to joining the COVAX effort.UNICEF said the 28 vaccine manufacturers had shared their annual productions plans for Covid-19 vaccines through 2023. A UNICEF market assessment “revealed that manufacturers are willing to collectively produce unprecedented quantities of vaccines over the coming 1-2 years.”But drugmakers have signaled the projections are “highly dependent on, among other things, whether clinical trials are successful, advance purchase agreements are put in place, funding is confirmed, and regulatory and registration pathways are streamlined.”Safe and effective vaccines are seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 864,000 lives globally.UNICEF’s new role with COVAX stems from its status as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world. The U.N. agency said it procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-says-drugmakers-can-produce-unprecedented-vaccine-quantities-for-covid-19/story-Bv1m8HR0S0N7Ftz67lf16O.html
04-09-2020||World||Over 250 arrested since Jacob Blake’s shooting in Wisconsin: Police||More than 250 people have been arrested since the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, with more than half from outside the county that the southeastern Wisconsin city is in, police reported Thursday.Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by a white police officer on Aug. 23, sparking three nights of unrest that resulted in roughly two dozen fires and damage to numerous downtown businesses. Two nights after the shooting, prosecutors say 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two demonstrators and wounded a third. His attorney claims it was self defense.Kenosha police updated arrest figures Thursday, saying of the 252 people arrested, 132 did not live in Kenosha County. Rittenhouse came from his home in Antioch, Illinois, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) from Kenosha, to join others who walked the streets with rifles saying they were there to protect businesses from damage.Four people arrested filed a federal civil rights lawsuit Wednesday, alleging that police were not arresting pro-police demonstrators like Rittenhouse who were breaking a curfew, while targeting others. The city’s attorney called the lawsuit baseless and said it should be dismissed.The city on Wednesday ended a curfew that had been in place since August 24, a sign of calming tensions in the city of about 100,000 midway between Milwaukee and Chicago. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday to thank law enforcement for their efforts and his Democratic rival Joe Biden was in Wisconsin on Thursday and met with members of Blake’s family and Kenosha community leaders.The police said damage to city property was about $2 million and damage to county property was about $385,000.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was investigating more than 23 fires, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-250-arrested-since-jacob-blake-s-shooting-in-wisconsin-police/story-gReB4cbwvKXcmLJCtn3HfN.html
04-09-2020||World||Too many children are going hungry amid Covid-19 pandemic||It’s hard to believe that America’s legislators, whatever their political leanings, would willingly allow millions of children to go hungry. Yet that is what’s happening during the Covid-19 crisis — and unless Congress acts quickly, the problem’s about to get worse.In one of the world’s wealthiest nations, food insecurity should not be an issue. Yet it is. Even in good times, the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) falls far short of reaching everyone in need. As of 2018, some 2.5 million children lived in households that reported being unable to give their kids enough to eat. Such deprivation has long-term consequences for health and broader well-being.Now, Covid-19 is testing the safety net like never before. As of late July, children faced food shortages in 19% of the households where they lived, according to the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. That’s about 16 million children going hungry, more than triple the peak of the 2008 recession. Black and Hispanic families have been among the hardest hit: Their rates of child food insufficiency were 31% and 27%, respectively.Congress is making things worse by allowing relief measures to lapse. Expanded unemployment benefits, which provided an added $600 a week through July 31, reduced food insufficiency by an estimated 30%. Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfers, which aimed to compensate families whose kids missed free or reduced-price lunches due to school closures in spring, had a similar effect through the summer. Without such supports, the number of kids going hungry is likely to double. It’s already on the rise.Extending unemployment benefits and school-lunch compensation would help maintain the status quo. Ultimately, though, what’s needed is an ambitious commitment to food security. Congress should redesign the supplemental nutrition program to ensure adequate food for all who need it, and automatically boost benefits during recessions. This would have the further benefit of providing an especially effective countercyclical stimulus: Research suggests that each dollar of food assistance can generate $1.50 or more in economic activity, because it’s so well targeted to people who will use it.At the very least, legislators should increase food assistance until the crisis recedes, as they did with good results during the last recession. The cost is relatively small. A 30% increase in the maximum benefit would raise it above the Department of Agriculture’s current and inadequate statutory benchmark, roughly aligning it with the agency’s Low-Cost Food Plan — and would probably cost less than $50 billion a year while in effect.This is a good use of taxpayers’ dollars. Congress should act without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-many-children-are-going-hungry-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-J9wxKCL89ohrY1YsyPEKKI.html
04-09-2020||India||Sushant case: Rhea’s brother among 2 held||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is looking into allegations of illegal drug use by the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his actor-girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, arrested Rhea’s brother Showik and Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda on Friday night. Two others –Bandra residents Basit Parihar and Kaizan Ebrahim – were also arrested on Friday on charges of peddling drugs, taking the number of arrests in the case to seven. KPS Malhotra, deputy director of NCB, said, “We have informed the families of Showik and Miranda and both have been arrested under several sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.” Parihar was produced before a magistrate’s court which remanded him in NCB custody till September 9. Showik, Samuel and Ebrahim will be produced before a magistrate’s court on Saturday. The other three arrested for drug peddling are Zaid Vilatra, 20 (arrested on Thursday), Abbas Lakhani, and Karan Arora (arrested on August 27-28). Lakhani and Arora were arrested based on a specific input in another case and curated marijuana was seized from their possession. Their questioning led NCB to Vilatra, who told officials that he ran an eatery in Bandra (West), but was suffering losses owing to the lockdown and so started to peddle drugs. Vilatra alleged he was in touch with Ebrahim and Parihar. Parihar allegedly told NCB that he used to procure drugs from Vilatra and Ebrahim, on the instructions of Chakraborty’s brother Showik who asked him to give it to Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda. Showik’s chats on a messaging application showed that on March 17, he shared Vilatra’s contact number with Miranda and asked to pay him ₹10,000 for 5gm. Miranda and Vilatra were tracked to the same location on March 17, said NCB officials, without elaborating on what the purchase was for.A senior IPS officer from NCB said, “We conducted searches at Miranda’s and Showik’s homes and collected some evidence. The investigation is at a preliminary stage and details of the evidence gathered can’t be revealed at the moment.” NCB officials said they have recovered Indian currency worth ₹955,750 and foreign currency – US$ 2081, 180 British Pound, 15 Dirham – from Vilatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-case-rhea-s-brother-among-2-held/story-uj3hZxmXNdMC8AclIha6ZP.html

04-09-2020||India||States told to review parole, furlough rules||New DelhiUnion home ministry has said that the release of prisoners on parole and furlough is not an “absolute right” and should be allowed only to selective prisoners on the basis of well-defined norms of eligibility while asking all the states and union territories to review the guidelines in this regard. Terrorists, people involved in heinous crimes, riots, dacoity or those involved in smuggling of drugs should not be eligible for release on parole or furlough as it could have adverse impact on society, the ministry said in its letter to states and UTs on Thursday. Decisions regarding release of prisoners on parole or remission in their imprisonment is taken by state governments on the basis of conduct, as prisons come under the state governments.The MHA suggested new guidelines should include that parole and furlough may not be granted as a matter of routine and may be decided by a committee of officers and behavioural experts keeping in view all relevant factors, especially for inmates sentenced for sexual offences, serious crimes such as murder, child abduction and violence. Officials, who requested anonymity, said that the advisory has been sent to states/UTs as there are reports from different parts of the country that many of those released from jails due to the coronavirus disease pandemic on parole were indulging in crimes. Referring to the Model Prison Manual, 2016, the MHA said prisoners whose immediate presence in the society may be considered dangerous or otherwise prejudicial to public peace should not be considered for release. The MHA said that prisoners convicted for heinous offences such as dacoity, terrorist crimes, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of narcotic and psychotropic substances, “may not report back to the prison after completion of the furlough period and should not be released”. It added that concerns have also been raised regarding recidivism, as in some cases prison inmates on temporary release from prison either on parole or furlough or on premature release before completion of their sentence, have re-offended or indulged in criminal activities. “This underlines the need to carefully regulate the grant of parole, furlough, remission and premature release to prisoners,” the MHA said. It is, therefore, important for state authorities to review their guidelines to ensure that the facility and concession given to inmates, by way of parole, furlough and premature release, etc, with the intention of providing them relief and rehabilitation, “is not abused and misused by them and their advantage does not turn into disadvantage and nuisance for the society at large”, the ministry said. The MHA suggested that expert psychologist, criminologist and correctional administration experts as members of the Sentence Review Board, should be included in the committee which decides grant of parole and furlough to inmates. Neeraj Kumar, former Director General of Tihar said, “I believe that nobody should be labeled a hardened criminal or person involved in heinous crime and parole, furlough or premature release should be decided in a non-partisan, non-biased manner on the basis of behaviour of the person during his stay in jail and not the crime he is in for”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-told-to-review-parole-furlough-rules/story-YdShXveYr5PxyV4ZoUMnuN.html
04-09-2020||India||Strictly adhere to time limit in probes against officials: Shah to MHA depts||New DelhiUnion home minister Amit Shah has ordered the departments under him to complete departmental enquiries against officers facings allegations of corruption or administrative lapses in prescribed time limits. A communication, sent to all the divisions and organisations under the ministry of home affairs (MHA), said, “It is observed by the Hon’ble home minister that the prescribed schedule of time limits in conducting investigations and departmental inquiries is not being followed by the departments/divisions as per the instructions issued by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)”. HT has seen the communication.According to the guidelines issued by CVC in May 2000 on time limits for departmental inquiries, once a complaint against an officer in any government department is received, a decision on whether it involves a vigilance angle or not has to be taken within a month and the department inquiry should be completed within six months. The letter sent to all divisions under the MHA and chief vigilance officers (CVOs) of all departments on behalf of Shah says that there should be strict compliance of the guidelines. The departments which report to the home minister include all central paramilitary forces - Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Assam Rifles, National Security Guard (NSG), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Natgrid, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), National Civil Defence College (NCDC) etc. The divisions in MHA under Shah’s authority are J&K, Ladakh, left wing extremism (LWE), border management, foreigners’ division, cyber crime, Centre-State division, prisons and others which are crucial in making day-to-day decisions on internal security. Officials familiar with the development, who didn’t wish to be named, said many inquiries linger on for years without any reasons. As reported by HT last month, the anti-corruption watchdog – Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) – had also written to all CVOs in all ministries and government departments to complete the disciplinary proceedings against officers facing inquiries for corruption or administrative lapses in time even if they were to conduct the proceedings through video-conferencing amid the Covid-19 pandemic. CVOs posted in every government department are responsible for finalising a disciplinary proceeding against officials indulging in any activity in violation of the norms or forwarding serious corruption complaints to CVC so that a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can be requested if required. The CVC has repeatedly reminded government departments to finish their disciplinary proceedings in time. A July 2018 letter, written by CVC, to all departments stated that “the unexplained delays lead to Central Administrative Tribunals (CATs) and the high courts quashing the chargesheet(s) on the sole ground that the concerned disciplinary authorities had issued chargesheets to the delinquents (officer under investigation) after very long periods of commission of alleged misconduct etc and also for unexplained delays in conducting disciplinary enquiries”. “More so, such long delays in finalizing disciplinary matters are not unjust to officials who may be finally exonerated, but helps the guilty to evade punitive action,” CVC had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strictly-adhere-to-time-limit-in-probes-against-officials-shah-to-mha-depts/story-C49Fh29fibgbewrxl5XQ0O.html
04-09-2020||India||Life after Section 377: Read what four LGBTQ people have to say||Two years after the Supreme Court decriminalised homosexuality by reading down the colonial-era section of the Indian Penal Code, four young members of the queer community speak about what’s next for themAnish Gawande, 24, writer and translatorIn 2018, Anish Gawande, then 22, worked as a campaign aide for key politicians such as Ashok Chavan and Milind Deora of the Congress Party in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections. A few months after he joined the team, the Supreme Court verdict on Section 377 was delivered, decriminalizing homosexuality. “There were jokes made behind my back, but there was always an openness to engage,” he said. A few months later, as the country went to polls, Gawande and Smriti Deora co-founded Pink List India, as an archive of what the candidates had said of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community and its rights. Today, Pink List offers more: Every single statement made by any Lok Sabha Parliamentarian on LGBTQI issues. “While there is an important legal battle for equality that must be fought in courtrooms, it’s time we go beyond requesting rights and start demanding rights. There is an avenue to discuss queerness in politics.”Megha Nandi, 25, graphic designerMegha Nandi, 25, still recalls the first Pride parade that she attended. It was a year before the Supreme Court verdict, and only a clutch of women had gathered at Hazratganj, the historic market area in the heart of Lucknow. “I felt empowered to be myself,” Nandi said, adding that she wanted other women to feel this way too. In February, she started an Instagram account called Humjinsi. “After the verdict, was easier to talk about the issue, and we could talk more openly about it,” she said. Many young women reached out to her through private messages over the social media platform and a group of them met up a coffee shop in Hazratganj Chowk. However, a year on, Nandi has closed her account. “There is still a lot of anxiety about meeting; parents don’t allow them to step out, and so many can’t show up at meetings,” she said. “If anyone wants to connect, they can reach me on my personal account,” she said.Sia, 20, tech professionalWhen Sia, 20, came out to her family as a transwoman, they hired men who abducted her one night and dragged her to a nearby “conversion” centre. She was forced to live with 170 men without her consent because her parents thought that living alongside men would “cure” her. However, what she faced at the centre was daily violence. But the judgment on September 6, 2018 changed everything. “I got some privilege. They didn’t behave so badly with me. The verdict gave me courage. I started to raise my voice and say I had rights, and that the Supreme Court had affirmed this,” she said. Now a professional with Tech Mahindra, Sia feels that the verdict helped her demand equal rights. “They treat us as equals. Not as something different. This is a big change.” Ramesh, 23, studentRamesh V, grew up in rural Andhra Pradesh and said he was unaware of terms like LGBT (an umbrella term that denotes the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community) until he went to college. Moreover, coming from a poor Dalit family, he said there were not many resources to help him come to terms with her sexuality. The Supreme Court judgment against section 377 was when his friends started talking about homosexuality – and this helped him start exploring the LGBT community. “I am thankful to the court that it saw that people like me have rights. But to be honest, it didn’t change the attitude of my family and neighbours,” he said. Ramesh said he dreads going back home because not only is he forced to act straight but also fend off talk about his marriage. But in the city, too, he is bogged down by what he calls rampant discrimination that he faces as a Dalit student. “The court can give us rights but I wonder if it can take discrimination away,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-after-section-377-read-what-four-lgbt-people-have-to-say/story-Gr32nT7pEjneuVM552zqQI.html
04-09-2020||India||BRICS foreign ministers express concern at conflicts, call for resolution through dialogue||The Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping on Friday expressed concern at violence and conflicts in different parts of the world and said such situations should be resolved peacefully through political dialogue. The joint statement issued after a virtual meeting of Brics foreign ministers didn’t refer to any particular conflict, and the grouping has a convention of not taking up bilateral issues between its members. However, the meeting was held against the backdrop of the months-long border standoff between India and China, two of the grouping’s key members. “The ministers expressed concerns at the rise of violence and continuing conflicts in different parts of the world that have significant impact at both the regional and international levels,” the joint statement said. “They concurred that, irrespective of their historic background and distinctive nature, conflicts should be resolved by peaceful means and diplomatic engagement through political dialogue and negotiations in line with principles and norms of international law, particularly the UN Charter,” it added. The ministers pointed to the UN Security Council resolution 2532 of 2020 demanding a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations, with the exception of operations against terror groups sanctioned by the Security Council, and calling for a “durable humanitarian pause” amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The ministers also “underlined the imperative of dialogue to address increasing international peace and security challenges through political and diplomatic means”, the joint statement said. A readout from the external affairs ministry said the discussions at the meeting centred round an overview of the global situation, including “new threats and challenges” and “regional hot spots”. The Brics meeting was to have been held in Moscow on September 11 but was advanced to Friday and made a virtual event after the foreign ministers of Brazil and South Africa said they couldn’t travel because of the pandemic. Besides external affairs minister S Jaishankar, it was joined by China’s Wang Yi, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, who chaired the meeting. Brazil’s Ernesto Araújo, and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Pandor. Jaishankar spoke to Wang soon after the June 15 clash at Galwan Valley, and the two leaders have joined several virtual multilateral meetings. Jaishankar and Wang are also expected to meet on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow on September 10. The foreign ministers also discussed Brics cooperation at international forums, including on key issues on the 75 UN General Assembly agenda, and reviewed progress in activities under the grouping. Jaishankar said Brics has an important role to play in the wake of grave challenges in the economic, political, social and health fields. He highlighted India’s “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiative to foster mutually beneficial global economic engagement in economy, infrastructure, technology, demography and demand. He also emphasised the need to reform the UN to reflect global realities and called for expansion of the Security Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories. He also called for reformed multilateralism, including reform of international bodies such as the WTO, IMF and WHO. Jaishankar also highlighted the issue of terrorism and sought enhanced Brics cooperation in countering it. He expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of the Brics counter-terrorism strategy. India is set to become the Brics chair in 2021, and Jaishankar said the country will continue to strengthen cooperation under the grouping’s three pillars of political and security cooperation, economics and trade and people-to-people contacts. The ministers also reaffirmed support for a transparent, open, inclusive and non-discriminatory rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied by the WTO, the joint statement said. They appreciated the role of the New Development Bank (NDB) in infrastructure and sustainable development financing and welcomed the NDB Board of Governors’ decision to establish an emergency assistance facility of up to $10 billion and the approval of four loans for a total of $4 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-foreign-ministers-express-concern-at-conflicts-call-for-resolution-through-dialogue/story-en76SLY7n7nMnTQLX4yKTN.html

The Railways had said last month that the high-speed rail corridor is expected to be completed on time despite the Covid-19 outbreak.The project has had to contend with issues ranging from protests by landowners to rising costs because of a widening gap between the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen; 80 percent of the Rs 1 trillion needed to fund the project will come from a 20-year Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) loan.Also read: ‘Vaccine nationalism’ would prolong coronavirus pandemic, says WHO chief TedrosThe estimated total cost of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad project is Rs 1.08 trillion, of which 81 percent cost is planned for funding through the loan from the JICA, may be escalated, officials said. “Last year, the company had floated nine civil work tenders which could not be opened due to the pandemic. The deadline of the project is likely to be shifted further due to this,” the officials added.Centre has signed a loan agreement with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for providing Rs 15,000 crore, of the total loan amount of Rs 88,000 crore.“It is difficult to assess the impact of the pandemic (Covid 19) on the project as it still continuing,” NHRCL spokesperson told Hindustan Times.“As per the feasibility study, the target date for the completion of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is December 2023. About 63 percent land has been acquired for the project and tenders for civil works for 345 kilometres out of 508 kilometres alignment (68 percent of civil works) is already floated. This includes six MAHSR stations (including one underground station in Mumbai). The works related to utility diversion are progressing well and the construction of Sabarmati passenger hub (a multi-modal hub) in Sabarmati, Gujarat has also started. The hostel building of High-Speed Training Institute (which is presently being used for Covid patients) and training tracks in Vadodara are also completed,” he said.One section of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor is likely to be tendered out within three months after nearly 90 percent of the land acquisition for the project is completed, according to railway board chairman VK Yadav, Hindustan Times had reported on August 4.Yadav had said there has been a “slowdown” in land acquisition due to Covid-19.“As on date, we have acquired 60 percent of the land... Due to Covid situation there was some slowdown in land acquisition but it has started picking up now and we are sure over the coming six months, most of the land will be acquired,” he had told HT earlier. Indian Railways has so far completed 76 percent of land acquisition in Gujarat and 24 percent in Maharashtra, he said.The national transporter has also begun feasibility studies on seven other potential high-speed corridors to gauge their financial viability and estimated traffic they will attract. The Indian Railways is exploring whether the corridors would be viable to run high-speed Bullet Trains with speeds above 300 kmph.The seven proposed corridors are Delhi-Varanasi, Varanasi-Howrah, Delhi–Ahmedabad, Mumbai–Nagpur, Mumbai–Hyderabad, Chennai-Mysore and Delhi–Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bullet-train-project-may-face-delays-due-to-covid-19/story-mxCkmXIRlZ4kYrKMPnSfQI.html

While the top court fined Bhushan with a paltry sum of Rs 1, the judgment left enough scope to also ensure that Bhushan’s license to practice law can be suspended.“Pursuant to the conviction in a criminal case, the Bar Council of India (BCI) can suspend the enrolment, if it so desires,” the judgment said at paragraph 89.The Bar Council of India has now cited the top court’s judgment to order the Bar Council of Delhi, where Bhushan is enrolled, to examine Bhushan’s tweets and take action as per law.Also read: Cash-strapped govt cuts non-essential expenditures amid Covid-19 crisis“The BCI is of the view that the tweets and statements made by Prashant Bhushan and the judgment of the Supreme Court need thorough study and examination… the General Council of the BCI has unanimously resolved to direct the Bar Council of Delhi, where Bhushan is enrolled as an advocate, to examine the matter and proceed as per law and decide the same as expeditiously as possible,” a press release issued by BCI stated.Section 24A of the Advocates Act provides that a person shall not be admitted as an advocate on roll of the bar council of the concerned state if he/ she is convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude. Section 35 of the Act lays down that if an advocate is found guilty of professional or other misconduct, such an advocate can be suspended from practice for a limited period or their license can be cancelled altogether.

BJP leaders in some parts of north Bengal also alleged that their rallies were stopped by police on the ground of violation of social distancing norms. “People’s verdict will have the last word. Have faith in us. The TMC government’s days are numbered. The countdown has begun,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said at the party’s main programme held near the statue of Gandhi on Mayo Road in central Kolkata. Also read: Cash-strapped govt cuts non-essential expenditures amid Covid-19 crisisSimilar programmes were held in every district where senior state leaders took part. There was a clash between TMC and BJP workers at Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar district when the ruling party workers allegedly damaged some vehicles in which the BJP workers were travelling. In Kolkata, Ghosh also cautioned the police and alleged that the force was being controlled by the TMC. “Be prepared for the day when we come to power. BJP workers are framed in false cases and put in jail. They are murdered and their bodies are hung from trees,” said Ghosh. Reacting to his statements, TMC Lok Saba MP Saugata Roy said, “How many times have Dilip Ghosh, or any BJP leader for that matter, have been to jail? These are all baseless allegations. The TMC will remain in power. His dream will never be fulfilled.”To mount pressure on the Centre, the TMC will organize agitation in every community block and municipal ward of the state on September 8 and 14. “The states cannot be forced to borrow from the Reserve Bank of India to meet the shortfall in revenue from Goods and Services Tax (GST). Also, the Centre is yet to release funds for relief and rehabilitation of people affected by cyclone Amphan. It has given only Rs 1,000 crore,” said TMC spokesperson Om Prakash Mishra. “On September 20, we will hold another state-wide agitation against privatization of public sector units,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-chief-says-tmc-govt-s-days-are-numbered/story-CPaoKKbWR2Pr2wBD1XjrzO.html
04-09-2020||India||Crisis along LAC unprecedented, can’t be business as usual with China: Foreign secretary Shringla||The situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is “unprecedented” and it “cannot be business as usual” in the relationship with China until the status quo is restored on the disputed border, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Friday. The standoff on the LAC is one of the most serious challenges India has faced in several decades and the current “magnitude of amassing of forces” on the border hasn’t been witnessed in recent years, Shringla said while speaking on the theme of Indian diplomacy amid the Covid-19 pandemic during a lecture organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA). “We have had an unprecedented situation on the India-China border, we have never had this sort of situation since 1962. We have lost the lives of soldiers which has not happened in the last 40 years,” he said, referring to the brief but bitter border war fought almost six decades ago. “We have also seen that there has been an attempt to take unilateral action that seems to be an effort to change facts on the ground. We will be firm and resolute in resisting this, and as far as we are concerned, there will be no compromise on our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Shringla said hours ahead of a planned meeting between the Indian and Chinese defence ministers on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow. Though India remains willing to talk with China and has kept the lines of communication open amid the pandemic, Shringla warned that it “cannot be business as usual unless there is peace and tranquillity in our border areas”. He added, “The normal bilateral relationship will be affected. There is a linkage between what is happening on the border and our larger relationship and that fact is very, very evident.” The only way to take things forward will be “revert to the status quo that existed before such aggressive actions took place” and to de-escalate and disengage frontline troops, he said. India have held several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic level and even contacts between the two foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues haven’t led to a breakthrough since the standoff emerged in the open in May. Following a fresh faceoff on the south bank of Pangong Lake, there have been four rounds on inconclusive talks between brigade commanders on the ground. Shringla described the standoff as “one of the most serious challenges we have faced in many decades” but India remains committed to preserving its territorial integrity and sovereignty. He also focused on how India’s foreign policy is coping with the challenges brought on by the pandemic, which he described as “perhaps the greatest shock to the international system since World War 2”. The Covid-19 crisis has made India take a close look at the fundamental drivers of globalisation and the deficiencies and limitations of the existing global system, he added. At a time when every country is looking at its own interests, there is a need for some sort of balance and to broaden the agenda of the international system and institutions, he said. The world order also has to focus on ensuring that a Covid-19 vaccine is accessible and affordable, and that there is “some level of equitable distribution” for it, he added. India also has been at the forefront of digital diplomacy because its “global spread of interests and stakes makes us vulnerable on many fronts”, Shringla said. The government is now working to make the country the nerve centre of global supply chains and promoting it as an alternative manufacturing hub and innovation destination, he said. The government remains committed to its “neighbourhood first” policy, Shringla said. However, he acknowledged that the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) had taken a back seat to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) because “one of our neighbours has been consistently involved in blocking Saarc in all of its constructive activities”. Though Shringla didn’t name any country, it was obvious he was referring to Pakistan. Bimstec, he said, had emerged as an alternative mechanism because it was a vital link between South and Southeast Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crisis-along-lac-unprecedented-can-t-be-business-as-usual-with-china-foreign-secretary-shringla/story-Oh2Lcv0fep4xOBJmv8iMJK.html
04-09-2020||India||Revise guidelines on parole, furlough, premature release of prisoners: MHA to states||The Union home ministry on Friday said that release of prisoners on parole and furlough is not an “absolute right” and should be allowed only to selective prisoners on the basis of well-defined norms of eligibility while asking all the states and union territories to review the guidelines in this regard. The ministry said that terrorists, people involved in heinous crimes, riots, dacoity or those involved in smuggling of drugs should not be eligible for release on parole or furlough as it could have an adverse impact on society. Prisons come under the state governments and decisions to release prisoners on parole or remission in their imprisonment is taken by them on the basis of conduct. In its letter, sent to states/UTs on Thursday, the MHA suggested new guidelines should include that parole and furlough may not be granted as a matter of routine and may be decided by a committee of officers and behavioural experts keeping in view all relevant factors, especially for inmates sentenced for sexual offences, serious crimes such as murder, child abduction and violence. Officials who didn’t wish to be named said that the advisory has been sent to states/UTs as there are reports from different parts of the country that many of those released from jails due to the coronavirus pandemic on parole were indulging in crimes. Referring to the Model Prison Manual, 2016, the MHA said prisoners whose immediate presence in the society may be considered dangerous or otherwise prejudicial to public peace should not be considered for release. The MHA said that prisoners convicted for heinous offences such as dacoity, terrorist crimes, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of narcotic and psychotropic substances, “may not report back to the prison after completion of the furlough period and should not be released”. It added that concerns have also been raised regarding recidivism, as in some cases prison inmates on temporary release from prison either on parole or furlough or on premature release before completion of their sentence, have re-offended or indulged in criminal activities. “This underlines the need to carefully regulate the grant of parole, furlough, remission and premature release to prisoners,” it said. It is, therefore, important for state authorities to review their guidelines to ensure that the facility and concession given to inmates, by way of parole, furlough and premature release, etc., with the intention of providing them relief and rehabilitation, “is not abused and misused by them and their advantage does not turn into disadvantage and nuisance for the society at large,” the ministry said. The MHA suggested that expert psychologist criminologist, correctional administration expert as a member of the Sentence Review Board, should be included in the committee which decides grant of parole and furlough to inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revise-guidelines-on-parole-furlough-premature-release-of-prisoners-mha-to-states/story-m7rgZ6yoNh7qiPCXvraeqO.html

The passenger would be allowed to board only if there is enough space after maintaining social distance. Else he has to opt for another train at a different time. With the West Bengal government apprehending that it could be difficult to tackle the crowd during rush hours, the authorities have proposed to issue e-passes to passengers to maintain social distance during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The state government has proposed developing a system to issue e-passes for entering the metro station. They have sought certain information from the Metro in this regard,” a Kolkata Metro spokesperson said. A senior official of the state government said that the idea is that, a passenger would have to apply for an e-pass through an app, hours before he wants to take a ride. If there is enough space in the train, after maintaining social distance among passengers, an e-pass would be generated. Security personnel would check the e-pass before letting him inside the station. Only smart card holders would be allowed. “For that, a passenger would have to mention his preferred journey time, name of the stations and his smart card number during booking on the app. Only a specific number of passengers will be allowed on the train. If there is no space, the passenger would be asked to give another time preference,” said the official. Kolkata Metro, the first metro in India, is the lifeline of the city and according to metro authorities around 6 lakh-6.5 lakh people take the metro on a week day. Out of this, around half of the commuters use smart cards. Each train would be allowed to carry at the most 400– 500 passengers to maintain social distance. “It was earlier decided that passengers with only smart cards would be allowed and tokens would be discontinued. But even with smart cards we may face problem as lakhs of passengers use smart cards. Hence the idea of an e-pass was floated,” said a state government official. The state home secretary had written to the railway board chairman on August 28 that the West Bengal government has no issues if local trains and metro services were resumed. Even though it has been proposed to operate the metro from mid-September, officials said that chief minister Mamata Banerjee has requested to resume services from September 13 as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test is scheduled on that day. Metro authorities said that two more rounds of discussion would be held with the state government before things are finalised and the plan is rolled out for commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-government-floats-e-pass-idea-for-kolkata-metro-to-tackle-rush/story-0axzG5avXKcUEXrTow9DUJ.html

Defeated by the experience, the former technologist from Tata Memorial Hospital’s radiotherapy department learnt everything about safeguarding and growing plants at home. “Taking care of a plant is not as simple as it looks. It requires dedicated effort and I set out to find answers,” said Katti, a biomedical engineer who began acquiring plants from around his residence and studied their requirements. The Covid-19 lockdown gave him enough time to achieve what he set out for. Today, Katti, a social worker since 1993, has a dedicated room full of as many as 275 plants consisting of seven species in his two-bedroom flat at Balkum-Saket road. He also has a 3ftx6ft kitchen garden (with over 25 species) in his backyard and consumes only home-grown vegetables. Also read: Delhi logs yet another highest single-day spike of nearly 3,000 Covid casesKatti will inaugurate his project on Saturday on the occasion of Teachers Day. “This is an opportunity for me to share and express my knowledge and gratitude with all my teachers, parents and guides who have supported me,” he said. A 2015 study by Japanese and Korean researchers showed that plants help suppress psychological and physiological stress signals released by the nervous system. Taking care of them, however, is complicated. “There is a difference between putting up a plant for show, and actually monitoring its growth from being a sapling. When that first plant died on me, I needed to learn about correct temperature, moisture availability, adequate sunlight, water provision or correct soil content,” said Katti. He began by bringing home plants that were neglected or dried. “I was lucky that my family (wife and child) were willing to devote one room to nurturing these plants,” he said. The room (see image) has home flowering, decorative and high carbon-absorbing plants, and 17 bonsais created from cuttings of plants found on the road. Also read: Kannada actress Ragini Dwivedi arrested in Bengaluru in drug probeExperts in urban rooftop greening said neglect and over-enthusiasm are the primary reasons why plants may not survive. “Most people ensure their efforts are not wasted by keeping a close watch, while others forget about them beyond visual pleasure. Some overwater their plants, while others are unaware of which season to grow them,” said Monisha Narke, founder and CEO, RUR Greenlife. “A balance is always needed.” During the Covid-19 lockdown, Katti was involved in disinfecting vehicles for the Thane road transport office and other government offices. “I came across farmers who had travelled from Nashik and who explained why their vegetables were immunity boosters. So I decided to put together my own kitchen garden with tomato, potato, onion, kadi patta, tea leaves, ginger, spinach etc. Four months on, I don’t need to depend on the local vegetable market,” he said. Therapists said the power of nature has a calming effect on mental health. “Caring for house plants requires more patience and a focused approach. We need to connect with nature before adopting a plant,” said Roshan Mansukhani, music therapist and counsellor. Katti said not a single plant has died under his care over the past year. “With the correct knowledge and attention to basic requirements, these plants have become my best friend. As I move into the latter stage of my life, this experiment that requires zero investment and 100 percent engagement is my way of giving something back to the environment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biomedical-engineer-builds-kitchen-garden-dedicated-room-for-over-200-plants/story-q55kXsVOwXQtQrPNRTiA9M.html
04-09-2020||India||Judge prods CBI to complete Moin Qureshi probe, seeks details on 9 points||The Central Bureau of Investigation has told a special judge that the agency’s probe against Moin Qureshi and former CBI chief AP Singh was impacted due to the Covid-19 pandemic and is resuming the investigation in the case that lay at the center of the agency’s two top officers, Rakesh Asthana and Alok Verma, feuding with each other.The CBI’s status report, submitted to special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal last month, said it had earlier halted this probe pending completion of the investigation in the 2018 bribery complaint filed by one of the suspects, Sathish Babu Sana. This complaint was directed at Rakesh Asthana who was supervising the probe. Asthana’s name was cleared in February this year. “However, not much progress could be made in the instant case since March 2020 onwards because of Covid-19 pandemic situation,” the CBI status report said.At an earlier hearing in early August, the judge had frowned at the lack of forward movement in the February 2017 case registered against millionaire meat exporter Moin Qureshi. In this FIR, the CBI had alleged that Moin Qureshi, apart from his day job of a meat exporter, also worked as a middleman for “certain public servants” and was helped by AP Singh who retired as CBI chief in 2012.JUDGE FLAGS 9 POINTS FOR CBIHow many documents have been collected/witnesses examinedWhat action has been taken against private persons who figure in BlackBerry messenger chatsWhat action has been taken / proposed to be taken against those public servants of whom Moin Akhtar Qureshi was allegedly acting as a middleman, as stated in FIRWhat favours were obtained in lieu of bribes allegedly paid to Mr Moin Akhtar Qureshi? By whom, through whomWhether any arrest proposal was made or drafted regarding the arrest of any of the suspects in this case till dateWhether ex-director of CBI AP Singh was ever examined in this caseWhether role of any CBI officer was examined in this case or that of any other public servant of any other departmentDoes, as mentioned in para 8 of the reply filed by CBI as above, merely because one person is complainant in RC 13(A)/2018/CBI?AC-III give him immunity in other cases or present case?What is the provisional timeline under which, final report in this case is proposed to be finalised by the investigating agency?The judge noted that the Moin Qureshi case, registered in February 2017 on information from the Enforcement Directorate, was yet to reach its logical end. “It appears to be moving at snail’s pace,” Aggarwal said, contrasting the pace with the “offshoot” of this case where a charge sheet had been filed earlier this year.“Therefore, such open-ended investigations which keep on gathering dust for years together may seriously erode the credibility/faith of public at large in premier investigating agency of india i.e. CBI, which is deleterious to rule of law, more so, when one of the accused in the above RC is Sh A.P. Singh Ex. CZAR or Ex. Director of CBI,” Aggarwal wrote in his 7 August order.Investigations into this case had gone for a toss after Sathish Sana Babu filed a corruption complaint against Rakesh Asthana. The allegation came around the time Asthana, who was overseeing the CBI’s special team put together to probe a bunch of complaints against Moin Qureshi, was pushing for Sathish Sana Babu’s arrest. Asthana had alleged that Sathish Sana Babu had paid off some CBI officials to stay out of trouble.In this FIR registered by the CBI in October when Alok Verma was still the director, Babu alleged that he had paid a Rs 2 crore bribe to Asthana via Dubai-based brothers - Manoj Prasad and Somesh Prasad - to be spared any action in the investigation linked to Qureshi. The money, he alleged, was paid over a 10-month period -- starting from December 2017. The CBI found no evidence to back this allegation against Asthana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-prods-cbi-to-complete-moin-qureshi-probe-seeks-details-on-9-points/story-w1mKYri5Waf3Vfrafiyj0H.html

This is close on the heels of a similar order issued on Wednesday that banned the printing of diaries, calendars and coffee table books in physical forms.“ln the context of the present fiscal situation and the consequent pressure on Government resources, there is a need for further economy and rationalization of non-priority expenditure, while protecting and preserving priority expenditure,” the DoE order said. The department is an arm of the Union finance ministry.Also read: ‘No compromise on territorial integrity’ - Foreign Secretary Shringla on India-China border rowThe Union government has resorted to cutting costs after the economy saw a sharp 23.9 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2020-21, mainly because a 68-day hard lockdown across the country to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. The order prohibits the printing of books, publications and documents on imported paper, except for printing done abroad by the Indian missions. “Expenditure on functions such as celebrations of Foundation Day, etc. should be discouraged or if felt necessary be appropriately curtailed,” it said. Besides, it directed departments to avoid travel costs for such functions and distribution of bags or mementoes.It asked ministries to review individual consultants working there and reduce their numbers to the minimum.

Urgent vacancies will be filled only after the proposal is approved by the DoE, it said.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said, “Given the severe lockdown due to the pandemic, it was certain that there would be a strain on the fiscal deficit and that fiscal consolidation would not be possible. Various estimates are going around on the fiscal deficit for the year crossing 7 percent.”“In this backdrop, probity in cutting down avoidable expenditure was expected and the latest measures are welcome... Though the government is under criticism for its measures; given the gravity of the situation, austerity steps, especially on avoidable expenditure, is welcome,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-strapped-govt-cuts-non-essential-expenditures-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-eHD4dAEgLX4iGKoqyp4PlN.html

Intensive control operations have significantly reduced infestations in both countries. Consequently, the second generation of breeding that commences in September is expected to be on a much smaller and more manageable scale,” says the advisory.Dr K L Gurjar, deputy director at Locust Warning Organization at Jodhpur said that it is a big relief to the country which is facing threat of locust attacks since the past one and half year. Gurjar said that in its recent advisory FAO said that due to intensive control operations, India and Pakistan have reduced locust infestations. Gurjar added that in present situation there is no presence of locust anywhere in the country.He said that earlier FAO warned about a huge locust attack from Ethiopia and northern Somalia. It was advised that by the first week of September adult locust groups may enter in India and may cause huge damage. Gurjar said that in its recent advisory FAO said that there is no possibility for the groups from Ethiopia and northern Somalia to enter India.Summer breeding, said Gurjar, has taken place in many parts of Rajasthan, including Nagaur, Jodhpur, Hanumangarh and Barmer. He said that with better coordination of state and central government departments and with use of helicopters, drones, fire brigade and hand sprays, locust control operations were carried out successfully and at present there is no presence of locust.According to Gurjar, only summer breeding of locust takes place in India and winter breeding takes place in Iran, Baluchistan and in some parts of southeast Pakistan.“During the summer, we have successfully carried out locust control operations in India and simultaneously similar successful operations were carried out across the border in Pakistan, due to which now there is no chance of locust attack in India in near future,” said Gurjar.“We will continue to keep an eye on the spring breeding of locust which usually takes place in Pakistan,” he added. Since the past one and half year the country has faced huge locust attacks in more than 10 states, including national capital Delhi.After a long gap of 26 years, first locust attack was reported on May 21, 2019 in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district. In the first attack locusts caused huge damage to Rabi crops in around ten lakh hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat. However, by the second week of February locust attack was controlled with intense control operations.Later, On April 11, 2020, the country faced a second locust attack. This time, locust groups were spread in more than 10 states including Rajasthan, UP, MP, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttrakhand, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. With an alarming situation, the issue was raised in many state assemblies and also in Parliament. As a result, the government swung in action and with locust control operations at large level locust infestations and breeding was controlled by the end of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intensive-control-operations-reduced-locust-threat-in-india-pak-says-fao/story-u4uBm3ykKO9xyID3CQmOQL.html

Interacting with probationers of the Indian Police Service through a video conference on Friday during the Dikshant Parade of 71 RR (Regular Recruits) at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad, the Prime Minister said the human face of the khaki uniform has been engraved in public memory due to the good work done by the police especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is very important that you should be proud of your uniform instead of flexing the power of your uniform. Never lose respect for your khaki uniform,” PM Modi told the IPS probationers. Stating that policing is a profession where the factor of encountering something unexpected is very high, the PM said all police officials must be alert and prepared for any such situation. “There is a higher degree of stress and which is why it is important to keep speaking with your near and dear ones. From time to time, maybe on a day off, meet someone like a teacher or someone whose advice you value,” he said. The Prime Minister also underlined the importance of Yoga for those working under stressful conditions. “Yoga and Pranayam are good for all those working under stress. If you do any work from your heart, you will always benefit. You will never feel stressed no matter how much work there is,” he advised. On terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, PM Modi said the youth of the country need to be prevented from taking the wrong path at the early stage itself. “Women police personnel can do that by involving women there,” he said. Union home minister Amit Shah also conveyed his best wishes to all the officers on parade and exhorted them to serve with sincerity and integrity for fulfilling the SMART Police Vision (strict and sensitive, modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable and responsible, techno-savvy and trained) of the Prime Minister. As many as 131 IPS probationers, including 28 women, have completed their 42 weeks of basic course phase-I training at the academy. They joined the academy on December 17, 2018 after completing their foundation course at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie and at Dr Marri Channa Reddy HRD Institute of Telangana, Hyderabad, with those from other central services like IAS and IFS. Director of SVP National Police Academy Atul Karwal presented the trophies to the winners of various competitions.

04-09-2020||India||Prashant Kishor’s team asks select Left leaders to join TMC. This followed||Several Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders who are known for their clean image have been approached by I-PAC, the company owned by election strategist Prashant Kishor, for joining the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) ahead of the assembly polls in 2021. Kishor - who earlier helped the Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and the YSR Congress Party win elections - was roped in by chief minister Mamata Banerjee after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 seats to 22. The BJP poses a challenge to Banerjee in the run-up to the assembly polls. Five senior CPI(M) leaders, including a former information technology minister in the erstwhile Left government and a sitting legislator, told HT that they were contacted by Kishor’s team in August and offered “better career prospects in the ruling party”. They said they turned down the offer. All the Left leaders said that I-PAC representatives who met them spoke in Hindi and English and said they were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. They also claimed that the I-PAC teams told them that they were approached only after a survey confirmed their credibility as honest and effective politicians. “On August 4, a man called me up and said I had done good work while serving as legislator from the Entally constituency in Kolkata. He said I-PAC would like to interact with me. I said I was not interested and hung up,” said Debesh Das, former IT minister and a former professor at Jadavpur University. Laxmi Kanta Roy and Mamata Roy, former CPI(M) legislators, claimed that they were offered funds to contest on the TMC ticket. “A man came to my house on August 9. He looked around and asked how could I live in such a small house and why don’t I have a car. He said if I work for the TMC I would get funds and anything else that I might need. I told him communists cannot be purchased and asked him to leave,” said Mamata Roy. Laxmi Kanta Roy claimed to have had a similar experience. “I told the man who came to my home that Communists don’t deviate from their ideology and I am happy with my life,” said Roy. Rafikul Islam, the CPI(M)’s sitting legislator from Harirampur in South Dinajpur district, said, “I was urged to visit Kishor’s office in Kolkata. I said I am 67 and a man does not give up his ideology at this age.” A lawyer by profession, Subinay Ghosh, the former CPI(M) MLA from the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district, said a man from Hyderabad came to see him at the local court premises. “He said I-PAC has formed separate teams for every Lok Sabha and assembly constituency and I was selected during their survey. I said, having served the people as a councillor and MLA, there is nothing more I look forward to in life,” said Ghosh. HT contacted I-PAC and a top functionary confirmed that teams from the company are approaching handpicked leaders from the Left parties. “It is evident that the TMC and BJP are the main forces in Bengal. It is essentially a two-horse race and the Left is a marginal factor. Our teams are only telling some selected Left leaders that if they really want to serve the people they have a better chance of doing that as part of the TMC. The decision is for them to take,” said the I-PAC functionary who spoke strictly on condition of anonymity. Significantly, the functionary bulldozed claims made by a sitting MLA of the Forward Bloc, a partner in the Left Front, that Kishor himself insisted on meeting him and drove down to a star hotel on EM Bypass in Kolkata to offer ministerial berth in the next government. Forward Bloc’s youth leader Ali Imran Ramz, who won the Chakulia assembly seat in North Dinajpur district in 2011 and 2016, claimed that Kishor came to meet him at the hotel where he had gone to have dinner with his wife on July 17. “Anyone can check the hotel’s security camera footage to verify my statement. My wife and I had tea with Kishor at a lounge between 10 and 11 pm,” Ramz told HT. “It is a big lie. Ramz was repeatedly telling members of the I-PAC team that his wife is a fan of Kishor and the couple would like to meet him. Kishor has been staying at that hotel ever since he started working in Bengal a year ago. He does not meet MLAs like this. He showed the courtesy only because Ramz came with his wife,” said the I-PAC functionary. “When they met, Ramz and his wife sought Kishor’s advice. Ramz said he does not have much future in the Forward Bloc,” he added. “It is also a lie that the couple had dinner at the hotel. When Kishor offered them to have food with him they said they had come straight from a marriage ceremony where they had their dinner. So, Kishor offered them some tea. The couple had tea and coffee and the bill was paid by Kishor. We have the documents,” said the I-PAC functionary. When HT questioned Ramz, he went silent on his claim of having dinner at the hotel and admitted that Kishor paid for the beverages. “I was not aware that Kishor was staying at the hotel. But it is not true that it was I who insisted on meeting him. Also, my wife doesn’t even know who he is,” said Ramz. Senior TMC leader and state panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee dismissed the statements made by the CPI(M) leaders. “They lost their heads after losing the elections,” he quipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-team-asks-select-left-leaders-to-join-tmc-this-followed/story-4VIYe1U3OCymkeJM4xxz9L.html

Nearly 900 passengers of the Ranchi-bound Rajdhani Special train were stuck at Daltonganj station for several hours on Thursday following an ongoing stir by the Tana Bhagat community at Tori railway station in Jharkhand’s Latehar district.Every passenger except the woman was finally dispatched to the state capital by buses arranged by Palamu district administration. The woman stayed put in the stranded train.The railway and civil officials said that the lady passenger, Ananya, travelling in B-3 coach refused to leave the train and board one of the arranged busses for further journey.

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde said that this was not an ordinary case, brushing aside concerns raised by Kumar’s lawyer regarding his health. “This is not a small case. We cannot grant you bail at all,” CJI Bobde remarked. The CJI, however, said that he will list the appeal filed by Kumar challenging the High Court verdict as soon as physical hearing restarts. The Delhi High Court had, in December 2018, convicted the 74-year-old politician and sentenced him to life imprisonment for his role in the 1984 massacre. The 1984 anti-sikh riots, targeting the Sikh community, broke out in retaliation for the killing of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. Kumar’s counsel Vikas Singh said that his client had already spent 18 months in jail and asked for an interim bail for one month so that Kumar could regain his health and weight.“I will abide by any condition Your Lordships impose. Your Lordships may at least grant interim bail for 1 month,” Singh pressed. Senior counsel HS Phoolka, along with Jagjit Singh Chabra, who were representing the riot victims, opposed the bail plea. Phoolka said that loss of weight was merely an excuse and Kumar is being given good care in jail. The court, after taking note of a March 11 report of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, noted that Kumar’s weight has, in fact, increased, contrary to the claims made by him.“We will put it (appeal) for final hearing as soon as the physical court starts,” CJI Bobde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1984-anti-sikh-riots-supreme-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-convict-sajjan-kumar/story-un1f3oAwN0ma5M0GsvJ5uN.html
04-09-2020||India||Assam re-launches self-employment scheme worth Rs 1,000 crore||With assembly polls seven months away, the Assam government on Friday re-launched an old scheme with the aim of providing self-employment to around 2 lakh youths of the state. Called Swami Vivekananda Assam Youth Empowerment (SVAYEM), the scheme worth Rs 1000 crore, would provide Rs 50,000 each as seed money to selected youths to start business ventures. The scheme was part of the BJP-led government’s budget speech in 2017-18, but instead of benefitting 1 lakh youths as planned it managed to get only around 7,000 beneficiaries due to lack of adequate support from banks. “We are launching the redesigned SVAYEM with a budget of Rs 1000 crore which will be spent in the next three months without any banking linkage. The 2 lakh beneficiaries would have to be part of self-help groups, joint liability groups, etc. before September 1,” said finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The groups seeking to avail benefits of the scheme will be able to register themselves at a new portal which will be launched on September 16. Sarma said the scheme could get repeated annually with the possibility of increasing the number of beneficiaries. “This is the biggest self-employment programme launched by any government in Assam since Independence. The Rs 1000 cr would come from our own revenue without any banking linkage,” the minister said. To claim benefit of the scheme, the applicants would have to be below 40 years of age, must have passed matriculation and should be part of existing self-help groups. A second scheme, which provides a Rs 50,000 subsidy to anyone who has taken an education loan will be launched again. Last year 1,545 persons had benefited from the scheme. “But due to the economic situation because of Covid-19, we had not launched the scheme this year. We already have 5,547 approved applications. Those who want to avail it can apply again. The amounts will be released next month. It will cost the exchequer Rs 25 crore,” informed Sarma. Another scheme worth Rs 250 crore would transfer a sum of Rs 3,000 each to nearly 8 lakh bank accounts of tea garden labourers in the state. Launched in 2017-18, the state government had provided Rs 2,500 each to 6.33 lakh bank accounts as part of the scheme and a similar amount the next year to 7.15 lakh bank accounts. No amount was transferred to the accounts last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-re-launches-self-employment-scheme-worth-rs-1-000-crore/story-Qzz1iYbGHFakg7noiB7aIL.html

Congress secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that Kangana’s Twitter account is managed by the IT-cell of the BJP and that Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP should issue an unconditional apology over the issue.In a tweet, Ranaut accused Raut of threatening her. She alleged that Raut had openly threatened her to not return to Mumbai if she has no faith in Mumbai Police. Kangana also added that Mumbai now looks like Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to her. The tweet said: “Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena leader, has given me an open threat and asked me not to come back to Mumbai, after Aazadi graffitis in Mumbai streets and now open threats, why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir?”Without naming the actress, the Sena leader said that Ranaut’s statements questioning the ability and the intent of Mumbai police is a “systemic campaign” to defame the city police.“The Mumbai police have constantly saved the city in all types of challenges including 1992 riots, terrorist strikes, etc. If some people not connected to Mumbai are making such statements then this a systemic campaign to defame the Mumbai police. The state home minister and police chief should take strong action otherwise the morale of the Mumbai police will be affected.”Sawant said that Kangana Team, the official handle of the actor, equals to “Kangana + BJP IT Cell”. “For the past few days, Kangana Ranaut through the IT Cell has been continuously defaming the Mumbai police. Now, she has compared Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir and insulted Maharashtra. Instead of condemning her actions, BJP’s Ram Kadam is supporting her, which is utterly shameful,” he said in a statement.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut’s PoK remark: MNS warns against defaming Mumbai Police Raut, meanwhile, refrained from naming the BJP and said, “Any political party, backing the one calling Mumbai, Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, does not have the right to seek votes in Mumbai and Maharashtra.

Does this mean that Mumbai police is Pakistan police?”Also Read: Kangana Ranaut responds as Renuka Shahane slams her comment on Mumbai: ‘Were you also waiting like a blood thirsty vulture’The Sena leader indirectly said that the actor should seek mental help.“I will not name anybody if somebody is saying that I issued a threat, I would say this that I never give empty threats. We don’t do such things; I am a Shiv Sainik, and an action-oriented person… Such mental cases have increased in Mumbai; they should be treated by the health department and the home minister should immediately take action against people, no matter how big they are, for defaming the Mumbai police,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-right-to-seek-votes-in-mumbai-bjp-under-attack-for-defending-kangana-s-mumbai-like-pok-jibe/story-qzqoytuKzYG8KDKlNc0NQN.html

04-09-2020||India||Teachers’ day: Celebrating the stars of nation building||The year 2020 brought along with it perhaps the biggest challenge a teacher could face. And it is not surprising that they’ve been the ones who were at the forefront of adapting to the changes that Covid-19 pandemic has forced them to make. Even for those with decades of experience, teaching virtually for them, has turned out to be a whole new ball game. This Teachers’ Day, we celebrate those who’re the most important participants of nation building. Minor technical glitches, network connection issues, lack of equipment — despite all this, these individuals have made sure they did their job even as talks of salary deductions or layoffs made rounds. “The initial few days were difficult,” says Rajeshwari Vyasan, a class 9th and 10th Sanskrit teacher, Bethany Convent, Panvel. She adds that even though equipments were all in place, getting a hang of teaching using them took time. “Many of our students are underprivileged and did not have mobile phones or laptops. They had to use their parent’s devices. It took a month or so to get used to the minor background disturbances or technical glitches that sometimes spoil the flow of teaching,” she adds. Shainy S Punchayil, who teaches 7th, 8th and 9th grade students at Amrita Vidyalayam, Juinagar, says that these days teachers are working for 10 hours to prepare for their lessons, compile notes, check assignments, search videos and check exam papers online which has made it “stressful because the time is limited”. “Initially I thought that the virtual classes would give us a good platform to break the traditional methods of teaching. We have used videos, whiteboards using one note app to explain concepts to make teaching more lively and interactive. We are also involving students in online reading, speaking and creative activities by posting short stories and conducting (Just a minute ) activities to develop their LSRW skills. We have successfully conducted two online exams using MS forms.Nevertheless we feel that offline teaching is far better than online teaching. The students who are interactive are no doubt enjoying all the activities and we are getting good feedback from them. But the online teaching is not effective in teaching the below average students. They are showing no interest and unable to complete their assignments. So the teacher is not able to connect with them virtually,” she says. On the eve of Teachers’ Day, PM interacts with national award-winning teachershttps://t.co/8nPOJz5fZM pic.twitter.com/xAzrUS80VmRachel D’Souza of Saraswati Vidyalaya, Thane, says that since she teaches primary students, it was especially difficult for them to get into a routine of online classes. “We are in the habit of being personally in touch with small students in classrooms, be it just going around and seeing what they are doing or even talking to them about the silly things that they find interesting. But now that we are taking online classes, it is very difficult to control them because they all want to talk at the same time and get noticed. But it has got better now with practice. They now know when they have to talk and when they have to mute themselves,” she says.The 56-year-old teacher says that since they were never technologically trained to hold online classes, it was difficult to get used to the processes initially, but now, everyone has got a hang of it. Yet, they would all love to go back to school as soon as possible. On 5th September we mark Teachers Day and pay tributes to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. #MannKiBaat pic.twitter.com/SJQbolfUez||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teachers-day-celebrating-the-stars-of-nation-building/story-HWJLqXTByutmVdyWy5ToJO.html

The deceased-Ashok Kunjam and his friend Bandara Kunjam--were brutally beaten up due to which they died,” Dantewada Superintendent of Police (SP) Abhishek Pallava told HT. The SP said that Ashok, with his five family members and friend Bandara, all natives of Kirandul town in Dantewada, had gone to fix his marriage with a girl of Dudi Tumnar village in Bijapur. “The villagers brought the bodies to Kirandul and it seems that they were beaten and strangled,” the SP said. Maoists have thrown a pamphlet, which was recovered from the spot, in which they claimed that the two men were police informers and were killed in Jan Adalat (Maoists’ kangaroo court). Also Read: Maoists deny Ganapathi surrender reports, call it Centre’s conspiracyThe Maoists also alleged that Dantewada SP was responsible for the deaths of the duo. “The deceased never had any association with the police.

The agency claimed that Vilatra’s interrogation revealed his connection with Parihar.During Parihar’s questioning, he revealed he would allegedly procure drugs from Vilatra and Kaizan Ebrahim on the instructions of Showik Chakraborty for Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager, Samual Miranda, the agency said in its application seeking Parihar’s custody till September 11.The agency claimed there were several instances when Parihar arranged drugs, and that he was in regular contact with Chakraborty. It also claimed that “he is an active member of drug syndicate connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers”.NCB on August 28, arrested Abbas Ali Lakhani, 21, allegedly with 46 grams of Ganja. On the basis of information given by Lakhani, his alleged supplier, Karn Arora, was arrested with 13 grams of ganja.Later, on the information provided by two, NCB arrested Vilatra. Parihar is the fourth person to be arrested in the case.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14 in what police said appeared to be an open-and-shut case of suicide. The post-mortem report ruled out any foul play. After a two-week quiet, a political controversy erupted over the death, as a Bihar police team constituted to probe the case on a complaint by the actor’s family alleged it got no cooperation from its Mumbai counterpart.The jurisdictional turf war spilled into the legal arena as the Supreme Court was approached to decide if CBI could investigate the matter. The issue became deeply acrimonious and divisive at multiple levels — between the Rajput and Chakraborty families, between the actors’ respective sets of fans, between the governments of the two states in question, and between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its former ally Shiv Sena — and left the entertainment industry split vertically.The case opened up a raging debate in and about the industry, devolving into a war of words and allegations between two camps largely made up of “insiders” (with generational links to Bollywood) and “outsiders” (first-generation actors and filmmakers). Chakraborty and her supporters alleged that the Bihar government was trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-abdel-basit-parihar-send-to-ncb-custody-till-september-9/story-pR8qMg8DNvw5D9mANA5D2J.html
04-09-2020||India||Court overturns ban on Assamese TV serial accused of promoting ‘love jihad’||The Gauhati High Court has overturned a ban imposed on an Assamese television serial last month and allowed its telecast as long as it doesn’t hurt religious sentiments. A single judge bench of Justice Suman Shyam on Thursday, acting on a petition by AM Television and its managing director Sanjive Narain, lifted the two-month ban imposed by Guwahati police commissioner MP Gupta on ‘Begum Jaan’, telecast by Rengoni TV, on the ground the order didn’t follow laid down rules. Based on four complaints from Hindu Jagaran Manch that the serial hurt religious sentiments and used content derogatory towards one religion, the police commissioner had banned it on August 24 for two months and issued a show cause notice to AM Television. The complainants had alleged that the serial promoted ‘love jihad’. The charge was denied by Narain who told journalists that it was “about a Hindu girl who gets into trouble in a Muslim locality and is saved by a Muslim boy”. Challenging the ban issued on recommendation of a monitoring committee, the petitioners informed the court that the order violated guidelines issued by Government of India as the committee didn’t include a representative from electronic media. The petitioners also informed the court that while the GoI guidelines require hearing versions of both parties before such a ban is imposed, in the present case it was not followed and the petitioners were not provided copies of the complaints or given a chance to air their views. After examining records, the court found both contentions of the petitioners to be true and castigated the police commissioner for issuing the ban without following laid down guidelines. “The respondent number 4 (Guwahati police commissioner) was clearly not justified in suspending telecast of the serial by an ex parte blanket order without giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioners to explain their stand or recording any cogent reason for doing so,” the order read. The court disposed of the petition by setting aside the order issued by the police commissioner and sent back the matter to the authority concerned for a “fresh decision on the complaints in accordance with law” allowing the petitioners to view the complaints and file replies to them. The television company, the court said, would be able to telecast the serial provided any content which could disrupt communal harmony or hurt religious sentiments of any community is deleted before it is aired. “It is made clear that violation of the above condition, in any manner, shall be viewed seriously by this court,” the order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-overturns-ban-on-assamese-tv-serial-accused-of-promoting-love-jihad/story-ecO4VkvNQxGUaSDpferVDK.html
04-09-2020||India||Humane side of police emerged during the Covid crisis: Narendra Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the humane side of the police had come to the fore during the current Covid-19 crisis.In a virtual address to Indian Police Service probationers at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad, Modi also discussed various challenges before the men and women in khaki. Responding to a question about Kashmir, Modi emphasised on a greater connect with the people of the state, adding that those taking the “wrong path should be dissuaded from doing so”.Modi said that police officers should also know how to develop relations with public representatives; governance is more effective if officers tap into the strength of the society.Modi said public representatives should be given due respect, but added that duty must be adhered to. He narrated how, during his initial days as Gujarat chief minister, police officer Atul Karwal, who presently heads the National Police Academy, had politely asked him to follow the security protocols that he was not used to then.In response to a question from an officer who worked in Jammu and Kashmir, Modi said the people of Kashmir had amazing strength. The kind of shawls they weaved were amazing, he said. He suggested that the lady officer, who had studied textiles, should make attempts to promote modern designing among the people of the state.“I have connected to the people of Kashmir and found them to be very lovely. The children who adopt a wrong path, we have to stop them from doing so. And this work can be done best by lady officers. To bring these children back, to explain to their mothers, our lady officers can do a superb job. I have complete faith we can stop children before they adopt a wrong path,” said the Prime Minister. A total of 131 probationers, including 28 women, were present at the event.In his address, Modi said that people from all professions were under a lot of stress these days and added that yoga and pranayama would be beneficial.One of the probationers also raised the issue of the need to protect the families of policemen who fall in the line of duty.The Prime Minister said the service rendered by the men and women in khaki during the pandemic has been seen by the people and a humane image of the police has emerged. Khaki should not evoke fear but pride, said Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humane-side-of-police-emerged-during-the-covid-crisis-narendra-modi/story-jwNGITTdYzfJaeyUEljFdP.html

Dolma’s nudge to India at a recent webinar came after President Xi Jinping’s call to sinicise, or reshape Tibetan Buddhism to bring it in line with the culture of the majority Han community and principles of the Communist Party of China.“India must recognise Tibet as an occupied nation and recognise that it shares a border not with China, but with Tibet. India has a legal, international obligation to stand for truth and recognise its relations with Tibet,” Dolma said. She was critical of India’s Tibet policy as well, contending that while India has been kind to the Tibetan people, the Indian government had always let its relations with China influence its stand. As the first step, Tibetans have argued India must start calling the ‘China border’ as the Tibet border.Also Read: 4 months on, India and China to sit across table. Rajnath meeting today the firstXi’s August 29 call at a meeting of the communist party isn’t the first time that the Chinese President has called for sinicisation of Tibetan Buddhism. Back in 2015 also, President Xi spoke about sinicising the five major religions practised in China- Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism and Daoism. This time, it was part of a four-point programme to build an “impregnable fortress’’ to maintain stability in Tibet. Also Watch | Amid India-China tension, Tibet govt-in-exile poll process begins | ExplainedThis is necessary, President Xi told the meeting, to strengthen border defence and frontier security of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) that borders India and Bhutan. One of the tasks that President Xi spelt out at the meeting included educating Tibetans in Lhasa and beyond to strengthen the struggle against ‘splittism’. President Xi’s mention of splittism is seen as a reference to the exiled Tibetan supreme spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who is frequently accused by communist Beijing of fueling separatism in TAR.President Xi’s fresh attempt to wipe out Tibetan identity comes around the time the People’s Liberation Army is engaged in a bitter stand-off with Indian soldiers in Ladakh, the last stronghold of Tibetan Buddhism, and Beijing’s deteriorating ties with the United States and its South China Sea neighbours.Also Read: Security along LAC enhanced, situation delicate and serious, says Army chief NaravaneIt was in this context that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in July that the US would restrict visas for some Chinese officials involved in blocking diplomatic access to Tibet and engaging in ‘human rights abuses’.

The CCP must respect and protect Tibetans’ human rights and fundamental freedoms, including religious freedom.”China watchers say that Xi Jinping’s Tibet plan was centred around cementing China’s grip on whatever autonomy remained of the territories under the Tibet Autonomous Region. Communist China ran over Tibet spread across 2.5 million square kilometres in 1950 in what it described as a ‘peaceful liberation’ that helped the remote Himalayan region throw off its ‘feudalist’ past. Buddhists led by the Dalai Lama called it ‘cultural genocide’. The Dalai Lama finally crossed into Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang in April 1959 to escape the Chinese.Also Read: In 2012, Dalai Lama spoke of Chinese plot to murder himIn 1965, China split half the territory of Tibet as its four provinces Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan. TAR, as it stands, accounts for one-eighth of China’s area.Lobsang Sangay, the president of the Tibetan Government in Exile, said CCP general secretary Xi’s address at the 7th Central Symposium on Tibet Work in Beijing was misguided.“Evidently, such misguided repressive policies have only enhanced the plight of the Tibetan people leading 154 Tibetans to self-immolate. The Chinese government must acknowledge the failure of its policies in Tibet,” Sangay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-xi-s-plan-for-tibetan-buddhism-fuels-a-pushback-and-a-nudge-to-india/story-WMksCDUNDuBBvSCxRPThlI.html

Acting on a public interest litigation filed by Tanmay Jyoti Mahanta, a division bench of the court comprising chief justice Ajai Lamba and justice Manish Choudhury issued the order on Thursday. In his petition, Mahanta pointed out that despite implementing the lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19 and various notifications issued by Assam government regarding the use of masks and maintenance of social distancing, rules are being flouted by the public, resulting in over 1 lakh positive cases in the state. The PIL said that despite the state health department’s order, issued on May 8, stating those found without masks would be fined Rs 500 for the first, second and third offence and Rs 1000 for subsequent offences, people could be seen moving around in public places without wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Mahanta requested the court to issue a “strict and proper” direction to the authorities for implementing the use of masks and maintenance of social distancing norms in public and workplaces and enforcement of punitive measures against those found violating the norms. “It is common knowledge that residents of the state in market places and otherwise can be seen without wearing masks or with masks worn below the nose level, which would result in the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19),” the court mentioned in its order. “We further find that people get together in market places and in work environments without caring for their own health or the health of others. Surely, no resident or a citizen has the right to put his own life in jeopardy or put the life of others at risk,” the order added. Also Read: Over 3,000 hectares added to Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve in Assam The court observed that though various orders have been issued, they are being flouted because punitive action is not being taken against the violators. The court directed that anybody violating the instructions to wear face masks, issued on May 8, will be punished as provided in the order. “This order is being issued in view of the fact that the hospitals are overflowing with Covid-19 positive patients. Oxygen is already in short supply in the hospitals,” the order stated. Also Read: Manipur expects GI tag for its unique orange in TamenglongThe court directed the police department to be proactive on the streets and check whether the health department’s guidelines are being followed. It asked the police force to impose fines on those found violating norms. Similarly, directions were also issued to deputy commissioners of all districts to involve officers from various departments to inspect areas in the respective towns and check whether police officers are complying with the court’s order. “The direction that is being issued today is considering emergent conditions that have emerged as we have observed on the streets, at this stage, and the dangers associated with spread of the pandemic,” the order read. The matter has been listed for September 17, the next date of hearing. Assam has recorded 118,333 Covid-19 positive cases till date with 330 deaths and 90,697 recoveries. Last week, health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma informed that the monthly requirement for oxygen is at present nearly 25 metric tonnes against the state’s production of 37.86 metric tonnes. Of this, nearly 8.25 metric tonnes of Oxygen is being supplied to COVID-19 patients at present. Sarma had expressed an apprehension that if the present trend of rise in COVID-19 positive cases continues, there might be a problem in getting adequate oxygen supply in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-orders-punishment-for-covid-19-safety-norms-violators-in-assam/story-2vv3lMCsFiIZ5jE3Dj5sQK.html

This court has had some horrible experiences while conducting court through video conference. A lawyer after finishing his case was joined by his wife even though the video-conference was still on. When the situation did not improve after frequent requests, the court had to disconnect the petitioner’s connection,” remarked justice Rath.In another instance, a lawyer argued his case from his garden on the plea that he could not get proper net connectivity from inside his house, which proved to be wrong. The judge remarked that the same lawyer while appearing through video conferencing went on eating.In June this year, the SC had upbraided a lawyer who appeared before a virtual court lying in bed while dressed in a T-shirt. The advocate had to tender an unconditional apology to the apex court later on. In April this year, a lawyer in Rajasthan high court had appeared in a bail hearing through video-conferencing dressed in a vest. The HC later pulled up the lawyer for not being properly dressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-argue-from-garden-orissa-court-on-horrible-video-conferences/story-4tedIAp2QkfVfdZa8BeVnN.html

The tanker MV New Diamond, which was chartered by the Indian Oil Corporation, was carrying 300,000 tonnes of oil from a Kuwaiti port to Paradip port in India. Following the fire and an explosion, at least one member of the 23-strong crew of the tanker was reported missing and presumed dead, a Sri Lankan Navy spokesman said. India has deployed five vessels from the Coast Guard and three from the navy to assist efforts by Sri Lankan authorities to control the blaze, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The Coast Guard ship ICGS Shaurya, equipped with a water gun, was diverted on Thursday to spray water on the burning tanker.The Coast Guard’s Samudra Pahredar, a pollution control vessel, was dispatched from Vishakapatnam on Thursday, while ICGS Sujay was deployed from Chennai, the people said. The Coast Guard ships Abheek and Ameya were deployed on Friday. Two Dornier aircraft of the Coast Guard were deployed for aerial reconnaissance flights, and the Indian Navy diverted three warships, Shakti, Sahyadri and Ranvijay, to help in efforts to douse the flames.Experts have expressed concerns that the fire could result in massive environmental damage, especially if the ship breaks apart and there is an oil spill. The Coast Guard tweeted that a two-metre crack had been spotted on the aft portion of the tanker at 10 metres above the waterline. The crew of the New Diamond, which is registered in Panama, included five Greek nationals and 18 Filipinos. The fire broke out in the vessel’s engine room on Thursday and spread to the bridge. The missing Filipino crew member was seriously injured when a boiler exploded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-vessels-two-aircraft-deployed-to-help-control-fire-on-supertanker-off-sri-lanka-coast/story-h5chF0Qy81fnOtaEojqNJN.html

An American non-governmental organisation (NGO) is funding the restoration work for the Bichli Haveli project. Malvika Mehta, a member of the Bachhawat Mehta clan and an architect by profession, had started the innovative restoration work in 2017.Later, she had got in touch with civil engineers from the School of Structural and Geo-technical Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) last year. Material scientists from VIT had visited the three-storey structure, which has 46 rooms and two big courtyards, in March 2019 to collect the samples of existing lime plasters in a bid to study properties of the material. Restoration Works International, a US-based NGO, is funding the restoration project aimed at promoting the use of lime as a contemporary construction material. “In the structure, stone masonry was used along with mud mortar. Lime plaster, which was up to 70 millimetres (mm) in thickness, gave the artistic finishing touch called ‘ghutai’ or ‘arraish’ in local dialects,” said Malvika, who belongs to the seventh generation of the Bachhawat Mehta clan. The lime plastered walls breathe to regulate moisture and interior temperature and get stronger with the passage of time, she said. Such buildings have a much longer life span. For instance, if maintained properly, the Bichli Haveli can survive for another 500 years, she added.“It is my duty to enable the haveli to remain relevant -- forever growing and living,” said Malavika. She said the chain of the transfer of traditional building knowledge was disrupted for some generations, especially since cement emerged as the mainstream construction material in the 1950s. “The current form of defective lime-based practices also led to a loss of faith in lime as a viable building material,” she added. The project attempts to use the scientific and the industrial know-how to fill in the gaps of the traditional knowledge and evolve its own building material ecosystem as a happy blend of the old and the new, she added. According to Dr Thirumalini, an associate professor of civil engineering department at VIT, the team from the university collected samples of existing lime plasters and concrete and conducted several advanced analysis and micro-structure studies to identify the type and properties of the material used in the construction over 140 years ago. “The objectives,” he said, “was to characterise old and existing lime plasters from the site and simulate them with the currently available building materials.” “The original material was re-engineered and applied for restoration of the haveli. During the process of material studies, an old lost technology of production of low-energy materials surfaced, highlighting the use of materials such as lime, plant extracts and hemp fibres to reduce the cost and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The original materials used were also found to act as CO2-capturing materials, helping in mitigating global warming, paving its way to be used in modern constructions for low-rise buildings,” said Dr Thirumalini. According to an NGO official, the project aims to bring several benefits to the community such as job creation --- especially for women --- support local suppliers and services and also help the haveli residents to celebrate their heritage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-ngo-pitches-in-to-restore-140-yr-old-legacy-in-rajasthan-s-udaipur/story-bmcrcqnr3LyJXGYCAVryHL.html

NCB sources said the two had revealed the names of Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda and Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik. NCB officials conducted searches at their residences on Friday morning and both were summoned for inquiry at NCB office in South Mumbai. A senior IPS officer from NCB confirmed the development and said, “Parihar was arrested late night and we will produce him before a magistrate court in the afternoon.” “Some evidence has been collected from the house of Miranda and Showik during the searches conducted. But the investigation is at a very preliminary stage and details of the evidence gathered from their residence cannot be revealed at the moment,” said the officer. Zaid Vilatra was arrested on Thursday and he was produced in the court and remanded in police custody till September 9. Zaid and Basit were called from questioning on Wednesday for their alleged role in drug peddling. Also Watch | Sushant death: NCB raids Rhea’s home; Samuel Miranda detained l Latest updatesNCB officials said that they have been questioning Vilatra and Parihar, and recovered Indian currency Rs 955,750, foreign currency US $ 2,081, 180 British Pounds and 15 Dirhams from Vilatra’s possession and during inquiry, he confessed that those were the proceeds of drug peddling, added NCB officials. While NCB had registered a case in Rajput’s death, the current investigation is a result of a separate case the NCB had registered. NCB had registered a case based on specific input and had arrested two persons, Abbas Lakhani and Karn Arora, and seized curated marijuana from their possession. During their questioning, NCB found Abbas Lakhani’s links to Bandra resident Vilatra who told the officials that he runs an eatery in Bandra (West) which lost business during the lockdown so he began peddling drugs through which he earned a substantial amount of money. Vilatra revealed that he was in touch with another Bandra resident, Basit Parihar. NCB questioned Parihar and found that he was in touch with Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik. Showik had allegedly used chats with Parihar regarding drug consumption and procurement. An analysis of Showik’s chats revealed that on March 17, 2020, he had shared Vilatra’s contact number with Samuel Miranda and asked to pay him Rs 10,000 for 5g. Thereafter, Samuel Miranda had contacted Vilatra for the first time on Showik’s behest, said NCB officials. But before Samuel called, Parihar had called Vilatra. Samuel had called Vilatra three times, said NCB officials. During interrogation, Vilatra has disclosed that he was paid cash Rs 10,000 and handed over 5g to two persons. The location analysis reveals that on March 17, 2020, Vilatra and Samuel Miranda were at the same location, added NCB officials||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-ncb-claims-to-have-found-links-between-drug-peddlers-samuel-miranda-and-rhea-s-brother/story-5R04UaHYqpLiib3WotcfKL.html

Ram Kadam dismissed Sawant’s attack sand said the real issue is about attempts to pressurise Ranaut. “I am ready for a Narco test whenever they want me. I have never hidden my Bollywood connections. I organise the biggest Dahi Handi festival in Mumbai and all film stars including Shahrukh Khan come there. However, the issue here is of trying to pressurise Kangana and protecting the Bollywood Mafia,” said Kadam. Sanjay Raut, whose article in Saamana on Thursday asking Ranaut not to return to Mumbai had started the debate, said that undue importance is being given to her.“If she has proof of the drug mafia, she should submit the proof to the government or the Police instead of just using the social media,” said Raut.Defending Ranaut, BJP legislator Ram Kadam called this a diversionary tactic.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut’s tweet comparing Mumbai to PoK draws controversy“The whole attempt is to scare her from exposing the Bollywood nexus.

04-09-2020||India||BJP protests against ‘illegal’ transfer of Puri dharmasala land in Odisha||Upping the ante on the allotment of plots of a heritage dharmasala in the holy town of Puri to a few lodge owners by the Naveen Patnaik government, the BJP on Thursday started an online petition against the move and pushed for its cancellation.The petition on change.org, seeking cancellation of the allotment of Bagala Dharmasala plots by the state government, was launched by party’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra and state unit president Sameer Mohanty.Patra, launching the campaign “Bagala bachao andolan”, said it was unfortunate that the state government wanted to give away part of the dharmasala’s land to influential persons for building their lodge.“A Jagannath devotee Kanheya Lal Bagala had donated the land of dharmasala in 1905 to cater to the needs of pilgrims and economically backward devotees as thousands of visitors had to suffer due to lack of accommodation in the holy town. As there was a widespread epidemic at that time, a lot of pilgrims had died. The dharmasala served the poor devotees of Lord Jagannath who used to pay a very negligible amount towards their stay. It is quite sad that the building once meant for housing poor devotees is being given away illegally,” alleged Patra.Since August last year, the Puri district administration had gone on a demolition spree, razing several mutts, lodges as well as private houses within 75-metre perimeter of the 12th century Jagannath temple over security threat. As part of relief and rehabilitation package to the lodge owners, the Puri district administration had allotted 0.34 acres of land of Bagala Dharmasala to five lodge owners whose lodges were demolished during the beautification drive last year.The BJP, which over last fortnight has been protesting against the move of the state government, said the act has hurt the sentiments of crores of Jagannath devotees and Odias across the world. “This callous action by the state government is a huge humiliation for the Jagannath devotees,” said BJP state unit chief Sameer Mohanty.The Odisha government in 2018, said the BJP leaders, had brought the dharmasala under the Central-assisted PRASAD scheme for its renovation work and an amount of Rs 21 crore was sanctioned. “The India Tourism Development Corporation started the work and spent approximately Rs 3.26 crore for the pile foundation after being allocated a plot near Jagannath temple. However, the state government abruptly stopped the work without any basis. It now seems the work was stopped so that some land of the dharmasala can be given to some BJD leaders,” alleged Patra.BJD leader Amar Satpathy, however, dismissed the charges, saying the BJP did not want development of the heritage city of Puri.Puri district administration said there has been no illegality in the allotment of plot as is being claimed.“Just 0.34 acres of land of Bagala Dharmasala has been given to private lodge owners who had lost their commercial establishment as per the Relief and Rehabilitation policy approved by the state government. The lodge owners were given options of taking cash or land in lieu of their commercial establishment. Just six persons opted for government land on the Grand Road and accordingly 0.34 acres out of 2.78 acres land of Bagala Dharmasala was allotted to five of them. One of the five persons is a servitor of the temple,” said Singh.The dharmasala building is still standing intact, he said.“The rehabilitation policy is being executed to ensure the security of the temple, increase in capacity as well as the provision of better quality accommodation for pilgrims so that Puri emerges as a world heritage centre. We should acknowledge and appreciate the sacrifices made by the servitors donating their centuries-old land properties for the cause of the Jagannath temple,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-protests-against-illegal-transfer-of-puri-dharmasala-land-in-odisha/story-CLgabVkppCcFywLX5O5ycI.html

On Thursday, India had reported 83,883 cases of the coronavirus cases.The country’s death toll reached 68,472 after 1,096 people succumbed to the viral disease, the ministry’s data showed. The number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus disease is now 3,037,151 after 66,659 patients were declared cured across the country. There are 831,124 active cases in the country.The health ministry said on Friday that less than 1/2% of the active cases are on ventilators, 2% are in ICUs and less than 3.5% are on oxygen support. “This is due to early detection, early hospitalisation and effective clinical management based on Standard Treatment Protocol,” it added.On Thursday, India had reached another peak of highest single-day recoveries at 68,584. There are 26 states and Union territories which have reported a recovery rate of over 70% and recovered cases are 3.6 times the number of active cases, the health ministry said on Thursday.Delhi recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases recorded in a day on Thursday since June-end, data from the daily health bulletin released by the government shows. The Capital recorded 2,737 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday with almost 33,000 tests having been conducted in a day.Delhi also recorded 19 more deaths due to the infection, taking the total toll in the city to 4,500. After recording deaths in single digits in August third week, the number of deaths started increasing and went up to 22 deaths a day recorded on three days during the last two weeks. The increasing number of cases and deaths in the national capital has led the Union home ministry to start “active engagement” with the Delhi government and lieutenant governor again.“The number of active cases and deaths in Delhi was on a decline, but in the last few weeks, both the parameters have gone up. Keeping that in mind, the ministry of home affairs has started active engagement with the Delhi government,” Rajesh Bhushan, the Union health secretary, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-over-83-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-day-tally-nears-4-million/story-842xvRGfmbtcOZzSWHBHWP.html

04-09-2020||India||Departments procrastinate probes against ‘corrupt’ officials, Amit Shah displeased||Union Home Minister Amit Shah is unhappy that departments under him are not completing probes against officers facing allegations of corruption or administrative lapses in time and has “strictly” ordered them to follow the rules. A communication sent to all the divisions and organisations that come under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), reviewed by HT, said “It is observed by the home minister that the prescribed schedule of time limits in conducting investigations and departmental inquiries are not being followed by the departments/divisions as per the instructions issued by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)”. According to the guidelines issued by CVC in May 2000 on schedule of time limits on departmental investigations, once a complaint is received against an officer in any government department, a decision has to be taken within a month whether it involves a vigilance aspect or not and the departmental probe should be completed within six months. The letter sent to all home ministry’s divisions and chief vigilance officers (CVOs) of all departments on behalf of Shah stated that there should be strict compliance of the guidelines. The departments which report to Shah include all central paramilitary forces such as the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Assam Rifles, the National Security Guard (NSG), the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the National Intelligence Grid (Natgrid), the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the National Civil Defence College (NCDC) etc. The divisions in the MHA under Shah’s authority are the union territories of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh, left-wing extremism (LWE), border management, foreigners’ division, cyber crime, Centre-state division, prisons and others that are crucial in making day-to-day decisions on internal security. Officials familiar with the development, who didn’t wish to be named, said many investigations linger on for years. As reported by HT in August, the anti-corruption watchdog – Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) – had also written to all CVOs in all ministries and government departments to complete the disciplinary proceedings against officers facing probe for corruption or administrative lapses in time even if they have to be conducted through video-conference because of the unprecedented coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. CVOs posted in every government department are responsible for finalising a disciplinary proceeding against officials indulging in any activity in violation of the norms or forwarding corruption complaints to CVC in a bid to ensure that a probe by CBI can be requested, if required. CVC has repeatedly reminded government departments to finish their disciplinary proceedings in time. A July 2018 letter written by CVC to all departments stated that “the unexplained delays lead to Central Administrative Tribunals (CATs) and the high courts quashing the charge sheet (s) on the sole ground that the disciplinary authorities concerned had issued charge sheets to the delinquents (officers under investigation) after very long periods of commission of alleged misconduct etc and also for unexplained delays in conducting disciplinary enquiries”. “Such long delays in finalising disciplinary matters are not just unjust to officials who may be finally exonerated, but help the guilty to evade punitive action,” CVC had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/departments-procrastinate-probes-against-corrupt-officials-amit-shah-displeased/story-zEdRDn5fknTi73CuMFpY4N.html
04-09-2020||India||India paves the way for return of 410 Pakistani Hindus stranded across the border||The Indian government has extended the term of the NORI (No Objection to Return to India) visas issued to at least 410 Pakistani Hindu immigrants-- who were living in India on long-term visas (LTV) before their intended short-trip to Pakistan earlier this year left them stranded due to the travel restrictions imposed in the wake of Covid-19—to facilitate their return to India, according to an office memorandum issued by Union ministry of home affairs.The term of the lapsed NORI visas of such migrants will be treated as deemed extended for a period up to 15 days from the date of lifting of such travel restrictions by the government of India.HT has seen the memorandums sent by the MHA to the external affairs ministry (MEA) and to the additional director of the Bureau of Immigration on July 31, paving the way for the return of such immigrants to India.The migrants stranded in Pakistan include a 33-year-old Janata Mali, who travelled with her husband and three children to see her ailing mother in Mirpur Khas in February before the Covid-19 lockdown was clamped. Being Indian citizens, her husband and children returned to Jodhpur in the last week of June through a shuttle service operated for citizens stuck on both sides of the border but Janata Mali, a Pakistani living in Jodhpur on long-term visa since 2007, was denied permission to travel. The July orders were issued after an earlier decision taken on May 9 to extend the NORI visas could not be implemented properly by the Indian high commission in Islamabad due to some technical difficulties. The MEA then requested the MHA for a review of the order on June 17.Also Read: Pakistan trying to politicise UNSC’s terrorist listing process, says IndiaThe MEA gave details to MHA of 410 Pak nationals, who held NORI visas issued by India and had been registered with the Indian high commission in Islamabad for the purpose of return to India.

04-09-2020||India||1962 to the Emergency: When Question Hour was dropped amid extraordinary circumstances||Suspension of the Question Hour, or the first 60 minutes of a Parliament session in which lawmakers seek direct replies from ministers, has become a issue for the Opposition parties. But sifting through Parliament data showed that this will be the first time that there will be a temporary suspension of the Question Hour. In the past, the Question Hour had been suspended during wars and the Emergency. However, this time around the Opposition parties are arguing that there are no such exigencies and have alleged that the government is running away from answering their questions. 1962 winter session During the India-China war of 1962, Parliament’s winter session had skipped the Question Hour. “The Session was to commence on November 11, 1962, but due to the Chinese aggression, it was advanced,” a parliamentary report said. The war had started on October 20 and lasted until November 21. From October 26, Parliament also made a special provision: it started daily from 12 noon instead of 11 am. While the original schedule was for 34 days, ultimately the session conducted legislative business for 26 days. 1971 winter session In December 1971, when then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced the unconditional surrender of Pakistan, it saw the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh. Parliament’s winter session was in progress --- Gandhi had made that announcement in the Lok Sabha -- while the country was still at war. According to PRS legislative research, Parliamentarian Hari Vishnu Kamath had suggested that “Parliament of the nation must continue to be in session and have the privilege of advising and guiding the government in this emergency.” During the 1971 war, too, the daily schedule was changed. “From December 6 to 23 (due to Pakistani aggression), hours of sittings of the Lok Sabha were changed to 10 am from 1 pm and the Question Hour and Calling Attention matters were suspended,” according to the official data. The Emergency (June 25, 1975 –March 21, 1977)During the Emergency, imposed by the Indira Gandhi regime, Parliament continued to function but without Question Hour in at least two sessions. Between June 1975 and March 1997 — when the Emergency was in place — five parliament sessions were to be conducted. The monsoon session of 1975 — the first after the declaration of the Emergency — didn’t have a Question Hour or time for Opposition MPs to ask questions to different ministers. The winter session of 1976, too, didn’t have a Question Hour. Several constitutional amendments were cleared hurriedly during this period. One of the most significant one was the 42nd Amendment that added the words “Socialist” and “Secular” to the Preamble to the Indian constitution. 2020 monsoon session Unstarred questions, or written questions that ministers need to reply to, would be allowed during the monsoon session of Parliament, but the Question Hour would remain cancelled, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The decision has been taken at a time, when the Opposition parties have protested against the move not to schedule the Question Hour. They have called the decision an attempt by the government to avoid being questioned, and have also described it as a bid to curb their rights. The unstarred questions would have to be submitted to the secretariat and answers would be provided on the day the question is listed (it would also be uploaded on the website), the people cited above said. However, oral or starred questions will not be allowed -- in the interests of time -- and to ensure that the number of people in Parliament is kept low (when a question from a ministry is listed to be asked as a starred one, key ministry officials are expected to be present in Parliament). The session may also not allow private member bills — through which Members of Parliament (MPs) seek policy or legislative changes — and the Zero Hour through which MPs raise current issues may also be limited to just half an hour. These changes have been necessitated following an unprecedented coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the country. The monsoon session is scheduled to start on September 14 and end on October 1 without any weekend breaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1962-to-the-emergency-when-question-hour-was-dropped-amid-extraordinary-circumstances/story-7608h3XMxPwVVuCiuOFRLJ.html
04-09-2020||India||CM Chouhan orders inquiry into sale of grain unfit for humans at govt shop||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced a police inquiry into distribution of sub-standard rice, meant for cattle feed, to poor people through the Public Distribution System, in two districts of the state.The inquiry would be conducted by the economic offence wing (EOW) of Madhya Pradesh police, the CM announced.The sub-standard rice was being distributed by millers in collusion with officials in tribal dominated Balaghat and Mandla districts.In Balaghat district, the administration had sealed 18 rice mills and disconnected power supply to these mills in the past 24 hours. Five more employees of the food and civil supplies department in the district were suspended on Thursday. The administration is in process of filing more FIRs against rice mill owners, said Balaghat collector Deepak Arya. In Mandla, 14 rice mills and a warehouse were sealed to facilitate the inquiry, said district collector Harshika Singh. On Wednesday night, the state government had terminated the services of two officers of Food and Civil Supplies department who held the posts of quality controllers, suspended another officer of the department in Balaghat district and filed FIRs with police against eight millers in the two districts on basis of analysis done of 32 samples of food grains by a Central government’s lab from these, officials said. The lab report submitted on August 21 by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution to MP’s principal secretary Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, stated, “The samples were analysed in the NABL accredited Central Grain Analysis Laboratory (CGAL), Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi….The stocks are found to be unfit for human consumption and in the categories of Feed-I which is meant to be suitable for livestock feed (such as goat, horse, sheep), Feed-II which is suitable for cattle feed and Feed-III which is suitable for poultry feed, as per the guidelines for the issuance/disposal of the stocks.” On Thursday, CM Chouhan said in a tweet, “The guilty who supplied bad quality rice to public distribution shops will not be spared. I have decided to conduct an EOW inquiry into it so that truth could come to light. Stringent action will be taken against the guilty to check possibility of recurrence of such incidents.” However, the Congress dubbed the CM’s announcement as an eyewash. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “Had the Congress not raised the issue with concrete evidence and there had not been a central government’s report on the quality of rice, the BJP government would not have taken any action. The central government’s report was lying with the state government for over a week. Will the CM conduct an inquiry as to why action was not taken against millers and government employees responsible for distribution of such rice of poor quality through the PDS shops, so far?”(With input from Monika Pandey in Jabalpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-chouhan-orders-inquiry-into-sale-of-grain-unfit-for-humans-at-govt-shop/story-undNcifQ46UathNjjtrU3L.html
04-09-2020||India||4 months on, India and China to sit across table. Rajnath meeting today the first||In a bid to break the deadlock in Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, on Friday evening on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) ministerial in Moscow. This is the first major political contact between India and China since the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) unilaterally changed the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in May 2020 in east Ladakh.According to people familiar with the developments in Moscow and Delhi, the meeting was arranged at the behest of both sides mutually to find a way out of the current stalemate in Ladakh with both the Indian Army and PLA deployed in full strength to counter each other. That the Ladakh stand-off will be the topic of discussion is evident from the presence of ministry of external affairs joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava in Moscow on Friday. Srivastava has held a series of conversations with his Chinese counterpart under the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs towards disengagement and de-escalation of the PLA in the contested sectors.The meeting between two defence ministers is crucial as Rajnath Singh is number two in the Narendra Modi government and a former BJP president, Gen Wei, a former missile force commander, is a state councillor and member of the all-powerful Central Military Commission. The CMC, headed by chairman President Xi Jinping, controls the PLA.with the President as commander-in-chief.Also Watch | ‘Situation along LAC slightly tense’: Army Chief speaks on border row with ChinaAfter this meeting, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at the same platform in Moscow on September 10.Also read: The curious link behind China’s Ladakh moves and a looming food crisis | AnalysisThe ministerial-level meeting between India and China comes at a time when PLA and the Indian Army are locked in a tense posture in Ladakh and occupied Aksai Chin with the former trying to impose 1960 claim map (demarcated by a green line) on the ground and the latter clear that its claim line (demarcated by a black line) is the true LAC.While PLA initially had made gains on the ground north of Pangong Tso in May and June, the Indian Army has nullified the dominance by repositioning on the heights overlooking Finger four on the lake and make tactical gains on south banks of the contested lake by pre-empting the Chinese troops.“It is a game of pressure and time.

Also read: Two dhabas in Haryana’s Murthal sealed after 75 workers test positive for Covid-19Delhi reported 2,737 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, while around 33,000 tests were conducted. This was the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases since June-end, the data from the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin showed. Delhi also recorded 19 fresh deaths due to the contagion, as the toll tally in the national capital rose to 4,500. The city was recording Covid-19-related deaths in single digits until the third week of August. But the fatality count went up to 22 a day on three occasions in the past two weeks.However, the case fatality ratio (CFR) – the number of deaths who tested Covid-19 positive – has been on the decline in the national capital. At present, Delhi’s CFR is 2.47%, but still much higher than the national average of 1.78%.“The number of active cases and deaths in Delhi was on a decline, but in the last few weeks both the parametres have gone up. Now, the MHA has started an active engagement with the Delhi government,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW). He said that Delhi government has been given guidelines to help control the number of Covid-19 cases and related deaths. “We are engaging with the Delhi government under the supervision of the MHA. We also held a meeting with the L-G recently, where the representatives from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), MoH&FW, and NITI Aayog were also present. We have given them some guidelines. If the guidelines are effectively followed, then the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths can be controlled,” said Bhushan. Bhushan said that Delhi was one of the five states that accounted for 70% of the total deaths in the country.Andhra Pradesh (AP), Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu (TN) are the other worst-hit states as far as the viral outbreak is concerned, he added.Bhsuhan pointed out that Delhi and Karnataka are the two among the five worst-hit states that have reported an uptick in the CFR in the past three weeks. The Delhi government authorities declined to comment.Delhi has ramped up its daily tests over the past two days in line with the Central government’s directive. The move has helped lower the positivity rate – the number of Covid-19 tests that show positive among the total swab samples tested – to 8.34% until Thursday. While the seven-day average positivity rate over the last week was 9.01%. Bhushan has also urged the states to conduct more real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. “There are states, where the optimal capacity of RT-PCR tests, of late, are not being utilised. We have drawn the attention of those states to the fact that they do have an installed capacity of conducting a particular number of RT-PCR tests, and they are doing less than their capacity. They need to scale up their RT-PCR tests,” said the secretary.“There is no uniform picture across the country, when it comes to RT-PCR and rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests. For instance, TN leads the pack as far as RT-PCR tests are concerned at over 90%. There are other states where the RT-PCR, TruNat (used for detection of tuberculosis), and CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test) testing capacities are limited. ICMR has laid down guidelines that RAD tests are ideal for screening in densely populated areas, containment and buffer zones. So why not use them?” he asked. An expert has a different take on the nation-wide testing pattern.“Testing is going up in Delhi. If we test more, we are likely to have more new Covid-19 cases. However, the positivity rate should remain the same. Since, the positivity rate has also gone up, it implies that the transmission of the infection has risen again amid further easing of lockdown restrictions. Hence, there is a need to conduct more RT-PCR tests. But RAD tests cannot be used for large scale diagnosis. If a person gets a false positive report, he may think that he has not been infected and may end up spreading the SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, among others,” said Dr Lalit Kant, a former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at ICMR..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-ministry-steps-in-again-as-cases-deaths-rise-in-delhi/story-TcFx0aVhBrhH6mmtAXHPRM.html

Fewer still _ 2.03% of the active cases _ are in need of admission to an intensive care unit. And, only 0.33% or 2,717 people with Covid-19 in the country are on ventilator, data released by the union health ministry shows. Also read: UNICEF says drugmakers can produce unprecedented vaccine quantities for Covid-19“This is due to early detection, early hospitalisation, and effective clinical management based on standard treatment protocol,” the health ministry said. At present, there are over 815,000 active cases of coronavirus disease in India. India reported 83,507 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday, taking the country’s tally close to 4 million cases. Five states _ Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu _ account for 62% of the active cases in the country. Except Tamil Nadu, the average daily active cases in the other four states have gone up during the past week, data from the health ministry shows. Over 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have been reported in a day across the country for three days in a row. On Thursday, 1,080 people died of it, taking the total toll of the infection to over 68,000 in the country, according to data from the HT dashboard. The union health ministry data shows that five states account for 70% of the cumulative deaths reported so far. However, only two of the five states have shown an increase in the number of deaths in the last three weeks – Karnataka and Delhi. Even as the numbers are on the rise, the case fatality ratio _ fraction of people who die among those who test positive for the infection _ has remained steady at 1.7%. On being asked why the government was reopening the economy even as the number of cases and deaths were on the rise, union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “The government has adopted a graded approach to open up various economic activities. It is not as if suddenly everything has been opened up. Prior to that, the government also ensured that all prerequisites are in place _ we have ensured that the testing capacity in the country is adequate, that there are clear cut guidelines of standard clinical treatment protocol, that the hospital infrastructure is enhanced and there are adequate number of ICU beds, isolation beds, and oxygen beds. All these things have been firmed up and only then has the government gone for a graded opening of economy. At the end of the day, the government firmly believes that while lives are important, livelihoods are equally important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-2-717-coronavirus-patients-on-ventilator-support-health-ministry/story-rui0zOgbl5bxvoHpgQFcbN.html
04-09-2020||India||Yogi Adityanath wants global publicity campaign for Ram temple in Ayodhya||Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday directed state government officials to chalk out an elaborate plan for a worldwide and world-class publicity campaign for the under-construction Ram temple in Ayodhya.The Ram temple would open new vistas of tourism in the near future, he said while addressing one of the two meetings held through video-conference to review the ongoing projects in the temple town and the Ayodhya division in eastern UP. He said at the other video-conference that the shrine would give Ayodhya a new identity. The need of the hour is to develop Ayodhya as a “solar city” in a bid to conserve the environment. “Ayodhya is known worldwide as Lord Ram’s birthplace and has an immense mythological significance. All development works in the town must be executed while keeping its ancient culture intact. Ayodhya, once developed, will also spur development of the other districts in the eastern UP region,” he said.“All ghats of Ayodhya should be conserved and beautified. A riverfront, stretching from Guptar Ghat to Naya Ghat, must be developed. The upcoming multi-level parking project should tap its commercial potential. The work on underground power cables also needs to be expedited,” he added.The CM laid stress on seamless movement of tourists and pilgrims in the ancient temple town. “Make two bus stations in Ayodhya, and develop the ‘Panchkosi’, ‘Chaudahkosi’, and ‘Chaurasikosi’ parikramas (circumambulations) around Ayodhya in a bid to decongest them. Widen all roads in Ayodhya on a priority basis. The Ram-Janaki path must be built as a world class facility,” he told the officers, who attended the video-conference.His call to action included opening more hotels in Ayodhya, as tourists and pilgrims’ footfall are set to rise in the temple town in the near future.“An increased footfall of tourists and pilgrims will lead to employment opportunities for local people,” Yogi said.The facilities at dharmshalas and restrooms must also be upgraded, he added.“The temple town should have a proper drainage system. Speed up the airport construction project in Ayodhya,” the CM directed to the officials concerned.Later in the day, Yogi chaired the Ayodhya divisional officers’ meeting on development works and ordered them to finish all the projects within the stipulated deadline. “Missing deadlines will lead to cost escalation,” he pointed out, as he reviewed projects worth over Rs 50 crore. “The projects won’t suffer due to want of funds,” he announced and warned the officials that there should be no compromise on the quality of the construction.He directed the officials to expedite construction of community toilets and gram panchayat buildings. He also asked them to digitalise all the secretariats in villages.The CM praised the officials in the Ayodhya division for their commendable performance regarding the payment of sugarcane dues to farmers and satisfactory power distribution. He lauded the reclamation of rivers through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005. The officials were also directed to rejuvenate ponds in the Ayodhya division under the Atal Bhoojal Yojana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-wants-global-publicity-campaign-for-ram-temple-in-ayodhya/story-XW9pXzwyWqAcXTTzS5IcXO.html

04-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Positivity rate double among healthcare workers in Delhi, Telangana and Maharashtra||The positivity rate for coronavirus among healthcare workers in three states _ Telangana, Maharashtra, and Delhi _ is double or more than the rate in general population, according to data shared by the union health ministry on Thursday.Positivity rate reflects the proportion of people who test positive among those who are tested. Also read: Virus can spread in public transport, reveals studyIndia’s positivity rate currently stands at about 7%. The country has ramped up testing and has been able to conduct over 1 million tests for three days consecutively. In comparison, the positivity rate among healthcare workers _ doctors, nurses, paramedical staff _ is the highest in Telangana where 18% of those tested were found to be positive. This is followed by Maharahtra with 16% and Delhi with 12%. The union health ministry has reached out to six states where the positivity rate among healthcare workers is on the “higher side.” The other states with high positivity rate among healthcare workers include – Karnataka where 13% of those tested are found to be positive, Puducherry with 12%, and Punjab with 11%, according to the data shared. “We have been tracking the positivity rate among the health care workers in the country. They are a precious resource and there is a need to protect them from the infection. We have brought this to the attention of these states and union territories through the ministry of home affairs,” said union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan in the press briefing on Thursday. He cited three reasons for higher infection among healthcare workers _ protocols for hospital infection control not being followed, protective gear not being used properly, and lack of containment measures in their area of residence. “The high positivity rate among healthcare worker begs the question, how are they getting infected? Is it from the hospital? That could be one reason. There is a standard protocol for hospital infection control. We have to see if that is being followed, if not we need to follow that. Then, we need to see if adequate protection is being taken by the healthcare workers, that is, proper donning and doffing of the PPE kits. We have also issued an SOP for that. We have recommended a buddy system where you have a group of two nurses or doctors with one seeing that the other has properly donned or doffed the PPE,” said Bhushan. He also said that if the healthcare workers are getting the infection from their area of residence, then proper containment measures would be needed. “We have also drawn the attention of the states and UTs to the localities where these doctors and nurses and support staff are coming from. If they are bringing infection from their localities, then we have to decide whether those localities have been contained or not. In case there is a need for containment or declaring them as buffer zone, then that must be done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-positivity-rate-double-among-health-care-workers-in-delhi-telangana-and-maharashtra/story-XQ4QrDIngN0E6CX1k5tUdK.html

The suspended Uttar Pradesh doctor said his family feared that the Yogi government could frame him in another case and put him in prison again. “We were assured of a safe stay in Jaipur by Priyankaji, who spoke to my mother and wife and said that the UP government may slap other charges against me. We feel safe here in Rajasthan,” Dr Khan said during a press conference at Pink City Press Club in Jaipur on Thursday. Dr Khan was released after the Allahabad high court set aside the charges pressed against him for a speech on Citizenship Amendment Act in Aligarh Muslim University in January this year. He was arrested on January 29. The paediatrician from the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur said he would appeal to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to revoke his suspension. “I shall write to UP CM urging him to revoke my suspension and give my service back so that I can work as a corona warrior. I want to volunteer in the vaccine research programme,” he said. Khan added that he will knock at the high court’s doors again if the suspension wasn’t revoked. He said despite the high court’s order to release him, the Mathura district administration delayed the release. “Mathura jail superintendent said he would only follow orders of DM [district magistrate] and DM was waiting for orders from Lucknow. They released me around midnight because they were looking for an opportunity to slap another charge against me,” Khan said. The doctor said his 65-year-old mother had to run from pillar to post - from the Aligarh lower court to the Allahabad High Court to Supreme Court - seeking justice for him for more than seven months. “They have ruined my family (brothers’) businesses. We have been crippled financially,” he said. Recalling the death of 70 kids at the BRD Medical College due to shortage of liquid oxygen, Khan said it happened because the state government had faltered on payment and people in Lucknow were demanding a cut to release payment of Rs 78 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assured-of-safe-stay-by-priyanka-gandhi-kafeel-khan-arrives-in-rajasthan/story-Qa44jgZYTKuk1jKIyyo6rJ.html
04-09-2020||India||Monsoon session of Parliament: Packed food may be served at House canteen||Indian Parliament’s much-publicised canteen may not dish out its cheap but mouth-watering hot dishes in this monsoon session amid severe restrictions to tackle the pandemic. Instead, only food packets are likely to be served and the thalis or wide-ranging ala carte dishes might be off the menu for this extraordinary session due to safety reasons, officials involved in the preparations for the session said. For the past five months, the canteen has only been serving tea and biscuits and its lunch service has been stalled. “It is almost decided not to cook food in the Parliament complex and serve food packets in a bid to reduce entry of people and crowding in Parliament,” said an official. The northern railway-run Indian Parliament usually dishes out sumptuous menu of 48 items at subsidised prices in the Parliament canteens. From boiled vegetables to Kesari bhat, the canteen now serves a total of 48 food items for lunch and evening snacks. But items such as poha, mutton cutlet or bonda are not available regularly. According to canteen officials, the vegetarian thali (Rs 40) and chapaati (Rs 2) are the most sought-after food in Parliament complex. According to the data available with officials, out of Rs 17 crore subsidy, only Rs 24 lakh was spent on account of the MPs. The rest was spent on account of visitors, security personnel and officials. During a normal session, an average 4,500 people eat daily at Parliament. In 2015, then Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had approved a proposal to abolish subsidy on parliament food and run the canteens on a no-profit-no-loss basis. The decision came after years of public criticism that Parliament serves a plate of chicken curry for Rs 29 or dal for just Rs 2. Now, a fruit salad is sold for Rs 10 while the price of chicken curry is revised to Rs 50. A masala dosa is priced at Rs 20. But this session will see a far less footfall due to widespread restrictions to ensure that virus doesn’t spread in the Parliament complex. For this session, visitors would not be allowed to enter the complex, staff strength would be reduced and even media entry would be restricted. “All these measures would also mean that the pressure on canteens would be reduced,” said an official. Plans are also afoot to replace the northern railway with Indian government’s catering arm ITDC to run the parliament canteen. Some officials said that the monsoon session itself may see ITDC along with the railways start their service on a pilot basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-of-parliament-packed-food-may-be-served-at-house-canteen/story-ZpibxPT3UgbQXoS5Z1FfYL.html

The accused Ashoke Kumar Bansal has been arrested.Police said that Bansal went to the office of Dawa Wangel Lama, food controller of Cooch Behar town, and threw acid on the officer. Lama suffered minor injuries. The accused was immediately overpowered by other staff and handed over to the police. “Preliminary interrogation has revealed that the man had some personal grudges against the officer,” said Santosh Nimbalkar, superintendent of police of Cooch Behar district. A few years ago, when Lama was a sub-controller and posted in the adjacent district of Jalpaiguri, Bansal had filed a case in the Calcutta high court against the food supply department. He, however, lost the case. According to a statement released by the police, the accused later filed another case against the food control department. This time he filed it in the Haryana high court. Lama, however, took special initiative and the court quashed the case. “After being defeated for the second time, the man decided to take revenge against Lama. He threw acid to take revenge,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-60-throws-acid-on-govt-officer-after-losing-court-battle-for-2nd-time/story-S7OHFk5bvuwypmrTL6VDvI.html

04-09-2020||India||A skewed recovery, and systemic headwinds||August has been the best month (so far) in terms of economic activity since the imposition of a nation-wide lockdown in India on March 25. However, the ongoing economic recovery is skewed in nature and faces systemic headwinds from within.Services in contraction zone, even as backlog increasesPurchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for August shows that the service sector continues to be in contraction mode for the sixth consecutive month. To be sure, August has seen a faster recovery than July. Respondents however reported “a further weakening of demand conditions” which among other things was also a result of “among the steepest” contractions in new export orders received by Indian service providers. Ongoing lockdown restrictions have meant that firms are unable to process previously placed orders, even as job losses continued for the sixth consecutive month, the press release from IHS Markit, which conducts the survey, said.See Chart 1: PMI industry and services !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Employment intensive sectors were hit the hardest in the first quarterGross Value Added (GVA) data for the April-June quarter when read with sector-wise employment share numbers narrate a grim story. The sectors which have suffered the biggest contraction also have the largest share of employment. Trade, hotels, transport, storage and communication (18.5%); manufacturing (12.1%) and construction (12.1%), which together account for 42.7% of total employment according to the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey, have suffered the biggest contraction in the first quarter. This underlines the possibility of job losses having a cascading adverse effect on future demand.See Chart 2: Scatter plot of employment share and contraction in GVA !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Ongoing recovery could get jeopardized once pent-up demand is exhaustedRising infections that prevented a return to normal service sector activity, continuing job losses, and a massive negative shock from the contraction in the April-June quarter means that the economy lacks a solid demand anchor. Consequently, some of the ongoing recovery could just be one-time pent-up demand. Once this is exhausted, even the nascent recovery that is being seen in some sectors could dissipate. Firms seem to expect this. In the Reserve bank of India’s Industrial Outlook Survey, conducted in April-June 2020, net expectations of order bookings in the July-September quarter were the lowest since June 2009.See Chart 3: Net expectation of order books !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The situation emphasizes the importance of a co-ordinated policy response. “We believe policymakers have an important role to play in the recovery process beyond traditional monetary and fiscal stimulus. This would entail efficient re-allocation of capital from sectors that are not working to those that are. Improving the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code procedure is a key step here”, said a research note by Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Private Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-skewed-recovery-and-systemic-headwinds/story-aYd8RJwG5L5NTycTlvrLGJ.html
04-09-2020||India||After a wet August, subdued rain across India likely for a week: IMD||India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities have said that rainfall has reduced across the country following the most wettest August this monsoon in 44 years.There is a 27.5% rain deficiency in the first three days of September. The weather condition is likely to remain largely dry with isolated events of heavy rainfall in some parts of north-west and peninsular India, scientists said.“There is no weather system that’s likely to develop at least for a week. Monsoon will be subdued with some isolated cases of heavy rainfall in north-west India and the southern peninsula,” said RK Jenamani, a senior scientist at National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC), IMD. All other zones, except for peninsular India, will be rainfall deficient in September. Peninsular India has recorded 71.5% excess rainfall for the first three days of September.The western end of the monsoon trough – the line of low pressure – is lying south of its normal position – from Ganganagar in western Rajasthan to the Bay of Bengal – and is likely to remain that way for the next two days. The eastern end is lying to the north of its normal position. The monsoon trough is likely to shift north of its normal position from Saturday (September 5) onwards, IMD said in its Thursday bulletin. Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh (MP) recorded 12 centimetres (cm) of rainfall; while Mandi in Himachal Pradesh (HP) received 9 cm and Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand recorded 8cm on Thursday.A cyclonic circulation is lying over north-west Rajasthan. Under the influence of the circulation, isolated heavy rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over HP and Rajasthan on Friday; and over Uttarakhand between Friday and Monday (from September 4 to 7)A cyclonic circulation is also lying over east-central and adjoining south-east Arabian Sea off the coasts of Karnataka and north Kerala. Under its influence, widespread and heavy rain is very likely over peninsular India during the next three-four days.August received record rains at 26.3% excess – the highest in 44 years. Central and peninsular India received 61.5% and 36.7% excess rainfall, respectively, in August. However, the precipitation was 19.1% deficient over eastern and north-east India. While the north-western parts of the country received 1.9% excess rainfall. Monsoon rainfall since June 1 over the country is 8.8% excess to date, scientists added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-wet-august-subdued-rain-across-india-likely-for-a-week-imd/story-DyIZhNvdhv59lDXM46udBJ.html

Talking to journalists in Gwalior, Scindia said, “Despite the crisis the country is facing due to Covid situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is working wholeheartedly to make available all facilities in hospitals like beds, plasma etc for treatment of Covid patients. He has infused a sense of security in people.” Praising the PM and BJP, Scindia said, “On one side there is development-oriented thinking and on the other side there is negative thinking.” “I only believe in politics of development. If former CM Kamal Nath visits our hometown (Gwalior) he is welcome here. However, we will continue to work for development of the region. When it comes to elections, people of the region would send him back,” Scindia said.He said, “During the first five months of the present BJP government in the state, every state assembly constituency has development projects worth ₹100 to ₹300 crore. Chambal Expressway which was the dream of my revered father is going to link Gwalior-Chambal region to Uttar Pradesh on one side and to Rajasthan on the other side.

04-09-2020||India||Note ban meant to hurt informal sector: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that the government’s hidden agenda behind demonetisation was to deliberately harm India’s informal sector, which survives on liquid cash. In his latest video series on the Indian economy, Gandhi dubbed the 2016 demonetisation as an “attack on India’s poor, farmers, workers and small shop owners”. He claimed that the hidden agenda of demonetisation, which saw the scrapping of all ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes, was to “clear the ground”. “Our informal sector works on cash. Small shopkeepers and workers survive on cash. The second target of demonetisation was to take out money from the informal sector. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the nation that he wants a cashless India. If India goes cashless, small shopkeepers, farmers, and workers will be finished,” Gandhi said in his video series. The short videos are the new communication tools for the former Congress president to reach out to a larger audience on social media. Earlier, he had spoken on the India-China border conflict and the informal sector amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.India’s informal, or unorganised, sector absorbs about 95% of the county’s workforce and is the key to an equitable growth. Gandhi’s latest series comes in the wake of the Indian economy’s decline by a record 23.9% in the first quarter of April to June in the current financial year 2020-21. The deceleration reflected the economic impact of the 68-day Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions in the first quarter.Gandhi recounted the woes of millions of people, who suffered following demonetisation, and said that the exercise didn’t solve the black money problem. “What did the poor Indians benefit? Nothing. So who all benefitted? Only the country’s billionaires,” Gandhi alleged. “The government used your money to write off the loans of the billionaires,” he further alleged.Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party did not comment on the allegations when contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/note-ban-meant-to-hurt-informal-sector-rahul-gandhi/story-fyBpFrFKBh2i2QsPXpd4aM.html
04-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||One of the most frightening things I have read in recent times is a study titled Community Outbreak Investigation of Sars-CoV-2 Transmission Among Bus Riders in Eastern China published in JAMA (Journal of American Medical Association) Internal Medicine. According to this study, by researchers from the US and China, 23 of 67 passengers who took a round trip lasting 100 minutes by bus (in January, in Zhejiang in Eastern China) to attend a 150-minute event were infected by the 68th passenger on the bus (who was unaware about being infected). A few of those who attended the event (and weren’t on the bus) were also infected — and all of them said they had come in close contact with the so-called index patient. The researchers found that those who were on the bus were around 40 times more likely to have been infected than 60 others (none infected) on another bus attending the same event (lending an entirely different perspective to the great Ken Kesey’s quote — “you are either on the bus or off the bus”).RESEARCHA study by researchers from the US and China showed that 23 of 67 passengers who took a round trip lasting 100 minutes by bus to attend an event were infected by the 68th passenger on the bus. The bus was air conditioned and in indoor-circulation mode. And while there were high-risk and low-risk zones, there wasn’t an appreciable difference in the chances of infection of those seated in these — a clear indication of airborne transmission of the virus.The bus was air conditioned and in indoor-circulation mode. And while there were high-risk and low-risk zones, there wasn’t an appreciable difference in the chances of infection of those seated in these — a clear indication of airborne transmission of the Sars-CoV2 virus, especially in a closed area where the air is recirculating. The attack rate of the virus on the bus was around 34%, the researchers found, although people seated near the door and the one window that could be opened, did not get infected.The study was published on Tuesday, a day before India’s housing and urban affairs ministry put out guidelines for the resumption of 15 Metro services around the country (13 of these will begin services; two, one in Mumbai and the other in Nagpur, both in the state of Maharashtra which continues to be ravaged by the virus, will not). It isn’t just the Metro; many offices have opened; as have several malls; and some restaurants and gymnasiums. The challenge before all of them is along two dimensions — all arising from the fact that when the facilities (including Metro coaches and stations) were being designed, the emphasis was on optimising space to accommodate the most number of people. In addition, modern malls and offices worked hard on creating social spaces where people could mingle.THE CHALLENGES The first challenge for Metros and modern offices is social distancing. It is not very difficult to ensure the coaches don’t get crowded, but the stations are another matter altogether. The second challenge is the one presented by air-conditioning. Most modern offices have no openable windows and depend on air-conditioning for both maintaining the temperature and air circulation. The first challenge is social distancing. It is not very difficult to ensure the coaches don’t get crowded, but the stations are another matter altogether. HT reported last week that while Delhi’s buses are sticking to the 20-per-bus limit (by and large) necessitated by Covid-19-related social distancing norms, the stops are crowded, with people waiting for a long time, and then jostling to get into the bus before it reaches its capacity. According to another report in HT, Metro officials will monitor stations through CCTV and order trains to skip crowded stations — an exceptionally well-thought-out solution that assumes the waiting crowd will disperse quietly and in a socially distanced and disciplined manner, instead of continuing to wait for the next train.The second challenge is the one presented by air-conditioning. Most modern offices have no openable windows and depend on air-conditioning for both maintaining the temperature and air circulation. That is true of malls as well, and Metro stations. The coaches themselves are air-conditioned, simply because many Metros run underground. Experts say that with the right kind of filtration and circulation systems and settings, airborne transmission of the virus can be controlled.Finally, it all comes down to risk, return, and the absence of options (many people taking buses and the Metro during the pandemic aren’t doing so out of choice).PS: In a move with significant political undertones, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday communicated to all states that they should be ready to store, distribute and administer a vaccine to those at the front lines of the fight against Covid-19, and other vulnerable groups. The communication mentioned two vaccine candidates without naming them, although the New York Times said the specifications match those being tested by Pfizer and Moderna. Three vaccines are in Phase 3 (or combined Phase2/3) trials in the US: Moderna’s, Pfizer/BioNTech SE’s, and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-XS1wort6vTWykGTLeqZsEP.html
04-09-2020||India||In Uttar Pradesh, Kafeel Khan becomes hot property for political parties||Political parties in Uttar Pradesh seem keen to rope in Dr Kafeel Khan into their fold, even though the doctor has only shown his bonding with some parties but not given any clear indication about his political leaning yet. On Thursday, a day after his release from Mathura jail on the order of the Allahabad high court, Kafeel thanked Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi for contacting him to find out about his well-being and that of his family members.“During the tough time Priyanka supported me,” he said on Twitter. After release from jail, Kafeel, instead of going to his home town Gorakhpur, went to Congress-ruled Rajasthan – an indication about his bond with the party. Former Congress legislature party leader Pradeep Mathur, who was present at the jail gate when Kafeel was released, said, “On the direction of senior party leaders, I was in regular contact with district administrations of Mathura and Aligarh to complete formalities for the release of Kafeel. I escorted him to the Rajasthan border as well.” When asked about Kafeel joining Congress, Mathur said “Priyanka had raised her voice in his support for the sake of humanity and to oppose the atrocities committed by the Yogi government on innocent people in Uttar Pradesh. It’s for Kafeel to decide if he wishes to work for Congress.” The doctor has already announced that he will visit Bihar, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to organize a health camp in the flood-hit areas, Mathur said. Another Congress leader, who did not want to be named, said Kafeel has potential to become the Muslim face of the party in the crucial 2022 UP assembly election, for which the party is working to regain the lost ground.“He has a large support among his community members in Uttar Pradesh as well as in other states,” he said. Meanwhile, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who has launched a political party -- Azad Samaj Party (ASP) – also welcomed Kafeel’s release. Hitting out at the state government, Chandrashekhar said the high court has vindicated Kafeel’s fight for the weaker sections of society. During a Facebook live programme on Wednesday, Kafeel concluded his speech with ‘Jai Bhim’ and ‘Jai Mulnivasi, indicating his bond with the Bhim Army too that is working to spread its base in UP. Azad has already announced that ASP will contest the 2022 assembly election. A Bhim Army leader said when Kafeel was in jail, Azad not only supported him but also attacked the BJP government for slapping NSA against him, he said. Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, in a tweet welcoming the release of Kafeel, said “all justice-loving people have welcomed the release happily and hope that soon Azam Khan (Samajwadi Party MP), too, would get justice. Injustice and atrocities by those who rule doesn’t last forever.” A BSP leader, who did not wished to be named, said party chief Mayawati has already called for Dalit-Muslim-Backward-Brahmin unity to defeat the BJP in the 2022 assembly election. The party has rallied in support of Kafeel after he was arrested following the oxygen tragedy in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur in which about 70 children had died. “To hide its failure, the state government was committing atrocities on Dr Kafeel,” the BSP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-uttar-pradesh-kafeel-khan-becomes-hot-property-for-political-parties/story-qJFsaIRAocSsekoylI9vWK.html
04-09-2020||India||Andhra bans online gambling, approves new free agriculture power supply policy||The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to ban online gambling by making necessary amendments to the statute in order to prevent spread of unhealthy trends in the society. A decision to this effect was taken at the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in Amaravati on Thursday. Briefing media after the cabinet meeting, state information and public relations minister Perni Venkataramaiah said online gambling would be banned by amending the State Gaming Act, 1974. Organisers of online gambling would get a jail term of one year along with a fine for the first-time offenders, while the jail term would go up to two years with fine for repeat offenders. Those playing online games will be sentenced for six months jail, he said. The cabinet approved the revised policy of supplying agriculture power supply free of cost. Stating that farmers would continue to get power supply to their crops free of cost, he said there would be absolutely no burden on them whatsoever. The government would make direct cash transfer into the accounts of farmers to the extent of power they consumed and they, in turn, could pay the power bills to the power distribution companies. “This gives a sense of feeling that the farmers have been paying for the power consumed and the Discoms will not go into the red. The pilot project will be introduced in Srikakulam and it will cover the entire state from April 2021,” he said. The chief minister also clarified that not a single connection would be removed and all the illegal connections would be regularized. “The cost of smart meters would be borne by Discoms and the state government. In order to meet the demand, plans are afoot for developing 10,000 MW solar power plant and the power reforms will not affect the farmers,” Jagan said. The cabinet also gave in-principle approval for constructing two barrages downstream to Prakasam barrage on Krishna river, each with a holding capacity of 3 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) at a total cost of nearly Rs 2,500 crore. The cabinet approved other irrigation project Babu Jagjivan Ram Uttharandhra Sujala Sravanthi for irrigating eight lakh acres in North Andhra region, with a budget of Rs 1539 crore and Varikapudisila lift irrigation project in Palanadu region of Guntur at Rs 1273 crore. As part of Rayalaseema Drought Mitigation Project, the cabinet approved the works of 14 reservoirs and lift irrigation projects. The cabinet also decided to extended the ban on Maoist Party and its frontal organizations by one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-bans-online-gambling-approves-new-free-agriculture-power-supply-policy/story-0SFZtm4qEidJ0zBPAwkSxH.html
04-09-2020||India||SC to hear on Friday review petition for NEET, JEE postponement||The Supreme Court will hear on Friday a review petition filed by minister from 6 non-BJP ruled states seeking review of the August 17 order of the apex court which had allowed the National Testing Agency (NTA) and central government to hold the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in September despite the prevailing Covid -19 situationThe plea will be heard in chambers at 1.30 pm by a 3-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan. Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari will be the other judges on the bench.JEE, for those aspiring to join top engineering schools which is scheduled from September 1 to 6 has already commenced and the prayer concerning the same has, therefore, become infructuous (pointless).NEET for students seeking admission to medical and dental courses is scheduled to be held on September 13.A 3-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra had, on August 17, rejected a plea by 11 NEET/JEE candidates seeking postponement of the exams until after the Covid-19 crisis has passed.The review petition against the August 17 order was filed by ministers Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh), Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab) and Uday Ravindra Samant (Maharashtra) in their individual capacity. They submitted that the top court’s August 17 order failed to consider the safety and security of students who are slated to appear for NEET and JEE and also did not take into account the logistical difficulties in conducting the examinations. “If the order of August 17, 2020 is not reviewed, then grave and irreparable harm and injury will befall the student community of our country and not only will health, welfare and safety of students appearing for NEET/JEE stand imperiled but also the public health at large would be in severe jeopardy in these Covid -19 pandemic times,” the petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said. A review petition is a legal remedy available after the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment in a case. The grounds for filing a review petition are limited and the petitioners seeking review should show that a new fact or evidence has come to light or that the court committed an obvious or apparent error while delivering its judgment. It is not necessary that a review petition should be filed only by those who were parties to the original case. However, the court is cautious while entertaining review petition filed by non-parties.The review petition as per law should also be heard by the same bench which heard the main case unless any of the judges has retired from office. Justice Bhushan replaced justice Mishra who superannuated on Wednesday.Justice Mishra while hearing the main case on August 17 had said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the NTA to hold the examinations in September.“Life has to move on even in Covid times. Covid may continue but postponement of exams is a loss for the country. Are you (petitioners) ready to waste a whole year,” justice Mishra had said.In response to this remark, the review petitioners submitted that the “advice of ‘Life Must Go On’ may have very sound philosophical underpinnings but cannot be a substitute for valid legal reasoning and logical analysis of the various aspects involved in the conduct of the NEET UG and JEE exams.”“Only two reasons that can be discerned from the (August 17) order for dismissal of the petition — life must go on and students should not lose an academic year. With utmost respect, both the reasons, even if cumulatively taken, do not constitute an authoritative and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the issue,” the review petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-on-friday-review-petition-for-neet-jee-postponement/story-cuf8PhHHvACkfkLH3UoklM.html
04-09-2020||India||Life a struggle, can’t SC rethink decision, ask residents of Delhi slums along railway lines||Sunil Kumar and his family -- wife and two children -- used to live in a south Delhi slum when their home was razed by a bulldozer during a demolition drive in December 2016. Civic authorities gave the family a few hours to pack their belongings and fend for themselves on a winter’s night.Kumar, a 42-year-old construction worker, and his family moved to his elder brother Anil Kumar’s house in a slum along the railway tracks in west Delhi’s Naraina Vihar where they have lived since.The family faces the risk of being displaced again after the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings situated along railway tracks within three months. And, to ensure compliance with its order, the top court also stopped any other court from passing a stay order on their removal. In case an order is passed, it shall have no effect on the eviction proceedings, the Supreme Court said.The top court’s order comes at a time when slum dwellers are already hard pressed in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and loss of income during the subsequent 68-day lockdown.“People everywhere are getting infected. So many have died,” said Anil Kumar, whose family moved to the capital from Bihar’s Darbhanga district around 15 years ago and shifted from one slum to another until they settled in the same Naraina Vihar slum six years ago. “We have hardly got any work for months now because of the lockdown. The family is struggling to survive. There is no money. Can’t the court reconsider its decision,” asked 47-year-old Kumar.HT on Thursday visited other slums – in Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri and Anand Parbat -- that are all located alongside railway tracks and densely populated, with open drains and narrow alleys .Many slum dwellers lost their jobs during the nationwide lockdown that was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease.Some chose to head back to their villages, and others stayed back looking out for daily-wage work, the residents said.The Supreme Court’s decision came after Indian Railways informed the court that despite a special task force having been formed to remove encroachments, political interference was coming in the way of getting jhuggis (slums) alongside train tracks removed. An order for removal of all such encroachments was passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on October 1, 2018.The Court said: “There is predominant presence of jhuggis in Delhi along with 140km route length of railway track in the region of NCT {national capital territory} of Delhi… Out of this, about 70km route length of track is affected by large jhuggi-jhopri clusters existing in close vicinity of the tracks.”These clusters aggregated to about 48,000 dwellings, according to the affidavit filed by the Delhi division of Northern Railways.The Supreme Court also involved the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board to prepare an action plan to enable rehabilitation of people who face eviction.A senior Delhi government official said on condition of anonymity that the Capital has around 750 slum clusters, of which around 52 prominent ones are located close to railway tracks. The precise population of these slums isn’t known because surveys planned to ascertain the number are still pending.“If we are rehabilitated in packed rooms with others, can the government agencies assure that none of the residents would get the coronavirus disease? In the slum, we at least have the safety of our homes. We are poor, but we can at least isolate ourselves to some extent,” said Rajan Jha, resident of a slum cluster along the rail tracks near the Mayapuri industrial area.The fear of infection by the coronavirus of losing their livelihood if they are relocated are among the top concerns of the slum dwellers.“Most residents here work in nearby factories, nearby streets where they set up their shops, neighbourhood localities where they work as domestic help. Work is slowly picking up pace now. Relocation shall leave us jobless and hungry again,” said Kamla Devi, resident of a slum along the railway tracks in Anand Parbat.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 2,737 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of infected individuals to 182,306. Also, 19 new deaths were recorded on Thursday, taking the toll to 4,500, even as 160,114 people have so far recovered from the disease, the government’s health bulletin said.“To evict people from their homes during this pandemic, when they have been asked by the government to stay at home to stay safe, would greatly amplify the risk to their health and lives,” said Shivani Chaudhry, executive director of Housing and Land Rights Network,which works among marginaliszed communities. “The United Nations has also warned that no one should be evicted and deprived of housing during this time, as losing one’s home could mean losing one’s life.” “The government should first conduct a comprehensive and inclusive survey, and then undertake a consultative and participatory exercise to develop a human rights-based rehabilitation plan, which ensures adequate housing with basic services and security of tenure in the vicinity of where people presently live, to protect their livelihoods. Given the public health and economic emergency and the high incidence of Covid-19 cases in India, no eviction or relocation should be carried out,” said Chaudhry.Sunil Kumar Aledia of the Centre for Holistic Development, a think-tank based in Delhi, said the group was seeking legal help to stop the eviction. “The plan is to file a review petition soon. The Covid-19 situation is bad and the slum residents are the poor people who have been the worst hit. At this juncture, they are struggling to live. Life will be no different in another three months. An eviction at this stage is a livelihood concern and also a major health concern,” Aledia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-a-struggle-can-t-sc-rethink-decision-ask-residents-of-delhi-slums-along-railway-lines/story-jwjLXw97m9XmpzlJVCU7LM.html

When HT visited the facility near the Delhi airport earlier this week, preparations were underway for the resumption of these services after around five-and-a-half months of restrictions in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Even though flight services resumed on May 25 in a phased manner — about two months after they came to a halt — it was only on August 27 that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) allowed airlines to serve meals on board.In line with the decision, national carrier Air India will serve in-flight meal services from Monday. “So far, we have been giving only ready-to-eat packed meals, which are placed on passengers’ seats before their boarding. But now, with DGCA allowing the service, we, at our ‘The Ambassador’s Sky Chef’ facility near the Delhi’s airport, have started preparations to resume serving hot meals in the sky,” said an Air India official from the catering facility.Apart from ready-to-eat snacks such as cheese paprika croissants and muffins, beverages such as packed juices, and chocolates and peanuts, flyers will now also get vegetarian biryani and stuffed parathas on board, the official said on condition of anonymity. Ambassador’s Sky Chef is one of the three catering facilities that prepare and deliver food to Air India passengers. “At present, we have cut down our staff strength from around 1,100 people to just 80-100 employees in order to ensure social distancing. This has also affected our productivity. Earlier, at this facility, we used to prepare 40,000 meal boxes every day, which has now come down to 5,000. Of these 40,000 boxes, 15,000 were taken by Air India alone (the facility also caters to some other private airlines). We are using 3,500 meal boxes out the total 5,000 prepared here every day because air traffic is low,” said the official quoted above who works closely with Ambassador’s Sky Chef. Air India said it will also resume serving alcohol on its international flights, and will start with beer for now.Vistara, which also operates on international routes as part of the “air bubble” arrangement with select countries, said it too was planning to serve pre-packed meals and beverages for domestic flights beginning next week.“While we are already serving pre-packed meals on international flights; we plan to serve hot meals and limited beverages from next week. The menus for meals and beverages are in the process of being finalised. Enhanced service will be introduced progressively from next week,” a Vistara spokesperson said.SpiceJet said pre-booking of sandwiches and cold beverages will open soon. “...We will also offer a ‘goodie bag’ for pre-booking, which would contain packed ready-to-eat food items along with beverages such as tetra pack juices, coconut water, buttermilk and aerated drinks,” a spokesperson said. “Customers who do not wish to consume hot meals or sandwiches can opt for this ‘goodie bag’. All food and beverages on our flights will be prepared, packed and handled with extreme caution.”Dr T Jacob John, a retired professor of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the Sars-CoV-2 virus, said: “Food borne infection is unlikely as it is a respiratory infection, more like influenza. Food is not the worry, but people will have to remove their face masks while eating and there is more chance of them inhaling the virus if there’s any infected person on-board. Therefore, an airline must stagger the food service so that everyone isn’t eating at the same time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-get-ready-for-in-flight-meal-services/story-HedJPuy4iu44j8VvaQk6jN.html
04-09-2020||India||FM Nirmala Sitharaman, SC give breather to borrowers||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Supreme Court separately offered a much-needed breather to bank borrowers on Thursday, stepping in to prevent loans under stress from impairing their creditworthiness, two days after the lapse of a moratorium on loan repayments necessitated by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The top court passed an interim order that loan accounts that hadn’t been declared non-performing as of August 31 shall not be classified as such until further notice. And at a review meeting to assess banks’ preparedness to implement a loan resolution framework in the aftermath of Covid-19, Sitharaman urged the lenders to support both corporate and individual borrowers who may be under stress, the finance ministry said in a statement.Sitharaman asked banks to roll out loan resolution plans by September, the ministry added. “During her interaction, the finance minister focused on lenders immediately putting in place board-approved policy for resolution, identifying eligible borrowers and reaching out to them.”“The lenders assured {Sitharaman} that they are ready with their resolution policies, have started the process of identifying and reaching out to eligible borrowers, and that they will comply with the timelines stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India,” the ministry said.This meeting via video conferencing took place ahead of recommendations by a panel headed by former ICICI Bank chief KV Kamath on the eligibility parameters for restructuring of loans hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In August, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said a resolution framework for all Covid-19 related stressed accounts will be finalised by September 6.Restructuring some loans will support economic recovery and help borrowers tide over the crisis. India’s economic growth contracted by a record 23.9% in the three months ended June as companies put investments on hold and households pared spending during the 68-day complete lockdown that was in place starting on March 25. Business activity is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Thursday’s intervention by the Supreme Court and the finance minister should assure companies, many of which had to stop production and shut their businesses, and individuals, many of whom suffered job losses or had their pay cut, that their accounts will not immediately be classified as bad loans after the August 31 lapse of the six-month moratorium on loan repayments. More importantly, analysts pointed out, they can borrow more. US investment bank Jefferies estimates that borrowers accounting for 31% of outstanding loans took up the offer of a moratorium, and this eased to about 18% by the end of June as businesses gradually reopened and some realised that postponing repayments could end up being costlier. Indian banks entered the pandemic laden with bad loans estimated at $140 billion.The apex court’s ruling came after it heard a batch of petitions seeking an interest waiver on the loan moratorium granted by RBI. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the central bank allowed the lenders to grant a loan moratorium for three months of equated monthly Instalments, falling due between March 1 and May 31. RBI subsequently extended this for three more month until August 31.The interim order was passed by a bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan and comprising justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah..Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench: “The idea of the moratorium was to defer repayment to ease the burden caused by Covid-19 and lockdown so that business can manage working capital. The idea was not to waive interest. The effort is that those who are affected by Covid and facing distress get the benefit and those who are defaulters are not able to take the benefit.”“Question is about the demands of compound interest in the meantime. Moratorium and penal interest cannot go together. RBI will have to clarify,” said justice Reddy.(Mint and Agencies contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-sc-give-breather-to-borrowers/story-qP8mWQm36sLJQoNcyhYWhL.html
04-09-2020||India||Bars to open in Delhi on a trial basis from Sept 9||Restaurants, bars, clubs and hotels in Delhi will be allowed to serve liquor on a trial basis between September 9 and 30 as lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday cleared the city administration’s proposal to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages to dine-in customers. The order came with stringent safety protocols and restrictions on the intake of customers that will have to be followed in all restaurants, pubs, clubs, bars and hotels. None of these will, however, be allowed to open in containment zones. Delhi has 922 containment zones, as of Thursday.The announcement was made on a day when Delhi reported 2,737 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 67 days, but could be attributed to increased testing in the Capital, where a record 32,834 tests were carried out on Wednesday.“The LG (lieutenant governor) has approved the proposal, but all such facilities will have to follow very stringent SOPs failing which strict action will be taken under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 by the district and excise officials against the owner and manager of the said facility. Besides, it will also lead to sealing of the premises forthwith and cancellation of the excise license,” the LG’s office said.The standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday mandated bars in restaurants, hotels and clubs to allow customers only up to 50% of seating capacity to ensure adherence to social distancing norms. It stated that no standing customer shall be served and only asymptomatic guests and staff will be allowed. For entry, wearing masks, thermal screening and hand sanitisation will be mandatory.Baijal’s approval came five days after the central government on Saturday allowed bars to resume operations across the country, even as it gave states the discretion to decide whether they wanted to permit them or not based on the prevailing Covid-19 situation. In the Unlock 4 national guidelines, the Centre had kept bars out of the list of places and activities that remained prohibited, thereby allowing them to resume operations.On August 20, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia directed excise officials to furnish “necessary permission” so that liquor could be served at restaurants as part of dine-in services and in hotel rooms. He said the decision was taken keeping “revenue implications” in mind.But, the excise department had then responded to Sisodia, saying the proposal would need the approval of the DDMA, headed by the LG. Restaurant owners and associations welcomed the move and said most facilities would choose not to open the dance floors in pubs and bars for the time being to ensure physical distancing and prevent violations of any rule laid down by the DDMA. Anurag Katriar, president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said the decision was significant because under the Unlock 3 guidelines, bars were specifically not allowed to resume operations. “This is a fantastic move and perhaps the first concrete step towards giving the sector some life in Delhi. Finally, we have good news after almost six months. Now, we need to work on building consumer confidence to trigger consumption with all safety norms in place. Not just the owners and the lakhs of employees engaged in this sector, but this news will also please the people of Delhi,” he said. When asked about the stringent norms put in place by the DDMA, Katriar said, “The norms are fine and can be complied with. Even as dine-in facilities were allowed to resume, there were several bars and pubs in Delhi that were shut all this while only because bars were not allowed.” Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), said it will help in the liquidation of inventory with bars, hotels and restaurants, which were locked up for all these months.“Though this sector accounts for less than 10% of liquor sales, its rejuvenation is a major psychological milestone on the road back to normalcy in Delhi. In our estimates, 15,000 cases of liquor are locked up in inventory with bars and restaurants, and liquidation of that will be a great relief to the hospitality sector. It will also help in dealing with the livelihood crisis which the workers were facing due to closure of this particular business,” Giri said.The SOP mandates that bars and restaurants conduct frequent sanitisation of the premises. The staff will have to wear masks and gloves and the facility will have to ensure proper disposal of these items. While only asymptomatic staff will be allowed to report to work, it will be mandatory for all such facilities to put up posters and other audio-visual information on preventive measures for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bars-to-open-in-delhi-on-a-trial-basis-from-sept-9/story-NfCcLsHrxT9GltD8hkWglJ.html
04-09-2020||India||India ready to handle 2-front threat: Bipin Rawat||Chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat said on Thursday that Pakistan could try to take advantage of any threat developing along India’s northern borders but warned that the neighbour’s army would suffer heavy losses if it attempted any misadventure amid rising tensions between India and China in the Ladakh sector. The latest flashpoint in the north was triggered by provocative Chinese actions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, after which India made counter-manoeuvres to occupy key heights. Speaking at a seminar organised by the United States-India Strategic Partnership Forum on Navigating New Challenges, Rawat highlighted the threat of “coordinated action” by the militaries of China and Pakistan along the northern and western borders, and stressed that the Indian armed forces were capable of handling the joint threat. The CDS said India’s military strategy to deal with a twin challenge would be based on identifying a primary and a secondary front for conducting operations. His comments came on a day the army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane reached Leh for a two-day security review of the Ladakh sector, where India and China armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. The Indian Army has rejigged its deployments at multiple points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, including the northern bank of Pangong Lake, to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from making aggressive manoeuvres to unilaterally alter the status quo in contested areas. Tensions flared in the sensitive sector after the Indian Army occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake five days ago to stop the PLA from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move. Brigade commander-ranked officers from the two sides met for the fourth time in Chushul on Thursday to de-escalate tensions but the talks were inconclusive with neither army prepared to make concessions On Wednesday, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria visited front-line bases under the Shillong-based Eastern Air Command to review the air force’s operational readiness in the eastern sector. India has strengthened its military posture across the length of the LAC --- from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh to deal with any provocation by the Chinese military. India is also keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict. Experts said collusive action by China and Pakistan was a possibility. “While hostility with Pakistan is out in the open, we are now witnessing military coercion by China in the Ladakh sector. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that they could collude militarily. They already have strategic collusion,” said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), former Northern Army commander. Reports prepared by the parliamentary standing committee on defence over the last decade have delved into the threat China and Pakistan could pose together. Pakistan was likely to step up hostilities if China were to launch offensive operations against India, a senior military officer told the committee in 2014. He, however, stressed that China might not pose a collusive threat if hostilities were to break out between India and Pakistan. In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India’s sovereignty was supreme and if anyone threatened it — from the Line of Control (LoC) to the LAC — the armed forces would respond to them “in the same language”. Rawat said India has border management protocols with China to promote peace and tranquility along the border but of late there have been aggressive actions by China that the Indian military is fully capable of handling. He said India was keeping track of infrastructure development by China in the Tibet Autonomous Region and its implications were being considered while devising military strategy. The CDS referred to the Quad as a good arrangement to ensure complete freedom of navigation on the high seas and overflight, and unimpeded commerce. China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year. Rawat said India and the US could soon finalise the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for sharing geospatial intelligence. He said India was seeking collaboration with the US to acquire high-end technologies in areas such as aerospace, space and artificial intelligence. He added there was tremendous scope for investments in India with the foreign direct investment limit raised to 74%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ready-to-handle-2-front-threat-rawat/story-5BqDAVRrHeVX679ok4LviO.html
04-09-2020||India||PM Modi pitches India as hub for global supply, value chains in post-Covid-19 world||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday highlighted India’s location, reliability and policy stability while pitching the country as a hub for global supply and value chains in the post-Covid-19 world. “This pandemic has also shown the world that the decision on developing global supply chains should be based not only on costs. They should also be based on trust,” he said in his keynote address at the annual leadership summit organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum. Modi also highlighted his government’s belief in delivering results so that ease of living is as important as the ease of doing business. “You are looking at a country with political stability and policy continuity. You are looking at a country with commitment to democracy and diversity,” he said. Though China found no mention in his speech, it was apparent the Prime Minister was highlighting India as an alternative destination for trade and investment at a time when the world community is focused on developing new supply and value chains to replace those disrupted by the pandemic. “Along with affordability of geography, companies are now also looking for reliability and policy stability. India is the location which has all of these qualities,” he said. The “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiative is aimed at transforming India from a “passive market to an active manufacturing hub at the heart of global value chains”, he noted. India received more than $20 billion in foreign investments during the year and Google, Amazon and Mubadala Investments had announced long-term plans for the country, he noted. The pandemic hasn’t dented the aspirations of India’s 1.3-billion population and reforms have made business easier and reduced red tape, while work was underway on the world’s largest housing programme and on boosting connectivity, he added. The country, he said, also offers a transparent and predictable tax regime while the insolvency and bankruptcy code has reduced risk for the entire financial system. “Our comprehensive labour reforms will reduce compliance burden for employers. It will also provide social security protection to the workers,” he added. “The continued regulatory reforms in bond markets ensure improved ease of access for investors. There are tax exemptions to sovereign wealth funds and pension funds for infrastructure investment. FDI into India rose by 20% in 2019, this when global FDI inflows fell by 1%,” he said. Modi also highlighted the government’s efforts to contain Covid-19, saying India was among the first in creating a “responsive system of lockdowns” and to advocate the use of masks. Starting from one testing lab in January, it now has around 1,600 labs, and the country has one of the lowest death rates per million while the recovery rate is steadily rising. Businesses have responded pro-actively, making India the second largest manufacturer of PPE kits in the world, he said. “This is in line with India’s spirit of challenging the challenge to emerge stronger. In the last few months, the nation has battled Covid, and other crises such as floods, [two] cyclones [and a] locust attack. But it has only made the people’s resolve stronger,” he said. The government has also protected the poor, and the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana” is among the world’s largest support systems while free food grains have been provided to 800 million people, and free cooking gas to around 80 million families. Cash support has been given to around 345 million farmers and employment to migrant workers by creating almost 200 million person-days of work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pitches-india-as-hub-for-global-supply-value-chains-in-post-covid-19-world/story-2hyIxNxZ7HJIdQzCYowaFI.html

04-09-2020||India||Plea in Supreme Court over Special Marriage Act provisions||The provisions under Special Marriage Act (SMA) requiring parties to an intended marriage to publish their private details for public scrutiny 30 days prior to the intended marriage violates the right to privacy of the parties, a petition filed before the Supreme Court said.The petition filed on August 31 by one Nandini Praveen, a law student from Kerala stated that the requirement was also in violation of right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution since no other laws prescribe such a requirement.“Publication of personal details often might have a chilling effect on the right to marry. In other words, couples are asked to waive the right to privacy to exercise the right to marry. This infringes the rights of autonomy, dignity and the right to marry, of various couples,” the petition settled by advocate Kaleeswaram Raj said. The right to privacy is held to be an aspect of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, the plea pointed out.The SMA is a law which allows solemnization of marriages without going through any religious customs or rituals. People from different castes or religions or states get married under SMA in which marriage is solemnized by way of registration.The SMA prescribes an elaborate procedure to get the marriage registered. First, one of the parties to the marriage has to give a notice of the intended marriage to the marriage officer of the district where at least one of the parties to the marriage has resided for at least 30 days immediately prior to the date on which such notice is given.Such notice is then entered in the marriage notice book and the marriage officer publishes a notice of marriage at some conspicuous place in his office. The notice of marriage published by the marriage officer includes details of the parties like names, date of birth, age, occupation, parents’ names and details, address, pin code, identity information, phone number etc. This is a peculiar requirement of the SMA.Anybody can then raise objections to the marriage on various grounds provided under the Act. If no objection is raised within the 30 day period, then marriage can be solemnized. If objections are raised, then the marriage officer has to inquire into the objections after which he will decide whether or not to solemnize the marriage.“Clauses (2) and (3) of Section 6 to the extent to which those direct to cause affixation of notice in some conspicuous place in the office of Marriage Officer are violative of the right to privacy of the parties to the marriage,” Praveen submitted.The petition highlighted the troubles faced by couples due to the requirement of making their personal details public.“Reports of honour killings and violence against inter-caste and inter-religious couples are predominant. One of the ways to access details of the couples marrying under the SMA is through the public notice under Sections 6(2) and 6(3) of the SMA,” the plea said.Besides, no other law except the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 has a requirement to make personal details public, the petitioner submitted.“The prime purpose of the Act was to address Inter-religious marriages and to establish marriage as a secular institution bereft of all religious formalities, which required registration alone. But this same law discriminates against inter-faith couples through Sections6(2) and 6(3) by requiring publication of notice of intended marriage. No other personal law, except the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 has a requirement like the above,” it was contended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-over-special-marriage-act-provisions/story-9zOfRimcSPkiHyRGHYRu0L.html
04-09-2020||India||Netflix India’s Bad Boy Billionaires series triggers controversy||Even as Sahara India Parivar chief Subrata Roy and Satyam Computers founder Byrraju Ramalinga Raju have managed to get an injunction on the release of Netflix’s latest documentary series, Bad Boy Billionaires, former liquor baron Vijay Mallya and diamond merchant Nirav Modi , two others who feature in the four-part series, will not be able to challenge the broadcast of series, according to the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, 2018. Section 14 of the FEO Act says that any person or company, who has been declared fugitive economic offender, may be disallowed from putting forward or defending any civil claim by any court or tribunal in India. Both Mallya and Modi were declared Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEOs) in January and December 2019 respectively for fraud and money laundering. While a local court in Bihar’s Araria last week gave relief to Subrata Roy by ordering Netflix not to use his name in the series, a Hyderabad civil court on Tuesday restrained Netflix from releasing it on a plea filed by Raju. The Supreme Court has refused to give any relief to the company when it was approached concerning the Araria court’s order. Even though Netflix series doesn’t have a special episode on fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi, accused in the Punjab National Bank fraud case, he approached the Delhi High Court last week seeking a preview of the series for himself before it is released arguing that it could prejudice the trial against him. The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeiTY) opposed Choksi’s plea saying it does not regulate the content on over-the-top platforms unless that interferes with national security. Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “Article 21 is available even to non citizens and if legal proceedings are pending then media cannot give their own versions and can only report facts. Netflix is calling its documentary to be investigative so this parallel investigation and conclusion is bound to breach right to fair trial under Article 21 of Constitution of India.” “My client (Mehul Choksi) has a presumption of innocence in his favour,” Aggarwal added. The high court junked Choksi’s plea but allowed him to go to a civil court. Sherbir Panag, a legal expert on white collar crimes said: “The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, provides that on declaration as a fugitive economic offender, any civil claim put forward or defended by such person may be disallowed by the concerned court. While this doesn’t take away the right to file a civil claim, it does leave ample discretion with the court on whether or not to allow such claim being put forward. This position is contentious from a procedural fairness perspective, but shall hopefully be balanced by conscientious judicial interpretation.” Zulfiquar Memon, international extradition expert, said: “On account of Modi and Mallya being declared as FEO, they may have limited rights to approach the Courts, but their purpose seems to have been solved by the fact that the airing of the docu-series on Netflix has currently been stayed by different Courts. According to me, this matter is likely to go to the Supreme Court and until such time, the stay may remain in force”. This is the second time within a month when Netflix is embroiled in a legal tussle after a movie on the life of Indian Air Force (IAF) female pilot Gunjan Saxena, which the Centre has challenged saying it shows Indian armed forces in bad light. Netflix is tightlipped about the developments even as it plans to move the Bihar high court against the Araria court order and the appropriate court against the Hyderabad court order. The docu-series was supposed to be released on Wednesday. Company representatives declined comment on the matter. Senior Advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, who represents Netflix, said: “We have not tried to defame anyone. It’s an investigative docu-series based on interviews as well as the facts which are available in public domain.” Experts say government has powers to regulate OTT content: Irrespective of particular show or OTT platform, experts feel that the government should take a proactive approach in regulating the content over the digital platforms. Pavan Duggal, top cyber expert said : “OTT is a unique platform which has not been effectively regulated globally as well as India. However, as OTTs are available on communication devices and mobiles, they are already covered under the Indian cyberlaw. OTTs are intermediaries under section 2 (1) (w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Under section 79 (2) (c) of the act, these OTT players are mandated to exercise due diligence while they discharge their obligations as intermediaries. Some generic provisions of due diligence have been given under the IT Rules 2011 but these are not specifically designed for OTT platforms.” “The government of India has not yet come up with specific rules, guidelines, and parameters concerning OTTs but it doesn’t mean it cannot regulate such platforms. Under Section 87 of the IT Act, government has the powers to come up with rules and regulations for OTT players.” Duggal added that “India needs to revise its legal position and come up with a framework to govern OTTs because these platforms cannot exist in a legal and policy vacuum. If they are allowed to so exist, it will start prejudicially impacting the cyber sovereignty of India as well Indian security and integrity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netflix-series-triggers-controversy/story-Mr47djEvqy3u1rYFKnnWQJ.html
04-09-2020||India||Study shows Covid-19 can spread in public vehicles||One Covid-19 infected person passed on the disease to 23 of 67 passengers on a bus, a new study published this week determined, showing the virus can spread readily in a closed, small setting like public transport. The findings are significant for India as it enters the fourth phase of the Unlock plan, with more public transport – including buses and metro trains – being allowed to run soon. According to the report in JAMA Internal Medicine, a journal of the American Medical Association, the spread happened in one of two buses that carried a group of 128 people who visited a worship event in eastern China. “Those who rode a bus with air recirculation and with a patient with Covid-19 had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those who rode a different bus,” said the authors, who studied the spread that took place on January 19 in Zhejiang province. The super-spreader, whose gender was not specified, had no symptoms such as a fever or cough at the time of travel, said the study, and this was a period before wearing of masks was made mandatory in China. Passenger mapping that the sickest people were in the front and back of the bus, outside the perimeter of 1-2 metres (three-six feet) that infectious droplets are believed to travel. “The investigations suggest that, in closed environments with air recirculation, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible pathogen,” said the study.A similar investigation of a outbreak cluster in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Sars-CoV-2 was found to have spread between diners’ tables more than one metre apart at a restaurant in, where three families dined on January 24. One person who had come from Wuhan developed a cough later that day and tested positive, and by February 5, nine other diners tested positive. The study was published in US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases in April, found that the airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission. An earlier experimental study published in NEJM in April had demonstrated that the virus remains viable in aerosols for 3 hours or longer, but epidemiological evidence from actual community transmission among people was missing. In early April, a high-level US scientific panel was the first to flag that the Sars-CoV-2 is airborne and could stay suspended in air in the ultrafine mist produced from normal breathing.Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of infection – studies show people are the most infectious one to two days before developing symptoms – further raise the risk of people infecting others in crowded public transport, such as buses and metros.For mobility to resume, safe behaviour is non-negotiable, experts say. “For buses, we must have thermal screening, spaced seating; masks (compulsory); supervised boarding (from back) and deboarding (from front); and open windows. For metros, thermal screening; orderly boarding and deboarding procedures ; and spaced seating, where possible,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. That apart, he suggests encouraging work from home, wherever possible. “We should try to encourage employers to stagger office hours to reduce crowd density of peak hours,” said Dr Reddy. The other option is using the government’s contact-tracking app Aarogya Setu, which is being used by 154.5 million users, to track risk and allow only safe passengers to board. “Many offices have done this, but it has to be done at a public-service scale. The app should be made stronger with personalised, useful and direct messaging to people, including tracking symptoms and communicating back to people, providing advice on how to protect themselves, and which routes to take and which areas to avoid. A more functional app will motivate people to use it, so people get into the habit of checking their Aarogya Setu before stepping out to minimize risk,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics an Integrative Biology, New Delhi.But simple masks are the best strategy, followed by safe behaviour. “Mandatory masks, and not riding if you have a cough, cold, fever or were in contact with a positive person are obvious precautions. Older adults, people with cancer, chronic diseases or compromised immunity must avoid crowded buses and metros even with protection. People take out masks when they are speaking, eating, or having a conversation, which is the worst thing that can happen,” said Dr Shiv K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi.The challenge is asymptomatic spread and the fact that everyone doesn’t have a smart phone. “For that, you can have SMS, and those who have no phone should go through a queue to have their temperature and symptoms checked. It’s unlikely we will face a problem for which a solution is unimaginable,” said Dr Agrawal.“With public transport opening, people must take precautions and protect themselves. We need a bottom up approach, we need social change,” said Dr Sarin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-shows-covid-can-spread-in-public-vehicles/story-Kt5NW9dR5B4ydFsHFyBb7J.html
04-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Antibodies may not stop transmission in children||Some children may have the potential to transmit the coronavirus disease, or Covid-19, even if they have measurable antibodies in their system, said a new study that indicated immune response, by itself, may be inadequate to protect children from the pandemic. The study, conducted by doctors at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington DC and published in The Journal of Paediatrics on Thursday, analysed 6,369 children tested for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and 215 children who underwent antibody testing between March 13 and June 21. Out of this, 33 showed the presence of both virus and antibodies at the same time. “With most viruses, when you start to detect antibodies, you won’t detect the virus anymore. But with Covid-19, we’re seeing both,” said Burak Bahar, lead author of the study. “This means children still have the potential to transmit the virus even if antibodies are detected.”She cautioned that the mode of transmission of a virus, which exists in the presence of antibodies, remained unknown. A clutch of recent studies have indicated that antibodies may last in a patient’s system for between three and six months, although no conclusive evidence has emerged. The researchers underlined that a lot was still unknown about the disease – especially at a time when many countries have pushed to open primary schools and kindergartens despite health experts cautioning that children were particularly susceptive to contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and others. “Wearing face coverings, social distancing and personal hygiene are effective ways to decrease spread of this disease; however, these practices might be challenging in schools and similar environments that care for children. Antibody response, at its own, is not recommended to clear children from precautions,” Bahar told HT. Data of Covid-19 fatalities in India published in HT earlier this week showed that children were the least vulnerable group. But a number of other studies – notably, one last week in JAMA Paediatrics – have concluded that children can shed the virus even if they are asymptomatic or for long after their symptoms have cleared.Researchers from the Children’s National Hospital found patients between 6 and 15 took longer to clear the virus (median time of 32 days) compared to patients between 16 and 22 (median time of 18 days). In the study, women in the 6-15 group took longer to clear the virus (44 days) than males (25.5 days for males). “The takeaway here is that we can’t let our guard down just because a child has antibodies or is no longer showing symptoms,” said Bahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibodies-may-not-stop-transmission-in-children/story-EiZ1xRq3qbqpH6jR1XuF3J.html
04-09-2020||India||CM launches probe into MP rice distribution case||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that the economic offence wing (EOW) of Madhya Pradesh police will conduct an inquiry into distribution of sub-standard rice to beneficiaries through the Public Distribution System(PDS) in two districts of the state.Chouhan in a tweet on Thursday said, “The guilty who supplied bad quality rice to public distribution shops will not be spared. I have decided to conduct an EOW inquiry into it, so that truth could come to light. Stringent action will be taken against the guilty to check possibility of recurrence of such incidents.” The Congress, however, dubbed the CM’s announcement as an eyewash. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “Had the Congress not raised the issue with a concrete evidence and there had not been a central government’s report on the quality of rice, the BJP government would not have taken any action. The central government’s report was lying with the state government for over a week. Will the CM conduct an inquiry as to why action was not taken against millers and government employees responsible for distribution of such rice of poor quality through PDS shops, so far?”The sub-standard rice was being distributed by millers in collusion with officials in tribal dominated Balaghat and Mandla districts.In Balaghat district, the administration in the past 24 hours sealed 18 rice mills and disconnected power supply to these mills. Five more employees of food and civil supplies department in the district were also suspended on Thursday. The administration is in process of filing more FIRs against rice mill owners, said Balaghat collector Deepak Arya. In Mandla district, 14 rice mills and a warehouse were sealed to facilitate the inquiry, said district collector Harshika Singh. On Wednesday night, the state government had terminated services of two quality controllers of Food and Civil Supplies department in Balaghat district and filed FIRs against eight millers in the two districts on the basis of an analysis conducted by a Central government lab on 32 samples of food grains, officials said. The lab report was submitted on August 21,2020 by ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Govt of India to MP’s principal secretary food, civil supplies and consumer protection, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai. “The samples were analysed in the NABL accredited Central Grain Analysis Laboratory (CGAL), Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi….The stocks are found to be unfit for human consumption and in the categories of Feed-I which is meant to be suitable for livestock feed (such as goat, horse, sheep), Feed-II which is suitable for cattle feed and Feed-III which is suitable for poultry feed as per the guidelines for the issuance/disposal of the stocks,” Kidwai said.

04-09-2020||India||Monsoon pattern may see rapid shift||The pattern of monsoon rainfall in India may see a major shift by the end of this century with southern India likely to register the most increase in extreme rainfall , researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, in West Bengal, have found. The researchers also expect rainfall to increase in the Arabian Sea and south-Asian countries, including Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia. “In the worst-case scenario of climate change, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India with the Himalayan foothills expected to receive the heaviest rain. In south India, rainfall could increase by 18.5 mm per day with the Western Ghats expected to be affected the most,” said Rajib Maity, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study.The scenario could play out towards the end of the century, between 2071 and 2100. The researchers analysed data of Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation for close to five decades (1971 – 2017), considering the period between 1930 and 1970 as the base. In meteorological terms, fifty years, the time it will take for the change to manifest itself, isn’t much. And the change itself, could have a significant bearing on cropping patterns in a country where much of the agriculture is still rain-fed. “South Asia, as we know, despite advances in irrigation systems, is highly dependent on the monsoons. Results of this study will be useful to the designers of water infrastructure and agricultural communities, especially in the southern parts of India and Himalayan foothills, to prompt a possible change in design criteria and agricultural practices including cropping pattern,” Virendra Tewari, director of IIT Kharagpur said, in a statement issued by the institute.The results have been published in the Scientific Reports journal brought out by Nature publishing group. “Our analysis shows a change in the direction of the southwest monsoon winds blowing towards the east over the Indian Ocean. This directional change will intensify the already observed precipitation contrast in future between South and North India, and cause more extreme precipitation events in countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia” Maity added. The researchers said that the Indian Ocean Dipole – popularly referred to as the ‘Indian Nino’ because of its similarity to its Pacific equivalent – is intensifying which could lead to increase in rainfall activity throughout India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to the difference in sea-surface temperatures in opposite parts of the Indian Ocean which, in turn, affects rainfall patterns. “The possibility of such a shift can’t be ruled out but such projections need more research and analysis as the association between the Indian Ocean Dipole and monsoon is still not well defined,” said R Krishnan, executive director, Centre for Climate Change Studies at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).To be sure, over the years, a significant correlation has been established between the Indian Ocean Dipole and the monsoon. IITM, in various studies, has documented the change in monsoon rainfall pattern and increase in extreme rainfall events since 1871. It has found that the period between 1981 and 2016 witnessed higher frequency of extreme rain during monsoon months. Studies by then IITM professor, M Rajeevan, now secretary ministry of earth sciences, have shown that monsoon rain has increased in western parts of India, namely Rajasthan and Gujarat and has declined in Central and north-western India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-pattern-may-see-rapid-shift/story-tJxHAoP7jegxIkVsDQIjBM.html
04-09-2020||India||Facebook bans BJP leader over hate speech||Facebook has banned the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Telangana legislator T Raja Singh, who has been at the centre of a political furore over a report in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that the social media company adopted a soft approach towards purported hate speech by the MLA and other functionaries to protect its business interests in India.“We have banned Raja Singh from Facebook for violating our policy prohibiting those that promote or engage in violence and hate from having a presence on our platform. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove his account,” a Facebook spokesperson said on Thursday.According to people aware of the specifics of the ban, Raja Singh has been banned under Facebook’s “dangerous individuals and organizations policy”. The ban means he will not be allowed on Facebook and Instagram and the social medial company will remove any pages, groups or accounts representing him if they come up. WSJ first reported the ban on Thursday morning. An August 14 report by the newspaper claimed that Facebook staff had considered taking down Raja Singh’s profile on the social media network in 2018 because of inflammatory messages posted by the Hyderabad-based legislator, targeting the Muslim community, before Ankhi Das, who leads Facebook’s policy efforts in New Delhi, intervened to block the move on grounds that it could potentially harm its interests in India. The Goshamahal legislator later in the day said that the posts were not made using his account and that he was hoping to return to the website. The claims in the reports prompted the opposition parties to seek an investigation into whether Facebook applies its content moderation rules in a politically partisan manner, a claim the August 14 article and subsequent news reports by the same paper and Time later repeated. All three reports cited comments from past and current Facebook employees who said Facebook India executives shared past links with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s information technology cell, did not comment on the specific case of Facebook’s ban on Raja, but said the determination of what constitutes hate speech should conform with the rules and laws of the land. “What constitutes hate speech in India will be decided by our constitutional framework and extant rules. It must be applied fairly to all irrespective of their political affiliation. Sonia Gandhi, whose divisive speech streamed live on Facebook, which led to wide-scale rioting, death, and destruction in Delhi recently, is equally guilty as is someone else. We can’t have double standards,” Malviya said. The Congress wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg twice complaining of a bias and asking him to specify the steps being taken to investigate the charges against its India unit. Earlier this week, union minister for Information and Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a strongly worded letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alleged that the platform is the “latest tool” being used to create “internal divisions and social disturbances” by vested groups. The BJP has lashed out at its critics and has also insinuated that efforts are being made by some Facebook employees to discredit the democratic processes in the country. “Social media has democratised discourse and that is something they haven’t come to terms with,” Malviya said.Responding to a letter by Congress, a Facebook executive said the company was “‘non-partisan and strove to ensure its platforms remain a space where people express themselves freely.”“We take allegations of bias seriously & denounce hate & bigotry in all forms,” Neil Potts, Facebook’s trust and safety director, said in reply to a letter written by Congress’ general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal’s accusing the social media platform of “interfering in India’s electoral democracy.”.“On the question of hateful content by public figures, we want to assure you that our Community Standards prohibit attacks against people based on their protected characteristics, including religion, caste, ethnicity, and national origin. In line with our hate speech policy, we have removed and will continue to remove hateful content by public figures in India on our platforms,” Potts added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fb-bans-bjp-leader-over-hate-speech/story-VXMcpb82nKUKVTzjenUHPJ.html
04-09-2020||India||Twitter handle linked to PM’s portal hacked||A Twitter account linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal website was purportedly compromised early on Thursday, with a series of tweets sent out by an individual or a group identifying themselves as “John Wick” who later told HT that the hack was meant to clear their name in a separate breach involving a popular e-commerce website.A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the page -- @narendramodi_in – associated with the PM’s website narendramodi.in, was compromised. Shortly after 3am, several posts were made, including some urging people to donate to a cryptocurrency wallet that the hackers said was linked to the “PM National Relief Fund”. “There is no other intention to hack this account. Recently fake news of our name saying PayTM Mall [was] hacked by us. So we have sent email to all news publishers in India [that] it’s not us, no one replied, so we decided to post something,” said a person who responded from the email address that was posted in one of the tweets after the hack. The tweets have since been taken down. To a query from HT, a spokesperson from Twitter said in an email: “We’re aware of this activity and have taken steps to secure the compromised account. We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted.” Questions to the Prime Minister’s Office about the alleged hacking did not elicit a response till the time of filing this copy. The hackers did not respond to questions on how they carried out the hack and whether it was a compromise of the Twitter account itself, but identifiers seen on screenshots suggested the tweets were made using a tool titled “narendramodi_tweets_apps”. The hacker suggested that this was done by breaking into the website narendramodi.in, and not the Twitter account. “Yes, 100% not secured,” said this person, when asked if they exploited something called an API, which allows people to access and send out tweets without accessing an account through Twitter.com. “They have to increase the security and invest in people like us,” the hacker said.On August 30, US-based cyber security firm Cyble reported that a hacking group identifying itself as John Wick “was able to gain unrestricted access to the entire databases” of PayTM Mall, an online retail venture of the popular payments app PayTM. PayTM later issued a statement saying it was investigating the breach and assured that user data was safe.“We don’t yet know the root cause of this incident so it is difficult to say whether there was a security standards issue involved. The best we can do is to remind people to activate two-factor authentication for their accounts,” said Baptiste Robert, a French cyber security engineer who is better known by his online alias Elliot Alderson and has brought to light several major vulnerabilities in Indian government-run websites and services.A person aware of the preliminary analysis at Twitter, who asked not to be named, said “there was no indication or evidence at this stage of any correlation between this account compromise and the incident that took place in July”. The reference was to the breach of Twitter’s internal systems through which hackers similarly solicited payments in digital currency by making posts from the accounts of US presidential candidate Joe Biden and former US president Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk. The page @narendramodi_in is followed by 2.5 million users and is a platform for disseminating news about the PM’s activities, his statements and addresses. It was not immediately clear if any money was sent into the cryptocurrency account posted in the hacked tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-handle-linked-to-pm-s-portal-hacked/story-Duyb3naa3JbiUQcL5hK1YJ.html
04-09-2020||India||Parliament disruptions mar Question Hour: Data||Many opposition parties have turned vocal against the government’s decision to skip Question Hour in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament, but data from the last 11 years shows that Question Hour has often been a victim of many opposition-sponsored disruptions. An analysis of Parliamentary data since 2009 —when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh entered his second term—by PRS Legislative Research underlines that Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha could not utilize 90% of the time alloted to oral questions and answers in any session barring one each in 2016 and 2019. Between 2015 and 2019, the Lok Sabha could use just 61% of its total allotted time for Question Hour. The Rajya Sabha faced a stiffer challenge as the ruling dispensation didn’t enjoy majority there for a long time, allowing rivals to influence the proceedings and leading to more disruptions -- in 2015-19, only about 40% of the total time was available for taking up questions.The opposition continued to protest against the suspension of Question Hour. Trinamool Congress’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said: “I challenge the PM and his ministers to come and debate with the Opposition on ‘The sanctity of Parliament and other institutions’. Come, debate this subject in the Monsoon Session. We are waiting.”Question Hour, or the first 60 minutes of the daily proceeding to seek replies from different ministers, is a key tool for lawmakers to keep a check on the executive. It is also the only opportunity for MPs to get guaranteed answers. The preparations for this vital part of parliament session require long, tedious hours of preparations. The two Houses of Parliament have decided that only written answers will be supplied to MPs in the upcoming monsoon session, but no oral questions will be allowed.The original decision was driven by a desire to reduce the presence of civil servants in Parliament to assist ministers amid restrictions put in place because of the Covid-19 pidemic. The move to allow written questions was a response to the opposition’s reaction. In the winter session of 2013, the Bharatiya Jabata Party-led opposition, adamant in its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to look into the coal block allocation case, halted a large part of the Question Hour. The Lok Sabha could utilize just 2% of its time allotted for Question Hour and the Rajya Sabha failed to take up a single question in the shortest session that ran for just 10 days. Similarly, in the winter of 2016 when an aggressive Congress was vocal about the demonetization of old, high-value currency notes, the Lok Sabha could use 29% of the time for Question Hour and the Rajya Sabha, again, failed to take up a single Question. In the Budget session of 2018, when the Congress-led opposition was again up in arms over the Rafale deal and launched major protests, Question Hour saw disruptions and could function for just 11% and 3% of its allotted time in the Lower and the Upper Houses. A Rajya Sabha record of the last six sessions also shows that in every session, Congress-led opposition parties regularly demanded suspension of Question Hour. Out of the 23 days in the last session, the Opposition gave notice on 15 days to suspend Question Hour to take up other issues. In 2018, the Congress and other Opposition parties wanted suspension of Question Hour for 15 days in one session and for 16 days in another session. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who is now a part of the panel to decide the party’s Rajya Sabha strategy, argued that “demand for suspension of Question Hour was because there was an issue of overriding importance. But it was not suspended. It is a legitimate parliamentary tactic as Arun Jaitley once said...But that is no excuse for the government to cancel the entire Question Hour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parl-disruptions-mar-question-hour-data/story-U8YIPyIRGEh7qCxnpFcUDJ.html
04-09-2020||India||Indian Army changes border posture||The Indian Army has changed its posture from border management to securing the border on the 1,597 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh after aggression by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in the Chushul sector, followed by additional induction of troops and support elements, people familiar with the matter said.The PLA Air Force has also stepped up its activity in the occupied Aksai Chin area, with positions being militarily strengthened.“The Indian Army is now in a secure border mode to pre-empt any Chinese PLA transgressions in vulnerable areas of Ladakh. The repositioning of Indian forces has been done to take the Chinese aggression into account in the area and to ensure that all positions are defended,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The Indian Army has also matched the PLA’s troop reinforcement in the sector by deploying additional specialised forces such as the Special Frontier Force (SFF) that was raised to counter China after the 1962 war. SFF soldiers had played a lead role in pre-empting the PLA, which tried to grab Indian territory five days ago on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. Indian soldiers have since then occupied key heights on the southern bank.The Indian Army has deployed a combat group -- a mix of armoured and mechanised elements -- in the Depsang Plains to match a PLA mechanised brigade and another combat group in Chumar to signal to the PLA that it means business and will not allow even an inch of Indian land to be taken.India dominates the Demchok and Chumar areas, giving soldiers a clear line of sight to the Lhasa-Kashgar (219) highway, a critical artery for PLA logistics supply. The Indian posture in Chushul clearly indicates that any further PLA perfidy will receive a matching response, a military commander said.While the PLA, under Chinese President and Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, is blaming the Indian Army domestically for aggravating the border situation, Beijing is making no effort to sort out the border row diplomatically or militarily by just restoring status quo ante.“It is a dead-end posturing as this will not yield any results for PLA as neither side can deploy troops all along the 3,488 km LAC round the clock throughout the year,” said a second senior official .Although military and diplomatic talks are on, Indian Army troopers are leaving nothing to chance and are prepared for the worst case scenario, with decisions being taken on the spot, and not by headquarters.Tensions have escalated in the Ladakh sector after a June 15 military skirmish in the Galwan Valley left 20 Indian troops and unspecified number of PLA soldiers dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-changes-border-posture/story-WQmEuVP8fS4MoqKus2kjbN.html
04-09-2020||India||Standoff result of Chinese actions along LAC: India||India on Thursday squarely blamed China for the tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the past four months and said the only way forward was through negotiations – reflecting the impasse created by fresh attempts by Beijing to alter the status quo along the disputed border over the weekend. There was no word from Beijing on the latest situation on the LAC though the Chinese foreign ministry cited Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and yoga’s popularity in the country to criticise New Delhi’s ban on 118 Chinese apps and subtly warned India not to join the US “clean network” programme, an initiative for an internet without security threats. China rejected recent comments from the US side on the tensions and said Beijing and New Delhi have the ability to resolve their border disputes bilaterally.Talks being conducted through diplomatic and military channels to end the standoff that began in May suffered a blow when Chinese troops resorted to what were described as “provocative military movements” on the south bank of Pangong Lake during August 29-30. They were thwarted by counter-measures by the Indian side, which quickly occupied several strategic heights and hilltops, and talks between local brigade commanders since Monday to ease the fresh tensions have been inconclusive. “It is clear that the situation we witnessed over the past four months is a direct result of the actions taken by the Chinese side that sought to effect unilateral change of status quo,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “Now the way ahead is negotiations, both through the diplomatic and military channels. The Indian side is firmly committed to resolving all outstanding issues through peaceful dialogue,” he said. The Chinese side, Srivastava added, should “sincerely engage the Indian side with the objective of expeditiously restoring the peace and tranquillity in the border areas through complete disengagement and de-escalation in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols”. Without going into details, he said the local military commanders are still holding discussions to resolve the situation that had arisen from the attempt by Chinese troops to unilaterally change the status quo on the south bank of Pangong Lake. Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong refuted US deputy secretary of state Stephen Beigun’s recent remarks about China’s “outsized” territorial claims at Galwan Valley in the Ladakh sector and said: “China and India have the ability to resolve their border disputes bilaterally. We don’t accept countries outside the region pointing fingers, let alone meddling or making instigation, which will only endanger the regional peace and stability.” In a statement, Ji said China wants a “fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution through peaceful and friendly consultations”. She added that the two sides were in “talks at various levels to seek peaceful settlement of the boundary issue”. In Beijing, the foreign and commerce ministries criticised India’s ban on 118 Chinese apps and called for the “mistake” to be reversed. Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying even questioned whether India was working with the US on such issues and called for New Delhi to adopt an independent policy. The foreign ministry said that unlike the reason behind India’s decision to ban the apps, the popularity of Tagore’s poetry and the popularity of Yoga among Chinese nationals didn’t mean that Beijing looks at such issues as “infiltration” or a “threat”. India on Wednesday banned 118 mostly Chinese mobile apps, including Tencent Holdings’s popular mobile version of video game PUBG, citing data security and privacy concerns. These apps collected and shared data in a “surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to the security of the state”, the Indian side said. Hua said the latest ban would harm the interests of Indian users and the rights of Chinese businesses. Both countries are ancient civilisations with exchanges going back thousands of years, she said, giving the example of Tagore, many of whose poems are popular in China. She quoted a line from one of Tagore’s poems: “We read the world wrong, and say that it deceives us.” She added, “Also, yoga is becoming more and more popular in China, including myself, I am very fond of Indian culture. But we do not think that Indian culture or the poems or other things are infiltrating here or posing any threat to Chinese culture.”Hua issued a subtle warning about ties between India and the US: “I have noted that the US state department on the same day said India banned more than 100 Chinese apps and called on other countries to join India to roll out the clean network initiative. “So, I don’t know if there is any correlation or interaction between India and the US. But India is an ancient civilisation with wise people. They should know what the US has done in cyber security, for example Dirtbox, Prism, Irritant Horn, Muscular and under-sea cable tapping.” Hua also said China hopes India will “stay committed to its precious independence [in] decision-making”. Commerce ministry spokesperson Gao Feng called on India to work with the Chinese side to maintain hard-won bilateral cooperation to build an open and fair business environment for international investors and service providers, including Chinese companies. External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava defended the ban on apps, saying they had engaged in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and defence of India. “What I can say is that we remain open, we continue to welcome FDI {foreign direct investment} in the country, including in the area of internet technology. However, what we would like to say is companies, when they operate here, they have to operate in accordance with the regulatory framework of the government of India,” he added. India first banned 59 Chinese apps on June 29, days after a clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. Another 47 apps were added to the ban in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/standoff-result-of-chinese-actions-along-lac-india/story-OK5QJEu4whaHjHGANjcUIP.html

The girl had gone missing from her house Monday evening.Vanan said the girl’s stepfather Supriyo Ghosh and his three friends have been detained apart from 10-12 other people.“We have interrogated about 25 people so far. We are confident of solving the case and arrest the accused by late tonight or tomorrow. We are awaiting the post mortem report to conclusively confirm if the victim was raped before murder,” he said.Ghosh, who had married the victim’s mother two years ago, however, has denied his involvement in the gruesome murder stating he had dropped the girl at her house in Kapali basti on Monday evening after taking her to Sonari market, police said.A medical board conducted the post mortem on Thursday following an order of Jamshedpur deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar. Meanwhile, an angry crowd from Kapali basti led by a local Congress leader, Usha Yadav, staged a protest at Sonari police station and blocked the road with the body of the victim, demanding that the accused be handed over to them for ‘public justice.’ The police deployed the quick response team (QRT) in the area to disperse the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamshedpur-cops-detain-man-whose-minor-daughter-s-head-was-crushed-arm-chopped-off/story-QcTDCodf9kyiBiwViYBLZJ.html

The repositioning of Indian forces has been done to take the Chinese aggression into account in the area and to ensure that all positions are defended,” said a senior official.The Indian Army has also matched the PLA’s pumping of troops into the sector by deploying additional specialised forces such as the Special Frontier Force that was raised to counter China after the 1962 war. SFF soldiers had played a lead role in preempting the Chinese PLA, which tried to grab Indian territory five days ago on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. Indian soldiers since then occupy key heights on the southern bank.ALSO WATCH | Explained: India bans PUBG, 117 more Chinese apps amid fresh border tussleThe Indian Army has paid special focus by deploying a combat group (a mix of armoured and mechanised elements) at Depsang Plains to match a PLA mechanised brigade and another combat group at Chumar to signal to PLA that it means business and will not allow an inch of Indian land to be taken.India dominates the Demchok and Chumar area, giving soldiers a clear line of sight to the Lhasa-Kashgar (219) highway, a critical artery for PLA logistics supply. The Indian posture at Chushul clearly indicates that any further PLA perfidy will receive a matching response, a military commander said.While the PLA, under General Secretary Xi Jinping, is blaming the Indian Army domestically for aggravating the border situation, the Chinese are making no effort to sort out the border row diplomatically or militarily by just restoring status quo ante.“It is a dead-end posturing as this will not yield any results for PLA as neither side can deploy troops all along the 3,488 km LAC round the clock throughout the year,” said a senior official.Although the military and diplomatic parleys are on, the Indian Army troopers are leaving nothing to chance and are prepared for the worst case scenario with the decisions taken on the spot not by the headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-border-army-changes-posture-at-lac-after-china-s-failed-midnight-attempt/story-W6DyRGMPa55bZScUO41rDP.html
04-09-2020||Editorials||India sends a clear signal to China||Over the past week, there have been both a series of developments in eastern Ladakh and a series of statements from India’s top decision-makers. In terms of events, India has pre-empted a possible Chinese intrusion and positioned forces at strategically important points. In terms of statements, the Chief of Defence staff, Bipin Rawat said that the military option was on the table — and more recently, has highlighted the threat of “coordinated action” from both China and Pakistan. And external affairs minister S Jaishankar has emphasised the importance of finding a resolution in the domain of diplomacy.Unpacking these events and statements provides a glimpse into how India has decided to approach the Chinese aggression. For one, there is absolute clarity that the Chinese have flouted border agreements, intruded into Indian territory, and the onus rests on them to both disengage and de-escalate and India will resist the incursion. Two, there is a recognition that China‘s behaviour is not just India-specific but in line with its pattern of aggression elsewhere — and this is because Beijing sees an opportunity to change the rules of the game even as the world struggles with the pandemic (that began in China) and the United States (US) remains distracted with domestic elections. The corollary of this is that when the geopolitical situation changes, and international opinion continues to build against it, China may be forced to review its approach. Three, while there is a sense that China will be India’s most critical longer-term challenge, in the immediate context, countering it will require a host of strategies — ensuring effective military mobilisation to send a message of strength; inflicting economic costs to send a signal that the entire relationship is in jeopardy; cementing international partnerships to build pressure; and pursuing bilateral dialogue to find an acceptable solution. The latest developments are in line with this broad approach. India has made tactical military advances — which sends a message of military determination. It has continued banning Chinese apps — and Huawei can well write off its 5G prospects in the Indian market. It has reiterated its commitment to Quad. The defence ministers of the two countries met in Moscow on Friday. And Mr Jaishankar has confirmed that he will meet the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Moscow next week. The ball is now entirely in China‘s court — it needs to decide if it wants to rescue the relationship or ruin it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-sends-a-clear-signal-to-china/story-WHly68afQEUSySiZWn3BQI.html
