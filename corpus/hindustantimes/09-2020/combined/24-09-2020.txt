The police dithered for a considerable time before taking firm action when they should have crushed the violence right away. Soon, the riots spread like wildfire across the smoke-grey skyline of the Capital, engulfing new areas and snuffing out more and more innocent lives. Chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal looked on helpless, sitting on a peace mission at Rajghat, while various politicians traded charges. Much to the relief of the city’s citizens, some semblance of order returned gradually from February 26.Six months after the incident, the probe into the riots has come under public scrutiny. The most contentious case is the overarching one, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, covering the conspiracy for planning, instigating and executing the riot action plan. The arrest of Umar Khalid under UAPA has unleashed a bitter debate over the alleged bias in the police probe. Even former director-general of police Punjab and Gujarat, and police commissioner, Mumbai, Julio Ribeiro and other retired police officers have expressed their reservations on the matter. The police investigation of the riot cases has clearly polarised the public. While a section finds the police biased for targeting the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protesters, the other justifies the police action, clamouring for stringent legal action against the accused in the UAPA charge-sheet. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. While the Delhi Police has done meticulous investigations in many cases, it has failed on some counts too. The probe can thus be covered broadly under three categories.First, it was a mammoth exercise to conduct a probe in the riots which claimed 53 lives and injured 583 others. Two policemen were killed and over 100 injured. A total of 781 cases were registered by the local police, special cell and the crime branch. The police arrested 1,575 people, including 776 Hindus and 799 Muslims, and 250 charge-sheets have been filed till now. Seizures by the police include 12 pistols, 121 empty cartridges, 92 live cartridges, 61 glass bottles full of noxious chemicals and an assortment of sharp-edged weapons. One policeman died from bullet wounds. The cases are being vetted by 11 special prosecutors for presenting in four special courts set up for the purpose. The charge-sheet submitted under UAPA runs into 11 volumes, totalling over 17,000 pages.The hallmark of an investigation in a majority of these cases has been the extensive use of scientific evidence, including the facial recognition system — matching the faces of the accused with the help of a databank of driver’s licences and dossiers maintained by the police — CCTV, electronic data and the Vahan portal. Some probe teams did particularly well, including the one which unearthed the killing of nine Muslims by 11 members of the Hindu Kattar Sangh in Gokulpuri. The painstaking collation of clues and messages of a chat group led to the case being cracked. Second, it is the case instituted under UAPA that has generated a heated debate as it relates to the planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration. While social activists maintain that Umar Khalid and company are mere dissenters and protesters of CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Delhi Police maintain that they have unimpeachable evidence against them regarding well-planned sit-ins and blocking of roads, collection of acid and incendiary devices, funding through the Popular Front of India (PFI) and confrontation with the state law and order machinery. The statements of a few witnesses before the court and electronic data have added heft to the charges. For the case to succeed, the prosecutors have to convince the judge that the acts of the accused extended beyond sit-ins and protest speeches which come under the ambit of democratic dissent, to the instigation of riots and confrontation with the state leading to the killing of two policemen and injuring 108 others. Hence, this issue is in a grey area awaiting a judicial verdict.Third, the high court observed after the riots that all hate speeches delivered around this time should be analysed and FIRs registered accordingly. The lack of real action taken by the Delhi Police against the speeches by Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Pravesh Sharma has got civil society in a ferment. The forces failed to summon the courage to take legal action against the minister, the Member of Parliament (MP) and some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cadres for rabble-rousing. Kapil Mishra was called to the police station only to be let off soon after. The minister and MP were not even called by the same police which had once questioned the Delhi CM in the case of an assault against the chief secretary. A clutch of petitions filed with the High Court on such issues is waiting to be taken up.When history looks back at the worst communal riot since Partition in Delhi, it is the failure to hold to account rabble-rousers from the ruling dispensation which will torment the sentinels of democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-delhi-riots-probe-polarised-society/story-bmBDlQT4cAzIKVs4GOjQdP.html
24-09-2020||News||Was Carl Sagan right about life on Venus? India can help find out more||Harold Morowitz and Carl Sagan speculated in 1967 that the clouds of Venus aka Shukra may harbour life. The recent exciting detection of phosphine from these clouds strengthens the possibility that micro-organisms may indeed be floating around in them. Galileo’s discovery through his telescope of the Moon-like phases of Venus solidified our understanding that Venus and Earth both orbit the Sun. Venus came to be regarded as something of a twin of the Earth, with roughly similar size, mass and solar distance. Radio images and spacecraft that travelled to Venus in the `60s revealed, however, that it was blistering hot on the surface. So much so that even metals could only be molten, and it had a crushingly high-pressure cloudy atmosphere. This was in contrast to Mars, with its Earth-like temperature, pressure and seasonal variations. Why then did Venus hit the global headlines in the context of the eternal human question of “are we alone?” There are many methods to search for extraterrestrial life. One is to listen for orderly, seemingly deliberate radio signals that could possibly be from sentient and technologically-able life-forms in our Milky Way or beyond. A second method is to search for planets that could harbour life as we know it. Over 4,000 `exo-planets’ have been discovered around other stars several of which are in the ‘Goldilocks zone.’ That is, at a distance from their host star that is not too close/hot nor too far/cold but just right to allow water to exist in liquid form and, therefore, harbour life of a familiar kind. Then there is in situ investigation, i.e., spacecraft landing on the planets (such as Curiosity-Rover to Mars). Robotic instruments on these crewless landers sample the planet’s atmosphere and surface material for evidence of life-nurturers like water, for “biosignatures” or chemical compounds that can‘t be generated by astrophysical or geo-chemical processes and, therefore, must be generated by life-forms, and, of course, for life-forms themselves. A fourth method, that ties in with the second, is to search for molecules of volatile “biosignatures” that float around in the planetary atmospheres, using telescopes. When these molecules are back-lit, even by the feeble light from the heated planetary surface, they absorb some of this light at specific wavelengths that are dependent on their make-up, amounting to a fingerprint stamped on the light. Phosphine is a molecule with a phosphorous atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms, a well-known toxic fumigant. It is very hard to make by natural processes, except under exceptionally high pressures and temperatures, in, for example, the core of Jupiter. However, living micro-organisms in oxygen-less environments on earth are also known to generate phosphine, and it is, therefore, a clear, though relatively neglected biosignature. One of phosphine’s molecular fingerprints on light occurs at a wavelength of 1.123mm and is in the range of current cutting-edge telescopes. So astrobiologist Jane Greaves and her team pointed the JCM Telescope in Hawaii at Venus in 2017, motivated by the speculation that its clouds could harbour life, and, sure enough, they found the fingerprint! They calculated that the implied amount of phosphine simply could not be produced by any known chemistry, and is, therefore, suggestive of micro-organisms in the clouds of Venus. A second observation, using the more sensitive and sharper-visioned ALMA telescope in Chile in 2019, confirmed the finding. The estimated quantity of phosphine (20 parts per billion) seems almost nothing. But that amount is at least 10,000 times higher than can be produced by any known abiotic chemistry: Volcanic, lightning-induced, solar wind-induced or delivered by meteorites. What next? Search for additional fingerprints, for starters. Then go the in situ way. Can Isro’s Shukrayaan help make headway? If conducted in the spirit of collective intellectual advancement rather than competitive nationalism, then yes, it can. Science knows no borders, and expanding the horizons of life as we know it is science that is transformational for humankind.Prajval Shastri is an astrophysicist from Bengaluru whose core research interest is the empirical investigation of giant black holes that are found in the centres of distant galaxies.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/was-carl-sagan-right-about-life-on-venus-india-can-help-find-out-more/story-qDByLyrB94HUnhKNMr5XmJ.html

The decision was taken considering the exorbitant rates being charged by blood banks and hospitals. State health minister Rajesh Tope made the announcement on Thursday.Those found charging in excess of the fixed charges will have to return the extra amount or they will face action. The authority can even cancel licences of the blood banks, Tope said.Following approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), convalescent plasma therapy is being used as a treatment for Covid-19 in the state. Each dose of convalescent plasma therapy is 200ml, for which blood banks and hospitals are charging exorbitantly.The state has formed an expert committee to determine rates for per dose of convalescent plasma therapy. In case, Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) or chemiluminescence test is conducted prior to the therapy then hospitals can charge ₹1,200 and ₹500 per test respectively, the health minister said.Earlier, the state government had fixed rates for Covid-19 tests. Samples collected at home for RT-PCR tests will be charged ₹2,000 and ₹1,200 for samples taken directly at the laboratory for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-fixes-5-500-for-each-plasma-therapy-dose-for-covid-19-patients/story-dsnwEfsrkg16rWjdGBMpyN.html

With a population of 10 lakh, the city of powerlooms has a majority of migratory population. Most of the workers and labourers look for homes for cheap. Over the past few decades, unsafe and illegal buildings have mushroomed in Bhiwandi. Experts claim small builders keep building such structures, within months, without permission or compliance with safety standards, while residents allege the civic body never takes any action. “Three-fourths of the total structures in Bhiwandi city are illegal and dangerous. As per the civic body’s record, of the 517 structures, which are more than 30 years old, only 47 have carried out structural audit,” said Pankaj Ashiya, chief of BNCMC. Ashiya said the civic body will conduct a massive drive to ensure the structures are audited, inspected and made safe for the residents to live in or razed, if required. “In the coming weeks, we will check the structures. Our committee has already begun formulating a strategy,” said Ashiya. Kamankar Dhurraj, an engineer from Bhiwandi city, said, “Most dangerous and illegal structures have come up in Bhiwandi in the past 10-15 years. Older areas housing the poor have maximum such structures. The builders simply get a plan from an architect of their choice unofficially and construct the building without any quality check. At least 200 such structures are under construction in the city at present.” The structures go from three to even seven storeys at times, Dhurraj claimed. “A nexus of builders, civic officials and local politicians rules in each ward. The only aim is to make money. Most of the buildings do not even have construction or occupation certificates,” he alleged. The rooms built in such structures are given on rents ranging between ₹1,500-₹2,000 or ₹3,000-₹4,000 a month. “We cannot pay much for rooms as we have to send money back home. We take shelter wherever possible. As we keep shifting from one place to another, we can’t pay much attention to whether the building is legal or safe,” said Shakeel Ansari, 38, a labour from Dhamankar Naka, Bhiwandi. In 2017, RTI activist Arvind Jaiswar had filed a petition against BNCMC seeking action against illegal constructions. The Bombay high court had passed an order in April 2017, asking BNCMC to create a grievance redress mechanism and a core committee to enable citizens to file complaints about illegal constructions. Jaiswar said, “No such committee has been formed so far. Soon I will meet the present commissioner and ask him to take implement the order.” Ashiya said BNCMC plans to appoint a committee of technical experts with civic employees and architects in the coming days. He added, “We had floated the tenders to appoint a panel twice, but there was no response. We will follow this up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-jilani-building-collapse-every-bhiwandi-building-to-be-checked/story-MG5KwCJqYWzjgs4yWmGJEL.html

Banu had left the house on Monday evening with her 8-year-old daughter when rescuers informed her that she will have to vacate it to help the operation. Banu hadn’t realised that it will be razed, and she is now clueless about where to stay with her daughter. She and three other families residing in the chawl are now homeless. Banu said, “On Monday night after watching rescue operations in Jilani building, I went to my relative’s place to sleep that night with my daughter. The team had asked us to vacate the chawl, but never informed they would raze it. The next day when I returned, the chawl had vanished. I was shocked and when I inquired they said they razed it to make way to the collapse site,” said Banu, whose husband passed away nine months ago. Their chawl was razed on Tuesday morning so that rescue teams could reach the collapse site and clear the debris using machinery. “Two other families also lost their shelters. Now we have no idea where to go as all my belongings are also destroyed. I have no money as well,” said Banu, who sells artificial ornaments on the road side in Bhiwandi. However, a member of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescue team requesting anonymity said, “On Monday night when we realised that next day there would be a need to use machinery to move the debris and find bodies, we had asked the residents in the chawl to move out with their belongings. We also informed them that if required we will raze it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-neighbouring-chawl-razed-to-make-way-3-families-left-homeless/story-HZB7iPB4qB7efoSI2CTNcI.html

The family remained at the site since the collapse as they refused to believe that their relatives, who lived on the first floor of Jilani building, are gone. Zaheer Ahmed, a 22-year-old student, was present at the site on the fourth day of rescue operations although the bodies of his two uncles, one aunt and three cousins were found on Wednesday. Zaheer’s two uncles — Shakir Ali Ansari, 40, and Zabir Ali Ansari, 20 — Zabir’s wife Shabnam Ali Ansari, 28, and their three children died in the incident. “I live nearby and reached the spot as soon as I came to know. When I looked around, I realised all of them were stuck inside. It was a painful experience for me. My uncles used to work as labourers in Bhiwandi and look after the family. They were all happy and I used to visit them often,” said Zaheer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-family-loses-six-relatives-visits-site-every-day/story-ZEaRDNRA2DGvKAcoNPLHjJ.html

The video shows him sobbing while shooting from inside the rubble. Khalid was stuck inside for 10 long hours after the building collapsed on Monday. He lost his brother and his son in the incident. Khalid thanked the rescue team for pulling him out from the debris. In the video, Khalid explained how he was caught inside the debris on the first floor when the building collapsed. He was heard saying, “So many would have died in this incident. I jumped off my bed when the incident took place and got stuck before I could run out. My leg was trapped under a concrete slab which I managed to remove. If I survive it would be because of God’s grace.” In the background the sound machines used by the rescue team could be heard. Khalid also showed the debris around him and the space where he was stuck. At the end of the video he said, “My children, please don’t trouble your mother.”Khalid’s wife and children were at native place, while he lived with his brother in the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-building-collapse-rescued-resident-s-video-from-inside-debris-goes-viral/story-hc07Cc9ed22COy9D2x4ppI.html
24-09-2020||Gurugram||Immunisation coverage of DTP vaccine takes a hit in Gurugram||With schools having been shut since March 25, due to a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the district’s immunisation coverage of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine has taken a significant hit, revealed the data shared by the district health department. Officials and experts fear this may lead to a spike in the cases of diphtheria among children over the next six to eight weeks. Gurugram and the neighbouring Nuh have already seen four suspected diphtheria deaths since July this year. The health department runs 11 immunisation programmes, covering a range of vaccines for preventable diseases (VPDs), such as measles, diptheria, polio, mumps, rubella and others. This year, due to Covid-19, the coverage targets of all 11 campaigns have been reduced. Immunisation efforts in Gurugram are lagging behind even in these lowered targets with staff stretched to capacity on account of Covid-19 outbreak, officials revealed. For example, a booster dose of the DTP vaccine, administered to children at age five, achieved 113% coverage last year (with 38,872 children inoculated as against a target of 34,375). This year, only 55% of the target has been met, with 7,408 children inoculated (out of 13,250 that were targeted for coverage till end August). Even sharper drops were seen in coverage of the tetanus-diptheria (TD) vaccine, which is administered to children at ages 10 and 16. Only 23% of the 10-year vaccine’s coverage target for August has been achieved (as opposed to 66% coverage last year). Similarly, the 16-year vaccine achieved only 11% coverage this year (as opposed to 51% last year). “It is unlikely that we will be able to meet or exceed our targets this year, whether for diptheria-tetanus-pertussis or any of the other campaigns. We are aiming for at least 90% coverage of all 11 vaccine programs, which should provide adequate herd immunity among vulnerable communities,” said Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer, Gurugram. While most vaccine campaigns are conducted door-to-door, booster doses of the DTP and TD vaccines, Garg explained, are administered in schools. “But schools have been shut since March, so naturally, these vaccines have achieved very low coverage this year. This would create ‘immunity gaps’ in the population, but we are going to set up weekend vaccine camps specifically for DTP and DT vaccines at all anganwadis in the district, every Saturday. Outreach programmes will also be done by ASHA workers to let people know,” Garg added.However, the public health ramifications of reduced immunisation cover are already manifesting, according to experts. Dr Bindu Yadav, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) surveillance medical officer in Gurugram, said, “Since July, Gurugram district has seen one confirmed case of diphtheria and seven suspected cases, whereas last year we saw only six cases. And the annual peak of the disease is still about eight weeks away. We are very likely to see a higher number of diptheria cases among children this year, which is indicative of low vaccine coverage during the lockdown.” Suspected cases of diphtheria have already been reported in Nuh, in which four children between the ages of five and 15 have died since July this year. Twelve other children are suspected to have contracted the bacterial illness, according to data provided by Dr Vimlesh Tiwari, district epidemiologist, Nuh. “Our district has historically struggled with immunisation cover. Last year we had about 150 cases of diptheria. This year, we are on the alert for more. Diptheria cases typically peak around late October and early November,” Tiwari said. Dr Sanjeev Tanwar, the WHO’s surveillance medical officer in Nuh, also added that suspected outbreaks of diptheria have been reported in districts of Alwar and Bharatpur in Rajasthan, which share their borders with Nuh. “I say suspected cases only because of technicality. Clinical symptoms of diphtheria are unique to the illness, so most cases are treated based on clinical discretion, and not necessarily based on lab confirmed results,” Tanwar explained. Dr Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi pointed out that diphtheria cases and/or outbreaks in the under-15 years age group have recently been reported both from Indian states, as well as countries in the region. “Take Bageshwar district in Uttarakhand, for example, or even parts of eastern Myanmar or central Vietnam. Like all routine health services, immunisation programmes have been affected to varied extents by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. This may render pools of unimmunised children and adolescents susceptible to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. All states are therefore making serious efforts towards catch-up immunisation,” said Dasgupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/immunisation-coverage-of-dtp-vaccine-takes-a-hit-in-gurugram/story-T3zs57hjyFXsrcP258xQYI.html
24-09-2020||Gurugram||Health team deploys 24 Ayurvedic doctors to visit home-isolated patients||Following Haryana government’s directive to increase surveillance of home-isolated Covid-19 patients, the Gurugram health department has added 30 doctors -- six MBBS, 24 ayurvedic doctors -- who will operate separately from the existing rapid response teams (RRTs).The surveillance teams will keep an eye on the patients’ health and ensure they get proper treatment if they deteriorate.Currently, 2732 patients of the 2990 total active cases are under home isolation, according to the district health bulletin on Thursday. At least 15 patients are in Covid Care Centre and 243 seriously ill patients are in hospitals. A district monitoring committee has been constituted especially for home-isolated patients, according to the notification issued by the state health department earlier this week. Health officials said that a 10-member committee has been formed to monitor the RRTs at the Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) level. There are 138 RRTs in rural areas and 143 in urban areas.Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer, said, “Twenty-four Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) doctors have been deployed under different UPHCs to visit patients at home and enquire about their health. They are being assisted by a lab technician. But before their visit, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) who are basically part of the RRTs visit these patients and record their vital parameters like body temperature, oxygen saturation level and blood pressure. The process helps in timely detection serious patients and preventing mortality.” RRTs comprise ASHAs, ANMs and lab technician. They were formed in May when the Covid-19 cases began to increase in the cityThese teams visit the patients on the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth day after testing positive and provide basic medicines like immunity boosters, AYUSH medicines, paracetamol and vitamin supplements. Besides, a doctor and an ANM at UPHC calls home-isolated patients between 9am to 5pm. Six doctors have been working in shifts, with three every alternate day. The team focuses upon patients with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension or those in immunocompromised state due to any long-term illness. “After the first round of surveillance when the patient is tested positive, the teams at the UPHC level identify people elderly with comorbid conditions. For the remaining patients, a separate list of patients is prepared who are reached out by the teams at the ground level. Every day the team reach out to over 100 home isolated patients.” said Dr Ashima Sheoran, senior medical officer, Wazirabad UPHC.“To understand this, the team on Thursday made calls to patients who were tested positive on September 21. These set of patients will again be reached out on September 27 and finally on the ninth day of their isolation period,” said Sheoran.According to her when the calls are being made to patients they generally enquire about the symptoms, food to be taken during the treatment, time duration for consuming immunity boosters and how family members can reach out to the team if the situation is serious. “In many cases patients talks to the team rudely and switch off their phones,” said Sheoran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-team-deploys-24-ayurvedic-doctors-to-visit-home-isolated-patients/story-pc6R1B31aGkxp93BNywFaJ.html

As per the data shared by district education officer Indu Boken, around 200- 400 students attended the classes daily. School heads said that while number students turning up was increasing gradually, sessions will not be scaled up until the end of the month. Voluntary visits to schools for clearing questions for a limited time period were permitted by the Central government as part of its Unlock 4 guidelines. Students outside containment zones were permitted to visit schools outside containment zones with the written consent of parents. In line with the statement of protocols, teachers were required to get a negative Covid test report and have Arogya Setu installed on their phones. Only 50% of teachers are permitted to visit schools for these academic sessions.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that guidance sessions would continue in the same manner until the end of the month. “We are holding discussion sessions for students in different slots. There is no exchange of class work or homework right now. Until the government issues new directions, sessions will continue in a similar manner,” said Sharma. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the number of students visiting the school had increased and. “Around 60 students visited the school today. Sessions were informal and unlike a full-fledged class. Students are allowed to leave after getting their questions cleared,” said Raghav. Most private schools said that they would continue with online classes since most parents were not in favour of school visits. Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that only a few students from classes 9 to 12 had visited the school for academic guidance visits. “We had sought feedback and consent from parent prior to the visits. However, where we expected four students, only one came and where we expected eight students, only three came,” said Misra. She said that the school had called only some teachers to schools based on the requests placed by students. “We had thoroughly sanitised labs and classrooms for specific classes. Desks where students were not supposed to sit due to distancing protocols were crossed out and separated. All measures were in place but not many children turned up,” said Misra. She said that the school would continue these sessions on a need basis since an overwhelming number of students were in favour of only online classes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-few-students-attending-schools-for-guidance/story-VABTY6UudqoP2S0cLWvy4H.html
24-09-2020||Gurugram||Around 1,800 workers in automobile factories have suffered serious injuries in past 3 years: Report||Around 1,800 workers employed in various automobile parts manufacturing units in Gurugram-Manesar industrial complex have suffered serious work-related injuries over the past three years that included, among others, losing their fingers and hands, stated a report released by Safe in India Foundation on Thursday. The report further stated that 88% of the injured workers were migrants from other states and they were also the ones who suffered the most during Covid-19 pandemic. As per the data shared by the foundation, 1,369 workers were seriously injured in the period between November 2016 and March 2019. Further, in the last one year, till September 1, 2020, an additional 504 auto workers faced serious injuries. The report also stated also stated that 52%of these workers were young and aged less than 30 years. They were mostly employed by vendors of large auto companies based in this region. “Every year, thousands of workers in Gurgaon, India’s leading automobile hub, meet with serious accidents. They lose their fingers, break their wrists, suffer nerve damage in their hands, and sometimes even lose the use of their hands. This happens despite the presence of safety laws and monitoring agencies in the country,” the report stated. Sandeep Sachdeva, CEO, Safe In India Foundation, said, without taking adequate care of workers engaged in production, India can’t progress. “A large number of workers have lost their hands and fingers in the last two decades. They need to be saved.”The supply chains of three automakers based in Gurugram and Faridabad accounted for more than 95% of the accidents. The foundation has also identified 31 factories in which one third of these accidents occurred. However, only few of the auto companies were serious about reducing these accidents and had responded to its recommendations in this regard, said Sachdeva. Chitra Khanna, head, safety Initiative of the foundation, said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, a large number of injured workers were replaced as auto companies preferred to hire workers who were physically fit when they resumed production. “The pandemic hit all the workers but those injured suffered the maximum,” she said. Experts also said that there was also a serious underreporting of such accidents by the factories and this was also the reason that systemic response could not be formulated to address the issue. On the government side, the report said that inspection of factories and industrial units has dropped while penalty for violations is very low. Rajesh Menon, director general, Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), said that safety of workers and their productivity greatly impact economic growth and social development. “Steps must be taken to prevent such accidents at all levels,” he said. The auto workers’ unions, meanwhile, said that there was need to improve safety measures on the shop floors to prevent such accidents as the mechanism for help and supporting the victims was very weak. “The system does not help these workers much and they are left in the lurch. The best thing would be to ensure minimum accidents,” said Anil Kumar, district general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress, which has multiple auto workers’ trade unions as its members. Reasons for accidents:Safety sensors/mechanism don’t workLack of formal operating and/or safety trainingLack of/poor quality safety gearProduction pressure from supervisorsMachines malfunction due to other reasons||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/around-1-800-workers-in-automobile-factories-have-suffered-serious-injuries-in-past-3-years-report/story-XhBL6Tr2C9P6JwBPRkw3YK.html

According to the police, the victim, identified as Suresh Kumar, worked as a security guard at a society in DLF Phase 3, and had gone missing on September 14. His brother, Munesh Kumar, had filed a missing persons’ complaint at Nathupur police post on September 19. In the complaint, Munesh had stated that his brother had not returned home after completing his shift on September 14. Munesh had said that his brother usually worked till 8pm. After he did not return, they searched for him in nearby areas for 2-3 days and then approached the police. Police said on September 21, Munesh and his nephew Krishan, were looking for the victim when they noticed Suresh’s dead body lying in a partially covered sewer near a Metro station in DLF Phase 3 area, behind the petrol pump. They immediately informed the police. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “After the victim’s decomposed body was recovered from the sewer, a charge of murder was added to the earlier FIR and a case was registered against unidentified person. A post-mortem was conducted subsequently. Further probe revealed that he had been hit with a heavy object and then his body was dumped in the sewer.” Police said on Wednesday, the accused man, identified as Jagat Singh, a native of Almora, Uttarakhand, was arrested from Nathupur, DLF phase 3. “The accused, who is a driver, said that he and Suresh were drinking alcohol on September 14 evening near the petrol pump. While drinking, the two had a fight regarding payment of the liquor purchased. Singh hit him with a brick on his head multiple times, following which Suresh fell to the ground, unconscious. Singh then dumped his body in a sewer nearby. Since the sewer had water, it is suspected that Suresh drowned,” said Boken. Police said they had confiscated all relevant evidences from the crime spot. The suspect, Singh, was produced in a city court on Thursday and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-murders-security-guard-after-tiff-dumps-body-in-sewer-arrested/story-RscRgp9MDZvmWOwc4T2fRK.html
24-09-2020||Gurugram||More than 1,600 property owners can lose water and sewage connections if they fail to clear dues||More than 1,600 property owners across the city can lose their water and sewage connections next month if they fail to clear their property tax dues by then, said officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday.MCG officials said, over the last one week, notices have been served to around 1,650 property owners, asking them to clear their property tax dues within the next 15 days. Otherwise, the civic body would terminate their water and sewage connections. MCG officials said that each property owner owes the civic body in excess of ₹10 lakh in dues, much of which have been accumulating for more than the past five years.“The 1,650 property owners have been given multiple notices to clear their dues. We have now decided to serve them a final notice of 15 days to clear their dues. Otherwise, we will terminate their water and sewage connections with immediate effect,” said Dinesh Kumar, zonal taxation officer (ZTO), MCG.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that for the civic body sealing properties of tax defaulters — the usual practice — was proving to be a hindrance, especially in residential areas and often they only ended up sealing commercial properties. Hence, the civic body has decided to opt for disconnecting water and sewage lines of defaulters.The official further said that the MCG is also planning to write to the power discom, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), requesting it to cut the electricity connection of property tax defaulters.It is for the first time that the MCG is planning to terminate sewage connections of property tax defaulters. The practice of terminating water connections, however, is not something new for the civic body. In April 2017, the civic body had terminated water connections of five residents in Sector 27 for failing to clear their dues.Property tax is MCG’s main source of revenue. More than 80% of MCG’s annual revenue comes from it.There are 3.97 lakh properties registered under MCG records and as per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act. The civic body can charge tax from any property falling under its jurisdiction.The MCG had collected around ₹166 crore through property tax collection in the 2019-2020 fiscal, much lower than its highest collection of ₹342 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. To ensure a higher collection of property tax in 2020-21 fiscal, the MCG introduced a rebate scheme of 10% on property tax dues in May. Initially, the deadline for this was set as August 31. However, after the civic body collected ₹105 crore of property tax dues in August — the highest it had ever collected in a single month — the civic body decided to extend the rebate scheme till October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/more-than-1-600-property-owners-can-lose-water-and-sewage-connections-if-they-fail-to-clear-dues/story-b3x8NDed6lLCm34NlI2CZN.html

The workers protested for one hour and burnt an effigy of the state government. Then, they submitted a memorandum to the district programme officer.Subhash Rani, general secretary of Punjab Anganwadi Mulazam Union, said, “We want that the state government ask the education department to not enrol students of pre-primary classes and send them to anganwadi centres. The centres are involving students in various activities and providing cooked food to them. During the pandemic also, the workers and helpers worked as Covid warriors and delivered food to the childrens’ home.”“If the government hires teachers for pre-primary students, then who will enrol their children in anganwadi centers. The state government has given its nod to this decision in a recent cabinet meeting which is not in favour of anganwadi workers and helpers. To protest this decision, anganwadi workers will gherao the residence of Punjab social security, women and child development minister Aruna Chaudhary on October 2.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anganwadi-workers-oppose-pre-primary-students-enroling-in-govt-schools-in-ludhiana/story-AoxbhYIelSzAg9wdC18g3L.html

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Turf war between SAD, Cong in Dakha for farmers’ support||Amid farmers’ protests against the agri bills passed in Parliament, Dakha constituency, which comprises over 90% of the rural population of the district, has turned into a political battleground for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress ahead of the 2022 legislative elections.Leaders of both parties are leaving no stone unturned to woo the farmers. On Wednesday, SAD MLA Manpreet Ayali and Captain Sandeep Sandhu, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s political secretary, who is also the Congress in-charge of Dakha, organised separate tractor protest rallies at the constituency. Both leaders have also been taking digs at each other on social media platforms.  The by-elections for Dakha constituency, which has a population of around 2.5 lakh and comprises over 110 villages, was contested last year between Ayali and Captain Sandhu, in which the latter lost out by 14,672 votes.”I am also a farmer and I have always stood by their side. It is Congress which is trying to get political benefit out of the crisis. We had announced Wednesday’s protest on Monday. It was then that Congress also organised a protest on the same day. Farmers are my priority and party is secondary. Congress leaders think they will win the 2022 elections with these unethical practices during this time of crisis, but the public will show them their true value by voting for SAD,” Ayali said. Sandhu, however, refuted the allegations levelled by the SAD leader and slammed the party over its double standards in terms of farm bills. ”SAD should make it clear who are they protesting against. If the protests are against BJP, then they are going against their allies at the Union level. If they are supporting BJP, they cannot stand by the farmers. Congress is clearly against the farm bills. We have been staging protests in support of the farmers for the last few days. There is no political motive behind this and SAD can’t handle that farmers are standing with Congress,” Sandhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/turf-war-between-sad-cong-in-dakha-for-farmers-support/story-O9y4Xn1UvT4sIJnh4j24rM.html

24-09-2020||Noida||Noida Police attaches gangster’s properties worth ₹4 crore||Noida Police on Thursday attached properties worth around ₹4 crore of a member of a Sundar Bhati gang as part of their crackdown on known criminals, officers said.As many as ten properties that belong to jailed gangster Satveer Bansal, who has cases of extortion, money laundering, and Gangters Act lodged among others against him, were attached on Thursday, said officers from the Noida police commissionerate. “All of these properties were in Ghaziabad’s Loni area, and were registered under Bansal’s name who is a known member of the Bhati gang. He owns other properties and assets as well, and we are working on attaching them as well. All of these properties and assets have been procured through illegal means,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 3.According to section 14(1) of the Gangsters Act, immovable and movable assets of known criminals procured using illegal means can be attached.The DCP said that market value of these properties is somewhere around ₹4 crore. The Noida Police had already attached assets worth ₹ 5.41 crore, owned by Bansal, earlier.“We also have orders to attach 12 vehicles of another gangster Pramod, who is a prominent member of the Randeep Bhati gang, and we will take the necessary action soon. We will continue to attach assets of known gangsters. This will cut off the money supply to organised criminals and restrict their movement. There are other criminals as well who have been identified and we will continue to attach their assets as when we get the instructions to do so,” the DCP said.The power to attach assets was with the district administration earlier, however, with the formation of the police commissionerate in January, the power now rests with the Noida Police.The district police have already attached properties and assets, including luxury vehicles, of organised criminals worth more than ₹40 crore this year. This includes assets and properties ₹17 crore of known associates of jailed gangster Sunder Bhati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-attaches-gangster-s-properties-worth-4-crore/story-WTTg9dOYY8fUUw1AqOeD9N.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi at peak of 2nd wave, cases will drop now: Kejriwal||Delhi has likely put behind it the peak of a “second wave” of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, and the situation is expected to improve from hereon, chief minster Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, expressing optimism that the capital has tided over the brunt of the health crisis.It’s the first time Kejriwal has spoken of a second wave of the pandemic, tracing it to the month between August 17 and September 17.“From July 1 to August 17, the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi was under control. From August 17, cases started increasing. We acted like a responsible government and scaled up tests from around 20,000 per day to 60,000 per day,” Kejriwal said on the sidelines of a visit to the Indian Agriculture Research Institute for the live demonstration of a crop stubble decomposition technology.“Aggressive testing and isolation of patients is the best way to defeat Covid-19. With increased tests, the number of cases also increased,” said Kejriwal. “If we had done fewer tests, the numbers would have been less – maybe close to 1,500 cases per day like earlier. But we went ahead. After September 16, when the number of new cases in a day was the highest, cases started dropping again despite heightened testing. Experts are of the opinion that the second of Covid-19 in Delhi is likely to have hit the peak, and now cases are expected to go down.”Between July 1 and August 17, Delhi recorded a daily average of 1,375 cases of Covid-19. However, from August 18 till Thursday, the Capital added more than double that number, logging 2,822 new cases of the disease on average each day. According to medicinenet.com, a second wave refers to a phenomenon of infections that can develop during a pandemic in which a disease infects one group of people first and infections appear to decrease; then, infections increase in a different part of the population, resulting in a second wave of infections. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said earlier this month that a second wave is a situation in which new Covid-19 cases start surfacing after hitting zero or extremely low counts.Dr Puneet Misra, professor in the community medicines department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “The current spike in cases in Delhi can be attributed to multiple factors which include increased testing, further easing of lockdown restrictions and a large sense of complacency among people. However, it would be inaccurate to call it a second wave because Delhi did not witness a significantly steep drop in average cases for long enough in the past. Also, the current trends suggest that Delhi should take some more time in reaching its peak.” Before the resurgence of cases, the seven-day average of daily cases in the Capital peaked at 3,446 on June 26 before falling to 983 on August 4. In the last seven days, Delhi has seen an average of above 3,700 new cases every day.On September 16, Delhi recorded 4,473 new cases in a day – the highest so far.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 3,834 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of patients so far to 260,623, even as 224,375 people have recovered from the disease and 5,123 have died. Over 59,000 tests were recorded on Thursday, against 19,841 on August 25, government records showed. “At this juncture, the Delhi government should keep up with the scaled-up tests and increase the proportion of RT-PCR {reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction} tests for better ascertainment of the prevalence of the disease. Currently, the positivity rate is around 7%. For one to say that the situation is under control, it should be less than 5%,” said Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR):RT-PCR is considered to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing and the most accurate method of diagnosing the disease. Of the total tests recorded on Thursday, 9,814 were RT-PCR tests and 49,369 were rapid antigen tests, the government health bulletin showed.Rapid antigen tests are considered less accurate because they throw up false negative results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-at-peak-of-2nd-wave-cases-will-drop-now-kejriwal/story-H5vyoQ5EWHWLuVIiahWpPK.html

The families of the victim alleged it was a communal attack but the police said it was personal fight. Police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel have been deployed in the neighbourhood even as senior police officers said the situation was under control and that efforts were being made to involve influential voices in the local communities to rein in mischief-mongers. There were multiple conflicting versions about what led to the violence and the death of Mohammad Shaukat. “Shaukat was only trying to intervene in the fight and save a man who was being thrashed by the mob. He was an innocent man,” said PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini). Shaukat’s family, however, said he was a bystander and was lynched because he was a Muslim. The violence reported from the Jhuggi Jhopdi Colony of Sawda, an economically backward village in Kanjhawala, on Tuesday first saw a mob carrying baseball bats, rods, swords, stones and sticks beating up a man. Then, there was stone pelting, allegedly by both Hindus and Muslims. On Thursday, the DCP said five of the about 20 members of the mob had been arrested and efforts were on to nab other suspects. Tension had been brewing Local residents said communal tension had been brewing in the neighbourhood for the last four-five months. “Hindus would verbally taunt and abuse us whenever they saw us,” said Mohammad Rihan, an 18-year-old Class 10 student who suffered a fractured leg in the attack. Dinesh, the father of one of the arrested men, Harish, agreed that tension had been festering for months. “It all began with some silly quarrel between young boys,” Dinesh said. Different versions to the trigger In his statement in the first information report (FIR), Rihan said his friend Saider was in love with a local girl who later turned out to be the girlfriend of a 19-year-old man named Ankit from the same neighbourhood. “Saider raised the issue with his girlfriend and the matter was sorted a year ago. But when Ankit got to know of the girl’s relationship with Saider, he and his friends began looking for Saider,” Rihan said in the FIR. Rihan allegedly told police in his statement that on Tuesday night, a heavily armed mob came looking for Saider and when they couldn’t find Saider, they attacked him (Rihan). The fight over personal issue was also the version offered by the DCP. On Thursday, however, Rihan told HT that his statement to the police was coerced and that he did not sign it. The DCP said while people are known to change statements with a change in circumstances and environment, there was no coercion of any kind. “We are probing the violence and the reasons behind it,” DCP Mishra said. Ravi, the maternal uncle of another arrested man Vikas said the violence began when a local youngster on a bike ran over Vikas’s foot and then slapped him on Tuesday night. “Vikas called his friends for help, but the matter was sorted. I don’t know what happened after that,” said Ravi. Ankit and Vikas are friends and immediate neighbours. Also, it remains unclear who allegedly ran over Vikas’ foot. The attack The alleged mob violence took place around 8.30pm on Tuesday when Rihan was fiddling with his mobile phone outside his home. “They attacked me with baseball bats and rods before some people rescued me. They were saying that they were going to kill me,” Rihan alleged. While Rihan was rescued by some local residents, the mob attacked Shaukat, who was returning from his photography shop and had allegedly stopped to watch what was happening. “Eyewitness have told me that the mob simply asked Shaukat his name and attacked him because of his faith. My son was an innocent person who worked hard to provide for our family of seven,” said Shaukat’s father, Azad, who works as a tailor in Kashmir. The DCP, however, said Shaukat was targeted after he intervened to save Rihan.According to Rihan, during the attack, the mob allegedly covered some CCTV cameras with bedsheets and picked up stones from a construction site nearby to pelt at the houses of Muslims. “When stones and bricks landed at our terraces, we pelted them back at the mob to chase them away,” said Khamruddin, a resident of the same lane. By the time the police arrived, the mob was gone. In the FIR, the police have mentioned that they received 19 PCR calls from the colony between 9.53 pm and 11.52 pm and reached the spot to find the lane and the main road filled with stones and a pool of blood at one spot. The injured men were taken to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Mangolpuri where Shaukat succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday morning and Rihan’s injuries were treated, the DCP said. When Shaukat’s body was brought back from the hospital on Wednesday, scores of people protested with his body on the road for an hour before senior police officers convinced them of action. “We have registered a case of murder, attempt to murder and rioting and ensuring that none of the people involved in the violence are spared,” said DCP Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tension-grips-delhi-s-kanjhawala-after-23-yr-old-man-lynched-1-injured/story-GPdGijMWARMJAllEuNbG5K.html
24-09-2020||Noida||Single window system planned to get approvals under UP MSME Act||Easing the conditions for setting up new micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units in Uttar Pradesh, the state government notified the much-awaited new UP MSME (Establishment and Operations) Act, 2020. Earlier, entrepreneurs required 80 no objection certificates (NOCs) from 29 departments, and had to apply to each separately. Now, a single window system will be set up for the purpose, and power connection of up to 20 KW will be made available within three days of filing an application. Notified on Sunday, it was made public on Thursday.“A person will have to make an application through a ‘Declaration of Intent’ to the District Level Nodal Agency (DLNA), which will have to issue an acknowledgment within 72 hours of receiving the application. On the basis of this acknowledgement, one will be able to establish the unit,’’ the notification stated.If the authority finds that the entrepreneur falsified documents or is ineligible for the NOC, then the licence can be cancelled and penalties imposed. However, government physical inspection can happen only after 1,000 days from acknowledgment, the notification adds. Navneet Sehgal, state’s additional chief secretary (MSME), said the DLNA will be headed by the district magistrate. “The application can be filed online through the ‘Nivesh Mitra’ portal, which is the official portal for the sector. The committee will immediately start verification of the submitted documents and licenses needed to start the industry will be issued within three days,” he said. “Earlier, we were working on the basis of the central MSME Act, which had very tough terms and conditions regarding land use and ceiling. Since officials from all departments concerned have been made the members of the DLNA, the idea of the Act is to allow projects to proceed. Not only that, once a business obtains all the permissions, there won’t be any inspection for 1,000 days,” Sehgal said. GB Nagar district deputy commissioner (industries) Anil Kumar said at least 10,000 new MSME entrepreneurs will now be able to kick off their ventures in the district. “Besides, it will also create new employment opportunities in the district. The Act will be applicable for new units or those seeking to expand or diversify, provided they increase their gross block only by 25%. This Act doesn’t cover units of tobacco products, gutka, pan masala, alcohol, carbonated drinks, fire crackers, plastic bags of 40 microns or less or as banned by the government from time to time,” he said. Welcoming the new Act, Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NEAC), said that it will boost the morale of aspiring entrepreneurs and weed out corruption. “Earlier, they have to make rounds of different offices. Now, they don’t either need to waste their time in getting NOCs or to grease the palms of babus in different departments. This single window system will attract many new entrepreneurs in apparel sector in GB Nagar, which is a landmark product in the district. The more apparel units will be established in GB Nagar, the more job and export opportunities will be created here,” he said. However, Surendra Singh Nahta, district president of MSME industrial association, said that the advantages of the new Act can only be assessed once the first entrepreneur gets license under the new provision. “The existing MSME units don’t have proper production due to paucity of workers. And, the government is not ready to provide them relief from any front. If the government can’t protect old units, how can it boost the morale of new entrepreneurs?,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/single-window-system-planned-to-get-approvals-under-up-msme-act/story-4AHSXdOAjCrXubDvaIHFcN.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||Balbharti’s e-content gets good response from students in Maharashtra amid Covid-19 pandemic||As schools in Maharashtra continue to conduct classes virtually for the past 6 months, the online content created by Balbharti – the state’s publishing bureau – has been a hit among students and parents. According to data shared by Balbharti, more than 1 lakh students have downloaded the E-Balbharti application on mobile phones after it was launched in January. Most of the downloads were recorded after the schools closed in the state owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are happy to see that a large number of students are benefitting from the online study material that is made available through the app. While the app was initially intended to be paid, we made it free for a few months due to the Covid-19 situation and the resultant closure of physical schools,” said Vivek Gosavi, director, Balbharti. The publishing bureau recently launched another mobile app – Geo Survey – for students of Class 12, who have geography as their subject, to learn how to conduct geo surveys online. “This app was released in August, and in a month’s time, it has got over 5,000 downloads,” said Gosavi. Over the past few years, Balbharti has been uploading PDF textbooks of all subjects on its official website – http://ebalbharati.in. Textbooks of the revised Class 12 syllabus were uploaded on the website in April, even before physical textbooks were made available in markets. The website has so far seen more than 2.5 crore downloads. Manisha Kadam, a teacher from a suburban school, said students who do not have access to internet for classes are able to use the PDF textbooks online. “Many students cannot afford to recharge their internet every month. So we send them PDF books on social messaging apps of their parents or relatives. We ask them to solve exercises and send us for correction,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/balbharti-s-e-content-gets-good-response-from-students-in-maharashtra-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-gYdJrpwUbXNmf2jKtWmc5N.html

Close to 2,400 people have already made use of the recently-launched Yulu bikes in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC).The mobile application-based e-bike operator started services in the commercial hub on August 31. According to Amit Gupta, chief executive officer and co-founder of Yulu bikes, around 300 people have been booking rides daily, and the most preferred slot is between 5pm and 8pm when they are returning home from work.The company is expecting the numbers to increase post-monsoon. “Post monsoon, we are hopeful of seeing the numbers rising further. As Unlock 4.0 gets implemented, citizens will prefer safe and shareable services, easing parking woes in business hubs like BKC. Via this launch we aim to provide a smart, safe and easy ride for all our commuters,” Gupta said.He added, “We are happy with the response that we have got and we want commuters to take advantage of this facility and make cycling within BKC a pleasant experience.”Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray had inaugurated the bikes in January, but the launch was postponed owing to the lockdown. On August 31, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) launched the public electric bike-sharing facility in BKC. Around 100 e-bikes have been made available for commuters at nine different locations, including the Bandra and Kurla stations.Commuters can download the Yulu app on their mobile phones and register for the service. Once they find a Yulu zone, they can unlock the bike for ₹5 and will be charged ₹1.5 for every minute. Commuters will have to pay ₹199 as a deposit and can also avail super saver packs on offer. The bikes will be sanitised after every ride, a spokesperson from Yulu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/e-bike-service-in-mumbai-s-bandra-kurla-complex-get-good-response-amid-limited-public-transport-options/story-VuU3N95T4EfDAi9don6NCO.html
24-09-2020||City||Rera asks Uttar Pradesh govt to reduce stamp fee on flat registry by 2%||The Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority (UP-RERA) has recommended a reduction of 2% in the stamp fee, a move aimed at helping the realty sector recover from the financial crisis it is facing in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease pandemic.The authority wrote a letter to chief minister suggesting a reduction in the stamp fee after state governments of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra reduced the same, said officials.“We wrote a letter to the UP government few days back suggesting that the stamp fee should be reduced up to 2% as it will help the real estate sector recover from the financial crisis which has come up due to the pandemic. We have recommended the reduction in all cities across the state as the pandemic has affected the sector everywhere,” said Balvinder Kumar, member, UP-RERA. The authority has suggested the reduction till August 31, 2021.In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas, among other parts of the Gautam Budh Nagar district, the stamp and registration department levies 5% of the total property cost, be it an apartment, plot, house or other property, as stamp fee at the time of execution of a lease-deed or registry, which is required to transfer the property’s title, unlike other cities like Ghaziabad or Lucknow, where the stamp fee is 7% of total property cost.Officials at the state stamp and registration department, meanwhile, said that if UP-RERA’s recommendation is accepted, it might encourage buyers to execute sub-lease or registry of their respective properties.“There are at least 20,000 homebuyers who have got the possession of their apartments but aren’t executing the sub-lease, thereby causing a revenue loss. The reduction in fee may encourage them to execute registry or sub-lease,” said SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general, stamp and registration department, Gautam Budh Nagar.The department said it has failed to meet its regular revenue target as buyers are not keen on getting their sub-leases or registries executed due to financial constraints caused by the pandemic.“We have a target of revenue ₹3,148 crore in the financial year 2020-21. So far, we could only earn ₹450 crore since April 1 till date, against a target of ₹1,500 crore, as the pandemic has thrown challenges before everyone, including buyers,” said Tripathi.Developers also welcomed RERA’s proposal.“The UP-RERA’s recommendation should be implemented immediately to tide over the financial crisis that the homebuyers and the entire sector is facing,” said RK Arora, president of the Uttar Pradesh national real estate development council (NAREDCO).Developers have also requested the state government to take steps to cope with the crisis.“The state government should take measures without any delay because the real estate sector is facing a huge financial crisis. And if stamp fee is reduced, it will also benefit the government as it will recover revenue immediately,” said Prashant Tiwari, western UP president of confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI).Homebuyers said they have already demanded a reduction in stamp fee.“The chief minister should reduce the stamp fee because homebuyers are in a financial mess with job losses and the financial crisis brought about by the pandemic,” said SK Nagrath, president of Jaypee Aman homebuyers’ welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rera-asks-uttar-pradesh-govt-to-reduce-stamp-fee-on-flat-registry-by-2/story-0wm0w3b2oK2gczvWByGmhM.html
24-09-2020||Noida||‘Good Morning Noida’ campaign to connect with locals||The next time you hit a red light at a traffic signal in Noida during rush hours, do not be surprised if a traffic policeman greets you with a Good Morning. The Noida traffic police department has launched a ‘Good Morning Noida’ campaign — an initiative that aims to reach out and make friendly contact with local residents. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar and district nodal officer of Dial 112, said that the main aim of the programme was to reach out to locals and take them into confidence in improving the traffic system. “The aim is to instil a sense that the police is working for the safety of people. The Noida traffic police and Dial 112 teams have been sensitised to participate in the Good Morning initiative. The traffic police’s morning shift starts from 7am. These police personnel are deployed at different crossings and red lights who ensure smooth vehicular movement. They will now also welcome people,” he said. Dial 112’s nodal officer, Saha, said that there are 65 four-wheelers and 70 two-wheelers in their fleet in Gautam Budh Nagar. Dial 112 is an emergency helpline number to access police, fire brigade, and ambulance services under the Emergency Response Support System in Uttar Pradesh. The service was launched in UP in October 2019.“These cops also visit different parks and societies and greet people in the morning. The police personnel also take selfies with locals and morning walkers and use the photos to update their attendance using an internal mobile app,” he said. Saha said that the traffic police have improved its presence and visibility in the city, and forged a good relationship with the residents. “We also seek resident feedbacks and suggestions on improving traffic system,” he said. KK Jain, general secretary, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA), and resident of Sector 34, said that a police team had recently visited his sector. “The police team welcomed us and asked if people were satisfied with the patrolling and police presence in the area. They asked if the local check post in-charge and SHO were available when needed. The residents informed that the police and people communication has improved. We are happy that the police is now reaching out to us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/good-morning-noida-campaign-to-connect-with-locals/story-Qkxtl7oq9CrllcDRnoyy0L.html
24-09-2020||Noida||Noida: Police to launch initiative to help minor rape survivors through counselling||The police have decided to launch an initiative to help minor rape survivors through counselling and rehabilitation. Under the initiative, titled “Sakhi”, trained women police personnel (counsellors) will soon identify minor rape survivors in the city and visit them at their homes in Noida and Greater Noida to counsel them and help them overcome the trauma.Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, Women Safety, Gautam Budh Nagar, said rape is a serious crime which needs to be checked. “We have formed a special team of 20 women police personnel – 15 sub-inspectors and five head constables. These sub-inspectors are also the investigating officials (IO) in most of the rape cases. For Saturday, we have scheduled a day-long training programme for these personnel. We have invited doctors and psychiatrists from government and private sectors to provide training and sensitise them. The personnel will be trained on how to talk to the survivors and counsel them properly,” Shukla said.Shukla said rape affects survivors mentally. “We are taking this initiative to ensure such crimes do not leave a deep impact on the victims. The police will also help victims who would need medical treatment, psychiatrists or proper medication,” she said. Initially the police will focus on minor survivors; the initiative would cover older survivors in later stages. The police team will analyse cases registered in August and September to select victims for counselling accordingly. Police said they are figuring out the total number of rape cases registered this year. Shukla said there are also some instances where fake charges of rape were levelled by complainants. “Investigation in some cases revealed that the allegations were not correct. We will screen the complaints and address only serious cases under this initiative,” she said. The counsellors will start visiting the survivors’ houses from Monday. Mala Bhandari, founder of Noida-based women’s rights non-government organisation SADRAG, said survivors need to be counselled with sympathy and empathy. “The police should also engage some expert counsellors for this initiative,” she said.Satya Prakash, programme manager of FXB India Suraksha – Childline, an NGO that works for child rights, said that counselling is a must in such cases. “Most police personnel are not specially trained to deal with rape survivors. We have found that the survivors experience mental suffering in such cases. There were some instances where the survivors tried to hurt themselves. The Sakhi initiative should not be limited to counselling only. The police should also ensure counselling of victims’ families, ensure compensation, and medical health services, etc., to the victim in an integrated programme,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-to-launch-initiative-to-help-minor-rape-survivors-through-counselling/story-S7wbZ68Bj24wOzK3Gnm3XJ.html

24-09-2020||Noida||Now, GIMS to collect plasma from homes of donors in GB Nagar||Recovered Covid-19 patients in Gautam Budh Nagar district need not make rounds of hospitals to donate their plasma as the district administration, on Thursday, asked the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) officials to collect plasma from the donor’s home. District magistrate Suhas LY, who shared coffee with plasma donors on Thursday at the collectorate auditorium, said the programme was organised to boost the morale of plasma donors. “They are our real heroes. They have not only defeated the deadly virus with their strong will power and immunity, but have also agreed to lead from the front to save other infected persons,” he said. He said GIMS doctors have been asked to make necessary arrangements, to collect plasma from the homes of donors. “If two and above donors are available in one society or high-rise, the team of doctors has been asked to go to one place and collect plasma from there. The plasma donors will have to make a call on 7303488239, which is the blood bank’s number in GIMS, and then the officials concerned will contact them to fix the appointment. It will not only remove fear from the minds of the people living in that society/high-rise, but will also save donors the exertion of having to visit the hospital again,” Suhas said. GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta, who was also present at the ‘Coffee with Collector’ programme, said GIMS has been running plasmapheresis therapy since May 9, 2020. “Till date, we have completed 128 plasma donations and 196 patients have received plasma therapy. As many as 10 persons, who have recovered from Covid-19, have donated plasma more than once. Four of these corona warriors are our staff members,” he said. Dr Gupta said of the 196 patients who have received plasma therapy, 169 were male and 27 female. “As many as 174 patients survived the infection, but we lost 22 of them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/now-gims-to-collect-plasma-from-homes-of-donors-in-gb-nagar/story-KJbIFpWsDZsn3tKZ6RTFLK.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||Spike in number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai cannot be called second wave at all: BMC chief IS Chahal||As the number of Covid-19 cases has gone up drastically in the city over the last two weeks, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday said that the spike in cases cannot be called a ‘second wave’. Chahal was speaking at Hospital Tech 2020 – a virtual event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).Replying to a question on whether the spike can be called a second wave, Chahal said, “I would like to reassure citizens that the spike in cases cannot be termed as a second wave at all. We have to understand that we have increased the number of testing in September. From 7,000 to 9,000 tests daily, now we are conducting around 15,000 or even more tests. If we bring down the number of tests, we might again have lesser cases.”Chahal added, “We can call it a stimulated spike, and this was done because we were in a position to handle more patients daily, with a sufficient number of beds and required infrastructure.”On Thursday, HT had reported how the number of cases has gone up drastically in September compared to August. In the same period, the number of deaths has decreased. The number of Covid-19 cases in the city rose 104% to 40,957 (September 1-22) from 20,031 (August 1-22), according to state health department data. The number of deaths dropped to 862 in September, from 990 in August during the same period.Stressing on several issues ranging from testing, tracing and treating to augmentation of health infrastructure, Chahal also emphasised the importance of wearing masks, social distancing and practising hygiene norms.On the question of when life in Mumbai can return to normal, Chahal said that it depended on how citizens deal with the situation now. “When normal days can be back is something I will keep for the citizens to decide. The more responsible we are, the sooner we will have normal days back. For this, we need to follow all norms like wearing mask, social distancing, etc. I still find people not wearing masks,” the civic chief said.Chahal said that the civic body will continue to be cautious about lifting restrictions. “Next on our platter are gyms and restaurants, and we are talking about how they can be opened with 1/3rd capacity. We want to unlock responsibly and we are doing it, rather than opening everything and shutting them again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spike-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-cannot-be-called-second-wave-at-all-bmc-chief-is-chahal/story-CnovL7tzqDyvYHITCuWV0K.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC orders police commissioner to crackdown on ‘honey trapping’, extortion||The Delhi High Court has asked the city’s police chief to call for reports from all police stations in cases of ‘honey trap’ or extortion and issue standing orders for taking action. While passing the direction, the court said that though acceptance of allurement is not justified, allurement advanced for extortion of money is also not acceptable. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said if such incidents of extortion by alluring a person have happened in the national capital in 2020, the police chief should issue standing orders to all the concerned police stations that action may be taken as per law, without harassing such person or the alleged accused. The high court’s direction came while granting anticipatory bail to a businessman, accused in a rape case, who claimed that he was trapped and tricked by gang of extortionists. “I have gone through the photographs and chats which are annexed with the present petition which seems to be the allurement on the part of the complainant (woman) and petitioner (man) got trapped therein, however, without commenting on the merits of the prosecution case, I am of the view that petitioner deserves protection from this court,” the judge said. The high court directed the concerned police officers that in the event of arrest, the man shall be released on bond on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs 25,000. It directed the man, represented through senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, to cooperate with the investigation and make himself available for interrogation and that he shall not contact or influence the woman and prosecution witnesses. “I hereby direct the commissioner of police, Delhi, to personally look into the matter and see whether the complainant herein and the above mentioned … (neighbour/ associate) are indulged in any other such type of cases, if so, appropriate action may be taken against the culprits…..In addition to above, the commissioner shall call reports from all the police stations of such cases as present one and file a report to this effect within four weeks,” the judge said. The high court listed the matter for November 17 for further directions and said that a copy of this order be sent to the Commissioner of Delhi Police for information and necessary compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-court-orders-police-commissioner-to-crackdown-on-honey-trapping-extortion/story-LPJobKTcqvPDYogXoun2bI.html

The decision follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent direction to states, including Uttar Pradesh, to focus on containment zones rather than lockdowns, while at the same time strengthening testing, tracing and spreading awareness on masks and social distancing. Accordingly, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed specific plans for the 16 districts and sending special secretary-level officers to monitor them.“The 16 identified districts are those which have an average of 100 daily cases in a week. The districts include Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Noida, Meerut and Ghaziabad among others. A workplan will be prepared and state officials are working on it. Once we keep focus on these districts, we will be able to control Covid-19 situation,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP additional chief secretary (home) on Thursday. “The CM has directed for control of fatality rate with the help of micro surveillance and contact tracing.”In Ghaziabad, the health department officials said that they are also monitoring rise in number of cases in specific pockets in order to control spread of infection. They said that they have identified eight police station areas where maximum cases were recorded this month. “We have identified localities in eight police station areas which have witnessed high number of cases in 22 days of the current month. Here, we will enhance surveillance teams and focus on contact tracing as well. As per our records, the eight areas need special focus in the district and check needs to be maintained on new cases,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer. “Apart from surveillance, we will also focus on contact tracing and testing in these areas which are having major share of cases in the current month.”According to the records of the district health department, they identified localities in police station areas of Indirapuram (812 cases), Kavi Nagar (782 cases), Sihani Gate (592 cases), Sahibabad (523 cases), Vijay Nagar (378 cases), Kaushambi (259 cases), Muradnagar (187 cases) and Modinagar (141 cases).

Pandian, an IAS officer, held a review meeting at the district headquarters and asked officials not to be complacent with respect to surveillance and monitoring.The district on September 24 has crossed the 13,000-mark with respect to total Covid-19 cases so far. This figure includes the 11,223 patients who have been discharged, besides 74 deaths and 1,753 active cases.“During the review, I asked the health department to conduct a minimum of 6,000 tests per day and rope in more sampling booths for the purpose. Further, I have directed the industry department officials to bring workers in industrial sector under ambit of testing. A nodal officer is to be appointed and a list of all suspected cases in industrial units shall be prepared on a daily basis and sent to the integrated command and control centre, after which they will be tested,” Pandian said.According to district officials, Ghaziabad has about 27,000 industrial units where a large workforce is employed. Given this number, identification of workers with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) becomes vital. “I have also directed that private hospitals display the rates of paid Covid treatment at their premises. I will be taking further reviews. I have asked officials to continue with surveillance activities and strictly monitor containment zones. This is very important in order to curb the spread of Covid-19 as many activities have now opened up under the unlock mode,” he added.The district on September 23 had a total of 387 containment zones.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that after the review meeting, he asked officials to prepare work plans and comply with the directions given by the nodal officer.According to health department officials who were present during the review, the district currently has been collecting 3,500-4,000 sampling per day. “We have been asked to come up with more sampling booths so that more areas in the district can be covered. At present, we have 20 sampling points in the form of static booths, mobile vans and mobile teams, among others. Since the requirement of 20 more lab technicians has been approved, we will rope them in to increasing our daily testing capacity after they are hired,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.Officials said they have also been given directions that all pregnant women should be tested at the time of registration at the respective hospital as well as a couple of days before their due date. “We have also been asked to daily compile a list of people purchasing medicines related to fever, cough, etc., from chemists. The chemists have already been asked to keep a register of such purchasers. Such lists will be sent regularly to the control room for follow up. The nodal officer has also directed that all the symptomatic cases, if they turn out negative in rapid antigen test, should be tested subsequently with the RT-PCR test,” he added.The nodal officer said that he will be in the district for a couple of days and will inspect healthcare facilities and take up further review of surveillance activities and other Covid-related processes.According to official records, the Ghaziabad district undertook 2,82,512 samples till September 23 and 1,62,971 of these include tests conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits. The district at present has a test positivity rate of 4.58%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-to-ramp-up-daily-testing-to-6-000-strictly-monitor-containment-zones-says-nodal-officer/story-aF3Ao0eezjlsHBOCQuxh4K.html
24-09-2020||City||To curb air pollution, UPPCB directs construction sites to self-audit, install cameras||The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB), in accordance with the directions of the state-level air quality monitoring committee, has directed construction sites in some cities in the state self-audit dust control measures and install cameras at the site; the control of the CCTVs is to be given to the board. The UPPCB’s directions are for 16 non-attainment cities in the state, including Ghaziabad, which see high levels of air pollution. Firms who are running construction sites are required to complete the self-audit after assessment and provide control of the cameras to UPPCB by October 10.“The self-audit and providing control of cameras to the board will be mandatory for sites which are 20,000 square metres (sqm) in size or more. Further, projects which are less than 20,000 sqm but require consent to operate from UPPCB will also be brought under these measures. Once the audit documents are submitted, UPPCB will conduct an inspection of the site. In case there is a violation of any condition filled up in the self-assessment, a penalty will be imposed,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The projects under this ambit will include builders’ projects, road construction projects such as the ones taken up by the National Highways Authority of India as well as infrastructure projects, among others.Officials said they have not defined how many cameras should be installed at the site but any number, with the help of which the entire site can be monitored, are to be installed.“We are planning a state-level monitoring centre to keep a tab on the sites via these cameras but a plan for a district-level control room is also being chalked out,” Sharma added.Under the self-audit, firms taking up construction have to fill up details related of the following: environmental clearance; status of usage of treated water for dust emission; status of consent to operate for ready mix and hot mix plants; status of dust suppression measures; status of PUC certificates for vehicles used for transportation of material; maintaining adequate stack height for DG sets and ensuring collection, segregation and disposal of construction and debris waste.Builders’ associations said they were happy with the move. Gaurav Gupta, president – Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI - Ghaziabad) said: “It is a welcome step in controlling air pollution but we need more time to ensure compliances. As per directions last year, our members have already installed anti-smog guns which have helped a lot in suppressing dust emission. We will also request authorities to scale down the number of directions which have been issued time-to-time. Otherwise, it becomes time consuming.” Ghaziabad city in 2019 has topped the list of the most polluted cities in the country on several occasions last year.According to UPPCB records, the city in 2019 saw the air quality levels (AQI) spike to ‘severe’ category for 31 days. For another 67 days in 2019, AQI was recorded under the ‘poor’ category. On September 19, Bhure Lal – the chairperson of the Environment Pollution (prevention and control) Authority (EPCA) – had come to Ghaziabad for an inspection and directed officials here to control fugitive dust, roadside parking and burning of solid and plastic waste, besides a parking plan to prevent roadside parking of vehicles.Environmentalists, on the other hand, felt there have been several directions issued in the past but they are useful only if strict monitoring and action are ensured.“A regular submission of an action-taken report with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) should also be ensured. Otherwise, there will be no effect on the ground,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.Officials meanwhile said they have also planned to levy environmental compensation costs in accordance with the July 20, 2016 order of the National Green Tribunal in case sites are found violating dust emission norms.The NGT had order clarified that the environment compensation would be ₹10,000 for sites up to 100 sqm; ₹20,000 for sites between 100 and 200 sqm; ₹30,000 for sites between 200 and 500 sqm; ₹50,000 for sites more than 500 sqm, and ₹5 lakh for sites of more than 20,000 sqm of area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-curb-air-pollution-uppcb-directs-construction-sites-to-self-audit-install-cameras/story-kouvmJ3QanmflYzTTH198H.html

The Centre is trying to destroy farmers with these bills and Congress had given consent for the same during the meeting of the high-powered committee.

This is a very simple, doable, and practical technique, for preventing stubble burning and the resultant pollution,” said Kejriwal.“This is the result of many years of hard work and efforts of our scientists, and they have got the validation after pilot testing and projection. They have also given their technique a licence for commercial exploitation,” the chief minister said.The technology, called Pusa Decomposer, involves making a liquid formulation using fermented farm inputs, and then spraying it over fields to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of crop stubble. The formulation also acts as a fertiliser, the government said in a press statement.On Wednesday, the chief minister had asked the development department in the city government to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the technology. He had also directed the department to explore the possibility of using the technology at farms on Delhi’s peripheries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-to-discuss-new-tech-to-decompose-stubble-with-javadekar/story-ijq1JqRHaRa7dAcA95aOSL.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||DJB to appoint pvt operators to manage water, sewer in different city zones||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Thursday announced that for efficient management of water supply and sewerage network, it has approved a ‘One Zone-One Operator’ policy, under which the city will be divided into 7-8 zones and a private operator will be appointed to look into the works in each zone. The decision was taken in a board meeting presided over by Delhi water minister and DJB chairman Satyendar Jain. “After extensive discussions and deliberations at various levels to improve the services and bring efficient management in the water supply and sewerage system, it was decided to award the contracts to private operators for operation, maintenance and management of water supply and sewerage networks in various zones of Delhi on the lines of ‘One Zone-One Operator’,” said a statement issued by the DJB. “The operators will be appointed for a period of 10 years under the scheme on a contract basis,” it said. Ankit Srivastava, DJB technical advisor, explained that the services are not being privatised and no layoffs will be done within the water utility. Senior officials said the powers of monitoring and supervision will rest with the DJB. “Even at present the work was being done by a number of smaller private contractors for which multiple tenders had to be floated. The division is being done to increase efficiency and fix accountability of the operators, who will be solely responsible for each zone. For instance, plugging leakages, inspecting of pipelines, maintenance and management works. This is being done to achieve the two targets ---- ensure 24X7 water supply and improve sewerage network to clean up the Yamuna,” said Srivastava. The board also decided that all houses would be provided sewer connections in any area where sewerage network would be laid by DJB. “This has been decided to ensure that all houses have sewer connections. So far a large number of households in many areas including unauthorised colonies are without sewer connections, which is one of the reasons behind pollution of the Yamuna,” said Srivastava. Also, from now only online applications would be accepted for new water/sewer connection. For those, who cannot do so may seek help of the ‘Mobile Sahayak’ under the doorstep delivery of public services, by calling 1076.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/djb-to-appoint-pvt-operators-to-manage-water-sewer-in-different-city-zones/story-QEJIm5wDhXB0cFBb7nfkPJ.html

24-09-2020||Delhi||Parents accuse many private schools of overcharging, denying online classes||Despite the Delhi government explicitly asking private schools not to collect anything more than the tuition fee from students, several schools are allegedly collecting fee under other components and denying students access to online classes on non-receipt of the amount, several parents have said. The Delhi Parents Association has compiled names of at least 76 private schools that are violating the government order. Aprajita Gautam, president of the association, said parents will call for a hunger strike soon if the matter is not resolved. “We had written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on September 17, demanding strict action against these schools. However, we are yet to get a response. The government should take these complaints seriously and find a solution at the earliest,” she said. An official from the education department said, “Strict action will be taken against schools violating the government order. No student can be barred from online classes for any reason.” The directorate of education (DoE), on August 30, had directed all private schools in Delhi to charge only the tuition fees during the current Covid-19 crisis. The directorate also ordered schools not to refuse access to online classes to any student, irrespective of whether the parent was able to pay the tuition fee or not. But parents of children who study at a prominent school in Dwarka alleged that the school had been demanding annual charges and fee under “other charges”; and it had allegedly warned parents of “action” if they did not pay by September 25. The father of a class 6 student said, “The school had discontinued online classes for my child for three weeks in July over a delay in fee payment. We paid the fee in August and my child’s classes resumed. Now, the school has sent a reminder asking for tuition fee and annual fee by September 25. I am worried that my child’s classes will be discontinued again.” The school’s lawyer, said, “The school has moved the Delhi high court, challenging the Delhi government’s order to charge only tuition fee. The matter is subjudice and will be next heard by the court on October 9. The school will not bar any student from online classes.”The matter had come before the high court on September 17 and the court had sought a response from the Delhi government.DoE officials denied comment saying the matter is subjudice. The father of a class 2 student of a East Delhi school, said, “Despite paying the tuition fee till June, the school discontinued online classes for my son on Thursday. They asked me to give a date by which I would be able to submit the pending fee. I do not know what to do as my shoe business has taken a hit.”  “The classes have been discontinued only for those who have not been paying the fee since the last academic session. Parents with financial problems are welcome to discuss their issues with us,” the east Delhi scool principal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parents-accuse-many-private-schools-of-overcharging-denying-online-classes/story-Ri7xtI9gIwcbhACOjgShkO.html

Raj Kumar, who hails from Samastipur village in Bihar, said, “I along with my five family members reached the station at 12.30 pm to board a train to Jaynagar at 2.35 pm. However, I was told at the entry point that all trains have been cancelled for three days. I was not aware of the cancellation and had to return home. I am working here as a labourer and decided to move to my hometown for a few days. Due to the pandemic, I was not able to go to my hometown earlier.”Another passenger, Shamu Shah from Jharkhand, who works here as fruit seller, said, “I booked the tickets last week to return to my hometown but when I reached the station, the cops did not allow me to enter. If farmers want to protest then they must go to Delhi to raise their issues, but their rail roko protest in Punjab has left many passengers in a fix. The government must intervene as the rail roko agitation will not resolve their issues.” Station director, Tarun Kumar said, “All the 14 pair of special trains were cancelled but the goods trains are running to ensure transportation of essential supplies. The passenger train services will remain suspended till September 26 as per the directions from the railways’ Ferozepur division.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rail-roko-agitation-passengers-suffer-as-14-special-trains-cancelled/story-b1yRVyWqRjHhrURGlwxHoI.html

May his soul rest in peace,” he tweeted.A police officer said Singh was residing with his family at Aloochi Bagh in Srinagar and was provided with two personal security officers (PSOs). However, on Wednesday he went to his ancestral house without his PSOs and didn’t give any information to the police about his visit.“Condemn the dastardly killing of BDC member. Violence will get us nowhere,” said the president of the Peoples’ Conference, Sajad Lone.The police said they have registered a case and started the investigation to establish the full circumstances of the crime.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader from central Kashmir, Nazir Khan was saddened owing to his personal association with Singh.“During his stint as BDC Khag, Bhupinder Ji ushered a new era of developmental works in the block. His killing has a lot to do with the existence of political crisis Kashmir has caught itself in. Bhupinder Ji, you will be missed. Rest in peace,” Khan said.“Deeply anguished by the news of the brutal assassination… Not a day goes by when Kashmiri blood is not spilt.

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Teenager’s ordeal: Brother, high on drugs, raped her last year||A 15-year-old who was recently found to be eight months pregnant after being allegedly raped by her brother and a friend is in trauma, but her counselling process has begun. Her ordeal began when her brother, high on drugs, assaulted her.In her statement to the police, the Class 9 student said she was sexually exploited by her brother, the sole earning member of the family, in December 2019. Later in January 2020, his friend, who visited her home regularly, sexually abused her. He told the girl that he was also a Class 9 student.Even as the two raped her, the victim could not complain against them as her mother was visually impaired and her elder sister had left home after getting married in January this year. The teenager is at present being counselled by people running the 181 helpline services run by the UT administration’s Chandigarh Child and Women Development Corporation under the aegis of social welfare department.The focus currently is on her mental and physical well-being. “Moving the child to a shelter home was important for her well- being considering the fact that her violator is her brother,” said a senior officer not wishing to be named. The victim, who had initially refused to go to the shelter home, agreed to do so after counselling. She will be quarantined there for the next 15 days as a precautionary measure due to the Covid-19 outbreak before being moved to a children’s home. A case under section 376 (3) of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered at the Sarangpur police station on the complaint of her elder sister. Request for financial aidAs the only earning member of the victim’s family has been arrested, a request has been sent to the district legal services authority to grant financial help to her. She is likely to be granted compensation under the victim compensation scheme. The victim has also been medically examined and administered medication to ensure safe delivery as termination of pregnancy at this advanced stage is not possible. As the teenager has indicated that she is not willing to keep the child, he or she will be put up for adoption after birth.Brother in prison, other accused still at large The police on Wednesday night arrested the victim’s brother, who was sent to judicial custody. He denied raping the victim during preliminary questioning. The police have yet to identify the other accused even as the search to nab him is continuing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/teenager-s-ordeal-brother-high-on-drugs-raped-her-last-year/story-f7ovNVSRoaTCguhLVrt11O.html

24-09-2020||Patna||Report red-flags air pollution level in Gaya, Muzaffarpur||The rising air pollution levels require immediate mitigation measures and future infrastructure and growth for the city should be planned only after evaluating the impacts and consequences of the potential environmental damage, says the ‘Gaya and Muzaffarpur Clean Air Action Plan (GCAAP) reports’ released by the Centre for Environment Energy and Climate Change (CEECC), a Bengaluru-based technology-policy think tank. The holy city of Gaya, which attracts lakhs of tourists during normal times every year to the Mahabodhi Temple, a UNESCO world heritage site, and ancient Vishnupad temple, has been placed among the five worst polluted cities in the world in terms of particulate matter (PM), as per a 2018 World Health Organisation (WHO) report. The CEECC report, released on Wednesday by deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi at the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) in Patna, says the major sources contributing to the deteriorating air quality of Gaya city are transportation, brick kilns, and dust emission from road re-suspension. Emission from transportation sector was found to be the most, contributing to 42% of the total PM2.5 emission load. It is estimated to increase by 95% by 2030 from the baseline emissions (2018). It has recommended promoting the use of electric/CNG vehicles and incentivising the installation of diesel particulate filters (DPF) as few of the measures to reduce pollution levels in Gaya. Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) is also planning to set up 24 air monitoring stations in 23 districts of the state in an effort to achieve time-bound air quality management. Transport emission was followed by dust (including road dust and construction dust), domestic (including heating, cooking, and lighting), and brick kilns contributing 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively, in 2030. It has estimated that the city would generate around 300 tonnes per day (TPD) of solid waste by 2030. Gaya would need an additional 120 TPD of composting plants and 35 TPD dry-waste collection centres for proper waste management by 2030. The Gaya municipality would require at least Rs 28 crore (capital cost) for installing these plants. Another report was also released on Muzaffarpur, one of the 20 most polluted cities in the world (WHO, 2019) in terms of particulate matters (PMs) and has also been identified as one of the non-attainment cities under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). Heavy industries, including power plants, and transportation sector were found to be the biggest contributors, accounting of 34% and 24% respectively. Sharing concerns over the deteriorating air quality of Gaya and Muzaffarpur, Dipak Kumar Singh, principal secretary, department of environment, forest and climate change, said that a state level committee has been constituted by the government to implement the control measures suggested in the report. “The department is planning to plant trees along the roads instead of end to end pavement construction as one important measure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/report-red-flags-air-pollution-level-in-gaya-muzaffarpur/story-RSHRW10MLwSKXYQZNSET2H.html
24-09-2020||City||Power generation trials begin at waste-to-energy plant in Shimla||SHIMLA Trials to produce electricity from garbage generated by residents here has started at the solid waste management plant at Bhariyal, located on the outskirts of Shimla.Around two-kilowatt power is being produced during the trials every day. The waste-to-energy plant has the capacity to generate two megawatts electricity daily.Due to the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, electricity production for commercial use was delayed. However, the Shimla municipal corporation (MC) has claimed that the required power will be produced as soon as the plant gets fully commissioned.The MC has entrusted a private company with the task of running the solid waste management plant. But the private firm is yet to get some machines from abroad, and only after they do will the plant be able to generate power to its full capacity.Plant supervisor DP Singh said preparations are underway to start the commercial production of electricity, which will be fully started as soon as the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.Around 70 to 80 tonnes of garbage is generated daily by the households of Shimla. However, the plant would require 100 tonnes of daily waste to generate electricity for the city. To fulfil this requirement, the MC has made arrangements to source garbage from the panchayats adjacent to Shimla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/power-generation-trials-begin-at-waste-to-energy-plant-in-shimla/story-upc3oYBjFtZ0xiFnKqMkdN.html

Now,for 34-year-old Sardar Singh, life is as disciplined as before, but since he hung up his (sports) boots the stick has been replaced by weapons and strategising is done to net criminals, not goals.Undergoing police training at the Haryana Police Academy in Madhuban, Sardar Singh’s morning starts with parade and physical training drills followed by classes in weapons handling and operations, investigation theory and law. Special instructions are given to cadets by top policemen narrating their experiences in handling critical situations. In the current situation, new lessons in handling the Covid-19 lockdown and “unlock” situations are also imparted. However, things have come to a halt for a brief while, again due to Covid-19, as the sportsman and winner of Arjuna and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awards, currently training as deputy superintendent of police (DSP), has tested positive for Covid-19.Isolating at home in Panchkula, Sardar Singh says: “There have been Covid-19 cases in Madhuban, outdoor training is discontinued for the last few days. All seven DSP trainees in my batch were tested and two, including me, were found positive. Being part of the police force, in the recent past, we have had numerous discussions on the outbreak so I am not psychologically impacted by the news.”Fortunately, though he does not have any symptoms, Sardar Singh is self isolating at home according to health protocols and will rejoin the academy once he recovers.The transition from sports gear to khaki, he says, has been easy. “Police training has again put me back in the schedule of my playing days. In Madhuban we have to get out of bed at 4.30am for parade, followed by two sessions of PT drills.”Sitting in class used to be ‘tough’The toughest challenge for the veteran of over 300 international matches is to sit in a classroom for theoretical sessions. “It’s almost after a gap of 14 to 15 years that I am back in the classroom culture. Because it’s police training you can’t afford to take anything lightly, so I had no other choice. Initially, I found it tough to sit still in class but later, when we got to investigation theories and weapons my interest levels peaked.”Grateful to the ustads (teachers) for being tough but supportive, Sardar Singh says, “At times, whenever I get stuck and have issues related to the technicalities of the training, they (teachers) do a lot of hand-holding.” Grateful for support When asked if he’s getting special treatment being the sports star that he is, Sardar Singh replies, “Once you are in the police academy, everyone is treated at par. But I am thankful to the director of the academy, Inspector General Yoginder Singh Nehra, who is always there to support us and listen to our queries.” The two-time Olympian was recruited as a DSP in the Haryana police force under the sports quota in 2008 but could not undergo the mandatory one-year training. Last year, after announcing his retirement, he joined police training, taking a couple of months off in between to play in the professional league in Canada. “My training is in its final phases and after that we will undergo three months of field training at a police station. Let’s hope I am able to contribute similarly to the police services as I have done in the sports field,” he signs off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/netting-criminals-not-goals-former-hockey-skipper-gets-set-for-new-innings-but-covid-holds-him-up/story-HXoHmpgPCLohawcn0uqEFO.html

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Polls to be held for vacant sarpanch, panch seats in J-K||The Jammu and Kashmir administrative council has given the go-ahead for elections to vacant sarpanch and panch constituencies in the union territory (UT).The council, which met on Wednesday evening under the chairmanship of lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha, approved the proposal of the department of rural development and panchayati raj to issue a notification for holding the elections. “The detailed schedule will be finalised by the election authority,” the official spokesman said, adding that filling of the vacant constitutional posts will ensure devolution of powers and proper grassroots planning in the third tier of the local self-government. He said that the elections will enable non-functional panchayats to start working.Earlier, general elections to 39,521 sarpanch and panch constituencies were conducted in 2018, of which 13,257 positions fell vacant due to resignations, removal or elections of sarpanches as block development council chairpersons, death, and non-availability of candidates at the time of elections. Among these 1,089 vacancies are for the offices of sarpanches and while 12,168 are for panches. More than 504 panches have resigned since the 2018 polls for various reasons, the maximum from south Kashmir’s Anantnag with 129 resignations, followed by central Kashmir’s Budgam district with 81 and in Baramulla and Kupwara districts with 67 and 61 resignations, respectively. Twelve sarpanches who resigned after getting elected include one each in Anantnag and Baramulla districts; five in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district and one each in Baramulla, Budgam and Bandipore districts of Kashmir. Five panchayat members were killed by militants in the last one year and many panchayat members have been moved to high-security zones after security forces received inputs that they were on the radar of militants.Since the 2018 polls, more than 504 panches have resigned over different reasons. The highest number of resignations came from south Kashmir’s Anantnag with 129 resignations, followed by central Kashmir’s Budgam district with 81 while in Baramulla and Kupwara districts 67 and 61 panches submitted their resignations. Prominent mainstream political parties, National Conference and Congress, didn’t participate in the last panchayat polls. The J-K government had earlier framed an apex level and two divisional level committees to conduct preparatory work for by-elections for panchayats and BDCs in two divisions of the UT.The elections, earlier planned for March, were deferred on the day when militants killed block development chairman Bupinder Singh at central Kashmir’s Khag area. Singh was without security and had not informed the station house officer of the Khag police station when he went to Dalwash village where he was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/polls-to-be-held-for-vacant-sarpanch-panch-seats-in-j-k/story-3lzDgvvGCx2eFkvQHD4B7N.html
24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Hours after Rohtak assistant professor’s body found in car, wife allegedly commits suicide with daughter||An 11-year-old girl survived while her sister died after their mother allegedly pushed them into a water tank before jumping into it in Rohtak hours after the body of the father of the siblings was found in a car after apparently dying by suicide, the Haryana police said. The three left their home immediately after learning about the recovery of the body, they added.The 11-year-old informed residents of the area near the tank, who took out the bodies of the 33-year-old woman and her other daughter from the tank. The body of her father, a 35-year-old assistant professor at a Rohtak college, was found along the Jhajjar-Rohtak road a day after he had left for Gurugram. The police said they have recovered empty pouches of agricultural pesticide celphos from the car, which suggests the professor may have consumed them and died by suicide. A note recovered from his car did not mention any reasons for it nor blamed anyone.Rohtak Urban Estate police station in-charge Shamsher Singh said the bodies of the woman, who was a teacher, and her daughter have been recovered from the water tank. He cited the preliminary investigation and said it seems the woman died by suicide along with one of her daughters as she could not bear the news of her husband’s death.Singh said the bodies have been sent for post-mortem and they would be able to comment further only after they get autopsy reports. The investigation is going on, he added.Rohtak deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sajjan Singh said as per preliminary investigation the assistant professor was depressed because of a family dispute and the death of his brother a few months ago. He did not mention the reasons for the dispute in his suicide note. The assistant professor resided in government quarters on campus with his wife and daughters.The DSP said, “The 11-year-old girl, who survived the incident, was very brave. Not only did she manage to get out of water but she made her way through mud and climbed over a wall to seek help for her mother and sister.”He added that the girl’s grandparents were looking after her.

BTS has been the talk of town among K-Pop lovers since the results for the virtual K-Pop have been announced recently. In vocal, Chanchui Khayi from Delhi has bagged the first position while Xeo Pachuau from Aizwal has scored the first place in the dance category. Although this is for the first time when the K-Pop competition was organised virtually across various parts of the country 1,348 K-Pop fans from India participated overall and the finale saw a selected 36 performances. And on the day of the finale, BTS shared a video message for the participants, and their Indian fans. The band said, “We heard online contests were held in 18 regions around India for this grand finale. As K-Pop artistes, BTS is very proud that such a great event is being held even though things are tough around the world. We want to say thank you so much to everyone in India who loves K-Pop.

Chanchui Khayi from Delhi, who won the finale, says, “I was quite thrilled and nervous at first because you never know what to expect in the digital realm, and the virtual audience. However, the organisers did their best in making things simple and clear, and the message from BTS was an icing on the cake! It was an exceptionally wonderful encouragement for all of us. I believe this is just the start for an amazing feat to happen in India and the K-wave. BTS has undoubtedly made it bigger and possible. They are exemplary in influencing not only Armies but everyone else watching around the world. I believe it’s something we can all see and learn to grow oneself.” Another participant, Vicky Singh from Delhi, says, “Receiving a congratulatory message from worldwide famous stars BTS was a really great feeling. Among their busy schedule of promoting their new single Dynamite, they took out time to wish us; that was really amazing. We also aspire to become great artistes in the near future, and their words definitely motivated me a lot. Thank you BTS! If there’s one thing I’ve learnt in this journey, it is that I shouldn’t ever give up and keep pushing.

The machines, bought for Rs 22,500 each, were expected to be installed at strategic locations inside the ward to facilitate residents sanitising hands once they step out of the house to the market or the public toilets.Residents and civic activists alleged that the machines were slated to be stationed in the ward area a month ago.Chandrakant Hase, an area resident, said, “The sanitising machines are lying unattended . The PMC must install it soon amid the pandemic for the safety of residents.”Sapna Sahare, junior engineer, Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori regional ward said, “The installation of the sanitising machines has been delayed due to delay in the release of the work order and its approval. The process of machine installation is on and we will complete the work at the earliest.”“The machines will be installed at places where there is a need and also taking the COVID situation into consideration,” she said.Former Mayor Siddhartha Dhende said, “ The machines should have been installed long ago, but there is some issue over who will look after maintenance and upkeep. As installation has been delayed, the machines are lying unutilised.”Balu Patil, an activist of Sahakarnagar, had called for an audit of the machine installation work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/20-sanitiser-dispensers-lying-uninstalled-at-yerawada-vishrantwadi-ward-garden-in-pune/story-6ZOLIFI8jbbBs2nNdHZDTM.html
24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Back in Punjab, Badals credit Shiromani Akali Dal with making farm bills a national debate||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said that the Akali leadership should be credited with making farmers’ rights a national debate by quitting the Narendra Modi cabinet and raising voices against the farm bills in Parliament. Addressing party supporters at Takht Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo, Badal said: “Recent Indian political history has no example where an ally of a Union government has quit a ministerial position for farmers’ rights.” “I had reiterated several times that the SAD would not hesitate to make any sacrifice if the farming community’s interest is compromised. (Bathinda Lok Sabha MP) Harsimrat Kaur Badal and I spoke bluntly against the farm bills in Parliament. As Akali leaders raised the concerns and reservations of farmers boldly in front of (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, they brought the attention of the entire nation towards a sensitive issue touching the lives of farmers,” said Badal, who represents Ferozepur in the Lok Sabha. Badal and his wife Harsimrat returned to Punjab for the first time after she quit as Union food processing industry minister to protest the passage of the farm bills last week. The couple paid obeisance at the shrine, associated with the visit of the 10th Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh. A large number of Akali workers had gathered at the historic gurdwara’s Diwan Hall to listen to their leaders, throwing Covid-19 guidelines to the wind. SEED SOWN BY CONGRESS: SUKHBIR The Badals targeted their regional political foes, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party in their respective speeches. Sukhbir Singh Badal said that the Congress had in its 2017 assembly poll and 2019 general election manifestoes promised to repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and make trade in agricultural produce, including export and inter-state trade, free of all restrictions. “Modi only followed but the seeds of these anti-farmer ideas were first mooted by the Congress leadership,” he said. Appealing to farmers’ cell of the SAD to rope in arthiyas (commission agents) and farm labourers in the ongoing agitation, Badal said that he will lead protest marches against Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and the central government from various districts to Chandigarh on October 1. “Amarinder should hold a special assembly session immediately to revoke the amended APMC Act of 2017 in Punjab,” he said. AMARINDER WAS CONSULTED, GAVE APPROVAL: HARSIMRAT Harsimrat said that Capt Amarinder Singh was among the seven chief ministers who had first started discussing the three farm bills with the Centre in August last year, “but he never expressed any resentment on the issue”. She showed documents to the gathering, claiming they were official papers that revealed the Punjab government had given its approval to the bills. “I had written three dissent notes, detailing issues, when the cabinet members were asked for their views in the third week of May. Whenever a central government plans a new bill, it is first discussed with the CMs and top state officials and the matter is tabled before the cabinet much later. Capt Amarinder Singh stands exposed,” she said. Unlike the ‘consent’ papers of the Punjab CM, Harsimrat did not produce anything to buttress her ‘dissent’ noting claim on the bills. “Anyone can get it through right to information (RTI),” she said from the stage. DODGE AAP PROTESTERS IN TALWANDI SABO Earlier, SAD’s political opponents had gathered near the gurdwara to show the Badals black flags but they did not get a chance do so as the Akali leaders opted to take an alternative road route. Wearing black aprons, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators Baljinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur were camping near Khanda Chowk at Talwandi Sabo. Baljinder Kaur said the Akalis have hurt the feelings of the farmers by being part of the NDA government that had passed the farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/back-in-punjab-badals-credit-shiromani-akali-dal-with-making-farm-bills-a-national-debate/story-BwQyZfprgPahaAYuBxZx8N.html

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||No option but to burn stubble, say farmers as doctors worry about Covid||Doctors fighting the Covid-19 pandemic are worried as farmers, with the onset of paddy harvesting, appear to be intent on burning stubble to clear their fields and the resultant pollution is likely to affect patients as the virus mostly attacks the lungs.Burning of paddy residue after harvesting has over the years attracted much criticism because it impacts air quality, spreading to cities in north India, especially Capital Delhi, creating conditions hazardous to health.As farmer unions say they will not dispose of paddy by any other means but by burning it unless the government incentivises stubble management, doctors worry about the pollution.“If pollution trends are similar to the last few years this can be a problem for Covid-19 patients, even for those who have recovered. Covid-19 impairs functioning of the lungs and breathing in smog will increase risks,” says a doctor who wishes to remain anonymous. Dr Vishal Chopra, a professor of pulmonary medicine at the Government Rajindra Medical College, Patiala, who is also managing Covid-19 patients, says people must be extra cautious. “Those suffering from ailments of heart and lungs should be careful. Exposure to smog will create problems. Patient load likely to increaseDr Rajesh Sharma, who works in rural areas, says with each year the number of patients with chest and eye problems is increasing. With medical facilities under pressure due to Covid-19, stubble burning is likely to increase the patient load those with chest ailments, including lung and breathing problems, will need medical care. He appeals to farmers to desist from the practise.Farmer leaders say they are aware of the problem as they and their families also face health issues, but lack of resources to manage stubble has left them helpless.“We too face problems and health issues and we live in farms in the fields, but we have no resources to manage it (stubble). The government must give us Rs 200 per quintal as handling charges of paddy straw,” says Jagmohan Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).Meanwhile, with the onset of the harvesting season the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre has recorded 61 incidents of fire since September 20. A maximum of 55 incidents were recorded in Amritsar, three each were reported from Tarn Taran and Mohali and one from Jalandhar.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had last week blamed the Centre for not announcing incentives to handle stubble. Also, chief secretary Vini Mahajan had directed all the deputy commissioners to ensure zero tolerance for paddy straw burning in view of the NGT guidelines.

24-09-2020||Pune||Fear of flash floods still haunts residents of Tangewala colony in Pune||On Friday, it will be a year since the flash floods struck the city on September 25, but the victims who are still picking up pieces of life have not been able to stabilise themselves. The flash floods of 2019 claimed 26 lives in Pune. For residents of Tangewala colony in Sahakarnagar, the flash floods were a nightmare as seven people from the colony lost their lives.Fears of flooding were back among residents with the city witnessing heavy rainfall over the past few days. With the rising water levels in the area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) sent a notice on September 13 to all the 85 houses of the colony to evacuate the premises.So far the Pune district has received 154.9 mm of rain, 56.2 mm more than the normal average (98.7mm).However, the residents say since the flash floods, nothing has improved in the area. “We are living under constant fear over the last two weeks as the water level has climbed up high and at night we had to run out of our houses. As we don’t have any other option, we have to stay here. The government and PMC had promised us that they will give us new houses and also build a safety retaining wall near Ambil Odha, but nothing has happened over the past year and we are staring at floods again,” said Sunil Shinde, a resident of Tangewala colony. Tangewala colony is located behind Gangatirtha society in Sahakarnagar. There is a canal located behind the society and it has 125 slums in close proximity to each other. Last year the flash floods occurred right before the state assembly elections and all political parties tried to take advantage of the situation by dolling out lofty promises to the residents of the area, including giving them compensation, repairing and restoring the Ambil Odha, among others. However, on ground, things remain the same. The Pune Municipal Corporation and district collectorate helped the flood victims by giving them compensation. The PMC also allotted Rs 300 crore for the repair of the Ambil Odha, which is yet to be completed. Another resident Nanda Kailash Shinde, whose entire house collapsed in the flash floods, said, “Our entire house was damaged in the floods and we had to rebuilt it. It cost us Rs 2.5 lakh. Also, all our important documents were damaged due to the water and we have not been able to get any help from the PMC or the state government. We are worried about the future of our children and so, PMC should at least give us proper homes for safety.” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, said, “We are taking all the necessary measures for the safety of citizens who had been affected due to flash floods last year. I have personally visited the areas over the past week. We are currently working on their rehabilitation project.”Revisiting the horrorOne hundred mm of rain in two hours in September 2019 set the Ambil Odha up to burst its banks and overflow. 2.5 lakh- People affected by floods and 800 animals killed, including cattle in local dairies. Also, 2,700- Vehicles on the roads and parking lots were found submerged in the waterlogged areas of south Pune in localities such as Katraj, Bibvewadi, Padmavati and Sahakarnagar.What was promised- On ground situationA private firm surveyed the stream and identified 77 illegal structures along the stream which aggravated the floods- Illegal structures still stand.

Following this, it was decided to refurbish the old museum with new features and attractions.Patna Museum redevelopment plan has been set in motion and is expected to be ready in a couple of years.The Patna Museum belongs to the British age and is the oldest museum in Bihar and Odisha. After Bihar’s separation from Bengal in 1912, some academicians and archaeologists planned a museum to conserve the antiquities discovered in and around the city at that time and in 1915.A makeshift museum was set up at the then Patna commissioner’s bungalow in the city which is now the AN Sinha research institute. Later, this collection was shifted to the Patna high court building, and in 1917 the Patna Museum was planned at its present site at Budh Marg on the Patna- Gaya road.Designed in Mughal- Rajput architecture, the Patna Museum once had over 50,000 antiquities in its collections.Also Read: Former Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey hints at joining politics“But the majority of its collections have remained at its storage points.

24-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand’s labour and industrial law changes termed anti-worker by Congress||The Uttarakhand assembly passed 18 amendment bills including five for labour and industrial reforms and one for amendment in Char-Dham Devasthanam Management Act, amid pandemonium by opposition Congress MLAs during the one-day session on Wednesday in Dehradun. The session, curtailed to one day from three days schedule, decided earlier, was attended by 42 MLAs, while 14 MLAs attended the proceedings through virtual platforms in the 71-member House. All the bills were tabled and passed on the same day with the session having no Question Hour. Among the bills passed by the House, five were related to labour and industrial reforms in the state aimed to increase the ease of doing business.In one of the bills pertaining to labour reforms, named The Trade Unions (Uttarakhand Amendment) Bill, 2020, an amendment was passed, which said --- “no such (labour) union will be registered unless 30% of the workmen engaged or employed in the establishment or industry are the members of such trade union on the date of making the application for registration.” The earlier required percentage of workmen was 10% or hundred in number, whichever was less. According to another bill named The Payment of Bonus (Uttarakhand Amendment) Bill 2020, ‘every employer in respect of the accounting year shall be bound to pay a minimum bonus to every employee in that accounting year in which the employer has any allocated (money) surplus.’ It was also passed.As per the bill named The Industrial Disputes (Uttarakhand Amendment) Bill, 2020 passed by the house, the government can exempt any new industrial establishment or new undertaking from all or any of the provisions of the Act for a period of 1,000 days from the date of the establishment of such new industrial unit conditionally or unconditionally by notification in the official Gazette. The trade unions, Opposition Congress and experts, however, termed the bills passed as “anti-labour” which, they claimed will affect their social security. Also Read: Uttarakhand assembly session: Congress, AAP protest over ‘anti-farmer policies’ Daljeet Singh, president of a labour union of a manufacturing company in Pantnagar area of Kumaon compared the bills with laws of British Raj. “These are equivalent to those during the British Raj which were meant to exploit the labourers. We strongly condemn these and will soon hit the roads against this pro-capitalist government in the state,” said Singh. Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin, who was present inside the House said, “The bills passed in the name of labour reforms and in favour of ease of doing business, are actually anti-labour and pro-industry.” “Toeing the line of BJP led NDA government at the Centre, the state government here is bringing such laws to suppress the labour class and promote crony capitalism. We have been against such moves and will continue to protest against them,” he said. Legal expert Dushyant Mainali said the “bills will majorly affect the social security of the labourers”. “These Labour Laws or Industrial Disputes Act provides a platform to the labour and marginalised class to fight for their rights. But these bills seem to deprive them of that and impact their social security. This will also impact their productivity at work when they will come to know that their job is not secure,” said Mainali. The House also passed an amendment in the Char-Dham Devasthanam Management Act through a bill named Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Under the amendment, the Char Dham devasthanam management board may ‘acquire land in or around the vicinity of the religious devasthanams and other places it would deem proper for its better development in favour of Char-Dham.’ Also Read: Uttarakhand HC directs govt to form monitoring panels to contain Covid-19The House also passed some other bills regarding amendment in the Epidemic Diseases Act and deduction of salaries and other allowances of the members of state Assembly for which it had earlier passed ordinances during the lockdown. Through the amendment in The Epidemic Diseases Act, the government has made violations of Covid-19 provisions a punishable offence with imprisonment up to six months or a fine of ₹ 5,000 or both. The offences will, however, be cognizable and bailable. The amendment bill related to deduction of 30% of salary and other benefits of the members of state assembly was also passed following which the deduction has come into effect from April 1, 2020 till March 31, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-s-labour-and-industrial-law-changes-termed-anti-worker-by-congress/story-d4zrGYdEZ5fXTUylo9bKzM.html

24-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees driest September in 16 years||The national capital has recorded 20.9 millimetres (mm) of rainfall so far in September. This is the driest September for Delhi in 16 years, as per the data from India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to IMD scientists, no more rainfall is expected in September, as the monsoon is set to withdraw from Delhi by the end of this month. “Delhi recorded three days of rainfall on September 5, 6 and 8. No more rainfall is expected in September. This is mainly because the monsoon trough, which is an area of low pressure, has largely remained in the hilly regions in September. There was no low-pressure system or any disturbance to have induced rainfall,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. Also Read: Intense rainfall to continue over sub-Himalayan WB, Bihar and UP: IMDThe national capital’s average rainfall for September is around 129.8 mm.Safdarjung Observatory, which is taken as a representative for the national capital’s weather, recorded only three days of rainfall in September, measuring 20.9 mm. Earlier, the lowest September rainfall was recorded in 2004 when Delhi had received 3 mm of rainfall. In 2015, the city had recorded 22 mm of rainfall in the same month. While last year’s corresponding figure was 74 mm. Similarly, it was 58 mm, 158 mm and 237 mm of rainfall in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, as per the IMD data.

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||AAP, Congress activists hold protest at Takht Damdama Sahib as Badals return to Punjab||Ahead of the visit of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Bathinda Lok Sabha MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal to Takht Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo on Thursday afternoon, their political opponents gathered near the historic gurdwara. Wearing black aprons, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators Baljinder Kaur and Rupinder Kaur are camping near Khanda Chowk at Talwandi. Baljinder Kaur said the Akalis have hurt the feelings of the farmers by being party to the central government’s farm bills. “As the entire farming and trading community is up against the Centre on the bills, the Akalis indulged in political gains. They supported the bill openly but the widespread protest by farmers forced them to oppose the bills superficially. The Akalis are still partners of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and their dual political role has been exposed,” she said. Sukhbir and Harsimrat will return to Punjab for the first time after Parliament passed the agriculture bills last week. The SAD has announced a statewide chakka jam (road blockade) on September 25 to protest against the bills. While Akali supporters were present in large numbers at the Talwandi Sabo gurdwara, Congress activists gathered there too to oppose the SAD leaders. Several of them were carrying placards opposing the BJP and the Akalis for their “anti-farmer” stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-congress-activists-hold-protest-at-takht-damdama-sahib-as-badals-return-to-punjab/story-dOImpeoPthQ0ZrIR5xsUZJ.html

The 48-year-old was admitted to the state-run Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital on Wednesday, which is a dedicated Covid-19 facility. A senior official on Wednesday said that Sisodia was hospitalized as a precautionary measure since he was continuously having a little higher body temperature and his oxygen levels dropped slightly.  हल्का बुख़ार होने के बाद आज कोरोना टेस्ट क़राया था जिसकी रिपोर्ट पोज़िटिव आई है. मैंने स्वयं को एकांतवास में रख लिया है. फ़िलहाल बुख़ार या अन्य कोई परेशानी नहीं है मैं पूरी तरह ठीक हूँ. आप सब की दुआओं से जल्द ही पूर्ण स्वस्थ होकर काम पर लौटूँगा.“He is still in ICU since yesterday (Wednesday), but his condition is stable.

24-09-2020||City||Orissa high court turns down rape survivor’s plea for medical termination of 25-wk pregnancy||The Orissa high court (HC) has turned down the plea to abort the 25-week pregnancy of a mentally challenged rape survivor (22) because it violated the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. Also read: Bombay HC refuses permission to terminate pregnancy in case of correctable deformityEarlier this year, the Union Cabinet had cleared a long-pending change to the Act by raising the legally permissible limit for an abortion to 24 weeks from 20 weeks.A single-HC bench of justice Biswanath Rath said the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 applied to rape on minor, minor and mentally challenged, minor and physically challenged, unmarried major, married major, mentally challenged major and physically handicapped major.“In case there is no interest shown for continuing with the pregnancy, the local chief district medical officer (CDMO) should undertake its termination under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. In case, an interest for termination is not shown, then the police along with the CDMO would have to take care of both mother and child in the womb involving pre-birth and post-birth care for at least one year after the birth takes place,” the HC observed. “In case of termination of pregnancy, the CDMO should take a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sample of the child, which can be handed over to a court concerned via the investigating agency for requirement, if any, of a criminal trial. To maintain secrecy of her pregnancy and termination, the state will ensure, if necessary, to let the mother stay in custody of a woman rehabilitation centre until her delivery and convalescence,” the court further observed. The order came on a plea of the mother of the mentally challenged survivor to allow abortion of the 25-week foetus due to her mental incapacity. In August, the survivor’s mother had lodged a complaint with a local police station in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur district after she found the woman to be 16-week pregnant. She moved the HC in September, seeking permission to terminate her daughter’s pregnancy. “The pregnancy of the victim has been forced and it is contrary to her choice. The rape survivor has been forced not only to carry an unwanted pregnancy, but is also forced to give birth to the child against her will. She will carry a stigma and humiliation for the rest of her life for the offspring born as a result of the rape. The situation compelled the court to give protection to her and the child. The court took into account the affidavit of her mother agreeing to take responsibility provided there is direction on financial and medical assistance as well as extension of co-operation by Srirama Chandra Bhanja (SCB) Medical College & Hospital in Cuttack, the CDMO and Jagatsinghpur district administration to both the mother and the child,” the judge noted in his order.The HC held the state government responsible for the rape survivor’s sufferings. It directed the state government to pay an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to her within seven days of the judgement and another Rs 3 lakh in case she gives birth to a male child and Rs 5 lakh for delivery of a girl child to make sure that the latter does not suffer throughout her life. The compensation amount would be kept in fixed deposit in any nationalised bank, stated the court order.The HC said transport, medical and medicinal expenses, including accommodation of the survivor and her mother, would be the responsibility of Jagatsinghpur district administration. The education of the child would be the responsibility of the state, the order added.The HC pulled up the government officials for their negligence and observed that the unwanted pregnancy could have been avoided had they taken recourse to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 when the matter first came to light in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/orissa-high-court-turns-down-rape-survivor-s-plea-for-medical-termination-of-25-wk-pregnancy/story-sq5WmITC4uNdY9aik15RjO.html

24-09-2020||Mumbai||Nagpur: Bombay HC quashes FIR against eight Myanmar nationals booked for ‘Tablighi activities’||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Monday struck down offences registered against eight Myanmar Muslims accused of engaging in “Tablighi activities”.“Compelling the applicants to undergo a trial would cause grave injustice,” said a bench comprising justices VM Deshpande and Amit Borkar while striking down the FIR registered by the tehsil police station at Nagpur against the group that visited the city in March 2020, just before the imposition of the nationwide lockdown in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The bench was also of the opinion that “allowing the prosecution to continue would be nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court, especially because of lack of evidence supporting the charges levelled against the foreigners”.The tehsil police had booked them under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 14 (contravention of any provision, order or direction issued under the Act) of the Foreigners Act, Section 3 (disobeying any regulation or order made under the Act) of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1987 and Section 51 (refusing to comply with order issued by the Centre or State government) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Also Read: Maharashtra crosses 20K new cases mark after 2-day drop, Covid-19 case count 1,263,799All eight Myanmar nationals had moved the court to quash the FIR and the charge sheet filed against them.They were booked under Section 14 on the Foreigners Act primarily on the ground of violating two clauses the Visa Manual, which prohibits foreigners from engaging in preaching religious ideology or making religious speeches in India.The high court, however, found no material to support the accusation. It noted from witness statements that the foreigners only read the Quran and offered namaz at a local mosque. They did not even know Hindi and therefore there was no question of them of engaging any religious discourse or speech.The bench also found no material to support the charges under sections 269 and 270, as the Myanmar Muslims had undergone Covid-19 tests and their results were negative, despite which they were kept in isolation. “There is no material on record to prove that applicants had indulged in any act which was likely to spread Covid -19,” said the bench.With regard to Section 188 of the IPC, the bench said the police could not have applied the section on their own in the first place. Only the district collector, who issued lockdown orders at the local level or one of his subordinates could have lodged a complaint, that too, with the judicial magistrate concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nagpur-bombay-hc-quashes-fir-against-eight-myanmar-nationals-booked-for-tablighi-activities/story-Uom8h9ZrPWuPhGkhd8S4yK.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Man beaten to death while rescuing another person from being lynched||A photographer (23), who reportedly tried to save a neighbour from being beaten by a mob of 20 in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala over a relationship, was beaten to death by the mob, Delhi Police said.Shaukat, who was beaten by the mob on Tuesday evening, succumbed to his injuries the following morning. The incident sparked tension in the area as Shaukat’s relatives and neighbours staged a protest with his body. Also read: Mob lynches three murder suspects in JharkhandPK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (Rohini), Delhi Police, dismissed the alleged communal angle to the incident. He said the situation is under control. “We have deployed adequate force in the neighbourhood. We are speaking to elders from both the Hindu and Muslim communities in a bid to ensure that the situation remains peaceful,” said the DCP.Though violence took place at an unauthorised slum in Sawada village in Kanjhawala at around 8.30 pm on Tuesday, trouble was brewing in the neighbourhood for the past few days.Rihan (18), a friend of Saider who the mob was looking for, has filed a police complaint about Tuesday’s incident.“My friend Saider had a girlfriend. A few days ago, he came to know that his girlfriend was in touch with another youngster, Ankit, from our neighbourhood. Saider spoke to his girlfriend and sorted the matter out with her,” Rihan has stated in the police complaint.“Ankit and his friends would keep looking for Saider in our neighbourhood, but couldn’t find him,” alleged Rihan, who is pursuing his matriculation from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU),On Tuesday night, Ankit and his friends allegedly started looking for Saider again, but instead spotted Rihan fiddling with his mobile phone at the gate of his house.They allegedly decided to target Rihan since they couldn’t locate Saider. “The mob was armed with baseball bats, swords, rods, bricks and stones,” alleged Rihan. DCP Mishra said that closed circuit TV (CCTV) footage has revealed that the mob consisted of about 20 men, all aged between 18 and 21 years.“Some members of the mob began thrashing Rihan, while others picked up stones and bricks from an adjoining construction site and threw at his house,” the DCP said.Rihan, who was rescued by his neighbours, was left with a fractured limb and several blunt injuries. Then, the mob turned to Shaukat who had tried to rescue Rihan. “Shaukat was an innocent man, who was only trying to save a human life. He had nothing to do with the quarrel between the two groups,” said the DCP.Shaukat worked at his maternal uncle’s photography studio and lived in the same area. “The mob thrashed him with baseball bats, stones and rods,” said Rihan.The mob fled after local residents chased them away by pelting stones.The two injured men were rushed to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Rohini where Shaukat succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday morning, the DCP said.The lane where the violence took place on Tuesday evening was littered with stones and bricks. So far, five suspects, including Ankit (18), have been arrested and the hunt is on for the others.“It was a fight between young men over a relationship. We are ensuring that the assailants are caught and no one gives the incident a communal angle,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-beaten-to-death-while-rescuing-another-person-from-being-lynched/story-UAy6ctIB4ghHc0PNf7ULsM.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Snake in your backyard? Wildlife rescuers say don’t panic!||When Rakesh Nagpal, a resident of Gurugram, spotted a snake in an empty plot near his factory in Dhankot, he did not fret; instead, he asked his employees to keep an eye on the snake while he dialled Anil Gandass, a city-based wildlife conservationist. Within 20 minutes, Gandass was on the spot, and carefully rescued a very rare Red Sand Boa, his third rescue of the day. Recalling that day, Nagpal says, “I’m used to seeing snakes near my factory, but for the safety of my employees, I always call Anil. We believe in harming no living being.” In the months of June to October, several such incidents get reported more often in Delhi-NCR, and there’s usually a massive surge reported in reptile sightings. Needless to say, environmentalists credit the growing human-wildlife conflicts to the encroachment of forest areas for residential establishments. A recent viral video of a monitor lizard in someone’s backyard created much hue and cry on social media, and in a more recent case, a snake was rescued from an autorickshaw in the Capital. “I rescued many snakes in this season from residential areas in Gurugram, in sectors along Golf Course Extension Road and Pataudi Road, which have forests nearby,” says Gandass, from Environment and Wildlife Society. Explaining why we see more reptiles in the monsoon, he adds, “These animals are all cold-blooded and have to feed, mate and soak in some sunlight before they retire for hibernating months in the winter.” Wildlife SOS, an NGO that runs a helpline for animal rescues also tells us that most of their rescue calls during the monsoons are regarding reptiles. They get calls from all over Delhi-NCR including Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, Okhla, Rajokri and Sainik Farm. “On an estimate, we have responded to over 300 calls this season. We always advise people to maintain a safe distance from the animal, and call professional rescuers, Police or the forest department. Never take matters into your hands as it might lead to untoward incidents,” says Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS. But the task of rescuers doesn’t stop when an animal is taken into custody. Many wildlife rescuers say that the lack of knowledge, preconceived notions and the fear in people make their job a tough one. “There were around 14-15 villages near Garouli in Gurugram which used to kill monitor lizards under the misconception that they were poisonous. After many awareness programs, they have now stopped hurting reptiles, and they just call me,” says Gandass. Wildlife SOS has also organised workshops in the past to sensitise people and train them to tackle such situations. Satyanarayan says although incessant calls keep their staff on toes, it’s a welcome change. “An increase in the number of calls we receive over the years is a positive sign. This means more and more people are becoming aware and are showing more compassion towards urban wildlife,” he adds. Wildlife spotted in the house? Here’s what to do:Never engage directly with the animal/reptile Do not make loud sounds, keep an eye on it from a distanceContact wildlife rescue immediately. Wildlife SOS helpline: 9871963535; Reptile rescuer: 9999841782 Animals like snakes attack when threatened; so don’t poke or harm itTry to send an image or describe the animal/reptile to the expert you are calling, so that they can ascertain if it’s poisonous or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/snake-in-your-backyard-wildlife-rescuers-say-don-t-panic/story-z3PpnCwCtGj0YeiuiMiIGN.html

24-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers in Punjab, Haryana intensify protests against farm bills; Oppn parties take to streets, too||Farmers intensified their protest against the Centre’s farm bills on Thursday in Punjab and Haryana by holding sit-ins and rallies across both agrarian states with opposition parties joining their agitation a day after Parliament’s monsoon session ended. On a call given by the Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC), farmers gathered to protest near Devidaspur village in Amritsar on the Amritsar-Delhi rail route and on the tracks leading to the Ferozepur station near Basti Tanka Wali. The committee leaders said they were getting support from various sections, including government employees, labourers and social activists. They clarified that they would not allow any political leader, former or incumbent, to share the stage with them during their three-day protest that began on Thursday. The farmer leaders also appealed to rural medical practitioners (RMP) to be ready for supporting the farmers in case of medical emergencies as a large number of women are taking part in the protests. “The protest will be further intensified on September 26 as farmers will block rail tracks in Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Pathankot, Fazilka, Kapurthala and Jalandhar districts too,” said the committee’s state general secretary, Sarwan Singh Pandher. The railways took the steam out of the farmers’ rail blockade plan by cancelling 28 trains from Amritsar and Ferozepur stations from 6am on Thursday in view the safety of passengers. Radical Sikh organisation Dal Khalsa and seminary Damdami Taksal have extended their support to the farmers’ bandh call on September 25. Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh said, “The people of Punjab, including the political parties, should join hands for the cause. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) should snap its ties with the BJP to show solidarity with farmers.” The Punjab Youth Congress is organising a statewide ‘8 Vaje 8 Minute Mashal March’ on Thursday in support of the Punjab bandh call of farmers. State unit chief Brinder Singh Dhillon said that members will perform duties during the dharnas be it serving water, food or other things needed at the spot. SECTION 144 IN AMRITSAR TILL SEPT 27 Meanwhile, police has imposed Section 144 of the CrPC prohibiting the carrying of firearms, inflammable items and sharp-edged weapons in the Amritsar city till September 27. Acting magistrate-cum-deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Jagmohan Singh said the decision was taken in the wake of farmer and labour organisations planning a rail blockade from September 24 to 26, besides giving a bandh call on September 25. HARYANA SEALS ITS BORDERS High-voltage drama was witnessed at the Shambhu barrier on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway, where activists of Punjab’s Lok Insaf Party were stopped in Ambala when they were headed for Delhi on motorcycles on Wednesday. Protesting against the passage of farm bills, the party workers confronted with the police and faced water cannon for hours, refusing to step back. In view of the protests, district magistrate Ashok Kumar Sharma imposed prohibitory orders to maintain law and order, while the police put up barricades refusing their entry into Haryana. In the evening, activists, including Lok Insaf Party leader Simarjeet Singh Bains, tried to enter Haryana through the Ghagger river bed, but were again confronted by Ambala police who persuaded to go back. Youth Congress workers faced water cannons at Samalkha near Panipat on Wednesday when police stopped them to take their tractor march to Delhi to protest the farm bills. The protest was led by Haryana Youth Congress state president Sachin Kundu and Congress’ Samalkha MLA Dharm Singh Chhokar. This led to a blockade on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway but later traffic was diverted on link roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-in-punjab-haryana-intensify-protests-against-farm-bills-oppn-parties-take-to-streets-too/story-X72JFSxDezntkoWPAbRHRI.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||With 395 mm rain in 48 hrs, Mumbai monsoon its second wettest ever||Mumbai has witnessed its second wettest monsoon ever, beating last year’s seasonal rain tally.After torrential downpour on Tuesday and Wednesday, rains eased on Thursday morning with a clear sky and sunshine after three days.Mumbai received 395.1 mm rain over the last 48 hours, 53.7 mm more than what it generally receives throughout September.Also read: Moisture incursion delays monsoon withdrawal, season will end in 9 daysFrom June 1 to September 24 morning, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 3,679.8 mm rain. The quantum of rain last year was 3,670.4 mm. The highest all-time seasonal rainfall was during 1958 at 3,759.7mm, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Thus, this year’s monsoon rain is the highest since 1959, or in 61 years.Seasonal rain at Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, was also the highest in 36 years with 3,198.7 from June 1 to September 4, 8.30am. Over the past 119 years (1901-2020), IMD data showed Colaba recorded its highest all-time seasonal rainfall in 1954 at 3,423.1 mm. In 1958 and 1983, Colaba had recorded 3,382.4 mm and 3,329.8 mm, making it a total of five such years (including 2020) in over a century that 3,000 mm rain was recorded.“Mumbai and Maharashtra witnessed an exceptionally good monsoon this year with rain records in all months except June. Local weather factors helped lead to the highest monthly rain in July, the formation of five low pressure weather systems in August kept weather systems active along the west coast. Rain intensity is expected to gradually decline now as September ends,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.The past 48 hours saw extremely heavy rain lash the city, leaving many areas in waist deep water and traffic snarls. Between 8.30 am Wednesday and 8.30 am Thursday, 108.7 mm rain was recorded in the suburbs and 50.4 mm rain in south Mumbai. The previous 24 hours (8.30am Tuesday and 8.30am Wednesday) saw 286.4 mm rain in the suburbs, which was the heaviest rainfall witnessed this season, and 147.8mm rain in south Mumbai.Location-wise rain over the past 24 hours showed several locations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) received over 120 mm rain. Ram Mandir (near Goregaon) received maximum rain 138 mm followed by Lokhandwala 137.2 mm, Bandra 129.2mm, Worli 128mm, Thane 120.1mm, Navi Mumbai 134.2mm. The remaining areas across Mumbai received rain between 70-90 mm.“Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai received heavy to very heavy rain across isolated areas over the past 24 hours. More rain intensity was witnessed towards Thane and Navi Mumbai in the evening. Thursday started with a clear sky and possibility of a few showers towards evening,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.The weather bureau has predicted the possibility of light to moderate rain for the remaining days of the month while independent meteorologists said the city will not receive any heavy rain spells as the season ends. However, monsoon withdrawal was not expected anytime soon. “Withdrawal could be delayed due to active La Niña conditions (a phenomenon when the western Pacific ocean warms up creating a low pressure near Australia pulling winds from the Indian Ocean strengthening equatorial dynamics keeping southwest monsoon circulation active) allowing rains to linger on for some more time over the west coast and central India,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-395-mm-rain-in-48-hrs-mumbai-monsoon-wettest-ever/story-cuTeHtrhOmlFe6MJt0K8gL.html
24-09-2020||Bhopal||MP: Rape, domestic violence survivor overcomes odds with karate||When she lost her father at 10, it was just the beginning of this 20-year-old woman’s troubles. Her family could barely make ends meet and she remained unlettered. She lived with her sister in Indore for some time before she began working as a cook to live on her own in 2016. The woman started earning enough to sustain herself and educate her brother. Things appeared to be looking up until her employer’s 19-year-old son allegedly raped her repeatedly for over a year and threw her life out of gear again. The traumatised woman, then a minor, could muster courage and lodged a case only in February 2018. Over the last two years, she has overcome more odds, learnt to read and write as well as karate, and won three medals in local tournaments.The woman’s alleged rapist was arrested but she could barely breathe easy as a local council in her village in Uttar Pradesh’s Lalitpur ostracised her family. She was forced her to marry the alleged rapist in January 2019, who was by then out on bail. Her troubles appeared to be unending. “[After marriage] started another phase of sexual violence. The man who raped me was my husband now. He constantly pressured me and subjected me to mental and physical torture as he wanted me to say in the court hearing the rape case that I was not a minor when I was raped.” When she got pregnant, she was given pills for its termination on the pretext of regular medication.Also read: Girl, 16, raped and blackmailed for 2 years; cops say she was his 7th victimBy June 2019, she had had enough and decided to fight back and refused to go back to her husband’s house despite pressure from even her family to retract her statement about the rape. “I was even insulted at public places but the pressure only affirmed my resolve to fight.”The woman shifted to a woman and child development department hostel and Childline Indore, an NGO, offered her karate classes. After learning karate for one month, she used her skills to teach three men sexually harassing her a lesson. “It gave me immense confidence and I started learning karate more seriously.”Childline Indore director Waseem Iqbal said she is among a few minor rape survivors, who have shown grit and determination to fight odds. “She won three medals in just six months in different tournaments from October 2019 to December 2019 in Indore, Bhopal and Dehradun organised by different organisations affiliated with the Karate Association of India,” he said. “...[She] has now learnt writing and reading English and Hindi to follow the proceedings of her legal battle. She is not supported by anyone from her family.”Her karate coach, Saeed Alam, said he has never seen a more determined and passionate woman than her. “We also treat her as a student without showing sympathy to her to make her mentally strong.”The woman’s lawyer, Shanno Khan, said her client has filed a petition also in the Madhya Pradesh high court to have her alleged rapist tried under the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act. “I have never seen a brave girl like [her]. She has faced the accused and his family bravely in the court without any hesitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/rape-domestic-violence-survivor-in-mp-s-bhopal/story-O18npqnCFWLAFtyyvC2ebP.html

24-09-2020||Delhi||Politicians who addressed anti-CAA protests mentioned in Delhi riots charge sheet||At least two arrested suspects and one protected witness in the Delhi riots case have named Congress politician and former MP Udit Raj, Congress leader Salman Khurshid and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat for giving provocative speeches during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests that led up to the communal violence in February. The political leaders have not been charged or named as accused in the charge sheet.The names of the political leaders have been mentioned in the disclosure statements of the suspects and the witness that are attached as an annexure to the charge sheet on an alleged conspiracy behind the riots in north-east Delhi that left 53 people dead and 607 injured. Delhi police filed the charge sheet on September 16. Also Read: Violence began with stone-pelting at Maujpur Metro station: Riots charge sheetThe statement of the protected witness, referred to as Beta, mentions the names of the above-mentioned political leaders, accusing them of visiting the site of an anti-CAA protest site in Khureji and giving gave provocative speeches. Delhi police have told the court that many prominent anti-CAA protesters such as former Jawaharlal Nehru University alumnus Umar Khalid, student activist Safoora Zargar, JNU student Sharjeel Imam and others had delivered provocative speeches as part of a conspiracy to mobilise people and start the riots in north-east Delhi. The charge sheet also mentions the name of senior advocate Prashant Bhushan and Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav in the disclosure statement of Khalid Saifi. Yadav and Bhushan have not been charged or named as accused but Saifi, who was arrested, has been charged as one of the main conspirators. Also Read: Jamia stir was a ‘beta test’: Charge sheetSaifi, in his statement, told the police that during the protests held in January 2020, Yadav, Bhushan, Khurshid and others also used to come to the protest sites and give speeches.The supplementary disclosure statement of Saifi also stated “…in order to sustain the protest for a longer time several known persons like Khurshid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider etc were called to the Khureji protest site by me and Ishrat Jahan.”Similarly, there is also a disclosure statement by former Congress councilor Ishrat Jahan(also charged by the police as one of the main conspirators) where she has said that in order to sustain the protests, several well-known personalities were called by her and Saifi to visit the protest sites. Ishrat Jahan, in her statement before the police, said Khurshid, documentary filmmaker Rahul Roy, Bhim Army member Himanshu, Chandan Kumar, a member of student outfit AISA, delivered provocative speeches that instigated the protestors against the government.“These are concocted allegations. This investigation has no credibility as it names Kapil Mishra (Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party leader), as a whistle blower. I have not just been to one site but several protest sites because my party has openly come out against the CAA,” Brinda Karat said.BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who had also given a speech a day before violence erupted in north-east Delhi, was also questioned by the police but he denied giving any speech. He was summoned on July 28 and he told the investigators that he had gone to the protest site in his personal capacity. “I have not delivered any speech. I just told police to clear the road in three days. If they did not do it, I said that we would also sit on dharna,” Mishra told the police as per the charge sheet.Udit Raj said that he went to the protest site in east Delhi’s Khureji to extend his support. “Whatever I speak in public and in the media, I spoke there also. What is provocative about it, “ Raj said. HT contacted Prashant Bhushan but he did not respond. Khurshid said: “Delhi Police have forgotten the law. I have never heard of any law which says that provocative speeches are illegal. That does not mean that I have made any provocative speeches. The speech has to be judged by its contents and the disclosure statements do not mention the words used in the speeches. This is a textbook example for the law students to show them how not to file a charge sheet and the lacunae which can be pointed out.” The charge sheet, filed by the special cell last week, has named 15 people who allegedly conspired to orchestrate the riots in February across north-east Delhi localities. In the 17,500-page charge sheet, the police have charged Abdul Khalid Saifi, Ishrat Jahan, Meeran Haider, Tahir Hussain, Gulfisha Khatoon, Safoora Zargar, Shifa-ur Rehman, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Shadab Ahmad, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Taslim Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohammed Salim and Athar Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/politicians-who-addressed-anti-caa-protests-mentioned-in-delhi-riots-charge-sheet/story-Toem6NtYgoILqNXjdnckYK.html
24-09-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow’s Bada Imambada reopens after 6 months, but with conditions||Lucknow’s iconic nawabi-era structure, the Bada Imambada, opened to the public on Thursday after nearly 190 days of closure due to Covid-19 triggered lockdown and subsequent restrictions on reopening of public places amenable to mass gatherings.The entry was allowed only through e-tickets and only 100 tourists would be let inside the historic structure each day to guard against overcrowding, as per Covid-19 induced social distancing and protection protocol, said an official with Hussainabad and allied trust (HAT) that owns the structure. Other than Bada Imambada that was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in 1784, the other heritage structures (owned by the HAT) including the picture gallery and the Chhota Imambada, too opened.“Bada Imambada and other heritage structures are open for the tourists. We are expecting more local tourists and a lesser number of foreigners initially, but we expect footfall to increase by this weekend,” said Sushil Pratap Singh, city magistrate/secretary, HAT.Singh said that the trust has also put in place certain measures to ensure safety of the tourists during the pandemic. Not only is the entry restricted to only allow visitors carrying e-tickets but a ‘no mask, no entry’ policy is also in place.E-ticketing and digital payment has been made mandatory for the tourists and group photography at Bada Imambada has been banned, officials said.The visitors appeared delighted with the reopening of these iconic structures.“It’s like being back to life. These days, when cinema halls and other hangout joints are still closed, opening of Bada Imambada is indeed a big relief,” said Mohammed Shadab, a college goer, who came visiting with his friends. The reopening of Bada Imambada has also brought smiles back to the faces of the tourist guides.

24-09-2020||Bhopal||Congress-BJP war on farm loan waivers intensifies ahead of key MP by polls||A political war of words has broken out between the BJP and the Congress ahead of the crucial by polls for 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh with the Congress claiming that the state government has finally accepted that the previous Kamal Nath government had fulfilled its promise to waive-off farmers’ loans and therefore, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should apologise for spreading alleged falsehoods, a charge rejected in toto by the BJP, which accused the Congress of misleading the people on the issue using half-truths. MP Congress leaders have cited state agriculture minister Kamal Patel’s written reply in the assembly, given to Congress MLA Jaivardhan Singh, to claim that loans worth more than Rs 11,000 crore owed by more than 2.6 million farmers were waived off in 2019. The state was ruled by a Congress government led by Kamal Nath in 2019.Farmers’ loan waiver has remained one of the major poll issues and a point of conflict between the BJP and the Congress since the last assembly elections. BJP has accused the previous Congress government in the state of betraying farmers by not fulfilling its poll promise to waive off loans up to Rs 2 lakh per head within 10 days of assuming power. The political temperatures on the issue soared further following a tweet by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday, which said, “Congress: Jo kaha so kiya, BJP: Sirf jhoothe waade”, meaning ‘Congress kept its word while BJP has made only false promises’.State Congress president Kamal Nath, who also happens to be the leader of Opposition in the state assembly, said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been misleading people right from day one on farmers’ loan waiver issue. Now, the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have got exposed for their lies with the state government’s own reply in the state assembly, which suggested that loans worth more than Rs 11,600 crore of 2.69 million farmers in 51 districts were waived by the then Congress government. Now, Chouhan should tender an apology to the people of Madhya Pradesh.” Also Read: With Madhya Pradesh bypolls drawing nearer, personal attacks on rise in campaignsHowever, agriculture minister Kamal Patel hit back at Kamal Nath accusing the Congress of sophistry.“Congress and Kamal Nath are anti-farmers. The then chief minister Kamal Nath had signed a document that loans worth Rs 55,000 crore of 4.8 million farmers up to Rs 2 lakh per head would be waived off within 10 days. Do the Congress leaders have any document to show that any farmer’s loan up to Rs 2 lakh was waived? In fact, the Congress leaders including state Congress president Kamal Nath should tender an apology to people for their false statements otherwise Nath should step down from both his positions- leader of Opposition and state Congress president,” Patel said.Also Read: MP Congress leader slapped with NSA for assaulting officer, blackening faceIn June 2018, during campaigning for the assembly elections, the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said in a public meeting in Mandsaur that if the party was voted to power, farmers’ loans would be waived off within 10 days otherwise, the chief minister would lose his position. The promise to waive off the loans was also part of Congress manifesto released ahead of November 2018 elections. After BJP dislodged the Congress government in March this year, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleged that the previous Congress government had only waived off Rs 6,000 crore worth of farmers loans contrary to what the party had promised before the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/congress-bjp-war-on-farm-loan-waivers-intensifies-ahead-of-key-mp-by-polls/story-gWssRkvGDrkDsGgDwzer6I.html

24-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Line of control||It wasn’t here until yesterday. And now, a glossy white line is running along the Matia Mahal Bazaar, slicing its main street in equal halves.“It was already painted when I arrived to set up my stall this morning (read Monday) at 7,” informs tea stall owner Muhammed Hamid—his rickety table is tucked by the street-side, a spitting distance from the dividing line. The man has no clue on who ordered the partition. Bawarchi Kallan offers a guess. Sitting a few steps away, across the street, he gazes intently at the line, saying, “Corporation people must have done it.” He is referring to the area’s municipal corporation. While morning shift sweeper Kanta suggests that the line might have been painted to regulate the traffic “and to keep the left and right side apart.”That this is a novel sight is undisputed. No other pathway in the vicinity has such a divider. Indeed, the Old Quarter roads and passages know no divide— rickshaw men, cyclists, cart pullers, bikers and pedestrians (humans as well as cats, dogs, goats and rats) go about in all directions. In fact, the traffic in the Walled City interiors looks as messy as the overhanging power cables above. Yet things work—people do reach their destinations, and during emergencies the crowds part as swiftly for fire brigade trucks and ambulances as the Red Sea did for the Israelites, in the Old Testament.Even so, this attempt to impose order is noteworthy.The painted line starts at Dujan House crossing and goes past an armful of shops and eateries—Bukhari’s Kids Zone, Naseem Jewellers, K&R Pickle and Murabbas, U-Like Collection, A Jabbar Milk Store, Asgher Bakery (yummy sheermals!), A-One Xerox, Bombay Saloon, etc. It barely bends along the way, leaping over the (covered) gutters, and ends in front of the grand Jama Masjid. This late morning, beggar woman Anwari is sitting cross-legged atop the last stretch, silently immersed in thoughts. As the noon hour approaches, the street gets chaotic with increased traffic—barely anyone is respecting the line. It’s been only a few hours since it was painted but has already grown less white, and seems to have embedded itself into the texture of the tarmac. As if it had always been here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-line-of-control/story-bojUVHAyGgJKVTG0LnjEPP.html

On Wednesday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar held a meeting with leaders from Jalgaon district, the hometown of the BJP leader. Pawar allegedly discussed the pros and cons of bringing Khadse in to the party fold. However, state NCP chief Jayant Patil said the meeting did not involve any discussion on Khadse. “There was no discussion related to Eknath Khadse. The meeting was called to discuss irrigation projects of the district,” Patil told reporters. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state NCP president, Anil Patil, NCP MLA from Amalner and former minister Gulabrao Deokar were present for the meeting. Khadse, the former revenue minister, was sidelined by the BJP after he was made to resign from the post following allegations of graft and conflict of interest in a land deal near Pune in 2016. Earlier, there were rumors that he would join Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/speculations-rife-about-bjp-s-eknath-khadse-joining-ncp-after-sharad-pawar-holds-meeting-in-jalgaon/story-hjS9FGDmBCHpR8CInahX5L.html

24-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants pre-arrest bail to Pune man booked for obstructing government servants on Covid-19 duty||The Bombay high court (HC) recently granted pre-arrest bail to a man booked for allegedly assaulting a government servant at the gram panchayat office in Pune district, where he had gone after he failed to get a bed for his Covid-19 positive mother. The HC, while allowing his application, observed that “anxious moments in the lives of near ones who have tested positive for Covid-19 lead to unexpected behaviour during a pandemic” and directed the man to be released on bail on condition that he contribute ₹10,000 to the Chief Minister’s (CM) Relief Fund.On September 18, the single-judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Swapnil Lande, a resident of Somatane village in Pune district, was informed by advocate Pranav Bhoite that his client’s mother had tested positive for Covid-19 on July 25. Bhoite said that as no beds were available in the dedicated Covid hospitals, Lande had no option but to keep his mother in home-quarantine. However, as all the village residents urged him to admit his mother to some hospital, he went in search of a vacant bed in the government hospital. However, as he was unsuccessful in securing a bed, he turned to a private hospital which asked him to deposit ₹1 lakh as advance. Bhoite submitted that as Lande was not able to arrange for the funds, when he came to know that some government officials were going to visit the gram panchayat office on July 27, he reached the office for redressal of his grievance but was denied an opportunity to meet the visiting officials. Bhoite added that while Lande was at the office, the driver of an official restrained him from entering the office and humiliated and abused him. He was thereafter locked in the office. In light of these submissions, Bhoite sought anticipatory bail as the driver had complained against him. Assistant public prosecutor Suraj Hulke objected to the application and said that as per the complaint of the driver, he had taken the officials to the gram panchayat office to survey the spike in Covid cases in the region. While he was parking the vehicle, “an unknown person” was shouting and insisted that his mother should get treatment. The complaint further stated that the driver tried to stop the applicant as the survey work was underway, and Lande’s interference resulted in deterring public servants from discharging their duty. After hearing the submissions, justice Dangre noted, “It can very well be assumed that the applicant was anxious to get treatment for his mother, who was detected positive and the complainant [driver] wanted to keep a distance from him since his family member was positive.” The bench said that the applicant did not have any intention of deterring the public servant from discharging duties, “but for the anxiety to get treatment to his mother, he might have overstepped his limits”. “The pandemic situation, which has brought the entire world to its knees, is witnessed by one and all. The anxious moments in the lives of near and dear ones, who have tested positive can lead to an unprecedented situation and unexpected behaviour,” said the judge. While observing that custodial interrogation of the applicant was not required, the bench said that Lande had to take responsibility for his actions. “He must pay the price for his irresponsible behaviour since it is a well-known fact that it is the endeavour of the government machinery with its limited resources to cater to the needs of the public in the pandemic situation, and the government is attempting to do its level best,” said justice Dangre. The court then directed Lande to deposit ₹10,000 with the CM Relief Fund within four weeks and said that in the event of his arrest, he should be released on furnishing a personal bond of ₹20,000 with sureties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-pune-man-booked-for-obstructing-government-servants-on-covid-19-duty/story-FHZ2kxnQzSiXa9qCpDl6uM.html

Deputy commissioner of police Manjunath Singe confirmed the FIR has been registered. Kashyap has denied the allegations. Satpute said the incident had taken place in 2013 when his client had approached Kashyap for work as an actor and Kashyap invited her to his home on two occasions. During the second visit, he allegedly sexually assaulted her. Last week, the actor spoke about the incident on social media. On Monday, Satpute and his client had approached Oshiwara police station to file a formal complaint, but were directed to Versova police station, as Kashyap’s residence comes under the latter’s jurisdiction.

24-09-2020||Mumbai||Rain wreaks havoc in Mumbai, again: Two killed, areas flooded for 12 hours||Two people were killed in Agripada on Wednesday after being trapped in a lift due to waterlogging. Several areas were waterlogged for over 12 hours following continued heavy rainfall. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has urged Mumbaiites to not step out unless absolutely necessary. On Wednesday morning, Jameer Mohammad, 27, and Shahjad Mohammad, 33, got stuck in a lift when waterlogging in the basement of Nathani Residency in Agripada, led to a short circuit. Mumbai Fire Brigade reported the incident to BMC’s control room at 11.45am. Jameer and Shahjad were rescued by the fire brigade and rushed to BYL Nair Hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival. BMC said the cause of death will be revealed after a post-mortem. Waterlogging was reported at multiple locations across Mumbai, including Hindmata, Gandhi Market, Sion Road 24, Malad Subway, Bandra Talkies, Old Khar, Behrambaug Junction, Sakkar Panchayat junction, Shastri Nagar, and on railway tracks between Dadar and Kurla. Traffic had to be diverted from 12 locations on major and arterial roads due to waterlogging, including BA Road, Gandhi Market, King’s Circle, Gol Deol, NM Joshi Road, Shell Colony, Veera Desai Road, near Kalpana Cinema Theatre and Grant Road station. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Wednesday, “Mumbai received 83% of its total rainfall for September in less than 16 hours. BMC pumped out 6 billion litres of water from city till 4pm, exactly the capacity of Tulsi Lake. That is why it is taking time for water to recede.” Chahal also directed ward officials to arrange temporary shelter for those in flood-prone areas. BMC had to shut down Oshiwara bridge on Wednesday morning, after pressure from the bulging Oshiwara river dislodged a water main running along the bridge and damaged the surface road of the adjoining bridge. Water supply to parts of Oshiwara has been affected and routine supply is expected to resume by this morning, said Bharatiya Janata Party corporator Sandeep Patel. Eight partial house collapses were reported and 17 tree collapses were reported. A portion of a retaining wall along a hillock in Walkeshwar also collapsed. Fifteen instances of short circuit were reported. Guardian minister of Mumbai suburbs and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and Chahal visited waterlogged areas, various pumping stations and BMC’s disaster management cell. Thackeray also directed BMC officials to expedite work on underground flood control tanks to retain excess rainwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rain-wreaks-havoc-in-mumbai-again-two-killed-areas-flooded-for-12-hours/story-Xs0ZC6YhISpboE4BSz9FSP.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admission process in Maharashtra likely to restart this week||The Maharashtra government is likely to restart the admission process for first-year junior colleges (FYJC) this week. The process was stayed owing to the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Maratha reservation. “The redrawing of seat matrix is nearly complete. The state government is now getting the required clearances. An announcement with respect to restarting the admission process is likely to be made this week,” said an official from the state education department. On September 9, the Supreme Court ordered an interim stay on Maratha reservation in education and employment. After the decision, the state education department had decided to stay FYJC admissions until further notice as admissions under the previously granted 12% reservation were no longer held valid. While the department had said that a revised timetable for the second admission round which was scheduled to take place on June 10 would be declared soon, it is yet to come up with an announcement in this regard.Meanwhile, students have been writing to the department urging the authorities to restart admission procedure as soon as possible. Junior colleges in Mumbai usually start their new academic year in August. However with the current delay, colleges are now stressed about completing the syllabus after the year begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admission-process-in-maharashtra-likely-to-restart-this-week/story-CJ0xBYqkeBiO1OSqv5fWxK.html

Partole identified the accused, Mohammed Sayyed Shaikh, from several CCTV videos. Partole, who was in casual attire, began following Shaikh. Shaikh, however, noticed him.“Partole did not even have time to react when Shaikh pulled out a chopper from his pocket and pounced on him,” said Pal. Partole then ran across the platform as commuters stared in shock and hopped on a train moving towards Kurla. Shaikh, too, managed to board the train.“Shaikh realised that Partole would shout for help as the train approached Kurla station, and hence jumped onto the tracks. This time, Partole started chasing Shaikh, but lost him near Kasaiwada,” said Pal. The police then registered an offence against Shaikh and started looking for him.“We traced a mobile phone that Shaikh was seen stealing a few days ago on a CCTV footage and tracked the phone to a resident of Titwala. The resident, who had bought the stolen mobile phone, knew Shaikh and gave us his address,” said Pal.However, the police were unable to arrest Shaikh from his house, and laid a trap in Kurla and Wadala. He was arrested on Monday at Kasaiwada for trying to attack a constable and possession of a weapon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/robber-arrested-for-chasing-grp-constable-with-a-chopper-in-hand-in-mumbai/story-y75fwtT79JhjLZFCSsFNKN.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 104% rise in Covid-19 cases in September compared to last month||The number of Covid-19 cases in the city rose 104%, to 40,957 (September 1-22) from 20,031 (August 1-22), according to the state health department data. The number of deaths in this period in September dropped to 862, compared to 990 from August 1-22. Civic authorities claim the spike in the number of cases is owing to increased testing and unlocking. The daily cases also started to increase owing to festivals in August. The daily testing in August was between 7,000 and 9,000. However, in September, the daily testing is between 10,000 and 15,000. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data, on August 1, five months after the first case was reported in Mumbai, the number of tests was over five lakh. However, the number of tests rose to over 10 lakh by September 22. This also means the testing doubled in the period of around 50 days. HT reported on September 21 that in the past 31 days, the city has recorded case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.2% (1,115 deaths and 51,617 cases), which has helped bring down Mumbai’s overall CFR from 5.5% to 4.5% between August 20 and September 20. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) attributed this dip in CFR to weekly monitoring at private and municipal hospitals as part of its ‘Mission Save Lives’ launched in June. CFR is deaths due to Covid-19 as a per cent of the total cases reported. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on September 6 told HT: “For the next 30 days, the civic body expects to detect daily around 2,000 cases as it aims to increase daily testing to around 12,000-14,000 tests.” Chahal had added the capacity is to conduct around 15,000 tests, and we are planning to optimise testing. So far, over 10.22 lakh tests have been conducted in the city, with overall positivity rate of 18.22%. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “It is a good sign that the number of deaths has come down despite the number of cases going up drastically. This is because of early testing or detection of possible Covid-19 patients. Also, availability of drugs to stabilise several critical patients has also helped bring down the mortality rate.” Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the city reported 2,360 cases taking the tally to 190,264 and 49 deaths taking the toll to 8,604. A total of 154,088 patients have recovered. The city’s recovery rate is 80.98%. The city has 27,186 active cases and the fatality rate is 4.52%. Dharavi recorded 22 new cases, taking its tally to 3,087.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-104-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-september-compared-to-last-month/story-QYyWXlH3DnAJYSzP1EdPiN.html

Devlekar was the corporator of Milind Nagar and Gholap Nagar in Kalyan (West).He was hospitalised for the last few days as his health deteriorated and was later shifted to a Mumbai hospital for intensive treatment. “We visited him in the hospital a few days ago and were hoping he would get better soon. Devlekar’s demise is a huge loss for the city. He worked on the ground level and he did a lot of work for the city during his mayoral tenure as well. We have been lost many party workers during the pandemic. These are Covid martyrs,” said Shrikant Shinde, Shiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) from Kalyan constituency. Devlekar is survived by his wife and two daughters. In April, two people were booked for spreading rumours about Devlekar’s ill health in Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-kalyan-mayor-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-bqomziC6SqduGFcQF4YMTL.html
24-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra crosses 20K new cases mark after 2-day drop, Covid-19 case count 1,263,799||After reporting less than 20,000 cases for two days, Maharashtra recorded 21,029 fresh infections on Wednesday, taking the case count to 1,263,799. It was the 15th day when more than 20,000 fresh cases were recorded in this month. The number of active cases went up to 273,477, 21.63% of the total cases reported so far.Death toll reached 33,886 with 479 new casualties reported. The highest toll in a day so far was recorded on September 15 with 515 fatalities.Maharashtra has continued to struggle to control Covid-19 cases as the surge in cases has not come down since lockdown restrictions were eased in phases from June 3. Free movement of people allowed the pandemic to reach even rural areas.The state has recorded 472,545 cases and 8,941 deaths in the past 23 days, which means an average of 20,545 cases and 388 casualties were recorded per day.In August, a total of 371,238 cases and 9,589 deaths were reported.The tally of fresh infections is likely to increase even further, according to an internal projection of the state health department. It states that daily cases are likely to rise by the end of this month. Officials, however, said detecting more cases should not be considered as a negative thing in this scenario as it will help in breaking the chain. They added that early detection also means less fatality.Ramaswami N, director of national health mission (NHM), said, “Daily infections have been static in the last few days and are stabilising in major cities. After unlocking the restrictions, cases were expected to increase, and our efforts are on to contain the spread. There is a possibility that cases will go up, and it is for good because it will help in breaking the chain.”He added that following social distancing norms is the only way to control the pandemic, for which peoples’ cooperation is a must. “We want everyone to contribute in controlling the spread,” he added.Meanwhile, the door-to-door survey under the ‘My family My responsibility’ initiative launched by the state government seems to be working. Survey teams have found over 4,500 Covid-19 positive patients in the past one week. They have also found more than 5 lakh comorbid patients in the same period.Since the campaign started, 7,075,797 homes have been visited and health surveys of 28,363,000 people have been carried out, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office. It added that 4,824 people were found positive for coronavirus and 7.54 lakh people were found with comorbidities.To tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases and reduce number of deaths, the state government launched the initiative on September 15. The state-wide survey aims to check 2.25 crore families for symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and comorbidities. The idea is to effectively curtail the spread by reaching out to each and every citizen of the state and provide necessary care wherever required.Under the campaign, health workers are conducting door-to-door surveys to check residents’ body temperature and oxygen level, besides other symptoms including tiredness, throat pain, dry cough, diarrhoea, and loss of smell and taste.Each team comprising one health worker and two volunteers will survey each and every family of the state twice in over a month. The state is also assigning one doctor for every five teams. The first phase of the survey is expected to be completed by October 10, while the second phase will be conducted between October 12 and 24.Though the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state is going down, the number of daily deaths still remains highest in the country with Maharashtra accounting for 37.64% of the total deaths reported across the country till Wednesday at 90,020 deaths.In terms of CFR, Maharashtra comes second with 2.68%, right after Punjab which has 2.89% CFR with 2,926 deaths on Tuesday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Meanwhile, Mumbai recorded 2,360 cases, highest in the state, on Wednesday, pushing its tally to 190,264. Of them, 27,186 are active cases. The death toll in the city reached 8,604 with 49 deaths on Wednesday.Pune city has contributed the second highest cases in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,797 cases on Wednesday, taking its tally to 146,062 while Nagpur city becomes third with 1,373 cases, taking its case count to 52,967.The state has conducted 89,503 tests on Wednesday, far less than 105,026 tests done on Tuesday. The total number of tests conducted till date is 6,106,787. The state aims to conduct 1.5 lakh tests a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-20k-new-cases-mark-after-2-day-drop-covid-19-case-count-1-263-799/story-QUuTODCkHYIaq817j6TLWJ.html

There is also a need to control its supply,” the CM said in the press statement.The CM outlined the measures taken up to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. He said that daily testing is going to be increased to 1.5 lakh and added that tele-ICU will be set up in rural areas so that infected people get timely treatment. He also said that post-Covid care will also be started.Thackeray said using masks is going to save many people from getting infected. He also requested PM Modi to address the nation and “direct the people of the country on how to go ahead in the fight against Covid-19. He added that the country faces challenges ahead, as festivals including Navratri, Dusshera, and Diwali are coming up, which could lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/set-up-dedicated-teams-in-20-worst-affected-districts-pm-narendra-modi-to-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-qJefh74Poq4TFNSrdK9qAK.html

24-09-2020||Delhi||SC rescues traders facing 200% customs duty on Pak imports post-Pulwama attack||The Supreme Court on Wednesday came to the rescue of certain traders who were asked to pay “enhanced custom duty of 200%” on imported goods from Pakistan due to sudden increase in the tariff by the Centre following the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and ordered that they will have to pay the duty under the older tariff. The top court dismissed the appeal of the Centre against a Punjab and Haryana high court judgment holding that it cannot levy enhanced custom duty from importers who had already presented “bills of entry for home consumption before the enhanced rate was notified’ in e-Gazette. As many as 40 Central Reserves Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on February 14, 2019 in an audacious terror strike at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. A Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist had rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying the security personnel. Two days after the terror strike, the central government on February 16, last year had issued a notification under Section 8A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and introduced “a tariff entry by which all goods originating in or exported from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan were subjected to an enhanced customs duty of 200 per cent”. The notification allegedly led to huge financial burden to some exporters, who had already exported goods under the old custom rates, and had to get their imported goods re-assessed for the purposes of levy of custom duty at enhanced rate. The consignments of import covered a diverse range of goods, ranging from dry dates to cement. The government’s notification was uploaded on the e-Gazette at around 8.46 pm on February 16, 2019 and the customs authorities at the land customs station at Attari in Punjab sought to enforce the enhanced rate of duty on importers who had already presented bills of entry for home consumption before the enhanced rate was notified in the e-Gazette and this led to filing of cases by traders in the Punjab and Haryana high court, the apex court noted in its judgment. The high court, on August 26, 2019, had allowed the pleas of traders and had held “that since the importers, who had imported goods from Pakistan, had presented their bills of entry and completed the process of ‘self-assessment’ before the notification enhancing the rate of duty to 200 per cent was issued and uploaded, the enhanced rate of duty was not attracted. The HC had also held that the importers were liable to pay the duty applicable at the time when the bills of entry for home consumption were filed under Section 46 of the Customs Act and had ordered the Centre “to release the goods within seven days on the payment of duty ‘as declared and assessed’ without applying the notification enhancing the rate of duty on goods originating in Pakistan.” The Centre came in appeal against the HC’s order which was dismissed by a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph in two separate and concurring verdicts. Justice Chandrachud, writing the judgment for himself and Justice Malhotra, referred to various provisions of the Constitution and the Customs Tariff Act and held that the importers who had already got their imported goods self-assessed for the levy of customs duty cannot be asked to pay the higher duty. “The rate of duty was determined by the presentation of the bills of entry for home consumption in the electronic form under Section 46. Self-assessment was on the basis of rate of duty which was in force on the date and at the time of presentation of the bills of entry for home consumption. This could not have been altered in the purported exercise of the power of reassessment under Section 17 or at the time of the clearance of the goods for home consumption under Section 47. “The rate of duty which was applicable was crystallized at the time and on the date of the presentation of the bills of entry in terms of the provisions of Section 15 …,” Justice Chandrachud, who wrote 82-page judgement, said. Justice Joseph wrote a separate and concurring 94-page judgement in the case and dismissed the appeals against the HC’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-rescues-traders-facing-200-customs-duty-on-pak-imports-post-pulwama-attack/story-RbRT6UvAFOVsvPCKFkt5lL.html
24-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi collapse toll is 38; search on for a toddler||Three days later, the death toll in the Bhiwandi building collapse on Wednesday rose to 38, including 17 children, while the number of injured was 25. Rescue operations were still on at the time of going to press, now for close to 70 hours and amid heavy rain, after the collapse of the 36-year-old Jilani building, a ground-plus-three storey structure, around 3.30am Monday.Officials said that they were searching for a two-and-a-half-year-old boy. Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) commissioner Pankar Ashiya, said, “There is a claim of a two-and-a-half-year-old child missing, so at one end, the search will continue and from the other, debris removal will go on. At present, the confirmed deaths are 38.” Of the deaths, the youngest was of Junaid Jabir Ali Shaikh, who was one-and-a-half years old. Milind Palsule, public relations officer of BNCMC, said this was the deadliest building collapse in the power loom town’s history. The rescue operations on Wednesday were mostly done using machinery as there was a need to clear debris to go deeper. The machine would do the clearing of the debris, while few rescue workers kept guiding and checking. “Throughout the afternoon, no body was found, we found 14 bodies overnight by Wednesday morning. While the work of clearing the debris was on, there was heavy downpour. This slowed down operations a bit. If there was no rain, we would have completed rescue operations much before,” said an officer from the National Disaster Management Response Force (NDRF), who did not wish to be named. Around 7pm, the Bhiwandi police made announcements on loud speakers, asking family members, relatives and friends to come forward if anybody is missing.Shaira Qureshi, aunt of Museb Qureshi, the boy who is still missing, said,”Our son is yet not found and we have asked officials to search for him. They have initiated a search.”Meanwhile, no arrests have been made in the case so far as the builder-cum-owner Sayyed Ahmed Jilani has gone absconding since after the incident. The Narpoli police, which is investigating the case, had initiated a search. In one of the more heart-wrenching scenes of the day, rescue workers found the bodies of Farida Banu, 32, holding her three-year-old daughter, Riha, in her arms, around 6.30 am. Sandeep Ghode, 22, a jawan of the Thane disaster management response force (TDRF), who pulled out the body of the mother, said, “When we recovered the mother’s body, we saw the baby in her arms. She tried to save her child, but unfortunately, both died as a large piece of debris fell on her. Two of her other children were also found besides her. This sight made all of us emotional,” Ashiya claimed that by Saturday, the civic body will have a list of extremely dangerous structures and vacate them. The civic body chief also assured temporary shelter for those who will be vacated from their houses. “By Saturday, we will have a proper list of buildings, which are unsafe, and our team will inspect them personally. These buildings will be vacated 100 per cent and residents will be in transit camps, community hall or schools in the city on a temporary basis. Arrangements will be made by the civic body for them. This will be on priority,” said Ashiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-collapse-toll-is-38-search-on-for-a-toddler/story-WXEy6ymG2db1s0AG9BkXTL.html

After rain intensity reduced marginally around midnight, thundershowers were witnessed from around 3.30am onwards, followed by intense downpour till 5.30am. Thereafter, light to moderate continued through the day with heavy rain spells across some areas on Wednesday.“Most of MMR, especially the entire western side of Mumbai from Colaba to Bhayandar, was under a thick cloud cover (maximum height 7-8 km) causing very heavy rain spells since Tuesday evening. Short bursts of intense rain recorded across isolated areas and the trend continued throughout the night with thundershowers followed by intense cloud cover and light to moderate rain on Wednesday,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Between 8.30 am Tuesday and 8.30 am Wednesday, the Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs recorded 286.4 mm (extremely heavy) rain while Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 147.8 mm (very heavy) rain.Prior to 24-hour rain between Tuesday and Wednesday, the heaviest rain spell this season for Mumbai suburbs was between August 3 and 4 at 268.6 mm. The highest for south Mumbai, however, was August 5 and 6 at 331.2 mm.On Wednesday, between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm, the suburbs recorded 94.9mm (heavy) rain while 18.2mm (moderate) rain was recorded at south Mumbai.The India Meteorological Department classifies 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain, and over 300 mm exceptionally heavy.Between Tuesday and Wednesday, maximum rain was recorded towards south-central Mumbai at Bandra Kurla Complex at 366.4 mm and Dharavi 360 mm followed by the western suburbs Ram Mandir (including areas of Goregaon) 298.5 mm, Malad 257.2 mm, Borivli 204.4 mm, Dahisar 191 mm, and in the eastern suburbs Chembur recorded 209.8 mm and Bhandup 185 mm. Across MMR, Panvel received 250 mm rain, Navi Mumbai 183.7 mm, Bhayander 101 mm, and Thane 119.8 mm. “Such intense spells can cause localised flooding especially for low-lying areas, which caused severe discomfort for commuters on Wednesday morning. The impact of extremely heavy rain was maximum on road and rail transport,” said Hosalikar.Independent meteorologists said rain intensity was much more than expected due to a vortex formation off the Mumbai coast. “This system pushed cloud bands from the sea paving the way for very heavy to extremely heavy rain,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, adding that monsoon withdrawal could be delayed due to active La Niña conditions (a phenomenon when the western Pacific ocean warms up creating a low pressure near Australia pulling winds from the Indian Ocean strengthening equatorial dynamics keeping southwest monsoon circulation active). “This will delay withdrawal, allowing rains to linger on for some more time over the west coast and central India. Farmers need to take care of their crops as unseasonal showers can cause crop damage,” he said.Meanwhile, meteorologists said rain intensity was likely to reduce through the rest of the week with on and off moderate rains with isolated heavy spells. IMD predicted light to moderate rain from Thursday to Sunday and did not issue any colour-coded alerts.“Most likely heavy rain for this monsoon is over,” said Balasubramanian.In the Agripada incident, the deceased, identified as Jameer Mohammad, 27, and Shahjad Mohammad, 33, were pulled out the the lift by the Mumbai Fire Brigade and rushed to Nair hospital, where they were declared dead. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC,) however, said that the cause of the death was not known and will be revealed after a post-mortem.According to information from the Mumbai fire brigade, water entered the basement of the building and the lift stopped working as its circuit failed due to the logged water. The incident was reported to the BMC control room by the fire brigade at 11.45am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2020-monsoon-is-mumbai-s-third-wettest/story-uxZtWH2AryOEM9cP0Pj5bI.html

24-09-2020||City||Covid-19 review: UP officials asked to maintain vigil during festival season||Ghaziabad: Officials from the Union home ministry and Niti Aayog on Wednesday held a video conferencing with senior officials of Uttar Pradesh about Covid-19 preparedness in the western region of the state. During the meeting, officials of the four western UP districts were asked to heighten vigil in coming months, especially during the upcoming festival season when the movement of people will be high. The video conferencing was attended by Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), divisional commissioner (Meerut) and district magistrates of Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat and Meerut. The meeting was held in presence of Dr VK Paul, member of Niti Aayog and senior officers of the Union home ministry, besides the officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research. “Dr Paul asked all officials to take up steps for heightened vigil especially during the upcoming festival season. He stressed on creating more public awareness and adherence to Covid protocols such as use of mask and social distancing. The officials have also directed that all the symptomatic cases who turn negative through rapid antigen kits should be tested with RT-PCR method,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. According to Ghaziabad officials, officers from five Haryana districts, including Gurugram and Faridabad, also attended the video conferencing. Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar, said, “Our high rate of testing was pointed out during the discussions and presentation we gave. Our testing rate is high among the NCR districts. The officials of the Centre also said that studies have suggested that wearing of mask reduces the chances of contracting infection by 30%. The officials asked us to maintain the work we are doing and also ensure availability of beds.” The district officials also said that they have been asked to continue with surveillance and enforcement in containment zones in order to find out suspected cases and also to keep in check the spread of Covid-19 infection. “They termed our surveillance activities as satisfactory. From UP’s side, our officials also raised issue that a lot of manpower is devoted when it comes to enforcement in containment zones. We expect that the Centre may issue some further directions in this regard,” Pandey, the Ghaziabad DM, said. The Ghaziabad district till September 19 had a list of 629 containment zones. In this regard, the district magistrate said that he has spoken to the state officials with a proposal in which municipal corporation is to be roped in to manage affairs of the containment zones in the district. “I have spoken to the state officials if the corporation can be roped in and given responsibility of managing the containment zones. This, of course, will be done with the help of incident commanders who are officers of the district administration. In such a manner, better management of containment zones can be taken up. We are waiting for the response from state officials,” Pandey said. He added that during the video conferencing, the central officials have also asked for better monitoring of containment zones and keep track of how many patients were discharged, besides ensuring speedy facility allocation. Meanwhile, Awasthi on Wednesday evening said that the chief minister has directed that Covid-19 tests should be taken up for all high risk groups. “The CM said that high risk groups should be tested through RT-PCR method. He has also said that if anyone having symptoms turns negative through rapid antigen kits, should be tested through RT-PCR,” said the UP’s additional chief secretary (home). The high risk groups comprise people who are close contacts or family members of positive patients, old aged persons and people with co-morbid conditions. On Wednesday, Ghaziabad reported 205 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 12,831 in the district. Now, the district has 1,689 active cases, while 11,068 patients have been discharged. On the other hand, GB Nagar saw 152 new positive cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases in the district to 11,815.

24-09-2020||Delhi||Violence began with stone-pelting at Maujpur Metro station: Riots charge sheet||Stone throwing at Maujpur Metro station by a group of 200-300 Muslims at 5.23pm on February 23 was the first riot reported to Delhi Police in the communal violence that rocked north-east Delhi, according to the charge sheets filed on a conspiracy behind the violence. “After the police reached the spot, the mob started pelting stones on them in which five policemen were injured. This was the first set of medico-legal cases in relation to the north-east Delhi riots,” reads the charge sheet. It was the first of the 16,381 distress calls that the police control room (PCR) received between February 23 and 27, according to the charge sheet filed by the special cell of Delhi Police last week.The riots, which started as protestors against and for the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) and later acquired a communal colour, left 53 people dead and 607 injured.About an hour later, while a police team was dispersing the mob and collecting stones/bricks amassed at the spot, the control room received information about the second rioting incident from Kabir Nagar, Bhajanpura, less than a kilometre away from the Maujpur Metro station. In the charge sheet, police have mentioned that at 6.40 pm, two police officers were injured in the stone-pelting near a crematorium in Kabir Nagar. A police inspector who was on patrol duty with his team noticed a mob of over 100 people beating three men. The police team were attacked with stones and bricks when they went to rescue the person. The police have registered 751 different incidents of rioting, murder, arson, destruction of property and other sections in which 1,571 people have been arrested. Weapons usedFrom guns to wooden sticks and from a pair of scissors to plastic crates --- the rioters used all kinds of things as weapons, the charge sheet says, citing the recoveries made by the police. According to data cited in the charge sheet, at least 12 pistols, 121 empty and 92 live cartridges, 33 wooden sticks, one iron rod, 61 glass bottles filled with chemicals, two knives, four swords, a pair of scissors, stones, several plastic sacks, plastic crates, one plastic tub, stones and 11 slingshots were seized by the police from the sites where violence had taken place. According to the police, the riots were “deliberate, planned and caused after due preparations”. The police have attached the statement of a protected witness, who has claimed to have seen suspended municipal councillor Tahir Hussain and his men stocking glass bottles, petrol and acid, which were later used in the riots. Police have also alleged that the money to buy a pistol, which was used to murder a man named Rahul Solanki, was provided by Hussain and he handed it over to arrested suspect Mustaqeem (first name only).Hussain has in the past denied the allegations and said that he was a riot victim; that his house was damaged; his family had to flee for safety and that the police were framing him.Fire incidentsBetween February 24 and 27, the charge sheet shows, the fire department received at least 242 calls of arson from the police and local residents. Records show thatthe maximum number of calls, 95, were received on February 25. During the clashes, a tyre market in Gokalpuri, a parking lot with over 150 cars in Shiv Vihar, a petrol pump in Bhajanpura and houses and shops were burnt. The lone woman, who died in the riots, Akbari Begum, 85, was killed when rioters set her house on fire in Bhajanpura on February 25. The charge sheet says at least 1,130 commercial and residential properties were damaged in Karawal Nagar and Yamuna Vihar. The police said they are awaiting the survey report from other areas such as Seelampur and Shahdara. The government has so far disbursed Rs 21.93 crore against the damages claims while 185 claims are still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/violence-began-with-stone-pelting-at-maujpur-metro-station-riots-charge-sheet/story-t9QzDCNVTSdDDB0tUK3xbM.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Over 101k recoveries, 40 deaths in home isolation in Delhi so far, data shows||More than 123,000 Covid-19 patients have been treated under home isolation in Delhi, of whom 101,916 have recovered so far, and 40 have died, data available till September 17 from the directorate general of health services (DGHS) showed.The report also stated that between June 22 and September 17, a total of 54,251 pulse oximeters were given to Covid-19 patients under home isolation. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced on June 22 that pulse oximeters will be given to all Covid-19 patients being treated at home.Of the total patients prescribed home isolation, 2% had to be shifted to hospitals or Covid health centres as their condition worsened. Experts who reviewed the home isolation numbers said Delhi’s strategy has been “fairly successful”, with several other states implementing it after initially making institutional quarantine mandatory for all Covid-19 patients including asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms.“The idea of distributing pulse oximeters also seems to have worked in Delhi since the number of patients who had to be shifted to hospitals is just 2,474 out of 123,000 home isolation patients. Only around 0.032% patients in home isolation have died, which is also commendable. The practice of health care experts making follow-up calls initiated in Delhi is the key to treating Covid-19 at home because one cannot do away with medical supervision in a disease like this,” said Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research.At least 346,819 calls were made to patients in home isolation till Thursday, as part of the Delhi government’s tele-counselling scheme.But other experts argued that, ideally, no patients in home isolation should die.Dr T Jacob John, a retired professor of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore said, “If there is any death under home isolation, it only means there was neglect. The main cause of death in such cases is usually complications related to the reduction in oxygen saturation levels. The surveillance should be so strict that no senior citizen, even if asymptomatic, should be allowed home isolation, because they are the ones who die without showing any Covid pneumonia symptoms,” he said.As per the national guidelines for home isolation, which are followed in Delhi as well, elderly patients aged more than 60 years are allowed home isolation, but only after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer. John emphasised that the proper evaluation by the medical officers becomes very significant in such cases and that there should not be any lapses in the process.Data also showed that Northwest district, which has the highest case load of all 11 districts in Delhi, has the most patients under home isolation (22,435), recoveries (19,397) as well as deaths (11) under the same category. This was followed by west district, which had a total of 16,648 patients in home isolation till September 17.Only New Delhi and Southwest districts reported zero deaths under home isolation, as of September 17, while north district had the highest ratio of deaths with five of the total 7,987 patients under home isolation dying.Kant said the concept of home isolation helps the city take the load off hospitals.“This way, serious patients are treated and given better attention in the hospitals,” he said.As per Wednesday’s health bulletin, the number of Covid-19 patients in Delhi who are in home isolation fell by 1,379 as compared to Monday. On Wednesday, 17,834 persons were under home isolation, as compared to 19,213 on Monday. On Tuesday, the number had dropped by 750 compared to Monday, which was a decline recorded after nearly a month of a steady rise in such cases.Since last week of August, both the number of home isolation cases and containment zones have shown a steadily rise, except on September 19 when the count of home isolation cases was 18,648, a very marginal fall from the previous day’s figure of 18,701. However, this Tuesday, for the first time in nearly 30 days, home isolation case count fell by a sizeable margin of 749, to 18,646.The Delhi government said in addition to pulse oximeters it has now also started to provide oxygen concentrators to Covid-19 patients under home isolation who ask for it. “Our home isolation concept is perhaps the first of its kind not just in India but in the world. Our teams continue to contact each home isolation patient two to three times a day to check their body temperature, oxygen levels and symptoms, if any. It has also boosted the number of tests in the city as people are no longer afraid that testing positive for Covid-19 would mean having to be locked up in institutional quarantine. Since over 80% of Covid-positive persons in Delhi have been asymptomatic, it helped them recover in the comfort of their home and loved ones,” a government spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-101k-recoveries-40-deaths-in-home-isolation-in-delhi-so-far-data-shows/story-3ERbvUnBUEvythJ81ezb5N.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Crimes in Delhi up 275% from 2013: CAG report||Crime incident in Delhi increased by 275% in 2019 compared to 2013 even as “acute shortage” of manpower put the force under “tremendous strain” with average daily duty hours ranging from 12 to 15 hours against the prescribed eight hours, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report on manpower and logistics management in Delhi Police which was tabled in Parliament on Wednesday. The report says that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had approved 12,518 posts in the city police with advice to operationalise 3,139 posts first and then the remaining 9379 posts after deployment of 3139 personnel on ground.“…..However, due to failure of Delhi Police to recruit against these 3,139 posts, the remaining 9,379 approved posts could not be operationalised (August 2020). We found the functioning of the Delhi Police being affected by shortage in manpower,” a press release issued by the CAG quoted the report as saying.A Delhi Police spokesperson said, “We have now initiated a proposal for recruiting nearly 5,800 constables. The recruitment process is on.” According to the CAG release, the registration of heinous crimes such as murder, robbery, rape in Delhi increased sharply between 2013 and 2015 (from 4,159 to 11,187 in 2015). However, after 2015, registration of such crimes has been constantly decreasing, showing a positive trend. The police registered 5,185 henious crimes in 2019 compared to 4,159 in 2013.Former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar said he higher crime figures should never be seen as the index of performance of the police as it is the “easiest to meddle with these numbers” and underreport them to show the law and order situation to be improving.He said that while the police would do well to fill the existing vacancies, the answer does not lie in the numbers, but in the utilisation of the existing resources. “The more the number of police personnel, the more lax is the control of the police leadership over them. Instead, the leadership must use technology as a force multiplier and better utilise their existing personnel,” said Kumar.After Neeraj Kumar retired on July 31, 2013, BS Bassi, Alok Verma and Amulya Patnaik served as Delhi Police commissioners before SN Shrivastava became the police chief in March this year.According to the CAG audit, only one out of 72 police stations had staff as per the norms prescribed by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D). In other police stations, there was a manpower shortage of up to 35%.Outdated communication system According to the CAG report, the increasing number of blank calls received in the police control room (PCR) has been a major irritant affecting the performance of the emergency response system but a “satisfactory solution has not been found”.The audit found that the city police have been using a 20-year-old trunking system (APCO), which is 10 years beyond its normal life span. The proposals for upgradation of these sets were initiated 10 years ago, but even tenders have not been finalised yet, the top auditor says in the report.“The number of wireless sets under the conventional system declined from 9,638 in June 2009 to 6,172 in June 2019 as the sets condemned during the period were not regularly replaced,” the report says.It also pointed out that the police have installed 3,870 CCTV cameras at strategic locations across the city, but the percentage of cameras functioning satisfactorily is abysmally low with 31% to 44% cameras being defunct. The police spokesperson said, “A proposal for procuring a new and advanced communication system is at the advanced stage in the ministry of home affairs.” The CAG says that despite being Delhi’s specialised counter terror unit, the special cell lacked vehicles, protective equipment like bulletproof jackets, and arms and ammunition, which are vital for quick, real-time response.Problems with digital initiatives In its report, the CAG has pointed out the Delhi Police’s Himmat (Plus), women safety mobile application, witnessed a lukewarm response from the users despite a sizeable expenditure (₹ 18.5 lakh on development and ₹6.82 crore on publicity).“Out of a total 1.66 lakh downloads of Himmat/Himmat Plus app, there were 1.32 lakh uninstalls leaving only about 0.34 lakh users as of May 2019, which was much less as compared to users of women safety apps of Bengaluru Police (50,482) and Maharashtra Police (84,000),” says the report.The police spokesperson said, “More citizen-centric mobile applications are being added for effective and transparent functioning of police. It is for the public to use such facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crimes-in-delhi-up-275-from-2013-cag-report/story-rseuhpQhIqbzZnTJ0gFKzH.html
24-09-2020||Chandigarh||CPIM urges govt to take steps to address mental health crisis||Keeping in mind the recent suicide by a Covid-19 patient at a Shimla hospital, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM) has urged the state government to take steps to cope up mental health crisis in state.In a memorandum submitted to state health minister Rajiv Saizal, CPIM said that job loss, prolonged isolation, increase in domestic violence, fear and consequence of contracting the infection, and uncertainty regarding vaccine has led to upsurge in mental health issues ranging from distress, depression, anxiety and in some cases, deaths due to suicide.Population most affected include those already facing mental health issues, people who have recovered from covid, frontline healthcare workers, youth, physically challenged, women, workers of unorganised sector and the elderly. CPIM state secretariat member Kuldip Singh Tanwar said without proper physiological support at hospitals and covid care centres patients, attendants, non-covid patients and healthcare workers are becoming victim of stress and anxiety.“Resultant anger and anguish is being directed towards overworked, stressed and burned-out healthcare workers. Given that this situation is likely to persist in the near future, immediate actions need to be taken,” he said.The party also placed some suggestions and proposals before the government. CPIM urges government to deploy mental health specialists and counsellors in isolation, quarantine and covid care centres to ensure good mental health of people put under isolation and quarantine along with heathcare workers and attendants, said Tanwar.“Psycho-social support teams should be formed in all 12 districts,” he said. He stressed on strengthening mental health care system by appointing psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, clinical psychologists, social workers and counsellors on short-term basis and organise training and capacity building.“Undertake statewide awareness campaigns to cope with stress, depression and suicide ideation by involving different departments including education, women and child development, and social and voluntary organisations,” Tanwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cpim-urges-govt-to-take-steps-to-address-mental-health-crisis/story-QmdcNVe9tbU53cqULGOU6O.html

24-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: 3-year-old killed after SUV hits rickshaw||A three-year-old boy died after a SUV allegedly crashed into a rickshaw he was travelling in near sector 37 D on Tuesday morning. Police said the ’killer’ car driver was arrested and later released on bail. According to the police, the incident took place around 9am on Tuesday when the victim Harish, 25, a native of Rajasthan, had gone to Basai Enclave, along with his two sons, aged three and four, in his rickshaw. In the police complaint, Harish, said, “I stay in the slums on Basai road. On Tuesday, I had gone to Basai Enclave with my sons to fill water in some drums. We were returning to our house and had reached a road in sector 37D, when the incident took place. As I drove the rickshaw towards the crossing, a car crashed into it from the rear.” He added that due to the collision, the rickshaw lost balance and his three-year-old son fell on the road. “My son sustained severe head injuries. Several commuters immediately gathered around and nabbed the driver of the SUV. I took my injured son to a hospital in Kadipur in the car of the suspect but the doctors declared my son dead on arrival there. The incident took place due to rash driving by the driver,” Harish said.A police official, privy to the investigation said, “The car driver has been arrested and released on bail. We have registered a case and a probe has been initiated.” A case was registered against the driver under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code at sector 10 A police station on Tuesday, said police.

24-09-2020||Pune||Dry swab test: Four months on, CSIR awaits ICMR approval||Pune: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) director general Dr Shekhar Mande has termed delay in approving the dry swab test as “shame” while asserting that bureaucratic delay is hindering Science in the country. The CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) had announced dry swab in June though lack of approval from Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) blocking the entry of new method, which according to Mande, can save Rs 100 crore a day. Mande while speaking during Pune International Centre’s for Society series lecture on Tuesday said that dry swab test for Covid-19 has received positive response and yet it is still awaiting regulatory approval even after four months. The dry swab tests, according to Mande, have established its efficacy in multiple laboratories, including Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad; IISER Berhampur (Odisha) and Pune- based Armed Force Medical College. “What we needed in the country is to get Science rid of all the bureaucracy that exists. In fact, one thing that hinders Science in India is our bureaucracy. We had announced dry swab in June and yet on today’s date, we don’t have regulatory approval for one reason or the other. It’s a shame,” Mande said. ICMR scientist said what Mande claimed was incorrect. Dr Nivedita Gutpa, ICMR scientist at its epidemiology and communicable diseases department and the one who is responsible for testing augmentation said, “This information is incorrect. I have flagged this with DG ICMR.” Dr Gupta said ICMR will tweet its response though there was no update on Twitter till the time going to press. The dry swab method is the same as RT-PCR except it does not require nasopharyngeal swabs to be immersed in Viral Transport Medium (VTM). Under the RT-PCT test, nasopharyngeal collected from patients are immersed in viral transform medium followed by RNA extraction. The RNA then is subjected to RTPCR, which is considered gold standard across the world. Under the new method, scientists of CSIR-CCMB have generated a simplified protocol where dry swabs are collected and directly used for RT-PCR. “This method has been established to have no loss of sensitivity and is on par with the current gold standard of testing,” director Rakesh Mishra was quoted by CSIR on its website. Established in 1942, CSIR is an autonomous research and development organisation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi being its president. According to Mande, Armed Forces Medical College in Pune tried the dry swab test method and informed CSIR about its efficacy. “In fact, AFMC in Pune has now told us that the test works very efficiently.” Hindustan Times has sent an email query to AFMC and is awaiting response. Mande said that the dry swab test is cheaper by about half of RT-PCR. Mishra in his interaction had also explained that dry swab method will allow testing of more than 36 lakh people with recurring cost of Rs 3,740 crore. “Our method does not need any new reagent, equipment or training. What it says is: do differently, in a simpler manner, and skip a few items and steps,” Mishra had said. Earlier last week, Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) gave nod to India’s first Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic (CRISPR) Covid-19 test for commercial launch, said Mande. This is developed by Tata and powered by CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology) FELUDA (an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Limited Uniform Detection Assay).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-months-on-csir-awaits-icmr-approval-for-dry-swab-test/story-5zRuiRddXUwvQy3tY4X7yK.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Vehicle emissions fell to 5% in early lockdown: Study||Contribution of vehicular emissions to Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentrations reduced from 19% during the pre-lockdown period to only 5% during the lockdown period between March 25 and 17. It again increased to 15% during phase 3 of the lockdown in May, a new analysis has shown.The impact of the nationwide lockdown to halt spread of Covid-19 starting March 25 was visible on Delhi’s air quality but a source apportionment study commissioned by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to IIT Kanpur and IIT Delhi has revealed what exactly changed during the various phases of lockdown until May. The study was referred to by CPCB in its report titled “Impact of Lockdown on Ambient Air Quality” released on Wednesday.Vehicular emissions, local coal and waste burning and urban organic aerosols (generated from urban sources) reduced sharply from the pre-lockdown phase into lockdown phase and were found to be steadily rising again with increasing relaxations under the Centre’s Unlock plan.The share of biomass burning reduced 21% in the pre-lockdown period to 17% during the initial lockdown phase until April 17. The share of contribution from power plants increased from 10% before lockdown to 25% in the lockdown period. This could be because of decrease in contribution from other sources, the report said.The source apportionment study was conducted in four phases--pre-lockdown (February 19 to March 24), lockdown phase-1 (March 25 to April 17), lockdown phase-2 (April 18 to May 3) and phase-3 (May 4 to May 18). Maximum restrictions had been imposed during the first phase of lockdown.It was also observed that contribution from vehicular emissions in PM2.5 levels were found to be higher (14%) only in the pre-lockdown phase, while for all consequent phases the factor was found to contribute only in trace amounts. Similarly, both the coal combustion and waste incineration sources decreased steadily during lockdown months.Black carbon which is primarily contributed from biomass burning and traffic emissions in total PM2.5 composition dropped from 12% during pre-lockdown period to 6-8% during lockdown phases.Secondary chloride remained unaffected by the lockdown. “This is a research question as to why secondary chloride concentrations didn’t change. Secondary chloride is generated due to various other chemical compounds which may have chloride in them interacting with each other. We are still studying this,” said SN Tripathi, head, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur.Air quality in Delhi had improved compared to 2019 even during the pre-lockdown period in 2020. This may be due to meteorological conditions as well as the fact that a few restrictions such as those on cinema halls, schools, colleges, etc. were already in place during the first half of March, the CPCB report said. PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) levels reduced by 24% during the pre-lockdown phase, it further reduced by almost 50% during both lockdown phases as compared to levels observed during 2019. PM10 (coarse pollution particles) reduced by a massive 60%, with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels falling by 64%, benzene by 62% and sulphur dioxide (SO2) by 35%, during the second phase of lockdown as compared to levels in the same time period in 2019.“Real time source apportionment shows us the immediate effect of taking action against pollution sources. It can be a very important tool for decision making because it also shows how toxicity of emissions reduces with stopping of certain emissions and hence having health benefits,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vehicle-emissions-fell-to-5-in-early-lockdown-study/story-vsZs9BnufstZ19rOoEIDPN.html
24-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: 38 villages oppose being brought under MCG’s jurisdiction, to hold protests||Residents of 38 villages in the district — that are proposed to be brought under MCG’s jurisdiction — have opposed the move and said that they will stage a protest against it on Thursday. The members of a joint action committee of 38 villages on Wednesday said that 80 per cent land in these villages was still agricultural and there was no reason to bring them under the jurisdiction of an urban local body as the people were satisfied under the Panchayati Raj system. As per the committee, the 38 villages proposed to be brought under MCG are located in Gurugram, Sohna and Farruknagar tehsils. Twenty-seven of these villages are in Gurugram, seven in Sohna and four in Farruknagar block. These villages have about 3 to 4 lakh population living in them and the panchayats also have sufficient amount of funds with them, members said. “A large number of people will gather at Zila Parishad office on Thursday morning and then go to the mini-secretariat to submit a memorandum of our demands to the deputy commissioner. This transfer to MCG will be opposed strongly as this step is not in the interest of local people,” said Virender Singh ‘biru sarpanch’, while addressing a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. The members of the committee alleged that condition of villages, which had come under the jurisdiction of MCG after it came the corporation was formed in 2009, was pathetic. “Around 40 villages went to MCG and lost their land and their funds available with the panchayat. It seems the current government is also eyeing around 7,000 acres of land and over Rs 900 crore, which is currently held by the 38 panchayats,” said Sunder Lal Yadav, sarpanch, Sikanderpur Barha and also the president of district sarpanch association. The members of joint action committee also said that the panchayats in these villages have constructed public health centres, schools, chaupals and other community facilities and they apprehended that a takeover by MCG will downgrade the existing facilities, as had been the experience in several villages earlier. “We have been warned by sarpanches and residents of villages, which are currently under MCG, to fight against this move as it will damage the existing ecosystem, which is serving us well,” said Yadav. The committee members said they would approach MP Rao Inderjit Singh, and MLAs of Gurugram district to seek support for their demand and to ensure that government does not take this decision forward. Gurugram Mayor Madhu Azad —when asked about the opposition to the proposed extension — said that this proposal has been made by the government and the house was informed regarding this in the last meeting. “We have not received any memorandum or met any delegation in this matter till now. However, if people of these villages have reservations regarding extension of jurisdiction then we will certainly consider it and take up the matter with higher authorities and the chief minister,” said Azad. She, however, said that extension of municipal limits was a gradual process and it happens over time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-38-villages-oppose-being-brought-under-mcg-s-jurisdiction-to-hold-protests/story-WF5dAqSPve4MKjAV77UHkL.html
24-09-2020||Delhi||Headhunting at DU hit by pandemic, only 138 students placed this year||With the recruitment season finally coming to an end at most Delhi University (DU) colleges, institutes are assessing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the recruitment process this year.The university’s central placement cell, which placed over 1,160 students last year, was able to place only 138 students this year. Hena Singh, the in-charge of the placement cell, said this was due to the restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 lockdown.“We had planned to hold recruitments for over 2,500 students as we had tied up with several companies that were interested in bulk recruitments. But the hiring process involved the conduct of large-scale tests -- something that could not be done online. Also, the delay in announcing the results of final-year students impacted the numbers,” Singh said.Also Read: DU Admissions 2020: ‘ECA trials should be held with all Covid related precautions’Generally, exams for final-year students are completed by May or June. This year, in the wake of the pandemic, and a subsequent change in the exam pattern, several exams are still ongoing for a section of students and the results of all students are expected only by October or November.“We have been getting proposals for holding recruitments again and it may start again. Since the Covid-19 crisis has given rise to an unprecedented situation, graduating students should be given another chance and we will be holding discussions on what can be done,” Singh, who teaches at Miranda House, said.At Miranda House, the highest annual package this year was Rs18 lakh per annum as compared to Rs20 lakh per annum last year. The average package, however, rose from Rs6 lakh per annum to Rs7.33 lakh per annum.Also Read: Delhi University and Delhi govt again spar over funding of state collegesIshita Bhatia, president of the placement cell at Miranda House, said, “The placement process turned sluggish between March and May (lockdown period). However, it has picked up since August and companies are recruiting from the graduating batch of 2020.” Even colleges that fared better than last year are feeling the sting of the pandemic. In a placement report released by the Shri Ram College of Commerce on Tuesday, the college said the highest offer its students received this year was Rs31 lakh per annum; the same as last year. The average package this year stood at Rs8.4 lakh per annum -- a jump of Rs2 lakh per annum from last year. Also, more number of recruiters came to the campus this year. The highest package offered during the lockdown period of May to June was Rs17 lakh per annum and the average package during that period was Rs6.77 lakh per annum.Principal Simrit Kaur said the placement team was working closely with students whose offers were rescinded by companies. “Some students approached us after global companies rescinded on the offers made to them. In the case of smaller companies, our teams interacted with employers and tried to renegotiate the offers.”Sanshita Vij, student coordinator for placements at SRCC, said, “A noticeable change this year included a shift towards remote hiring and aggressive hiring to the divisions of sales and marketing, and business development by smaller startups. Bigger recruiters were more conservative.”At Lady Shri Ram College for Women, the highest package stood at ₹30 lakh per annum this year and the average package stood at ₹9.4 lakh per annum. Last year, the highest package offered was ₹37.8 lakh per annum.Arvind Kumar, convener of the placement cell at the college, said this was due to the Covid-19 crisis. “Few offers, less than 5%, were also revoked due to the crisis. Current aspirants should hone their IT skills which are going to gain more importance in the times to come,” he said.While the highest package at St Stephen’s College last year was ₹29 lakh per annum, this year the number dropped to ₹26 lakh per annum. The average base pay package for both the years, however, only had marginal difference with the amount standing at ₹10.25 lakh per annum this year.Shankar Kumar, faculty in charge of the placement cell at Hindu College, said, “Our college’s average salary increased by ₹1 lakh per annum from last year. If we look at the placement figures of top DU colleges, it won’t synchronise with the 23% fall in India’s GDP in the first quarter. The placement figures haven’t changed much from last year as companies that largely recruit from top colleges are from sectors such as information technology or accounting. These businesses were not affected by the pandemic as compared to other sectors such as service industry or tourism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/headhunting-at-du-hit-by-pandemic-could-only-place-138-students-this-year-says-recruitment-cell/story-fgfwhTN3BJslapWTT1YuRN.html
24-09-2020||Pune||Three arrested for illegally selling Remdesivir at a private hospital in Pune||Three persons, including a woman, were arrested on Wednesday for illegally selling Remdesivir injection, used for treatment of Covid-19, at a private hospital in Akurdi. The trio was identified as Vaishali Kunkar, Vijay Ranjane and Shahid Jabbar Shaikh. The men are ward boys and the woman is a security guard at the hospital, according to the police. “A complaint was lodged by a person whose friend’s father needed medicine for which they were approached by one of the accused. The trio took extra money to provide the medicine. They did not work at the medicine sale department,” said senior inspector Ganesh Javadvad of Nigdi police station. The complainant is a 19-year-old owner of an electronic store who lost his mother to Covid-19 while she was undergoing treatment at the same hospital between August 19 and August 23. Of the eight injections that he had paid for during his mother’s treatment, two were missing. The security guard, one of the accused, had sold the two injections to him at a hiked price, the complaint told the police. “As the complainant had paid a higher price for injections when his mother was admitted at the hospital, he caught the accused red-handed while fleecing his friend before filing a late-night application at the police station. The arrested ward boys used to take prescription and bring medicine. They used to steal one injection every day. They later sold it at a high price to patients who have already paid for it,” said assistant inspector Prashant Aradwad of Nigdi police station. A case under Indian Penal Code, Essential Commodities Act and Drugs and Cosmetic Act was registered at Nigdi police station against the three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-arrested-for-illegally-selling-remdesivir-at-a-private-hospital-in-pune/story-F5zd9rmj2FgiFi2StgSZSJ.html
24-09-2020||Pune||IMA seeks clarification on admission of patients from the state government||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has sought clarification from the state government regarding the admission of Covid-19 patients to private hospitals. The IMA points to the state notification dated September 18, which it claims discourages patients being admitted to private hospitals without an RT-PCR test, and only on the results of the rapid antigen test. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, said, “There are several points in the same notification which need clarification. The notification says that a couple of patients are admitted in private hospitals without an RT-PCR test, but only on rapid antigen tests. Does this mean that if a rapid antigen test of a person comes positive, is it not sufficient reason to admit? Is there any notification by the state or ICMR regarding that? If a positive RT PCR is the only criterion to admit the patient, why is the government carrying out rapid antigen tests?” Point four of the notification says, “It has been noticed that there are hospitals admitting patients who have not been tested as per RT-PCR and have been diagnosed based on rapid antigen tests or HRCT.” Dr Bhondwe said, “This point criticises that some patients are being admitted with HRCT reports. If in the initial clinical examination of a suspected patient HRCT shows evidence of Severe Bilateral Viral Pneumonitis, which is internationally accepted as a positive sign of the Sars-Cov-2 infection, should the hospital not admit? The results of the RTPCR test take a minimum of 24 hours, to three days at times. Still, as per your instructions the patient is not to be admitted? There are a large number of such cases when the RTPCR test turns positive after four days or remains negative, since there is no Viral Flora in the throat.” The Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra chapter had issued a strongly worded letter asking the state government to withdraw the notification, after which, the state government issued a clarification. The notification also says that hospitals that are not on the list of designated Covid health care centres are treating Covid positive patients, but also consuming a large amount of oxygen. This activity needs to be curbed immediately. The IMA has objected to the same saying that the association that is the local authority is not taking action against such hospitals if they are consuming a lot of oxygen. The IMA letter to the government dated September 22 said that these might be hospitals with ICU serving the community at large and must be supported with corrective measures to register them as Covid hospitals. The IMA has been in an open disagreement with the state government since the beginning of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ima-seeks-clarification-on-admission-of-patients-from-the-state-government/story-JjtSyFmJ32epkQuqIOjs4O.html
24-09-2020||Pune||State’s October 1 estimates for Pune show shortage of beds, manpower||Pune: The director of health services (DHS) has projected that Pune district will report about 3.23 lakh Covid-19 by October 1, and also deficit in the number of ventilators, oxygenated beds and even isolation beds. Although the district administration is adding more beds each day, shortage of manpower and expertise to take care of these extra patients is a major problem. As per the estimated projection by DHS, Pune district will report about a total of 323,539 Covid-19 cases, of which 67,894 will be active and the remaining 6,697 will be reported dead while 248,948 would have recovered. The estimates also project that going by the number of cases that are estimated to be reported from the district, Pune might face a deficit of over 2,300 isolation beds, 1,500 oxygenated beds and 200 ventilators. The estimate does not project any shortage of ICU beds without ventilators. The projection, when compared to the previous projection done for September 14, shows a positive trend with reduced percentage in case fatality and active cases while the recovery rate is seen to be improving. However, even as the number of cases is increasing, the administration is struggling to increase the bed capacity. To improve the bed capacity, the administration is likely to order private hospitals with available isolation beds to convert them into oxygenated beds. The earlier projection by the DHS for Pune as of September 14, is very close to the real figures that were reported by the state health department. As per the state health department’s September 14 press note, the district reported 235,419 total cases of which 152,297 were recoveries and the remaining 4,838 were declared dead and 78,284 were undergoing treatment. The projected figures for September 14 were total cases 230,194, recoveries 172,311, deaths 5,610 and active cases 52,272. The predicted deficit in infra for the same date was isolation beds 198, oxygenated beds 1,984, ICU beds 145 and number of ventilators 348. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We have been successful in adding 850 beds without O2, 545 beds with O2 and 39 ventilators since last Friday. Also, we are increasing the capacity of Sassoon General Hospital which has total 540 beds for Covid-19 patients and is undergoing repair works. Once the work is over, we will provide enough doctors and other paramedic staff and increase the capacity to over 800 beds. Also, we will add beds in DY Patil hospital, Baner Covid facility, COEP jumbo facility and add ventilators and other facilities.” During an online press meet, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We are increasing beds in rural areas too which has seen a fall in case fatality rate. By adding more beds in these areas, the stress on city hospitals will reduce.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-government-projects-over-3-23-lakh-cases-in-pune-district-by-oct-1-shortage-of-beds-manpower-estimated/story-9NfRzRD6ImdoCV2q7VSKvM.html
24-09-2020||Chandigarh||54-year-old woman dies by suicide in Covid isolation ward of Shimla hospital||A 54-year-old woman, diagnosed with coronavirus infection, hung herself in the isolation ward of Deen Dayal Upadhaya Hospital here on Wednesday. This is the first case in the state where a Covid patient has committed suicide in a hospital, police said. A resident of Chaupal in Shimla district, she tested positive for Covid-19 on September 18, after which she was referred to the hospital and admitted to the isolation ward, police said. The victim, a widow, hung herself from a balcony of the hospital with a dupatta (scarf) around 12.05am and was found dead by hospital staff who informed the police and her son. Her son said she was suffering from hypertension and frequent headaches, for which she was being treated at Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla. He said he did not suspect foul play. However, he said the staff had been negligent and demanded that an FIR be registered against the hospital. “My mother was killed due to negligence. No doctors had attended her since her hospitalisation on September 18. The staff had refused to attend her in the isolation ward saying they cannot use a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit for a single patient. She was traumatised with the treatment meted out to her by hospital staff,” he said. Negligence allegations grow shriller Multiple patients and their family members have levelled allegations of negligence against different hospitals in the state since the outbreak of the virus. A Covid patient who was hospitalised at Indira Gandhi Medical College died after he took a fall on September 10. His family members had alleged that the patient had been neglected. Not just laymen but politicians have also complained that the staff were negligent. Himachal Pradesh jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur, a senior minister in the state cabinet, had left IGMC alleging the staff were negligent after he had tested positive.

24-09-2020||Mumbai||Sonneratia alba species declared state mangrove tree of Maharashtra||The state government on Tuesday declared Sonneratia alba, or the mangrove apple, the official state mangrove tree. Maharashtra is the first coastal state in India to declare a state mangrove tree species to enhance conservation of the salt-tolerant vegetation. The government resolution (GR) issued on Tuesday noted that the state’s coastline benefits from mangrove vegetation and read, “Students and general public should be made aware about the importance of mangroves, and their support for the protection and conservation of these trees. Accordingly, the Maharashtra government declares Sonneratia alba as the state mangrove tree.” Sonneratia alba is an evergreen mangrove species that grows up to five feet; has white flowers with a pink base; and bears distinctive green apples as fruits. They often grow on newly-formed mudflats playing an important role in combating land erosion. The fruit is used to make pickles. Of the 60 mangrove species found globally, Maharashtra is home to 20. On August 7, the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) had approved a proposal for the declaration by the state mangrove cell under the forest department. “Mangrove presence is prominent along our coastline acting as shield against natural disasters and crucial in terms of carbon storage. More so, a large area near our urban centres has mangrove cover. Declaring a state mangrove tree gives our effort to protect this ecosystem a further boost,” said Aaditya Thackeray, state environment and tourism minister. Milind Mhaiksar, principal secretary (forest) said, “It is a welcome step which shows sensitivity as well as aesthetic recognition towards the important ecosystem of mangroves. The state is also on a fast track to complete the final notification of mangrove areas as reserved forest, and also hand over these zones to the forest department.” In Mumbai, the mangrove cell documented the species along Thane creek, Bhandup, Vasai and Dombivli along major mudflats. “The idea was to select a species which was neither extremely rare nor common, which could help us spread awareness among local communities and public at large about mangrove conservation,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). Experts said mangrove apple had the potential to thrive and the species and instinctively equips itself with a defence mechanism to fight future sea level rise where the state’s dominant species Avicennia could fail. “This declaration is symbolic both of our hope to fight climate change through nature-based solutions and the best way to do it that is through a community-based conservation strategy” said N Vasudevan, former mangrove cell head. MANGROVE CELL FRONTLINE STAFF SUCCUMBS TO COVID-19 Security personnel of the Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC) Tushar Shivaji Aavhad, 31, died at Sion Hospital on Monday. He is the first of the state mangrove cell’s on-ground, frontline staff to succumb to Covid-19. “Aavhad died due to health complications (brain haemorrhage) which aggravated after he tested positive for Covid-19. He was a head guard deputed at Mandale for mangrove protection,” said DR Patil, divisional forest officer (mangrove cell). Two other officers (another MSSC security personnel and a range forest officer) have also tested positive for Covid-19 and been admitted to different hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sonneratia-alba-species-declared-state-mangrove-tree-of-maharashtra/story-VPM2J3RYQTsOMkypOPa2pO.html
24-09-2020||World||Hong Kong Disneyland loses right to land near theme park ahead of reopening||Walt Disney Co.’s Hong Kong Disneyland Resort lost an option to expand its site after local authorities decided not to renew an agreement with the amusement park to develop a neighboring plot of land.Hong Kong won’t extend the 20-year purchase option, which expires Thursday, due to “the current economic conditions,” according to a statement Wednesday on the government website. A 60-hectare patch of land next to the theme park was reserved since 2000 to allow for possible expansion.It would be more “prudent” for the theme park operator to focus on developing the existing resort, a spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in the statement.The move underscores changing priorities for Hong Kong as it tries to revive its economy battered first by the anti-government protests and then by the coronavirus outbreak. Waves of challenges have badly hurt the city’s tourism sector and major attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland have been closed for most of the year.‘Extremely disappointed’Disney “will continue investing in the current expansion plan, however, we are extremely disappointed with the Hong Kong government’s decision not to extend the phase 2 land expansion option,” a Hong Kong-based company spokeswoman said in an email.Disneyland’s plan to expand within its existing Hong Kong site aimed at adding at least one new attraction almost every year through 2023, according to a paper submitted by the city’s legislative council in June. The plan was estimated in 2016 to cost HK$10.9 billion ($1.4 billion), according to the document.The theme park in Hong Kong is run by a firm that’s jointly owned by the local government and Disney. It’s scheduled to reopen on Friday with reduced capacity and enhanced health and safety measures.In January, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan said that he wanted to build temporary residential units on this site, urging Disney to consider its “corporate social responsibility.”Some local tycoons, criticized by state-run media for helping drive up home prices, have offered to donate land or cash to the government to avert any backlash from Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-disneyland-loses-right-to-land-near-theme-park-ahead-of-reopening/story-sEwtD4SbjZcIDStep2A7sM.html
24-09-2020||World||Trump non-commital on peaceful transfer of power after election||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to commit himself to allow a peaceful transfer of power if he lost his November 3 re-election bid, raising the largely unfounded prospect of widespread fraud in mail-in ballots.If it was a fair and free election, Trump claimed, there will be “continuation” of power, and not transfer.This is not the first time he was non-committal on the issue, taking the same stance most recently in an interview to Fox News. And as a candidate in 2016, he had refused to say he will accept the outcome of the election if he lost.“Well, we’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump said on Wednesday when asked by a reporter at a White House briefing if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power. “You know that. I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster.”Trump has been campaigning against large-scale use of mail-in ballots for the upcoming elections, alleging, without any evidence, that it will be used for election fraud by Democrats.There are two kinds of mailing ballot systems: universal mail-in voting, when states send ballots to all eligible voters; and absentee balloting, when a voter is sent a mail on request. President Trump himself has voted by mail. In 2016, nearly a quarter of all votes polled were cast by mail.More states are resorting to widespread use of mail-in voting for the November 3 elections because of concerns about the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic.“Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very ...very peaceful ... there won’t be a transfer, frankly,” Trump said at the briefing, adding, “there’ll be a continuation.”As before, President Trump’s refusal to give a commitment kicked up a storm.“What country are we in? I’m being facetious,” said Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president when asked for a response to the president’s remarks. “I said what country are we in? Look, he says the most irrational things. I don’t know what to say.”Backlash came also from Republicans. “Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power; without that, there is Belarus,” said Mitt Romney, a Republican senator and a former candidate for president, referring to the unrest in the former Soviet nation caused by the sitting president’s efforts to cling on to power in an allegedly rigged election. “Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,” he added.Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman, said: “The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America’s leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-non-commital-on-peaceful-transfer-of-power-after-election/story-kQaSV6hlbP7RYik7VSG4bL.html

Sunak said he could not ensure that every job is protected, but offered a lifeline to millions of people on furlough and to companies facing severe downturn.The government has been paying much of the wage bill of employees since April, which was due to end in October. But the recent surge in cases and the new curbs to last about six months prompted demands for extension of the schemes.Sunak said in a statement to the House of Commons: “The resurgence of the virus, and the measures we need to take in response, pose a threat to our fragile economic recovery…Our approach to the next phase of support must be different to that which came before”.“The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people’s jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve”. Sunak cancelled the annual winter budget due in October after making a series of Covid-influenced mini-budget statements in recent months.The economic plans announced so far amount to over £190 billion of support for people, businesses and public services - including paying the wages of nearly 12 million people, supporting over a million businesses through grants, loans and rates cuts.Sunak said: “Our lives can no longer be put on hold…We find meaning and hope through our friends and family, through our work, through our community. People were not wrong for wanting that meaning, for striving towards normality, and nor was the government wrong to want this for them.”“(The) truth is the responsibility for defeating Coronavirus cannot be held by government alone. It is a collective responsibility, shared by all. Because the cost is paid by all. We have so often spoken about this virus in terms of lives lost.

Nix gave this undertaking to the government: “From no later than January 2013 to March 2018 I caused or permitted SCL Elections Ltd or companies associated with SCLE to market themselves as offering potentially unethical services to potential clients, thereby demonstrating a lack of commercial probity including: bribery stings and honey trap stings designed to uncover corruption; voter disengagement campaigns; the obtaining of information to discredit political opponents; the anonymous spreading of information.”From October 5, Nix stands disqualified for seven years from acting as a director or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a company.Nix was a director of SCLE, a company that provided data analytics, marketing and communication services to political and commercial customers. He was also a director of five other connected UK companies: SCL Group Ltd, SCL Social Ltd, SCL Analytics Ltd, SCL Commercial Ltd, and Cambridge Analytica (UK) Ltd.From 2016, SCL Elections Ltd was included in a rebranding of associated companies which then operated under the trading names Cambridge Analytica, CA Political (Global) and CA Commercial.SCL Elections and the five connected companies, however, ceased trading following allegations in the UK and US media which created substantial adverse publicity. Some of the accusations against the companies related to allegedly offering potential clients unethical services.Officials said the unethical services offered by the companies included bribery or honey trap stings, voter disengagement campaigns, obtaining information to discredit political opponents and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns.Mark Bruce, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, said: “Following an extensive investigation, our conclusions were clear that SCL Elections had repeatedly offered shady political services to potential clients over a number of years”.“Company directors should act with commercial probity and this means acting honestly and correctly. Alexander Nix’s actions did not meet the appropriate standard for a company director and his disqualification from managing limited companies for a significant amount of time is justified in the public interest”.It emerged in 2018 that up to 87 million Facebook users potentially had their data hijacked by Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Facebook modified its data sharing app policies since then.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-ceo-of-cambridge-analytica-banned-from-running-cos-for-seven-years/story-0oM5UN3I46G07zA7o5omcM.html

All the money Mr.Lukashenko can get now will not go to support the Belarusian people but will go for those repressions,” she told reporters, referring to the pro-democracy crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-aren-t-legitimate-belarus-president-eu-tells-lukashenko/story-x4WrEg91QitE03NpdFKOYN.html
24-09-2020||World||Hong Kong activist Wong arrested over unauthorized assembly||Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said he was arrested again Thursday for allegedly participating in an unauthorized assembly last October.Wong tweeted that he was arrested when reporting to the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s Central Police Station.He said he was also accused of violating a pre-coronavirus pandemic law banning the wearing of masks in public places on the pretext they obscure identity.Wong was expected to leave the police station and address journalists later Thursday.He rose to prominence as a student leader during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests for universal suffrage, and is among a growing number of activists being charged for various relatively minor offenses since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the territory that has severely restricted political speech.He played a low-key role in mostly leaderless and sometimes violent anti-government protests last year that led to Beijing imposing the security law. However, with Beijing’s encouragement, Hong Kong authorities have been pursuing charges against major opposition figures for illegal assembly and other minor infractions in what some call a campaign to harass and intimidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-wong-arrested-over-unauthorized-assembly/story-ZKTkDBSHFA9JusIBNeJaQO.html
24-09-2020||World||France curbs city life in Europe’s battle to contain the spread of Covid-19||France introduced new measures to fight the rapid resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic in major cities, adding to risks weighing on an already slowing economic recovery.The first significant tightening of restrictions on daily life since the end of the lockdown in May includes closing bars at 10 p.m. in Paris and several other large urban centres. The tougher restrictions follow similar moves in the UK, as Europe reemerges at a hot spot for the disease.“If we don’t take measures rapidly, we risk being in a critical situation in some regions in a few weeks,” Health Minister Olivier Veran said at a press conference in Paris late Wednesday, insisting that the government isn’t considering another nationwide lockdown.There are signs the prospect of harsher curbs has already hit confidence, which improved less than expected in September. National statistics agency Insee said that while business leaders are more upbeat about recent activity, they are losing optimism about the outlook for their own companies and the entire services sector.“Today’s measures are an extra shock to confidence as it reminds consumers that it isn’t over,” said Julien Manceaux, an economist at ING. While some sectors could be hit, “it’s not a general shock.”France is the latest in a string of European governments to change tack in the face of mounting infection rates as they try to avoid the widespread restrictions that tipped the continent into a deep recession earlier this year. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week abandoned his appeal for Britons to return to offices as he warned of “many more deaths” unless people obey a raft of new restrictions.The British government is due to set out a fresh round of policies to support jobs on Thursday after abandoning plans for a fall budget. A government official said Wednesday that now is not the right time to outline long-term strategy, a sign the Treasury is preparing for months of economic disruption.In France, the virus has gathered force after tailing off at the start of the summer. The country has recently hit fresh highs in daily infections of more than 13,000 positive tests.Gyms in the hardest-hit French cities will be shuttered for two weeks, and there will be limits on public and private gatherings. In Marseille -- one of the most seriously affected areas -- all restaurants and bars will be shut from Saturday.Any new restrictions will apply for two weeks and can be extended, Veran said, adding that businesses affected will be compensated. Prime Minister Jean Castex will be under pressure to explain the strategy when he appears on TV talk show Thursday evening.“It’s an unfair decision that the government has taken only to mask its inability to handle the crisis,” Franck Trouet, spokesman for the employers’ union GNI, told Agence-France Presse on Thursday, adding that bars and restaurants will suffer from a new loss of business after having invested heavily to meet social distancing rules.Shares in exhibition organizer GL Events fell as much as 10% to its lowest level in more than a decade.The widening spread has disrupted national politics. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who is in quarantine after confirming he tested positive for Covid-19 last week, will hold a call Thursday with representatives from sectors hit by the new restrictions.France’s neighbors are reacting by restricting travel. Italy on Monday ordered mandatory virus tests for people arriving from Paris and some other parts of France. Germany on Wednesday added the regions of Brittany, Normandy and Centre-Val de Loire to its list of coronavirus “risk areas.” The Paris region has been on the list since the end of August.Many of the new infections have been linked to vacationers bringing the virus home, as well as young people socializing without respecting distancing and hygiene rules.So far, the fresh wave of infections hasn’t claimed large numbers of lives. More than 30,000 people died from the disease in France between March and July. The government reported 43 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 31,459.That’s given President Emmanuel Macron the leeway to use more targeted measures to fight the disease to minimize the hit to the economy, following the path taken by France’s European neighbours. The government has said that France can’t afford to impose another full lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-curbs-city-life-in-europe-s-battle-to-contain-the-spread-of-covid-19/story-7PbXvq4HrMME4gilBomdzN.html

We then provided all this information to the FDA (US Federal Drug Administration) and we are waiting to hear their decision,” Soriot told a virtual World Economic Forum discussion.The US trial of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, initially developed by the University of Oxford, remains on hold while regulators investigate an illness in one of the participants, even after a British study and other programmes outside of the United States have resumed. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Wednesday the continued suspension showed the FDA took vaccine safety seriously.A document posted online by Oxford university last week stated the illness in a British participant that triggered the pause on Sept. 6 may not have been associated with the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-still-waiting-for-fda-decision-to-resume-us-trial/story-NOIi6zguExvyqmsXbORL6K.html
24-09-2020||World||Israel tightens second lockdown amid surge in Covid-19 cases||Israel on Thursday moved to further tighten its second countrywide lockdown as coronavirus cases continued to soar.The Cabinet voted to close all non-essential businesses, including open-air markets. Prayers and political demonstrations would be limited to open spaces and no more than 20 people, and participants would not be able to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from home for either.The measures are set to go into force on Friday afternoon, as the country shuts down for the weekly Sabbath ahead of Yom Kippur on Sunday and Monday. Israel annually closes down for 24 hours in honor of the solemn holiday.The restrictions are to last for at least two weeks, but synagogues will be allowed to open under restrictive conditions for Yom Kippur prayers.The restrictions on demonstrations are subject to approval by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and the limits on both prayers and protests could spark a backlash. An anti-lockdown demonstration was planned for later in the day in front of the Knesset.Israel’s politically influential ultra-Orthodox community has objected to limits on public prayer during the ongoing Jewish High Holidays, and opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused the government of using the lockdown as a cover to end weekly demonstrations against his handling of the crisis.Israel is currently reporting nearly 7,000 new daily cases, making the outbreak in the country of 9 million people among the worst in the world on a per capita basis.Israel won praise this spring when it swiftly moved to seal its borders and shut down most businesses. By May, its daily rate of new cases had dropped into the double-digits. But then it reopened the economy too quickly, leading to a surge of new infections over the summer.Many businesses, meanwhile, have yet to recover from the earlier lockdown, and the new restrictions are expected to take a heavy toll on the economy even though they are being imposed during the holidays, when many businesses would ordinarily scale back hours.Israel has reported a total of more than 200,000 cases since the pandemic began, including 1,335 deaths. It has more than 50,000 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-tightens-second-lockdown-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-j7nhuZ4KmMjnQF5cxGkqpI.html

Now we estimate that it’s under 10,000 people a day getting the disease. That’s too high, but it’s still much lower than in the peak,” he told Sky News on Thursday.Britain reported 6,178 new daily cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday.Hancock also said the proportion of people getting a so-called false positive test result is below 1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/less-than-10-000-britons-catching-covid-19-per-day-says-health-secretary-matt-hancock/story-hMG8uLkWAXBnjR223xzjPJ.html

He did not elaborate.South Korea had asked for the telephone call, Japan said.Moon congratulated Suga and said that Japan and South Korea need to find the best solution on the war-time forced labour issue, said Kang Min-seok, a spokesman of the South Korea’s presidential Blue House.Moon said that South Korea and Japan are the closest friends who share basic values and strategic interests, as well as a partner that should cooperate for peace and prosperity of the world and Northeast Asia.The two leaders also welcomed scheduled talks on the special entry procedure for essential travels between the two countries and expected it would serve as an opportunity to resume personal exchanges and improve bilateral relations.The ties between Seoul and Tokyo soured after South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a Japanese steelmaker to pay compensation for forced labour in 2018, which prompted Tokyo to impose export curbs on some key high-tech materials.In a letter to Suga last week, Moon had said he was willing to sit down any time to improve ties. Suga replaced Shinzo Abe as prime minister last week.

24-09-2020||World||Seoul: North Korea shoots South Korean official, burns his body||South Korea said Thursday North Korean troops fatally shot a South Korean government official who may have attempted to defect and set his body on fire, after they found him on a floating object in waters near the rivals’ disputed sea boundary.According to Seoul’s announcement, the man disappeared from a government ship that was checking on potential unauthorized fishing in an area south of the boundary on Monday, a day before he was found in North Korean waters.North Korea sent officials wearing gas masks aboard a boat near the man to learn why he was there on Tuesday afternoon. Later in the day, a North Korean navy boat came and opened fire at him, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said.Sailors from the boat, putting on gas masks and protective suits, poured gasoline on his body and set it aflame, the Defense Ministry said, citing intelligence gathered by surveillance equipment and other assets.It was also unclear how he ended up in the North. But a defense official said the man might have tried to defect to North Korea. The official, requesting anonymity citing department rules, said the official was wearing a life jacket on a small floating object and that the military had obtained information that he wanted to go to North Korea.The official said North Korea may have determined to kill him in line with its stringent anti-coronavirus rules that involves shooting anyone illegally crossing the border.North Korea has steadfastly said there hasn’t been a single virus case on its territory, a claim widely disputed by many foreign experts. Observers say a pandemic could cause devastating consequences in North Korea because of its broken public health care system and a chronic shortage of medical supplies.South Korea sent a message to North Korea via a communication channel at the US-led UN Command in South Korea on Wednesday to ask about the missing official. But North Korea hasn’t responded, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.Senior military officer Ahn Young Ho told reporters Friday that South Korea strongly condemned North Korea’s “atrocious act” and urged it to punish those responsible. He said South Korea used various intelligence to hold North Korea responsible for the man’s death.Little is known about the 47-year-old, except that he was among 18 officials aboard the government boat belonging to the Oceans and Fisheries Ministry. When his colleagues searched for him after his disappearance, they only found his shoes left on the ship. Days of search involving aircraft and vessels came up empty handed, according to the defense and oceans ministries.The poorly marked western sea boundary is where several bloody naval skirmishes and two deadly attacks blamed on North Korea happened in recent years. The government ship was near South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island, which was hit by North Korean artillery in 2010, killing four people.The incident is expected to deepen already-strained ties between the rivals, whose exchange and cooperation programs have virtually all been suspended amid a deadlock in broader nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington. In June, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office on its territory to protest South Korean civilians sending leaflets against the North across the border.Conservative experts and politicians in South Korea argued that the government explanation the official might have attempted to defect lacked evidence. They say the government may want to prevent strong anti-North sentiments in South Korea to keep alive chances for talks with North Korea.“A public servant defecting to North Korea? I think it sounds bit strange as he has a stable job security,” said Choi Kang, vice president of Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. “Why did North Korea shoot a man defecting to the North voluntarily? I can also say the burning of his body was an attempt to conceal evidence.”South Korea’s liberal government led by President Moon Jae-in has faced criticism by conservatives that it’s sympathizing with North Korea too much and fails to respond strongly enough to the North’s provocation, such as the liaison office destruction and crude insults.In 2008, North Korean soldiers fatally shot a visiting South Korean tourist who wandered into a restricted area. South Korea’s then conservative government responded by suspending tours to the North’s scenic Diamond Mountain resort.The main conservative People Power Party urged Moon’s government to take stern action. “The reason for the government’s existence is protecting its people and their property,” a party statement said.Defections of South Koreans to North Korea are highly unusual. More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea in the past 20 years for political and economic reasons.In July, however, a North Korean defector slipped back to North Korea, prompting North Korea to impose a lockdown of a border city and declare a state of emergency over virus concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-north-korea-shoots-south-korean-official-burns-his-body/story-D7v1QV8at3UT6JJMdzdS6K.html
24-09-2020||World||Parts of Canada already in second wave of Covid-19, says PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is already evident in parts of the nation.Public health authorities have already stated the resurgence was real but stopped short of describing it as a second wave. But Trudeau defined it as such. “In Canada’s four biggest provinces, the second wave isn’t just starting, it’s already underway.”Trudeau’s 12-and-a-half minute long address, for which he sought airtime from all major networks in the country, came just hours after his government laid out its programme before Parliament in the Throne Speech delivered by the Governor General Julie Payette.“I want to speak directly to you today because Canada is at a crossroads.” Trudeau said, explaining the reasoning behind the rare public broadcast.His speech, given in English and French, painted a stark picture for Canadians.“We’re on the brink of a fall that could be much worse than the spring.” He pointed out that the numbers were “clear” as when Canada went into lockdown on March 13, there were 47 confirmed coronavirus cases, while on Tuesday, it recorded “well over 1,000.”As the surge is being caused mainly by cases being reported within younger demographics suffering from “Covid fatigue”, Trudeau said, “It’s no time for a party.”He said while Canadians can’t change the numbers being reported currently, they could change where the country is in October and into the winter. “It’s all too likely we won’t be gathering for Thanksgiving, but we still have a shot at Christmas,” he said. Canada has far more tools in its toolbox, the PM noted, and sought cooperation in wearing masks, taking precautions and using a tracking app released by the government.Canada recorded 147,612 cases by Wednesday evening, including 1,085 for the day, an 80% rise over the past fortnight. It also tallied 10 fatalities to take the total death toll to 9,244, going into double digits after weeks.Earlier on Wednesday afternoon, as the parliament reopened in Ottawa, the government presented its platform, which will form the basis of its legislative agenda for the session. Among these were extending welfare payments in a new form into at least mid-2021 as well as a similar tenure for a wage subsidy programme that can be availed by employers.While the government has come under fire from the Opposition for taking on record debt and ballooning the deficit to new highs, it was clear Trudeau is looking at increased spending as a way out of the crisis. As it put in the Throne Speech, “The economic impact of Covid-19 on Canadians has already been worse than the 2008 financial crisis. These consequences will not be shortlived. This is not the time for austerity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parts-of-canada-already-in-second-wave-of-covid-19-says-pm-trudeau/story-zpESwjmeS5cPUgj8mWTjJK.html
24-09-2020||World||Pak oppn alliance against Imran Khan is crumbling, with some help from the army||Within days of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s hard-hitting speech challenging the army leadership’s interference in Pakistan’s politics, the grand opposition alliance created to unseat the Imran Khan government seems to be crumbling.Not surprisingly, this comes with a little nudge from the military.While the government was unable to counter much of the allegations levelled by Nawaz Sharif, it was the army that sprung into action with a series of media leaks and statements which created rifts in not only the political alliance but in Sharif’s own party PML-N, pitting his brother Shahbaz Sharif, who is also party president, on a collision course with his daughter Maryam Nawaz, who is party vice president and Nawaz’s political heir.The first statement after the former premier’s speech to a meeting of the alliance came the very next day from the army chief, Gen Qamar Bajwa, himself. Meeting selected parliamentarians, Bajwa said Pakistani military did not have role in matters related to politics.He added that the military did not play any part in the recently passed FATF-linked legislations, the workings of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the political proposals for Gilgit Baltistan (GB). The government had rammed through a bunch of bills linked to compliance with Financial Action Task Force, the global watchdog on money laundering and terror funding, in a joint sitting of parliament after several of them were defeated by the Senate.Insisting that political leadership was responsible for all these matters, Bajwa conceded that GB had strategic importance and therefore broad-based consultation was necessary. The government is moving ahead with holding elections and declaring province status for GB, both opposed by India which considers it a region within Jammu and Kashmir illegally occupied by Pakistan.While this debate was gathering momentum, it was leaked to the media two days ago that key opposition party leaders had met with Gen Bajwa, and the head of the ISI Lt General Faiz, days ahead of the All Parties Conference of the fledgling alliance. Railways minister Shaikh Rasheed, who is seen to be close to the military, made this disclosure as he taunted the opposition for criticising the army on the one hand and meeting with it on the other.It emerged that the meeting was attended by Shahbaz Sharif, along with his party colleagues Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal on behalf of the PML-N while the PPP was represented by party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and senator Sherry Rehman. The leak embarrassed most of those who attended. Shahbaz Sharif confirmed the meeting and said nothing more. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari clarified that they had attended a briefing on national security and such briefings are usually kept secret.In a hurriedly called press conference, he justified the meeting with the military as Prime Minister Imran Khan had failed to engage with the opposition on national security issues that have arisen during his tenure, such as worsening of relations with India following the Pulwama attack. He also said that the issue of Gilgit Baltistan was discussed at the meeting.Soon after, PML-L leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif took this opportunity to criticise her allies and take a pot shot at her uncle and party president Shahbaz Sharif.She told the media on Wednesday: “They (opposition leaders) were called (to the GHQ, the military headquarters) on the issue of Gilgit Baltistan. This is a political issue that should be settled by the peoples representatives.... These issues should be decided in the parliament, not in the GHQ.”Asked if the PML-N leaders who went to see the army had Nawaz Sharif’s blessings, she denied having any knowledge of that. However, she said “the political leadership should not be called nor should it go to discuss such issues”.Reacting to Maryam statement, railways minister Sheikh Rasheed further disclosed that the PML-N leadership held not one, but two meetings in the last two months with the military leadership. In the meantime, Maryam’s statement seems to have hit its target and the military retaliated within hours. In response to her claim that Nawaz Sharif had not been part of the meeting with the army, the head of the Pakistan Army’s media wing disclosed that senior PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair held two meetings with Gen Bajwa in recent weeks about the former prime minister and his daughter.Babar Iftikhar told a news channel on Wednesday night that both meetings were “requested” by Zubair, a former Sindh governor. “In both meetings he (Zubair) talked about Mian Nawaz Sharif sahib and Maryam Nawaz sahiba,” Iftikhar said, adding “The army chief made it clear to him (Zubair) that whatever their (Nawaz and Maryam’s) legal issues are, will be solved in Pakistan’s courts, while the political issues will be solved in the parliament.”The army’s line appears to be that they don’t interfere in the country’s politics and that all politicians come to them for help, including Nawaz Sharif.When asked about it, Zubair said he had had personal ties with Gen Bajwa for more than 40 years. “There’s nothing unusual about the meeting,” he told an interviewer, adding he never approached the army chief when the PML-N was facing difficulties.“As a friend, I thought I should brief him (Bajwa) on the state of economy of Pakistan and issues of governance. But I told him in clear words that I had not come to seek relief for anyone in my party, neither had I come on the request of anyone — neither Nawaz nor anyone else.”While the army seems to have won the latest round, what is clear is that the issue of military interference in the country’s political landscape will continue to be debated. It has also shaken the government of Imran Khan, who is being accused of coming to power on the back of a rigged election.Analyst Kamran Yousaf said that the days of the Imran Khan government may soon be over, and that a government cobbled with consensus could be taking charge. But others strongly disagree.At the same time, most analysts say that Nawaz Sharif’s speech to the APC via video link from London, where he is undergoing medical treatment, seems to have stirred a hornet’s nest. His contention that the army is now a “state above a state” will echo in corridors of power for a long time to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-alliance-is-crumbling-with-some-help-from-the-army/story-1ugLydxbeYRfVkUvNFaaKM.html

Zhong is now Asia’s second-richest person, behind India’s Mukesh Ambani, and is the 17th wealthiest in the world, ahead of Charles Koch and Phil Knight.Nicknamed “Lone Wolf” for his eschewing of politics and clubby business groups, Zhong’s fortune has jumped $51.9 billion in 2020, more than anyone else in the world except Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk. Both suffered heavy declines on Wednesday as tech stocks stumbled and Tesla plunged after its “Battery Day” event fell short of expectations. Musk’s fortune dropped by almost $10 billion.The initial public offering of bottled-water company Nongfu Spring Co. -- which turned out to be Hong Kong’s most popular among retail investors -- propelled Zhong to China’s top three richest earlier this month. That came after the April listing of vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. pushed his net worth to $20 billion by early August.Zhong now leads a wealth ranking in China that is typically dominated by people who made their fortunes from tech companies.While Zhong has surpassed Ma as China’s wealthiest, the tech tycoon might soon regain the top spot, which he’s held for most of the past six years after Alibaba went public in the U.S. Ant Group’s IPO next month is poised to boost his fortune, with his stake estimated at $28 billion if the company achieves the $250 billion valuation people familiar with the matter have said it’s targeting.Wednesday was brutal for U.S. tech stocks, which tumbled the most since earlier this month. The plunge in Musk’s wealth was the biggest among the people on the Bloomberg ranking of the world’s 500 richest, followed by Bezos, whose net worth dropped by $7.1 billion. Musk is now worth $93.2 billion and Bezos $178 billion.

He’s going to need it,” Trump said.The couple recently moved into a California home after announcing they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said was unbearable intrusion and racist attitudes from the British media.Meghan, star of the TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018. They have a young son named Archie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-s-not-a-fan-of-meghan-s-wishes-harry-luck-as-he-is-going-to-need-it/story-tgztvGTrUGPrqRYvNf2UoI.html

Various parts of the world have been under strict lockdowns following the Covid-19 outbreak, forcing organisations to let their employees work from home. “It is amazing to see how well the work from home (WFH) culture has worked and I hope will continue even after the pandemic is over,” Gates told an online business summit organised by financial daily The Economic Times. “But once this pandemic ends, we will rethink on what percentage of time we spend in offices... 20, 30, 50 per cent. Lots of companies will expect their employees to spend well below 50 per cent of their time in offices and may be the rest of the companies will go the normal way,” he added. Gates, who co-founded Microsoft and also the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said he has not travelled for work this whole year. “Honestly I have got time to do much more. It’s been.. eye opening for me,” he said.   However, the world’s biggest philanthropist said WFH has not been as engaging, for which software has to improve a lot. Software engineering has surprisingly worked well but when kids are home, homes are small and there are chores, it is difficult to work. For women, they have too many things to handle so WFH comes with its own drawbacks, he pointed out. On his outlook on the end of the pandemic, Gates said “the message from me and others resulted in very little... Even the US, from which you would expect to have the best response with the great scientific research, did a very poor job in getting ready with this and now we are faced with incredible damage.” “Hopefully we will learn our lessons and be better ready next time but in the meanwhile we have so much work to be done,” he emphasised. Stating that China did not do a perfect job in getting the data out initially about the virus, he said this led to wasting time. On whether the strict two-month lockdown has worked in India, he said the country did some “incredible things” like use of digital infrastructure to transfer money to households in need. But the challenge for India is its population, he said, adding a lot of people live in slums and dense areas and they cannot be asked to maintain social distancing. Besides, many people have jobs where remote working is not possible, he said. “India was always going to face much bigger problems compared to Europe and the US. We hope as we get into fall, things don’t get worse although the cold temperature is not good for containing the virus. “Right now some great things are happening, the Premjis, Primals, the Tatas etc are stepping up efforts to minimise the damage,” Gates added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/work-from-home-culture-to-continue-even-after-pandemic-ends-bill-gates/story-vH8WsZ2poeSYhxutOs8SKO.html
24-09-2020||World||US Presidential polls: Trump won’t commit to peaceful transfer of power if he loses||President Donald Trump on Wednesday again declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the Nov. 3 presidential election.“We’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump said at a news conference, responding to a question about whether he’d commit to a peaceful transfer of power. “You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.”It is highly unusual that a sitting president would express less than complete confidence in the American democracy’s electoral process. But he also declined four years ago to commit to honoring the election results if his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, won.His current Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, was asked about Trump’s comment after landing in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday night.“What country are we in?” Biden asked incredulously, adding: “I’m being facetious. Look, he says the most irrational things. I don’t know what to say about it. But it doesn’t surprise me.”Trump has been pressing a months long campaign against mail-in voting this November by tweeting and speaking out critically about the practice. More states are encouraging mail-in voting to keep voters safe amid the coronavirus pandemic.The president, who uses mail-in voting himself, has tried to distinguish between states that automatically send mail ballots to all registered voters and those, like Florida, that send them only to voters who request a mail ballot.Trump has baselessly claimed widespread mail voting will lead to massive fraud. The five states that routinely send mail ballots to all voters have seen no significant fraud.Trump on Wednesday appeared to suggest that if states got “rid of” the unsolicited mailing of ballots there would be no concern about fraud or peaceful transfers of power.“You’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer frankly,” Trump said. “There’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control, you know it, and you know, who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.”In a July interview, Trump similarly refused to commit to accepting the results.“I have to see. Look ... I have to see,” Trump told Chris Wallace during a wide-ranging July interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.”The Biden campaign responded Wednesday: “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”The American Civil Liberties Union also protested Trump’s remarks. “The peaceful transfer of power is essential to a functioning democracy,” National Legal Director David Cole said. “This statement from the president of the United States should trouble every American.”Trump made similar comments ahead of the 2016 election. When asked during an October debate whether he would abide by the voters’ will, Trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.”It’s unlikely that any chaos in states with universal mail-in voting will cause the election result to be inaccurately tabulated, as Trump has suggested.The five states that already have such balloting have had time to ramp up their systems, while four states newly adopting it — California, New Jersey, Nevada and Vermont — have not. Washington, D.C., is also newly adopting it.Of those nine states, only Nevada is a battleground, worth six electoral votes and likely to be pivotal only in a national presidential deadlock.California, New Jersey, Vermont and D.C. are overwhelmingly Democratic and likely to be won by Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-trump-won-t-commit-to-peaceful-transfer-of-power-if-he-loses/story-LVuJ7oiaE2lR9DKHRLIqJI.html
24-09-2020||World||Study suggests dengue fever may provide immunity against Covid-19||Amid the ongoing surge in the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, several organizations and institutions across the globe are conducting research to develop a vaccine or to find out a disease that might combat Covid-19.Since the last eight months, over 47,000 scientific papers have appeared in medical journals that talk about ways of dealing with the disease. The information obtained from these papers has helped in forecasting the outcome of Covid-19 and developing effective measures to control it.According to news agency Reuters, a study was conducted that analysed the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil- which is the third worst-hit nation after the United States and India. The country has registered over 4.6 million cases so far. The deaths are nearing 140,000 while the active and recovered cases stand at 178,743 and 923,699 respectively, according to Worldometer figures.The study which was exclusively shared with Reuters found a link between the spread of Covid-19 and past outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral disease dengue, which further suggested that exposure to dengue might be able to provide immunity against the virus to some extent.The study, which has not been published yet, was led by Miguel Nicolelis who is a professor at Duke University. It compared the geographic distribution of Covid-19 cases with the spread of dengue in 2019 and 2020.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe study was being published ahead of peer review on the MedRxiv preprint server and will be submitted to a scientific journal.Nicolelis discovered that the places which had lower Covid-19 infection rates and a slower case growth had suffered intense outbreaks of dengue in 2019 or 2020.“This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between dengue’s Flavivirus serotypes and SARS-CoV-2,” the study said, referring to dengue virus antibodies and the novel coronavirus.While speaking to Reuters, Nicolelis pointed out previous studies that showed those with dengue antibodies in their blood could test falsely positive for Covid-19 even if they were never infected.“This indicates that there is an immunological interaction between two viruses that nobody could have expected, because the two viruses are from completely different families,” Nicolelis said, adding that further studies are needed to prove the connection.The study highlighted an important co-relation between lower incidences, mortality and growth rate of the virus in Brazil, where levels of antibodies to dengue were higher.Also read| Covid-19 vaccine: When will US get its first vaccine?The team led by Nicolelis also found a similar relation between dengue and Covid-19 in several parts of Latin America, Asia and islands in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.Nicolelis added that his team came across the dengue discovery by accident, during a study focused on how Covid-19 had spread through Brazil, in which they discovered that highways played a major role in the distribution of cases across the country.After identifying certain case-free spots on the map, the team went in search of possible explanations and a breakthrough came when the spread of dengue was compared with that of Covid-19.

24-09-2020||World||Police officers not charged for killing Breonna Taylor||A Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for the killing of Breonna Taylor during a drug raid gone wrong, with prosecutors saying Wednesday that two officers who fired their weapons at the Black woman were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire.The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s that had people in it. The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on the night of March 13.Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” marched through the streets.Also read: 1 fatally shot at Breonna Taylor protest park in KentuckyPolice in Louisville, Kentucky, said Wednesday night that an officer had been shot. It’s not clear if it happened during the protests and no other details were immediately released.Scuffles have broken out between police and protesters, and some were arrested. Officers in riot gear fired flash bangs and a few small fires burned in a square that’s been at the center of protests, but it had largely cleared out ahead of a nighttime curfew and demonstrators marched through other parts of downtown Louisville. Dozens of police cars blocked the city’s major thoroughfare.Demonstrators also marched in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Philadelphia.Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers who entered her home on a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation. State Attorney General Daniel Cameron, however, said the investigation showed the officers announced themselves before entering. The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor’s case became a major touchstone for nationwide protests that have drawn attention to entrenched racism and demanded police reform. Taylor’s image has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silk-screened on T-shirts worn by celebrities. Several prominent African American celebrities joined those urging that the officers be charged.The announcement drew sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further. The wanton endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years.“To not indict the officers for murder is to claim #BreonnaTaylor killed herself. Racist America constantly kills Black people and then tells Black people we killed ourselves,” tweeted Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University and the author of “How to Be an Antiracist.”Also read: Black Lives Matter: Beyoncé wants officers charged in Breonna Taylor’s deathMorgan Julianna Lee, a high school student in Charlotte, North Carolina, watched the announcement at home.“It’s almost like a slap in the face,” the 15-year-old said by phone. “If I, as a Black woman, ever need justice, I will never get it.”Right after the decision, protesters began gathering in Louisville, with some preparing food and others bringing cases of water to “Injustice Square,” the park where people have demanded justice for Taylor.While the rallies were largely peaceful, police in protective gear carrying batons mobilized in downtown, and some scuffles broke out. Officers could be seen handcuffing some people. Police also ordered a group that broke off from the protests to disperse, warning that chemical agents might be used if they didn’t.Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he authorized a limited deployment of the National Guard. Guard members and armored military vehicles were in downtown Louisville, and streets were blocked off with barricades, fences and large trucks.Beshear also urged Cameron, the state attorney general, to post online all the evidence that could be released without affecting the charges filed.“Those that are currently feeling frustration, feeling hurt, they deserve to know more,” he said.The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill Black Americans and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.At a news conference, Cameron spoke to that disconnect: “Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.”“But my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. ... My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,” he added, choking up.But Cameron, who is the state’s first Black attorney general, said the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them. He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor’s apartment announced themselves before entering — and so did not execute the warrant as “no knock,” according to the investigation. The use of no-knock warrants has since been banned.“According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,” he said. “This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor’s death.”Cameron said an FBI crime lab determined that Cosgrove fired the bullet that killed Taylor.Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but prosecutors later dropped the charge.Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who was coming into the home and fired in self-defense.Cameron, who is a Republican, is a protégé of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who has been tagged by some as his heir apparent. His was also one of 20 names on President Donald Trump’s list to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.At a news conference, Trump read a statement from Cameron saying “justice is not often easy.” He praised both Cameron’s handling of the case and the governor’s calling up of the National Guard.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden told reporters that he didn’t have enough information on the decision to comment fully but warned protesters to keep demonstrations peaceful.“Do not sully her memory or her mother’s by engaging in any violence,” he said.Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate and a former prosecutor, also told reporters she hadn’t fully read the decision.“But there’s no question that Breonna Taylor and her family deserved justice yesterday, today and tomorrow, so I’ll review it,” she said.Hankison was fired on June 23. A termination letter sent to him by interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said the white officer had violated procedures by showing “extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly” fired his weapon.Mattingly, Cosgrove and the detective who sought the warrant, Joshua Jaynes, were placed administrative reassignment.Last week, the city settled a lawsuit against the three officers brought by Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, agreeing to pay her $12 million and enact police reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-officers-not-charged-for-killing-breonna-taylor/story-44Hcd2SHrhgMVcNHTas10I.html

24-09-2020||World||US Navy releases documents from Cold War loss of submarine||The Navy began releasing documents from the investigation into the deadliest submarine disaster in US history on Wednesday, but the Navy said the documents released under a court order don’t shed any new light on the cause of the sinking.The first of the documents released were 300 pages from the official inquiry into the sinking of the USS Thresher on April 10, 1963.The loss of the nuclear-powered submarine and all 129 men aboard during a test dive in the Atlantic Ocean delivered a blow to national pride during the Cold War and became the impetus for safety improvements.“The loss of Thresher was a defining event for the submarine service,” said Rear Adm. William Houston, director of the undersea warfare division in the office of the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon.The Thresher story was already well known. It had undergone sea trials and was back in the ocean for deep-dive testing about 220 miles off Massachusetts’ Cape Cod.The first sign of trouble was a garbled message about a “minor difficulty” after the 279-foot (85-meter) submarine descended to more than 800 feet.The crew indicated it was attempting to empty ballast tanks in an effort to surface. The crew of an accompanying rescue ship heard something about the “test depth.” Then the sailors listened as the sub disintegrated under the crushing pressure of the sea.The Navy inquiry found weaknesses in the design and construction of the first-in-class nuclear-powered submarine, which had been built at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and based in Groton, Connecticut.The documents released Wednesday included the timeline of the sinking, evidence lists, reports, testimony and correspondence. But there were some redactions. Even more than 50 years later, technical details including the test depth were redacted.In the documents, the Navy said it believes an interior pipe burst and caused electrical problems that caused an emergency shutdown of the nuclear reactor.The documents noted that the commanding officer’s evaluation of the first year of operations – before additional work was conducted at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard -- included praise the submarine. But he also said the submarine was overly complex in many areas and he noted a vulnerability of the auxiliary salt water system.“He stated, ‘In my opinion, the most dangerous condition that exists in Thresher is the danger of salt water flooding while at or near test depth,’” the report said.The brazed joints in pipes were a special concern, and many electrical panels were not adequately protected from sea water in the event of a leak, the report said.Resting on the ocean floor at a depth of 8,500 feet, the Thresher looks as though it went through a “shredding machine” and is spread out over a mile, University of Rhode Island oceanographer Robert Ballard told The Associated Press in 2013. Ballard used his 1985 discovery of the RMS Titanic as a Cold War cover for surveying the Thresher.Not everyone was satisfied with the Navy’s conclusions.Retired Capt. James Bryant, commander of a Thresher-class submarine, requested the documents under the federal Freedom of Information Act and ultimately went to court to demand the documents’ release. He thinks there’s more to be learned from the documents, most of them classified.Michael Shafer, whose father and uncle both died on the Thresher, said some of the families need to review the documents to see for themselves and fully understand what happened. His suspicion is that the Navy was pushing the limits and placing personnel at risk during the Cold War.“I want to know the truth, the whole truth. Not some smoke screen from the Navy,” he said Wednesday from St. Petersburg, Florida.A judge in February ordered the Navy to release the documents. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the review of the documents. Eventually, more than 1,000 pages of documents will be released.If there was a silver lining, it was that the tragedy so shook the Navy that it accelerated safety improvements and created a program called SUBSAFE, an extensive series of design modifications, training and other improvements.One submarine has sunk since then, the USS Scorpion in 1968, and it was not SUBSAFE-certified, the Navy said.Some of the improvements included better welding techniques, and the main ballast tank blow system that helps a submarine reach the surface was made more effective.Joy MacMillan, one of four siblings who lost their father, the submarine’s chief radioman, said it’s helpful to know the tragedy spurred safety improvements. But it’s still important for the families to have the documents, and some closure.“After being 57 years in the dark, it’s time for the families to know any and all information so that we can put it away. We can say, ‘Mistakes were made. Let’s move on,’” MacMillan, of Brentwood, New Hampshire, said Wednesday.The sinking was the first of a string of calamities in 1963.The March on Washington was a turning point in the Civil Rights movement, but the Vietnam conflict grew, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Alabama and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-releases-documents-from-cold-war-loss-of-submarine/story-dcx37TeWZe4YSpFSY019pK.html
24-09-2020||World||White House could veto FDA’s vaccine rules, says Trump||President Donald Trump signalled that he could veto any tightening of US rules for the emergency clearance of a coronavirus vaccine, a move that could increase concerns that the race to find a Covid-19 shot is being politicized ahead of the presidential election.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to soon issue final guidelines for an emergency-use authorization. Regulators and drugmakers have in recent weeks vowed to adhere to science, not politics, in deciding when a vaccine is ready to reach the market.At a news conference on Wednesday, Trump said it “sounds like a political move” when asked whether the FDA was considering stricter standards for an authorization, suggesting that the White House could intercede if it thought the agency was too rigorous.“That has to be approved by the White House,” Trump said. “We may or may not approve it.”A representative for the FDA declined to comment.If a vaccine shows promising early signs of being safe and effective, it could be allowed to reach the market on an emergency basis before full results from a clinical trial are available. Companies including Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson have vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials. Some of those studies could produce efficacy data as soon as October.Trump is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in polls ahead of the November election, with surveys showing that a majority of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the virus. Trump has sought to focus on other topics while claiming that his administration is doing a good job handling the virus.The president has been promising that a coronavirus vaccine will be approved within weeks -- a gambit to turn a pandemic inoculation into an October surprise for his struggling re-election campaign.Trump and his supporters have also questioned whether government employees are trying to sabotage his efforts to combat the virus. In August, the president attacked the FDA for harboring “deep state” staff slowing vaccine and drug work to hurt him politically. There’s no evidence that’s the case.FDA officials have indicated they would hold a vaccine to a higher standard than other medications that typically receive emergency waivers from the agency.Peter Marks, head of the agency’s biologics office, earlier this month described what he called an EUA-plus program that would accelerate the review of a vaccine but require data standards similar to those that are used when the FDA is considering a full approval.Marks also said at the time that the FDA would like companies to have a median of two months of follow-up on trial participants after they receive the vaccine.“That’s what we’re hoping for,” Marks said. “Most adverse events will happen about a month and a half after vaccination.”He also said any plan for an emergency authorization would include longer-term follow-up once the vaccine is on the market.The FDA has been attempting to rebuild trust as Trump publicly pushes for a vaccine to be authorized by the Nov. 3 election. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been criticized for exaggerating the benefit of a plasma treatment the agency authorized for use against the virus last month. Hahn has tweeted several times since that outside FDA advisers would review vaccine data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-could-veto-fda-s-vaccine-rules-says-trump/story-3133VQbDWoJFKi29nntSnL.html
24-09-2020||World||‘Lies and shady motives’: China fumes at Donald Trump||China on Wednesday slammed US President Donald Trump for his hard-hitting remarks against Beijing at the UN General Assembly session, saying his allegations were full of “fabricated lies” driven by “shady political motives”.In his address on Tuesday, Trump blasted China for “unleashing” the plague of the “China virus” to the world, demanding that the UN must hold Beijing accountable for failing to contain the pandemic.Slamming Trump’s speech, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said his remarks about China “disregarded facts and fabricated lies”.“And driven by shady political motives, President Trump used the UN podium to level unfounded accusations against China. China firmly opposes these smears. Such acts have again shown that unilateralism and bullying are the biggest threat to the world,” Wang said.“Lies can in no way masquerade as truth. The world is fully aware of China’s record in containing Covid-19, and the people have their fair judgement,” he said, adding, “China is a victim of the virus.”Saudi king targets IranSaudi Arabia’s King Salman used his speech before the UN General Assembly on Wednesday to stress his country’s Islamic roots and slam rival Iran.The monarch touted the kingdom’s role as president of the G20 this year, and the billions of dollars in humanitarian aid Saudi Arabia gave to countries around the world.He said West Asia has been suffering from major political and security challenges, blaming Iran for the region’s instability. He blamed Iran for targeting Saudi oil facilities last year, saying: “It demonstrated that this regime has total disregard for the stability of the global economy or stability of oil supplies to international markets.” He said Iran has exploited a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers “to intensify its expansionist activities, create its terrorist networks, and use terrorism,” adding that this had produced nothing but “chaos, extremism, and sectarianism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lies-and-shady-motives-china-fumes-at-donald-trump/story-jReZv54el0vDW0VZxrAsHL.html

The company, which is developing the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis through its subsidiary Janssen, said it anticipated the drug would be ready for emergency approval by early 2021 if proven effective.“As Covid-19 continues to impact the daily lives of people around the world, our goal remains the same - leveraging the global reach and scientific innovation of our company to help bring an end to this pandemic,” said Alex Gorsky, the company’s chairman and CEO.Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, “Four Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in Phase 3 clinical testing in the US just over eight months after Sars-CoV-2 was identified. This is an unprecedented feat for the scientific community made possible by decades of progress in vaccine technology.”The US has given J&J about $1.45bn in funding under Operation Warp Speed. The vaccine is based on a single dose of a cold-causing adenovirus, combined with a part of the new coronavirus called the spike protein that it uses to invade human cells.J&J used the same technology in its Ebola vaccine which received marketing approval from the European Commission in July.The company said it was poised to imminently publish the results from an earlier stage of the trial on a medical preprint site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-johnson-johnson-begins-phase-3-trial-with-60k-people/story-jXVrxaHjcYh11NtvE7dwaP.html
24-09-2020||World||200k Covid-19 deaths in US, but Trump says could’ve been 2.5 million||As America’s death toll from Covid-19 crossed 200,000, President Donald Trump called the alarming milestone “a shame” even as he deflected the blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China.“I think if we didn’t do it properly and do it right, you’d have 2.5 million deaths,” the US president told reporters, defending his administration’s handling of the health crisis. The world’s most powerful nation hit the figure 41 days before a presidential election, and as the World Health Organization warned that new cases worldwide have risen to record highs.Trump used a video address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday to attack Beijing for not stopping the spread of what he called the “China virus”. He has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the crisis, even as the United States suffered one of the world’s highest death tolls.According to a tally run by the US-based Johns Hopkins University, more than 31.6 million people have been infected worldwide and nearly 972,000 have died from Covid-19 since the virus emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019.Across the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a fervent appeal to the public, urging them to diligently follow the new curbs or face the prospect of yet another lockdown. He sent out the message in a special broadcast of Tuesday evening, hours after outlining a new set of restrictions.He said, “(Unless) we take action, the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later… If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space - once again - to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs.“And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods, but the loving human contact on which we all depend… We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/200k-covid-19-deaths-in-us-but-trump-says-could-ve-been-2-5-million/story-hg0E5JxhQlgJ4gvY02F38N.html
24-09-2020||World||Indians in US raise $3.3mn for Biden in one night, seek moderate positions on Kashmir, CAA||Indian Americans raised $3.3 million on a single night for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a possible record, and pressed his campaign to moderate its positions on Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as also to add an agenda for the Hindu community on its web platform.Around $2mn was written in by “big donors” and $1.3mn came in from smaller donors, said Ramesh Kapur, a member of the Biden-Harris National Finance Committee 2020, who participated in Tuesday night’s fundraiser, adding he believed this was a record amount raised by the community at any single-night fundraiser.Biden acknowledged that he knew and understood this was because of Kamala Harris, his Indian-American nominee for vice president, Kapur said.The main virtual fundraiser, which followed Biden’s interaction with a handful of Indian Americans such as Kapur, was attended by over 200 people and headlined by Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, who is among those the community is pushing for a cabinet position in a possible Biden administration. He introduced the former vice-president, recalling how he had helped with his rocky confirmation hearing process in the Republican-controlled US Senate.Some Indian Americans who wanted to “do more than just write cheques” also took the opportunity to press the former vice-president on his campaign’s position on Kashmir, CAA and the “lack of equal treatment” of Hindus, who don’t have a dedicated section on the campaign platform’s section titled “Joe’s Vision”. There are various segments in that section of the website, which also explains Biden’s agenda for communities including Indian Americans, Muslims, Jews and catholic Christians.The segment on Muslim Americans says, “In Kashmir, the Indian government should take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of Kashmir. Restrictions on dissent, such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the Internet, weaken democracy. “Joe Biden has been disappointed by the measures that the government of India has taken with the implementation and aftermath of the National Register of Citizens in Assam and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act into law. These measures are inconsistent with the country’s long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious.”Many in the Indian American community have called this an egregious overreach by the Biden campaign, amounting to interference in the internal affairs of another country. Even Democrats such as Sunil Puri, an Illinois businessman, were irked and have publicly and privately pushed the campaign to “moderate” its position.“Joe do you even know that you’re making all these comments about (article) 370 and Kashmir,” Puri said recounting his remarks to the former vice-president. “And if you do, it’s a complicated situation. And before we jump in and make comments about what are other country’s internal affairs, (we should understand) we wouldn’t want India to tell us what to do.”Puri, who was on the White House presidential commission on Asian Americans during President Barack Obama’s tenure, also said he cautioned Biden against taking the Indian American community for granted, citing a recent poll in which Biden’s support among Indian Americans is 65%, down from 77% in 2016 had backed Hillary Clinton, the then Democratic nominee.The poll of the Indian American community by Indiaspora-AAPI Data showed that while Biden’s support in the community has fallen compared to Clinton’s, President Donald Trump’s has gone up from 16% in 2016 to 28%. This shift has been attributed by some to the Biden campaign’s positions on Kashmir and CAA, among other things.“We have the Christian page, we have the Muslim page, but we don’t have a Hindu page,” Kapur said, recounting his remarks to the former vice-president at the fund-raiser, adding Biden asked him to call him.The Indian American community, which has 1.8 million eligible voters, is being wooed aggressively by both Biden and Trump campaigns, especially in the battleground states that will determine the presidential election on the basis of electoral college seats, not the popular vote.While most of them lean Democratic and will vote for Biden, according to the Indiaspora-AAPI poll, they feel aggrieved by on account of the Kashmir and CAA positions; enough to not be allayed by the campaign’s expansive programme for Indian Americans and Biden’s repeated assurances that relations with India will get “high priority” in his administration.Even at the Tuesday fundraisers, he repeatedly expressed concern over Chinese aggression along the border with India. He brought it “twice” and on his own said Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-in-us-raise-3-3mn-for-biden-in-one-night-seek-moderate-positions-on-kashmir-caa/story-skRsMw2Mfdg6Hz4XauLBxI.html

Requests from Afghan Sikhs to be granted permission to settle in India had increased since a terror attack on a Sikh place of worship in the Afghan capital earlier this year, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual weekly news briefing. Nearly 30 people, most of them Sikhs, were killed in the attack in Kabul in March. The attack was blamed on the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which have close ties with the Pakistani military establishment. “We have been receiving requests from Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan to grant them permission to settle down in India,” Srivastava said. “These requests have specifically gone up after the attack in the gurdwara in Kabul in March,” he said, without giving details regarding the number of requests received by New Delhi. “We see a targeted persecution of the minority community members by terrorists and their sponsors, and this is a matter of serious concern,” Srivastava said. “To ensure their safety and well-being, the Indian mission in Kabul has been actively in contact with them and they are facilitated [for] their smooth arrival from Afghanistan despite the Covid-19 related restrictions,” he added. “So far, 357 members of the minority community have arrived from Afghanistan to India since the lockdown and the Indian Sikh community is assisting in making their stay comfortable in India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/request-by-afghan-sikhs-to-settle-in-india-rises-after-gurdwara-attack-in-march/story-h6hMzk9zHCaGqghMDC8lZN.html
24-09-2020||India||India rejects Pak’s Gilgit move||India on Thursday strongly opposed any move by the Pakistan government to make Gilgit-Baltistan that country’s fifth province, saying such an action would have “no legal basis whatsoever” since the region has been militarily occupied. Pakistan’s minister for Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan affairs, Ali Amin Gandapur, recently spoke about official plans to make the region, a part of the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of parliament. The move comes ahead of the holding of local elections in Gilgit-Baltistan in November, and it reportedly has the backing of the powerful military establishment. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is backing the move to boost its chances of faring better in the upcoming elections.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the government has seen statements by the Pakistani leadership and media reports about the proposed changes in Gilgit-Baltistan. “Any action by Pakistan to alter the status of the militarily occupied so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ has no legal basis whatsoever and is totally void ab-initio,” he said.“Our position has always been clear and consistent. The entire territories of the union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have been and are an integral part of India, and would remain so,” he said, adding that Pakistan has “no locus standi to comment on India’s internal matters”. The Pakistan government’s move comes two years after powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for Gilgit-Baltistan were transferred to a local assembly. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order renamed the Northern Areas as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in parliament. The Gilgit-Baltistan issue also figured in recent secret meetings between Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed and top political leaders such as Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People’s Party, who raised questions about the holding of free and fair elections in the region. The proposed changes in the strategic Gilgit-Baltistan region have also been spurred by the Pakistani military’s concerns related to India’s scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir last year. However, senior PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the daughter of former premier Nawaz Sharif, has said that issues such as Gilgit-Baltistan should be decided in Parliament and not at the military headquarters. In reply to another question, Srivastava said the ministry had summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat and lodged a strong protest through a note verbale, or unsigned diplomatic correspondence, about the recent kidnapping of a woman from the Sikh minority. “The kidnapping led to anger and worries among the Sikh community, and they conveyed this to the Indian side...There are some reports that the woman has been freed,” he said. “This is not the first incident of its kind, there were others in the past. We have told the Pakistan government to take all possible steps to ensure the security of the minorities,” he said. Replying to another query on Pakistan denying visa to diplomat Jayant Khobragade, who was proposed by India as the next acting head of the Indian mission in Islamabad, Srivastava said the Pakistani side had “some reservations” but didn’t give details. “This is an administrative issue and we are handling it,” he said. Khobragade’s name was proposed to the Pakistani side in June, days before New Delhi asked Islamabad to reduce the strength of its high commission by 50%. The move triggered a reciprocal decision by the Pakistani side. On Sunday, Pakistan contended Khobragade was too senior for the post and sought to link bilateral ties to the resolution of the Kashmir issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pak-s-gilgit-move/story-t2WP6e7i38KXSE3M2Fm93I.html

24-09-2020||India||Does Brazil Covid study offer some clues on herd immunity?||Unchecked spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the Brazilian city of Manaus offers some clues on what achieving herd immunity against the virus may take, a new study has suggested.The pandemic ripped through Manaus, a city of 2.1 million that lies at the centre of the Amazon rainforest region, in March and April with tens of thousands of infections, but the spread slowed down.Now, a study -- published on the pre-print server MedRxiv before peer review – said the results of antibody analysis of banked blood and mathematical modeling led them to estimate that between 44% and 66% of the population of the city was infected.This, the study said, was sufficiently high to have reached the threshold of herd immunity, in which enough members of a population develop immunity to a disease so as to break the chain of infection. “The unusually high infection rate suggests that herd immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic,” the researchers wrote in the study, which was first reported by MIT Technology Review. “All signs indicate that it was the very fact of being so exposed to the virus that brought about the reduction in the number of new cases and deaths in Manaus,” the study’s coordinator, University of Sao Paulo professor Ester Sabino, told the Sao Paulo State Research Support Foundation (Fapesp), which helped fund the study.Manaus recorded its first infection in March and over the next two months was ravaged by the disease in the absence of quick state response or social distancing. Media reported overwhelmed health care workers struggling to control the disease, overrun hospitals and mass graves dug to accommodate rising fatalities. But deaths started slowing down in recent weeks – from a daily high of 79 to just four in the past 14 days. The city is currently reopening after a months-long lockdown in Brazil, the country with the second-highest death toll worldwide. “The elevated mortality and the rapid and sustained drop in cases suggest population immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic in Manaus,” the study said.The authors cautioned that their results could not be extrapolated directly to other contexts due to differences in population demographics, behaviour, vulnerability to infection, as well as implementation and adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures.The concept of herd immunity has triggered vigorous debate across the world with health experts warning that any attempt to reach the threshold was a risky policy that endangered the health of thousands of people. “Community immunity via natural infection is not a strategy, it’s a sign that a government failed to control an outbreak and is paying for that in lives lost,” tweeted Florian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-brazil-covid-study-offer-some-clues-on-herd-immunity/story-e9iylculvciKbBEvTBG0QO.html
24-09-2020||India||Manipur CM inducts five ministers in Cabinet rejig||The three-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition government in Manipur on Thursday inducted five new ministers and dropped six ministers in a Cabinet reshuffle that aims to bring stability to the government that was rocked by dissension in June. The newly inducted ministers include BJP MLAs S Rajen (Lamsang),Vungzagin Valte (Thanlon),Th Satyabarta (Yaiskul) and two former MLAs O Lukhoi (Wangoi) and Okram Henry (Wangkhei). Lukhoi and Henry were Congress MLAs who resigned and joined the BJP on August 11, hours after the Congress moved a no-confidence motion against Biren Singh led government , which was defeated on the floor of the house. Three other Congress MLAs have also resigned with them and joined the BJP. Henry is nephew of former chief minister and Congress leader, Okram Ibobi Singh. Political experts said the reshuffle shows the the BJP’s central leadership has imposed faith on CM Singh and has punished National People Party for rebelling against him in June, when three NPP ministers had resigned and supported the claim of former chief minister and Congress leader Ibobi Singh. The three ministers who were dropped on Wednesday are V Hangkhalian, who held the agriculture and animal husbandry portfolio, Nemcha Kipgen (Social Welfare and Cooperation), and Th Radheshyam (Education, Labour and Employment).Later, on Thursday, three more ministers L Jayantakumar (Health & Family welfare),K Shyam(Consumers Affairs Food & Public Distribution) and N Kayisii( Tribal Affairs & Fisheries) were dropped from the ministry. While Jayantakumar and Kayisii are from the National Peoples’ Party (NPP), Shyam belongs to Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). The NPP and the lone LJP MLA has helped the BJP to form in the government in 2017 even though the BJP got 21 seats as against 28 by the Congress in 60 member house. Biren Singh was able to get support of all non Congress MLAs and form the government. In June, 2020, 9 MLAs including four of NPP and one TMC and independent MLA withdrew support to the BJP and decided to back Ibobi Singh’s claim to form the government. However, the BJP was quick to react and took the rebel MLAs to Delhi for a meeting with home minister Amit Shah. After the meeting, the rebels returned to the BJP fold and government was saved. On August 11, the Congress moved a no-confidence motion against the BJP government. Five Congress MLAs skipped the assembly session, thereby reducing the strength of the house and helping the BJP to win the trust vote. They later in the day resigned from the legislative assembly membership. The swearing-in ceremony of the five ministers was held at around 5pm in the banquet hall of Raj Bhavan in Imphal as per the existing standard operating procedure. The oath of office was administered by governor Dr Najma Heptulla.“The reshuffle is a routine affair as desired by national leaders for development of the state,” Biren SIngh said after the swearing in. The BJP led government in Manipur came to power in March 2017 with support of four MLAs each from NPP and NPF besides one MLA each from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party, and an Independent in the 60 member House.The effective strength of the house is 47 on account of 5 Congress and 3 BJP MLAs resigning and 5 Congress MLAs disqualified. The BJP has 18 MLAs each and has support of 11 other MLAs. The Congress also has 18 MLAs now. With by-polls to the 12 assembly elections slated with Bihar assembly elections, the BJP is confident of getting majority on its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-cm-inducts-five-ministers-in-cabinet-rejig/story-54MjML22N8LYVKldhedL4N.html
24-09-2020||India||‘Can of worms opened?’ Cong on CAG’s report||The Congress on Thursday attacked the central government over the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report that said the maker of the Rafale jets, Dassault Aviation, and the weapons supplier MBDA did not confirm the transfer of technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which was part of the contract. In its report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, the country’s top auditor pointed out that several offset contracts built into multiple defence deals had “not yielded the desired results”. The observations were part of CAG’s scrutiny of a raft of offset contracts — including the Rs 59,000 crore Rafale deal — between 2005 and 2018.“The offset obligations should have started on 23-9-2019 and the first annual commitment should have been completed by 23-9–2020, that is yesterday. Will the government say if that obligation was fulfilled? Is the CAG report the opening of a can of worms?” asked former finance minister P Chidambaram. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the country was facing a huge loss due to the delay in the transfer of technology. India’s offset policy stipulates that in all capital purchases above Rs 300 crore, the foreign vendor has to invest at least 30% of the value of the purchase in the country to boost indigenous capabilities. In the case of the Rafale deal this was 50%.“There are two important points in the report. Firstly, it is being claimed that the work will be done in the seventh year, which is 2021. That means you won’t do anything in six years. And secondly, forget 50% not even 37% has been completed in terms of technology transfer. We are not saying this. The CAG has said it. This is complete fraud. We have been raising this issue because it is in the public interest,” he added.Congress party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “Chronology of biggest Defense deal continues to unfold. The new CAG report admits that ‘technology transfer’ shelved in #Rafale offsets. 1st, ‘Make in India’ became ‘Make in France’. Now, DRDO dumped for tech transfer. Modi ji will say everything is ok.” However, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who repeatedly attacked the government over the Rafale deal during the 2019 general elections, did not comment on the CAG findings. The BJP declined to comment on the Congress allegations.According to the CAG report, the defence ministry stated as recently as October 2019, (the first Rafale was handed over in France on October 8, 2019) the vendors had not yet been able to confirm their capability for technology transfer.To be sure, in case of the Rafale deal, the DRDO’s offset share worked out to 30%, while 20% has been allocated to the private sector, including Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) -- Dassault’s joint venture (JV) with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group. CAG did not pick any loopholes as far as the 20% allocation to the private sector, and asked the defence ministry to get more details about its progress.The report said the defence ministry stated in October 2019 that the vendors had not been able to “confirm their capability to carry out the requisite upgradation”.“Thus, it is not clear if even this technology transfer (for engine) will take place, and there is need for the MoD/DRDO to identify and acquire the right technologies in order to comply with the directions of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) given in September 2016,” the report said.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later.This replaced a previous United Progressive Alliance regime decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Congress alleged that the new deal entailed buying the fighter jets at a higher price. The government denied this, and the Supreme Court said in a judgment that the deal did not require scrutiny. A February 2019 CAG report said the deal to buy the jets was kosher and cheaper than that was being negotiated by the UPA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-of-worms-opened-cong-on-cag-s-report/story-F4HALHpKvF3jib6TrFlgsM.html
24-09-2020||India||Nationwide shutdown over farm bills row on Friday: 10 points||Various farmer organisations have given a call for a nationwide protest (Bharat bandh) on Friday. These groups are protesting the passage of farm bills in Parliament. As many as 31 farmer groups, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), and 19 political parties have extended support to the strike.These parties include Congress, Trinamool Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal, Aam Aadmi Party, and Telangana Rashtra Samithi.Here are the 10 points about the protest:* The leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in Punjab will stage a three-hour “chakka jam” to protest against the contentious bills. The road blockage will begin from 11 am. The railways has suspended several trains and partially cancelled 20 till September 26 in view of the strike and the “rail roko” agitation called in Punjab. The “rail roko” agitation began on Thursday and will continue for three days.* In Haryana as well, several organizations have extended their support to the nationwide strike.* In Delhi, the police are on high alert and will maintain high security at all border points amid the demonstrations. It will also seal its border with Haryana to prevent any untoward incident.* In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party workers will support the strike in the state. In Congress-ruled Rajasthan, demonstrations are expected.Also read: Farm bills are welcome, but farmers need a rights-based protection law | Analysis* The Congress had called the bills “anti-farmer” and on Thursday said it will challenge the “black laws” in court. It has termed them “unconstitutional” and against the country’s federal structure.* The SAD has also described the bills as “anti-farmer”, and wants the government to withdraw them. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had even met President Ram Nath Kovind requesting him to not give assent to these bills.* The three farm bill legislations - Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, were passed by Parliament earlier this week.* The legislations have received staunch criticism from various farmers’ bodies and Opposition parties. The agitating farmers fear that these reforms will lead to end of the “Mandi system” and are only in the “interest of big corporates”.* The government has maintained that these bills are in favour of farmers and will “revolutionise the agriculture sector”. The government also maintains that systems of the minimum selling price (MSP) and government procurement will continue unhindered and the passage of the bills do not affect them in any manner.* The Opposition parties accuse the government of pushing through the bills in Rajya Sabha while ignoring calls by many members for a division of votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nationwide-shutdown-over-farm-bills-row-on-friday-10-points/story-kaFJl5tefHcCqvP848rgOO.html
24-09-2020||India||Farm bills: Punjab, Haryana farmers to go on strike tomorrow||Farmers in Punjab and Haryana will go on a strike on Friday in protest against the contentious farm bills that were passed in the Parliament. As many as 31 farmer organisations have joined hands for the ‘Punjab Bandh’. Several organisations in Haryana, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said they had extended support to the nationwide strike called by some farmers’ bodies against the bills. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh appealed to the farmers to maintain law and order, and adhere to all coronavirus-safety protocols during the strike. In a statement, Singh said the state government was fully with the farmers in their fight against the bills and no FIRs would be registered for violation of Section 144, which bars assembly of more than four people. There should be no disturbance of law and order during the strike, the chief minister said. He appealed to the farmers to ensure that the citizens were not inconvenienced, and lives and property of people were not endangered due to the agitation. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh appealed to the people, including shopkeepers and commercial establishments, to keep their shop shut in support of the strike. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar also urged people to support the farmers and make the strike a success. The main opposition Aam Aadmi Party has already extended its support, while the Shiromani Akali Dal has announced to hold road blockades. Farmers started a three-day rail blockade against the bills and squatted on tracks at many places in Punjab on Thursday. The farmer outfits have also decided to go for an indefinite rail blockade from October 1. The protesters have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system and they would be at the “mercy” of big corporates. The farmers said they would continue their fight till the three farm bills were revoked. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by the Parliament earlier this week. Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh said besides the outfit, some other farmer organisations had also extended their support to the nationwide strike. “We have appealed that sit-ins should be held on state highways and other roads in a peaceful manner,” Singh said. “No sit-ins should be held on national highways.” Nobody should indulge in any kind of unlawful act during the strike from 10 am to 4 pm, Singh said. The BKU leader said the commission agents, shopkeepers and transporters had also been urged to support the strike. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij held a meeting with officers of the home and police departments on Thursday to review the situation, and directed the DGP to ensure elaborate police arrangements to prevent any untoward situation, according to a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-punjab-haryana-farmers-to-go-on-strike-tomorrow/story-kMM0VeO6jeNiAyJOhC7BJM.html
24-09-2020||India||A tightrope walk for river-crossing in Odisha’s Kandhamal, video is viral||Officials in Odisha’s Kandhamal district on Thursday removed the electric cables and ropes strung across a stream of river that helped over 150 people of a village cross the river after the videos and photos of them precariously perched on aluminium ropes while crossing the stream went viral on social media.On Wednesday, the photos and videos of poor tribals of Birindipada village of Kandhamal district crossing the Kalipenu stream, tributary of Khadag river, had gone viral on social media with several people slamming the state government over its failure in building a bridge over the river.One Twitter user name Kishlay Sharma wrote: “Incredible India. Picture from Kandhamal, Odisha. After 20 years of solid development by Naveen Patnaik. Imagine , we Indians take such risks even for basics like going out to market or school. Just imagine.” Another Twitter user named Kasturi Mishra wrote: “The true picture of rural Odisha Kandhamal, when the state government always claims to be number one.”The videos and photos showed women, elderly persons and youngsters dangerously balancing themselves on the 60-metre long rope while a river was flowing down below.“It has been our only way of getting to Gunjibadi grampanchayat office for collecting our foodgrains and get several other social assistance schemes. During rainy days as well as other days we use the ropes to get across. But after the video was shown on TV, the local BDO and other officials came today and removed it. We are now helpless,” said Nakula Pradhan, a tribal farmer of Birindapada village.Sub-collector of Baliguda, Subhankar Mohapatra said as there is a well-connected permanent bridge over Kalipenu river connecting Brindapada village to Gunjibadi grampanchayat, the administration removed the rope and cable wires which the villagers used to cross the river.“The permanent bridge is only 2 km away from Brindapada. But to cut corners, the villagers are using this unsafe ropeway occasionally. Theropeway has been removed immediately and people asked to use the permanent bridge,” said the sub-collector.However, the sarpanch of Gunjibadi grampanchayat said the district administration’s advice to the people of Brindapada was not practical as they have to travel 4 km of hilly roads to reach the new bridge that has been constructed 5 years ago.“From the bridge, they would have to travel another 8 km to reach the gram panchayat office. But if they take the ropeway, they just have to cover less than 4 km to reach the gram panchayat office,” said Gunjibadi sarpanch Lingaraj Pradhan.Pradhan said it ‘s not just Brindapada, at least 4 more villages in his panchayat faced the same problem of reaching the panchayat office as they have to cross the Kalipenu river. “For over 500 people of Taperikia, Tipidinga, Bagadi and Guduripada villages under Gunjibadi panchayat, ropeway is the only means of getting across the river. Like Bindapada, we have been demanding small bridges across the river near those villages for years together,” he said.Farmer Prusty Pradhan of Brindapada village said the villagers are well aware of the perils of crossing the river on a cable. “Crossing the river on a rope is a nightmare for us. We carry agricultural and other sundry goods while crossing. At times we carry a patient across the river to the nearest healthcare centre. The government instead of removing the ropes, should build a bridge near our village as we can’t travel long distances to reach the gram panchayat office and hospital,” said Pradhan.Housewife Lubang Pradhan said she is afraid of crossing the swelling river by holding on to ropes in both her hands. “There have been several incidents of people falling and being swept away while crossing the river. We are always scared,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-tightrope-walk-for-river-crossing-in-odisha-s-kandhamal-video-is-viral/story-aLGm0Mdeb7TnD4kkZBGXwK.html

Though this ambitious proposal of getting GI tag for peda is an old one, the district administration has initiated steps now to get it implemented on ground as soon as possible,” said Singh.The authorities will apply to the Chennai-based GI Registry for the GI tag. Though this sweet made of khoya is not offered as prasad at Baba Baidyanath Temple, over time, it has become a kind of ritual that most devotees coming to the temple town would buy peda and carry it back home.Taking the initiative forward, the district administration held a meeting at Vikash Bhawan with Babadham Peda Traders Association (BPTA) on Wednesday and directed to prepare a list of regular peda traders from the district.Deoghar deputy development commissioner (DDC) Shailendra Kumar Lal discussed the proposal with concerned officers of district administration and directed them to initiate steps for getting the coveted tag.“GI tagging will increase income of peda traders and give global identity to the product. The financial condition of Peda traders who have been involved in this trade for generations would be enhanced manifold,” said DDC.A GI tag is a distinctive sign, name used on a product which can be used on basis of its unique characterisation and geographical origin, an official said.“Once any product gets GI tagging it can also invite fine on copying by anybody outside that geographical region”, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-s-deoghar-eyes-gi-tag-for-babadham-peda/story-AGMP2vSdrOMYTSn0r1zCkI.html
24-09-2020||India||Several BSF, Customs officers under CBI scanner in cattle smuggling case in Bengal||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing the alleged involvement of several Border Security Force (BSF) and Customs officials in the ongoing probe into cattle smuggling along the India-Bangladesh border in West Bengal, officials familiar with the probe said. The case was registered in 2018 after a BSF commandant, who served in Bengal, was booked in Kerala. The probe has revealed a nexus between government officers and cattle traders. It is alleged that cattle seized by the BSF were auctioned within 24 hours with the help of some Customs officers so that cattle traders could buy these at very low price and legally sell them again. The CBI is probing allegations that for every cow seized and sold through this nexus, BSF officials used to get Rs 2,000 and Customs officials used to get Rs 500, according to the CBI FIR that HT has seen. In addition, Customs officials used to allegedly get 10 per cent of the auction price as bribe. CBI officers suspect that a large quantity of money was sent to other states through hawala operators. On Wednesday, CBI conducted raids in 15 cities and towns in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and a BSF officer’s residence at Salt Lake in the eastern fringe of Kolkata was sealed. Satish Kumar, the officer named in the FIR, used to be a commandant in the South Bengal Frontier of the BSF and is now posted in a neighbouring state. His home in Gaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, was also raided, a senior BSF official of the South Bengal Frontier said on condition of anonymity. A CBI officer said on condition of anonymity that according to the agency’s FIR more than 20,000 cows were seized by the BSF when Kumar was posted as commandant of the 36th Battalion from May 2016 to May 2017. However, neither was any smuggler arrested nor the vehicles used for ferrying the cattle seized, the FIR says. The CBI is probing the alleged involvement of several BSF and Customs officials in the illegal trade involving crores of rupees. The agency is also probing if the cattle smugglers operating in West Bengal have links with terror groups in Bangladesh, especially the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). According to the FIR, there was a nexus between some BSF and Customs officers and three cow traders; Muhammad Enamul Sheikh, Anarul Sheikh and Muhammad Gulam Mustafa. “The seizure lists of such seized cattle were prepared arbitrarily categorizing the breed and size of the seized animals with an intention to reduce the upset (minimum) price of the cattle during auctions. These cattle were then auctioned immediately (within 24 hours of seizure) with the help of the nearest Customs station in Jangipur, Murshidabad,” says the FIR. “Since the cattle were shown mostly small in size and of common breed in the seizure memo of BSF, the auction value of such cattle were reduced which were then procured at a considerably lower price by the traders due to their unholy nexus also with officials of the Customs department,” the CBI FIR reads. CBI officials said raids were conducted at several places in and around Kolkata and also in Murshidabad and North 24 Parganas district on Wednesday and Thursday. In 2017, the CBI had booked J D Mathew, a former commandant of the BSF 83rd Battalion posted in Murshidabad, for possessing assets disproportionate to income. He was charged again by the agency in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-bsf-customs-officers-under-cbi-scanner-in-cattle-smuggling-case-in-bengal/story-Q2gt3mjij4ByNvYjaEJS3O.html
24-09-2020||India||What data tells us about testing in urban and rural India||India’s rural districts, home to nearly 74% of India’s population, accounted for 65% of all Covid-19 tests conducted in August, and 55% of new cases reported that month. Urban districts, on the other hand, are home to 14% of the population and accounted for nearly 22% of all tests conducted in August, with 28% of the cases reported that month coming from them.The government this week released in Parliament data on the number of Covid-19 tests conducted in each of India’s 734 districts in August. This is the first time that district-level data on testing from across the country was made public. This analysis has divided India’s districts into three large groups – urban districts (less than 40% rural population), mixed districts (40% to 60% rural population) and rural districts (more than 60% rural population). The proportion of the rural population is based on the 2011 Census (the latest data available). Data on the number of cases has been sourced from How India Lives (11 revenue districts of Delhi have been taken as one single unit because the Delhi government does not release a district-wise breakup of confirmed infections). The number of tests conducted per million people in rural districts was 14,880, compared with 26,115 tests per million in urban districts.Nationally, about 8% tests in August came out positive. But this figure was 10.5% in urban areas and 6.9% in rural areas. Both were higher than what is recommended by the World Health Organisation, which says the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control.To be sure, the government has not given a breakup of tests by method. A Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (or RT-PCR) test, seen as the gold standard in Covid-19 testing, tends to result in a higher positivity rate because the other common method, the rapid antigen test, may throw up false negatives for people who are infected with a low viral load. The government said on August 4 that about a quarter of all Covid-19 tests across the country were rapid antigen tests. A greater share of rapid antigen tests in a region may lead to a lower positivity rate there. Anecdotally, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which account for 18% of all rural districts in the country, depend heavily on antigen tests. Some predominantly urban areas, such as Delhi, also use a disproportionate number of antigen tests.  In August, rural areas reported 1,023 confirmed cases per million people compared to 2,736 confirmed cases per million people in urban areas. While it is possible that the infection spreads at a slower rate in the rural areas because of the low population density (people per square kilometre) there, it is equally possible that the results have been skewed by states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (which have a large proportion of rural population) depending largely on inaccurate antigen tests. To be sure, the population density metric ought to be read with care. For example, Bihar’s Vaishali district (more than 80% rural population) has a population density of 2,164, more than Haryana’s Gurugram (1,267), which has 31% rural population. The positivity rate in Vaishali was 2.8% compared to 4.3% in Gurugram -- but this again, may be because of Bihar’s dependance on antigen tests which lower the positivity rate.  332 districts reported at least 1,000 infections in August. Of them, the positivity rate was below 5% in 96 districts and more than 30% in six districts. Maharashtra’s Nandurbar and Ratnagiri districts had the highest positivity rate (48% and 43% respectively) even though both are rural districts. Similarly, not all urban areas have a high positivity rate. Delhi, for example, had a positivity rate of 7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-data-tells-us-about-testing-in-urban-and-rural-india/story-woXp8xYNrpARnkeesAdKXI.html
24-09-2020||India||Centre’s eSanjeevani records 3 lakh out-patient consultations in 6 months||The Union ministry of health and family welfare’s tele-consultation platform, eSanjeevani, has completed 3 lakh out patient department (OPD) consultations within the past six months since its launch.The ministry started a patient-to-doctor tele-consultation facility in India to manage patient rush during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak when healthcare services were partially running.“This has helped in containing the spread of Covid-19 by ensuring physical distancing, and has simultaneously enabled provisions for non-Covid essential healthcare. The number of high tele-consultations is a testimony of its popularity among the citizens,” said the health ministry in a statement.The total number of states and union territories using eSanjeevani has gone up to 26. Around 4,600 doctors have been trained in using the platform efficiently, and on an average at least 6,000 consultations per day are recorded in its national network.With 1,29,801 digital interactions, Tamil Nadu has held the largest number of tele-consultations so far. The state had been a pioneer in the field, registering 32,035 OPD consultations by August 9, and 56,346 consultations by the 19th of the same month.Tamil Nadu had also registered nearly one lakh consultations (97,204) by September 8. The platform had provided essential healthcare to the state, one of the worst affected by Covid-19, at a critical time when conventional medicine was perceived to be risky owing to the nature of the infectious disease.Tami Nadu is followed by Uttar Pradesh (96,151 consultations), Kerala (32,921 consultations) and Uttarakhand (10,391 consultations). These four States account for almost 90% (2,69,264) of the total tele-consultations.“The aspect that makes eSanjeevani telemedicine platform special is that the operations and management of the platform has been organised in a very methodological manner. A close and an efficient connection is maintained between the states and the implementing agency (C-DAC Mohali). This enables quick feedback from the users which helps the implementing team to make quick optimisations. Accordingly, eSanjeevani is not only consistently increasing with respect to its efficiency and productivity but it is also getting enriched with newer functionalities and features as required by the users in the states,” read the health ministry statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-esanjeevani-records-3-lakh-out-patient-consultations-in-6-months/story-sadQ8qJbGzjEQOplvOT4RP.html
24-09-2020||India||Plasma therapy treatment yields mixed results in Uttarakhand hospitals||The use of convalescent plasma therapy in coronavirus-infected patients in Uttarakhand hospitals has thrown up different responses after almost two months of starting the process.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has allowed convalescent plasma to be used for moderately ill Covid-19 patients.Convalescent plasma therapy involves extraction of plasma from the blood of Covid-19 patients four weeks after they have been cured of their viral infection. The extracted plasma is injected into Covid-19 patients. The antibody that develops in a recovered patient helps other Covid-19 patients to fight the virus.Dr Shashi Upreti, in-charge for plasma therapy and blood bank at Government Doon Medical College Hospital said that since plasma therapy treatment started in the hospital around August 1, around 1200 Covid-19 positive patients have recovered, but very few patients have come forward to donate plasma. “Since the treatment started, we have called 1200 patients of which only 25 patients agreed to donate. When these 25 were screened, only eight patients tested positive for antibodies (enough antibodies for donating plasma) and seven have donated so far. But this is still very low as these are only the patients who have been discharged from our hospital. We would get more people, if antibody screening is done in containment zones as more people would test positive there and would have developed antibodies,” said Dr Upreti. In Nainital district’s Susheela Tiwari Hospital, the main referral hospital of Kumaon, which has also been conducting plasma therapy treatment, the response has been better. Dr Saloni Upadhyay, in-charge of blood bank at Susheela Tiwari Hospital, said that around 170 recovered Covid-19 patients were screened of which approximately 150 tested positive for antibodies. “We had screened around 170 patients of which around 150 tested positive for antibodies and around 20 people did not have enough antibodies. All these 150 people have donated plasma at Susheela Tiwari Hospital,” said Dr Upadhyay. In Nainital district, 89 patients have recovered so far through plasma therapy treatment, informed the district administration. Savin Bansal, district magistrate of Nainital, said that after getting cured people are being made aware and encouraged to donate plasma. “A Google spreadsheet Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping has been prepared by which recovered patients are being identified region-wise and ward-wise, after which they are being counselled and encouraged to donate plasma,” said Bansal. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh, the third hospital following plasma therapy treatment in the state said that they are getting a good response but not all recovered patients have a sufficient amount of antibodies needed for plasma donation. Dr Geeta Negi, in-charge of plasma bank at AIIMS in Rishikesh, said that approximately 60 people have donated plasma through which 53 people have been treated so far. “We take plasma from recovered patients only after testing for antibodies. These have been taken from patients who recovered at the hospital, or walk-in patients, then sometimes we get calls from people willing to donate plasma; so the number of people who have been screened is scattered, but the response has been good. We have rather had to turn down people as they did not have enough antibodies,” said Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-treatment-yields-mixed-results-in-uttarakhand-hospitals/story-cy3Be6Q6A5m3cgiZD1C0iK.html
24-09-2020||India||No refund on lockdown flights originating outside India, Centre clarifies||Refund of air tickets for international travel during the lockdown period will be restricted only for flights originating from the country (ex-India) and will not extend to flights scheduled to arrive in India, irrespective of whether they are Indian or foreign carriers.The latest clarification from the Centre came on an affidavit filed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in answer to queries put forth by the Supreme Court hearing a petition by Pravasi Legal Cell.On Wednesday, a three-judge bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, had asked the Centre to respond to concerns raised by the petitioner and travel agents association who were not happy with the refund scheme proposed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and DGCA in consultation with airline operators and travel agents.The scheme, which is awaiting the nod from the apex court, proposed immediate refund for tickets booked during the lockdown period (March 25 to April 14). For tickets booked prior to March 25 for travel up to May 24 (as calibrated domestic operations recommenced from May 25), the airline was liable for refund within 15 days.In the event of financial difficulty, the scheme proposed a credit shell in the name of the passenger that could be availed for travel on any route within March 31, 2021. Interest of 0.5 per cent till June 2020 and thereafter 0.75 per cent would accrue on the credit shell that will be transferable and if unused, will be paid back to the passenger with interest after March 31, 2021.Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner Pravasi Legal Cell, told the court that with regard to international travel, the scheme restricted the refund and credit shell benefit only to ex-India flights and not flights originating from other destinations into India.“During lockdown, many Indians stranded abroad booked tickets in India through their relatives and this scheme does not consider their plight after the flights stood cancelled during lockdown,” said advocate Jose Abraham, who filed the petition for the Pravasi Legal Cell. This group represented many such Indians working in the Gulf countries.The DGCA responded in the negative to the petitioner’s demand in its latest affidavit filed on Thursday. It said, “The ambit of the regulatory mechanism of the DGCA does not cover international flights, which originate from any foreign destination. It is stated that the said flights are governed by the regulatory mechanism of the country of origin, irrespective of the fact whether the carrier is Indian or not.”Further, the affidavit stated, “It is reiterated that the issue of refund of tickets/credit shell of such international flights would be governed by the law of such sovereign country from where such international flights originate.”The affidavit also responded to the demand made by travel agents to create the credit shell in their name as the tickets booked by them were in bulk with the passengers, most of them situated overseas, yet to make payments. The DGCA said that the Civil Aviation Requirements identifies the passenger in whose name the ticket is booked. Tickets booked by travel agents in bulk form part of a private arrangement between the travel agent and the airline which is out of the regulatory purview of the DGCA, the affidavit said.“The applicable Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) have been issued for ensuring the protection of the passengers and emphasising the role of airlines in facilitating the same. It is humbly submitted that, the regulation of private arrangements of travel agents is not covered by these CARs, as it is beyond the regulatory purview of DGCA/MoCA….Thus it would neither be feasible nor advisable for the DGCA/MoCA to regulate and supervise such private arrangements between the airlines and the agents,” the affidavit stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-refund-on-lockdown-flights-originating-outside-india-centre-clarifies/story-CzSXcevWF7LQ387xodMuxO.html
24-09-2020||India||AgustaWestland scam: Court to pass order on cognisance of charge sheet on September 25||A Delhi Monday reserved order on whether to take cognisance of a supplementary charge sheet against British National Christian Michel James and businessman Rajeev Saxena in the AgustaWestland chopper scam.Special Judge Arvind Kumar reserved order for September 25 after the public prosecutor, appearing for the CBI, submitted his argument that there was enough material to proceed against both the alleged middlemen as well as 13 others in the case.  According to sources, the probe report filed on Friday details the alleged role played by the accused in bringing bribes for politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force (IAF) officials.The sources said that the CBI, which had earlier this year sought sanction from the authorities concerned to prosecute former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, has not named him as an accused since the request has not been granted yet.The agency told the court that it may file another supplementary charge sheet in the matter later.The first charge sheet in the case was filed in September 2017 naming former IAF chief SP Tyagi and others.The agency had earlier told the court that “during the course of investigation, copies of classified/ secret official documents of Indian Air Force (IAF)/ Ministry of Defence (MoD) such as Operational Requirements for VVIP helicopters before issuance of Request of Proposal and other incriminating documents running into more than one lakh pages received from Italy and Switzerland”.It had also said that a “payment sheet” recovered from Michel, prepared on his dictation, shows that an amount of 30 million euro was paid/ proposed to be paid to the officers of IAF, MoD, bureaucrats, politicians and family in India for showing favour in the VVIP helicopter deal.Michel had entered into as many as five contracts through two of his firms to legitimise the illicit commission/ kickbacks on the procurement of VVIP helicopters by MoD, India, the CBI said.“An amount of 42.27 million euro was paid by the Westland Group Companies to the firms of the applicant as kickbacks/ bribes without undertaking any work against the receipt of such amount,” it said.It said that out of the kickbacks received from AgustaWestland, Michel further made payments to various persons in India.Michel was taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on December 5 last year after his extradition from Dubai, while the ED took him into custody on December 22 last year. He is currently in judicial custody in both cases.Dubai-based businessman Saxena was extradited to India on January 31, 2019 in connection with the scam relating to the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland.ED had earlier arrested Saxena but he was later granted bail after the agency supported his plea to turn approver in the case.The agencies had told the court that Michel made 24.25 million euro and 1,60,96,245 pound from the now-scrapped AgustaWestland deal.The CBI has alleged that the deal signed in February 2010 to supply VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euro caused an estimated loss of 398.21 million euro (about Rs 2,666 crore) to the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agustawestland-scam-court-to-pass-order-on-cognisance-of-charge-sheet-on-september-25/story-cmjIZqJTpqgdCHJ04s5UWM.html
24-09-2020||India||NIA grills Kerala CM’s former aide for third time in gold smuggling case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday questioned Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former secretary and senior IAS officer M Sivasankar, for eight hours in Kochi in the gold smuggling case before letting him off, a senior officer familiar with the probe said. This is the third time he was questioned by the NIA but he hasn’t been given a clean chit, he said. He was summoned after the NIA had retrieved some vital information from the phones and a laptop computer of one of the main accused Swapna Suresh which she had deleted before her arrest, the officer said. The NIA had recently retrieved 2,000 GB data from four of her mobiles and computer and it wanted to cross-check some of the earlier statements given by both. He said both were questioned simultaneously. Sivasankar, who was close to the CM, was suspended after his alleged proximity with Swapna Suresh surfaced. Sivasankar came under the scanner after the seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. After the seizure, there were reports that some officials at the CM’s office allegedly pressurised the Customs department to release the consignment. But Sivasankar reportedly told investigators that although he knew some of the accused including Swapna Suresh he was not aware of their smuggling background. There were also media reports that he was instrumental in appointing Suresh as a business development manager with the Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited and he helped her arrange a room in an apartment outside the state secretariat which the accused allegedly used for smuggling activities. After Swapna Suresh’s arrest in July, the Customs seized Rs one crore cash and two kg gold from her bank locker. Later it found that the locker was jointly operated by Sivasankar’s chartered accountant and Suresh. The chartered accountant reportedly told the NIA that he was asked to do so by Sivasankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-grills-kerala-cm-s-former-aide-for-third-time-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-YqklirBGW8CIe2pseCBWXI.html
24-09-2020||India||CBI raids 3 in 2019 Vellore Lok Sabha cash-for-vote case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a case in connection with the alleged cash-for-vote scandal in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and conducted raids on a senior manager of Canara Bank and two private persons. The alleged irregularities date back to March-April 2019 during the poll campaign in the Vellore Lok Sabha constituency, where DMK member of parliament DM Kathir Anand locked horns with the AIADMK-backed Puthia Neethi Katchi candidate AC Shanmugam when the Income Tax (IT) officials held surprise checks.The Election Commission had cancelled the election at the constituency but when the re-election happened in August 2019, Kathir won the seat. After registering a case on September 22, CBI teams on Thursday raided the premises of M Dayanidhi, a former senior manager of Canara Bank, Vellore branch, and two private persons - Damodaran and Srinivasan. Srinivasan is said to be a DMK functionary and Damodaran is his relative. All three have been named as accused in CBI FIR. It is alleged that it was Damodaran who fetched a cache of Rs 11.48 crore unaccounted cash, in newly printed Rs 200 notes, kept in small bundles and that money was meant for distribution to voters in Vellore constituency during the election scheduled there on April 18, 2019.This money was recovered by the I-T department on April 1, 2019 from the cement godown of Damodaran. The money was allegedly issued from the currency chest of Canara Bank branch there. Allegedly, the CBI says, the cash in the bundles of Rs 200 denomination was obtained from Canara Bank’s currency chest in exchange for other currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 2000 denomination.The CBI FIR says that Dayanidhi facilitated the exchange by inducing another public servant and falsifying the accounts to obtain the bundles of Rs 200 notes abusing his official position as a public servant by violating the laid down rules and procedures of the Canara Bank.“Dayanidhi, being a public servant, in criminal conspiracy with other accused persons committed an act of criminal misconduct by extending undue favour to the other accused private persons Damodaran and Srinivasan. The currency was obtained for facilitating easy distribution of currency notes to the voters in the Vellore parliamentary constituency during the parliamentary election which was to be held on April 18, 2019 in turn promotes corruption,” the CBI said in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-3-in-2019-vellore-lok-sabha-cash-for-vote-case/story-qbMp9iektRvAi7jPhOcnGL.html
24-09-2020||India||India underlines stability on ground ahead of fresh round of talks with China||India and China are set to hold another round of diplomatic and military talks to try and take forward the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with New Delhi on Thursday pressing for stability at the friction points in Ladakh sector. A meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs is expected to be held before the seventh round of talks between military commanders, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The dates for both meetings are yet to be finalised, they said. The two sides had decided to have the next meeting of the corps commanders “at the earliest”, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “In parallel, the next meeting of the WMCC is also likely to take place soon,” he said, without giving details. The sixth meeting of the corps commanders, held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on September 21, ended inconclusively on the main issue of disengagement after more than 13 hours of talks. The commanders met after nearly 50 days, and the only headway was a rare joint statement from the armies of the two sides that said they had agreed to stop sending more troops to the frontline and to refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground. The external affairs ministry, which was part of the military talks for the first time on Monday, insisted that adhering to this agreement would be key for the upcoming talks. “Even as two sides work towards complete disengagement in all friction areas, it is at the same time also necessary to ensure stability on the ground,” Srivastava said. He added, “The way ahead will be to refrain from making any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, while the two sides continue their discussions to achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas and to ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.” Srivastava also highlighted that this was the first joint statement issued after any meeting of the corps commanders, and it reflected the “stated commitment of both sides to disengage along the LAC”. Disengagement, he pointed out, is a “complex process that requires redeployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”, and this would require “mutually agreed reciprocal actions”. The last meeting of the corps commanders provided them an opportunity to have candid and in-depth exchanges on stabilising the situation along the LAC, he said. The two sides also decided to strengthen ground communications to avoid any further misunderstandings and misjudgements, and to avoid any actions that may complicate the situation, he said. The people cited above said India would stick to its demand for a comprehensive disengagement at all friction points, instead of a piece-meal approach suggested by the Chinese side. India will also insist on restoration of the status quo as it existed in April so that the ultimate goal of de-escalation along the LAC can be achieved, the people said. China has been asking India to withdraw its troops from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake as a prerequisite for disengagement at other friction points but this has been ruled out by the Indian side. Before the last corps commanders’ meeting, the defence ministers of the two sides met in Moscow on September 4 and this was followed by talks between the two foreign ministers, also in Moscow, on September 10. The foreign ministers had reached agreement on a five-point roadmap for comprehensive disengagement in all the friction areas. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said that with the border standoff now into its fifth month and winter about to set in, the endeavour by both sides appeared to be to prevent any further escalation. “However, I still take comfort from the desire on both sides to prevent further escalation, to ensure stability and to continue talking. It is a positive sign at the political level that there is a similar message from both sides – that there is no question of an armed conflict and peaceful negotiations are the way forward – though there is little less clarity in the messaging from Chinese side,” he said. “Combined with the onset of winter and some luck, there will be no further escalation while we await a breakthrough.

24-09-2020||India||Goa Police ‘lose track’ of 366 foreigners who jumped bail since 2015||The Goa Police has lost track of 366 foreigners who were enlarged on bail between 2015 and the first half of 2020, according to data collated by the state home department and submitted in the High Court.The foreigners who have mostly been arrested under sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act have been released on bail often with the condition that they report to the police station regularly or keep the local police station informed about any trips outside the state or country. The absconding foreigners make up 90% of foreign nationals who were enlarged on bail pending trial and have fled the country or otherwise made themselves scarce and not available to face prosecution. A bulk of them are from the North Goa district. The Superintendent of Police (North) has revealed to the court that the police in his jurisdiction lost track of 32 foreign nationals in 2015, 40 in 2016, 65 in 2017, 87 in 2018, 59 in 2019 and 22 up to August 31 this year.The Anti-Narcotics Bureau of the Goa Police said it lost track of 3 undertrials in 2015, five in 2016, eight in 2017, nine in 2019 and eight in 2019.The Superintendent of Police (South) said he lost track of 16 foreigners during the same period while the Crime Branch said they had no track of 20 such foreigners facing trial since 2015.“It is evident that in almost 90% of the cases where the foreigners have been enlarged on bail, their present whereabouts are unknown meaning thereby, that in all probabilities such foreigners have fled the country or otherwise not available to face the prosecution,” the Bombay High Court at Goa division bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar said. These foreigners are mainly Nigerians but also include Kenyans, Tanzanians, Ghanaians, Israelis and Russians.“If the concerned police officials were to realise that the foreigners are not attending the police stations and marking their attendance, the least that was expected was to move the courts for cancellation of bail. Besides, the police officials were required to immediately swing into action and trace such foreigners, before they succeed in fleeing from justice,” the High Court said. “From the statistics furnished, at least prima facie impression is created that the police agencies have treated this matter absolutely casually. We reiterate that if this continues, then, the administration of criminal justice in this State will be very seriously affected,” the judges noted. The High Court was initially hearing an appeal filed by the State against the acquittal of one Pavel Neuhausel, a Czech national who was arrested on charges of murdering his partner Marketa Horka in 2013. After his initial acquittal by the trial court of the murder, Neuhausel was enlarged on bail while the state challenged the acquittal in the High Court. However, during the hearing of the acquittal it came to light that Neuhausel had fled the country. Back in 2013 Neuhausel was found in an unconscious state alongside the railway tracks at Cansa Tivim in North Goa and told the police that he was kidnapped, assaulted and dumped by the railway line. When the police broke into his room at the guest house where he was staying, they found his murdered partner lying in a pool of blood. He was arrested for the murder.“We found that the police agencies were not at all serious, either in apprehending the accused or even in fixing any responsibility upon the police officials who were responsible for the accused jumping the bail and fleeing the country,” the High Court observed. “This is a serious issue affecting the administration of criminal justice. If this continues, then, it will have a very serious effect upon the administration of criminal justice in the State of Goa,” the High Court said.No one in the government was willing to come on record about the court’s observations. But Goa’s Advocate General Devidas Pangam said the government will file a reply in response to the Court’s orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-police-lose-track-of-366-foreigners-who-jumped-bail-since-2015/story-CljHcbE8sIX01FYX4KCiTK.html

The committee also wanted that a revised autopsy be conducted on the bodies of the Maoists under the supervision of forensic experts either at Warangal or Hyderabad.Meanwhile, Bhadradri Kothagudem superintendent of police Sunil Dutt said the bodies of the three Maoists who were killed in the encounter were identified and their bodies were handed over to the relatives.The slain Maoists were identified as: Sodi Jogaiah (25), a local guerrilla squad member of Kishtarampadu village, Madakam Malli (22), a member of Chennapuram squad who had worked in protection team of Telangana state Maoist party member Azad alias Koyyada Sambaiah and Madakam Mangi (24) an LGS member of Bhuvanagiri village.The SP said Jogaiah was involved in as many as 26 cases including killing of four people accusing them of police informers in the last three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeat-post-mortem-of-3-maoists-killed-in-encounter-says-telangana-court/story-Y66ifOwt58WTdCdlbT7tQL.html

While his parents and wife managed to get their Aadhaar card, he could not get it. He tried enrolling again at the Aadhaar enrolment camp in Banaskumpa gram panchayat office six months later, but still could not get it. His three daughters, the last one Ekisha born 2 years ago, too has got her Aadhar card after getting her details enrolled in the UIDAI database.But Sethi has remained unlucky as his name failed to make it to the database. “When I first enrolled for the Aadhaar number six years ago along with my father, I thought I would get it quickly which would enable me to get a bank account as it is mandatory. My parents and wife got it, but I was unlucky,” said Sethi.The lack of Aadhaar card has made Sethi ineligible for getting the food grain under National Food Security Act (NFSA) that he is supposed to get every month. While the family is supposed to get 25 kg of rice every month for five-members of his family, they get 20 kg rice only. After getting rejected about 10 times, Sethi met the sub-collector who reportedly asked him to apply again, but for inexplicable reasons his application was again rejected. “I was asked to approach the Odisha Computer Application Centre in Bhubaneswar. But I am a daily wage labourer. How can I sacrifice my day’s wage to go to Bhubaneswar?” said Sethi.Frustrated over his attempts in getting an Aadhaar card, Sethi filed a case in the Lok Adalat in March this year, but the hearing in the case is yet to take place.In Odisha, Aadhar enrolment is necessary for getting several benefits like pension as well several state welfare schemes.Officials in Kandhamal district administration said they have to look into the applications of Sethi before commenting on it. Uppara Narendranath who is in charge of UIDAI’s Aadhaar enrolment for Odisha, said he would not be able to comment on it without looking into the case records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-man-applies-for-aadhaar-card-more-than-20-times-but-still-doesn-t-get-it/story-WhoVUjdPpG5LpM2fcJEUwN.html

24-09-2020||India||‘Witch-hunt by 3 central agencies’: Rhea Chakraborty to court||Actor Rhea Chakraborty, in jail for alleged offence of procuring drugs for her late boyfriend, on Thursday claimed before the Bombay High Court that a “witch hunt” has been unleashed against her by three central investigating agencies. She also argued that the investigation conducted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) was illegal as it had no jurisdiction to investigate the drug link to the untimely death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Counsel for the 28-year-old actor and her brother Showik, advocate Satish Maneshinde, submitted that the drug related case should also have been entrusted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after the Supreme Court order of August 19 that allowed the Central agency to take over the case.Arguing Rhea and Showik’s bail applications, Maneshinde pointed out that on August 19 the apex court had directed that all cases relating to the death of the late actor should be transferred for investigation to the CBI, and since the drug trail being probed by the NCB was also linked to Rajput’s death, this case should also have been transferred to the said agency.Maneshinde maintained that the offences attributed by the NCB to Rhea and her brother were bailable, as admittedly those are related to small quantities and stringent provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS), 1985, like section 27A (financing illicit trafficking of drugs or harbours offenders), were not applicable to the case.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who represented the NCB, said they will reply to all the arguments advanced on behalf of the siblings. He, however, sought time to file an affidavit in reply to the bail applications by Rhea and Showik.Accordingly, justice Sarang Kotwal posted the bail applications for further hearing on September 29, when the court has posted applications of three other accused arrested by the NCB in the same case.In her application, Rhea has claimed that a witch-hunt has been started against her by engaging three central agencies for investigating cases, but two of those agencies have till date found no evidence against her or her family.“The applicant states that the respondents (read the Centre) have started a witch-hunt against her by the investigations at the behest of three Central agencies,” stated the bail plea of the actor.“The CBI and the ED till today have found no evidence against the applicant and her family members. The allegations have made no headway,” it said further, adding that the Narcotics Control Bureau, which is supposed to prevent international illicit trafficking of drugs, has been “brought specifically to somehow implicate her and her family.”The NCB started investigation into purported drug angle to the untimely death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput - who was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14 - after WhatsApp chats revealed that ganja was regularly procured for consumption of the deceased actor.A long trail of drug peddlers and suppliers led to Rhea’s arrest by the anti-drugs agency on September 8. Her brother Showik is also arrested in the case. Both of them have moved the high court after their bail pleas were rejected by a special NDPS court on September 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/witch-hunt-by-3-central-agencies-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-to-court/story-MIo45kv645vtXXjrrXjppK.html

The examination to recruit 587 SIs was cancelled in 154 exam centres across the state on September 20 after the question paper was leaked and was found circulating on Whatsapp. Nearly 64,000 applicants were scheduled to appear for the examination.

Six months after a nationwide lockdown, Covid-19 is spreading fast across the length and breadth of India with more testing and developments on the vaccine front but no clarity on when the disease will be controlled, say scientists.  On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown for the entire country, stating it was the only way to break the chain of infection. At the time, the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was a little over 500 and the death toll 12.  Six months on, India has the second highest number of cases in the world after the US with a tally of 57.32 lakh cases, 86,508 people testing positive in a day and a total of 91,149 fatalities, according to Union Health Ministry figures on Thursday. As COVID-19 rages -- and even laypersons get conversant with the complexities of RT-PCR tests versus the cheaper but not so reliable rapid antigen tests -- US-based economist and epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan said there is a “hidden epidemic” happening even as the pandemic spreads.He noted that the infection is spreading widely across all parts of the country, including into rural India, although the visibility is lower in places where testing is weak or inadequate.  “We will likely see some increases in states like UP and Bihar but only if RT-PCR testing increases. Right now, we have a hidden epidemic in many parts of the country which have weak health systems,” the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington told PTI. “While the infection is spreading at a slower rate than if people were not taking precautions, it is definitely not under control,” Laxminarayan added.However, he expects the number of cases to start coming down in the next month or two as India approaches some sense of “population immunity”. As a substantial number of the population is infected and recovers from the disease, they are unlikely to spread the virus.“Given the precautions that are being taken both by the government and individuals, the epidemic has slowed down. This would mean that we would see a sustained plateau for a while before the cases start coming down,” Laxminarayan said. On March 23, a day before the prime minister announced the lockdown and two days before it came into force, India had tested 18,383 samples. Till September 22, this had gone up to at least 6,62,79,462 tests, both RT-PCR and rapid antigen.The recoveries have gone up to over 46 lakh people, pushing the national recovery rate to 81.55 per cent.  Immunologist Satyajit Rath sounded a note of caution and said India is still at the stage of spreading viral infection across communities.  “With global, international travel as the point of origin, the infection was first established in urban high-density localities, and is now spreading from those into the rest of the country, at widely varied speeds,” Rath, from the National Institute of Immunology (NII) in New Delhi, told PTI.The infection has never really been under control in India, he said.“The early harsh prolonged lockdown somewhat delayed the large-scale establishment of the infection. But ‘control’ has never been a possibility. So we are certainly going to see growth in the infection numbers for quite a long while yet,” Rath added.Immunologist Vineeta Bal concurred with Rath, saying the Indian government did not learn much despite experiences from other parts of the world and announced complete “draconian lockdowns” that were extended for long periods. “Leadership in the country lacked in its vision and could not get a sense of the ground realities for poor people; or maybe did not care,” Bal, from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, told PTI.“Because of major undermining of public health infrastructure for decades, our epidemic handling preparedness was very, very poor. That could have been the only justifiable reason for imposing the lockdown,” Bal added.Laxminarayan took a different view. He said there were many positives about the control strategy, including an early recognition of the threat faced by India, and an early lockdown though the implementation and planning could have been much better.    “The lack of early testing really cost the country. With better and more expanded testing early on, that India was fully capable of, the lockdown could have been more targeted rather than been nationwide.    “Since then, there has been much confusion on the scientific communication, including on the prospects for a vaccine and the utility of hydrochloroquine. The performance across different states has been very varied depending on their health system capacity,” he noted.Rath said the early harsh prolonged lockdown created more problems than it solved.“It somewhat delayed the large-scale establishment of the infection, but it did that at the disproportionately massive cost of disruption of already fragile livelihoods, of the economy, and of healthcare systems,” he explained. Bal also pointed out that India has been paying for its long-term neglect of healthcare infrastructure that should accessible to the poor and the needy.“While there have been serious efforts to build infrastructure, upgrade facilities in the past six months, what has been done is still not enough,” she added.Discussing the vaccine, on which rest the hopes of billions of people globally, the experts said there are almost 200 efforts across the world to build and test candidates. A large number, growing by the week, are in clinical trials of actual efficacy.In India, there are at least eight vaccine candidates being developed, two of which have entered Phase 2 trials or the penultimate stage.“In all likelihood, a number of vaccines will emerge. Optimistically, the first vaccines will probably be licensed by the end of this calendar year,” Rath said.   “Further, the first-generation vaccines are likely to provide significant but not complete protection, and it will not be clear how long protection will last and how well booster vaccination will work,” he said.Laxminarayan, also an affiliate professor at the University of Washington, added that it is too early to know if any of the vaccine candidates under development in India will play a major role in Covid-19 control in the country. “However, one should hope that,” he said.  “This is the first disease in human history, to the best of my knowledge, where candidate vaccine trials began in less than eight-nine months from the day the virus was identified and its sequence published. This is a major technological achievement,” Bal added.  The expert noted that in India the pandemic is unlikely to be over in the months to come, and the number of people getting infected will continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-months-since-lockdown-strides-in-testing-vaccine-devt-but-covid-crisis-far-from-over-say-scientists/story-kg4PqcNMNTUWm089lsUamJ.html

Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing an informal virtual meeting of foreign ministers of the eight-member grouping, whose functioning has stalled because of differences between India and Pakistan. The meeting of the foreign ministers is an annual event held on the margins of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York that has been marked by testy exchanges between India and Pakistan in recent years. Also read: India needs to invest in regional disaster relief mechanisms | Opinion“Cross-border terrorism, blocking connectivity and obstructing trade are three key challenges that SAARC must overcome,” Jaishankar said in a string of tweets highlighting the contents of his speech. “Only then will we see enduring peace, prosperity and security in our South Asia region,” he added.In his speech, he said: “Over the last 35 years, Saarc has made significant progress. But our efforts towards collective collaboration and prosperity have been hampered by acts of terrorism and threats to national security. “Such an environment impedes our shared objective of realising the full potential of our collective endeavour. It is, therefore, crucial that we collectively resolve to defeat the scourge of terrorism, including the forces that nurture, support and encourage it. “This will generate the much needed trust and confidence to collectively build a stronger and prosperous Saarc.”  Though he didn’t name any country, it was obvious he was referring to Pakistan. India has accused Pakistan of backing cross-border terror, especially in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). After India created an emergency coronavirus disease (Covid-19) fund for Saarc states earlier this year, Pakistan asked for it to be placed under the grouping’s secretariat. Jaishankar said he had also reaffirmed India’s commitment to its “neighbourhood first” policy and towards building a connected, integrated, secure and prosperous South Asia. He also highlighted India’s Covid-19-related cooperation efforts, including a commitment of $10 million to the emergency fund for the region, the supply of essential drugs, medical consumables, and protection and test kits to the region, and a video conference of health professionals from the region to share information and best practices on the pandemic. India had also launched a Covid-19 Information Exchange Platform (COINEX) to facilitate exchange of specialised information, helped the development of an innovative website by the Saarc Disaster Management Centre to provide reliable information and updates on the evolving situation, and activated the Saarc Food Bank mechanism to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, he said. “And where we brought back our own people from afar, we had space both on the plane and in our hearts for our neighbours,” Jaishankar said. He also pointed to India’s support for neighbours, such as the extension of $150 million (m), $200 m and $400 m foreign currency swap support for the Maldives, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, respectively. In his address, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi spoke of his country’s “willingness to host the 19th SAARC Summit and for obstacles created in its way to be removed for SAARC to function as an effective instrument of regional cooperation”. The summit was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November 2016 but was called off after an attack on an Indian Army camp at Uri in Kashmir that was blamed on Pakistan-based terrorists. Since then, Saarc has largely been dormant. Qureshi said Pakistan attaches great importance to Saarc and its charter, which upholds the principle of sovereign equality as the basis for meaningful regional cooperation. He also reiterated the need for a regional approach to stop the spread of Covid-19. In March, the Pakistani representative at a video conference of Saarc leaders on the Covid-19 situation had triggered a controversy by raising the Kashmir issue. That event had been organised at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion. At the time, Indian officials had said Pakistan’s move was unwarranted and an attempt to politicise a humanitarian issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cross-border-terror-among-key-challenges-for-saarc-jaishankar/story-8I4QKgOgqs50ktaa9BElPK.html

Sudarshan News has been given time to file its reply by September 28.Here is everything you need to know about the issue:• Sudarshan News aired four episodes in the programme on September 11, 12, 13 and 14, 2020, and there are around six more episodes remaining to be broadcast in the programme series. The Supreme Court has put a pre-broadcast ban on the remaining episode till the time the case is decided.• The petition against the programme has been filed by a lawyer, Firoz Iqbal Khan, who submitted that “Bindas Bol” contained statements which were derogatory about the entry of Muslims into the civil services. In the programme’s trailer, which was widely shared on social media platforms, the anchor and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, Suresh Chavhanke, was seen questioning how there had been a sudden increase in the number of Muslims succeeding in Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service exams.• Khan has contended in his petition that such views were derogatory to Muslims, had a divisive potential and was in violation of the programme code spelled out under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 which regulates television content.• Sudarshan News has maintained that the intention of the programme is not to vilify the Muslim community but to highlight the allegedly dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organisation that supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants.• On September 21, the top court had pondered over the nature and extent of its order regulating “Bindas Bol” saying it did not want to “curtail” freedom of speech as the programme has “public interest” involved on issues of “foreign funding” and “reservation”.• The channel has urged the apex court to lift the stay on the telecast of the remaining six episodes of the controversial programme, saying the channel would abide by laws.• But the Centre tol the bench of justices DY Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph that it has served a four-page notice seeking a written submission from the channel regarding violation of programme code and why action should not be taken against it.• The bench has adjourned the hearing in the case till October 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-controversy-around-sudarshan-tv-show-bindas-bol-all-you-need-to-know/story-jDFY7NQjrpJlXmIDDTFv1H.html

Besides Jaishankar and Doval, the event held at the Saudi embassy on Wednesday evening was also attended by minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. Also read: Countries where Indians can’t travel and whyThis was only the second diplomatic reception held by a major embassy in the wake of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related restrictions, with the other being the national day event hosted by the Afghan embassy. While the NSA has attended both the Afghan and Saudi national day receptions in recent years, it is rare for both him and the foreign minister to join the same reception. The last time an external affairs minister had attended a diplomatic reception was in 2018, when late Sushma Swaraj had joined an event at the Russian embassy as the chief guest. In a message posted on Twitter, Jaishankar had extended greetings to his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud and the government on the national day. “Our expanding cooperation across so many sectors reflects the intrinsic strength of our ties. Look forward to further advancing our Strategic Partnership,” he said. Addressing Wednesday’s reception, Saudi envoy Saud Al-Sati said the kingdom valued India as a “close friend and an important strategic partner”, and the socio-economic engagement and strategic partnership between the two sides is based on mutual respect and shared interests. “Through the mechanism of the Strategic Partnership Council (SPC), we are working on further strengthening our partnership and deepening our friendship ... In the beginning of 2020, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia had awarded 41 new foreign investment projects to Indian investors,” he said. The ambassador said there is huge untapped potential in merchandise trade, particularly non-oil trade, and the two sides are enhancing cooperation in the commercial, investment and technological fields. “Current bilateral trade of approximately $34 billion will surely continue to grow,” he said. In recent years, India has ramped up its cooperation with Saudi Arabia, one of the country’s top two suppliers of energy, in fields ranging from security to technology. Saudi Arabia is home to 2.6 million Indians, the largest expatriate community in the kingdom. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-nsa-naqvi-attend-saudi-arabia-s-national-day/story-0av8L1dQLxiEFctwSgz52K.html

The aspirants in their plea have sought the postponement of civil services 2020 examination for two to three months, citing incessant rains and flood situations in the country and the rising cases of Covid-19.The petition has been filed by 20 UPSC aspirants against the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination, which is scheduled to be held on October 4.“Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time, is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including Petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death,” the plea stated, according to PTI.The plea further said that since civil services exam is a recruitment examination, there would not be any delay or loss of any academic progress. The petition urged for the postponement of the exam stating that many aspirants are facing “unimaginable hardship” or “unsafe health conditions”.“Despite alarming spurt in Covid-19 pandemic, UPSC did not increase the number of Examination Centres, resulting into a situation where many candidates from rural areas will be forced to travel for around 300-400 Kilometres, in order to reach to their Examination Centres and there will be high probability of such aspirants, getting affected while using public transportation for such travel,” the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-s-notice-to-centre-and-upsc-on-plea-filed-by-civil-services-aspirants-seeking-postponement-of-exam/story-ej7Bl9wdFXx6Qo78iI6gRN.html

24-09-2020||India||Telangana cop had Rs 70 crore in illegal wealth, unearth raids||The Anti-Corruption Bureau authorities in Hyderabad on Thursday arrested an Assistant Commissioner of Police, a day after conducting searches in his house that unearthed assets worth Rs 70 crore, which were disproportionate to his known sources of income. The ACB authorities produced Yelamakuri Narasimha Reddy, presently working as ACP in Malkajgiri under Rachakonda police commissionerate, before a special court for ACB cases in the Nampally criminal court complex. After medical tests, he would be remanded in judicial custody. According to an official release from ACB director general J Purna Chander Rao, the ACB authorities on Wednesday conducted searches simultaneously in about 25 locations in Hyderabad city, various places in Warangal, Jangaon, Nalgonda, Karimnagar districts, and also in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. During these searches, the authorities detected documents that showed that Reddy owned 55 acres of agricultural lands at Anantapur, four plots measuring 1960 square yards of land near Cyber Towers in Madhapur in Hyderabad, two other house plots, a four-storeyed commercial complex at Hafeezpet and two houses. “The searches also found unaccounted Rs 15 lakh in cash, two bank lockers and investments in real estate and other businesses at Reddy’s residence,” the director general said. He said the ACB had conducted searches based on the reliable information that Reddy had acquired assets disproportionate to his lawful sources of income by indulging in corrupt practices and dubious means during his service as a public servant. The searches went on till late on Wednesday night and the officials had examined and evaluated the documents recovered from the police officer. “The present market value of the properties detected by the authorities was around Rs 70 crore,” the ACB official said, adding that a case of DA was registered in this regard and investigation was going on. Narsimha Reddy, who joined the police department in 1991, had worked as inspector of police at Uppal, before being promoted to the rank of ACP only recently and posted at Malkajgiri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cop-had-rs-70-crore-in-illegal-wealth-unearth-raids/story-xeplhC4Maog9M6CIbcDHGO.html

The building is demolished partly, and in the heavy monsoon, we cannot leave it in this state. We will start hearing the petitioner tomorrow,” the bench said.Ranaut, in her plea filed in the HC on September 9, sought that the demolition carried out by the BMC at her Pali Hill bungalow be declared illegal.She subsequently amended her plea to demand Rs two crore as damages from the civic body and its officials.In her plea, she alleged that the BMC had demolished the bungalow out of personal vendetta, since she had made some comments adverse to the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government.The BMC in its affidavit filed in the high court denied the allegation.In the affidavit filed through advocate Joel Carlos, the BMC said Ranaut had carried out illegal structural changes and repairs at the bungalow, and the civic officers were merely following the law in demolishing unauthorised portions of the structure.The civic body had urged the high court to dismiss Ranaut’s plea and to impose a cost on her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-leave-demolished-house-the-way-it-is-bombay-hc-to-bmc-on-kangana-ranaut-s-plea/story-6Rz9vgqMSgXKN0FSNwLJdJ.html

They had the right to sit in Parliament and express their views but they instead abdicated it and staged a walkout. They began protests and dharna outside and are now meeting the President,” he said.There are nearly 300 days for these things, Javadekar said, adding that Parliament meets for 70-80 days so that its members could express their views there.The opposition boycotted Parliament and is now complaining everywhere, he said.The opposition parties have been up in arms against the passage of farm bills, and their delegation on Wednesday urged President Kovind not to give his assent to the same. They also called the passage of the bills “unconstitutional”.Javadekar said farmers have received a “boon” in the form of these proposed laws and asserted that the opposition’s allegations about the minimum support price (MSP) and agriculture ‘mandis’ have been proved “wrong”.The government has just hiked MSPs of rabi crops and will now procure them, he said.The new labour laws will give “salary, social and health” rights to farmers and ensure equal wages for women for the first time since independence, the minister said, adding that the opposition is now complaining after not taking part in the debate on the same.“This is wrong,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-directionless-it-boycotts-parl-and-protests-outside-says-javadekar/story-7t0kN5FSeHQ9xBFIdHLf6J.html

You have a good case on merits. Why are you not filing for bail on merits,” the bench comprising justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi asked.Bharadwaj’s counsel, Vrinda Grover then agreed to withdraw the bail plea on medical grounds saying they will try for bail on merits of the case.Bharadwaj had sought bail citing vulnerability to Covid -19 due to co-morbidities.The Bombay high court had rejected her plea on August 28 after which she moved the Supreme Court in appeal.Bharadwaj was arrested by Maharashtra police in 2018 for allegedly inciting violence during the celebration of 200th anniversary of the battle at Bhima Koregaon between the British East India Company and the Peshwas. The company army was comprised largely of persons from Dalit community and the event is celebrated by them.Bharadwaj along with activists Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Anand Teltumbde, and Gautam Navlakha have been charged with offences under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged role in inciting the violence.Bharadwaj was initially lodged at Yerawada jail in Pune before she was shifted to Byculla jail.After the change of government in Maharashtra in 2019, the central government had intervened and transferred the investigation to National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Maharashtra police.Grover, on Thursday, argued that Bharadwaj had developed two new diseases while in custody - ischemic heart disease and arthritis.“Ischemic heart disease is a ticking time bomb. Anytime, her condition can deteriorate,” Grover said, seeking bail so that Bharadwaj can be subjected to a detailed medical examination.Also Read: Elgar Parishad case: Anand Teltumbde moves court against NIA’s extension of his custodyGrover also submitted that Bharadwaj was a lawyer in Chhattisgarh who used to fight cases on behalf of marginalised sections of the society.“No incriminating material was recovered from me or my electronic devices. I was teaching at National Law University, Delhi when I was arrested,” Grover argued.“Why are you not filing for bail on merits,” asked justice Lalit.Also Read: Elgar Parishad case: Custody of 3 Kabir Kala Manch members extended till September 19“You have a good case on merits,” said justice Rastogi while also taking exception to certain submissions made by Bharadwaj before Bombay high court regarding the medical report submitted by jail authorities on August 21 which did not mention Bharadwaj’s condition of ischemic heart disease.The court made it clear that it will not grant bail on medical grounds.Bharadwaj’s bail plea on medical grounds was earlier rejected by a special NIA court on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-case-on-merits-sc-asks-bhima-koregaon-accused-to-file-fresh-bail-plea/story-50UgMTLTtYeRdTuSKcAm5H.html

24-09-2020||India||Congress leader asks why Kangana Ranaut wasn’t quizzed for alleged drugs abuse||For the second day in a row, Maharashtra Congress has posed a few questions to the central agencies probing Sushant Singh Rajput death case and the alleged drug dealings in Bollywood.The Congress has asked why the narcotics control bureau (NCB) did not question actor Kangana Ranaut despite the surfacing of her alleged link to drugs abuse and also alleged that those booked in Sandalwood drugs case were not being probed properly since they were related to the Bharatiya Janata Party.“And lastly: despite having a video proof of @KanganaTeam, why has she not been called by NCB for a probe since she was in Mumbai especially when even whatsapp chats are considered proof ? Is Kangana not from Bollywood?,” the last of Sawant’s tweets on the subject said.BJP responded by saying that the Congress was raking up non issues and its government should instead concentrate on real issues in Maharashtra.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, in a series of tweets, wanted to know the status of an alleged case of drug recovery from a BJP worker and the case against Ragini Dwivedi, arrested in the Sandalwood drug racket case, earlier this month, in Karnataka.Also Watch: Kangana’s ‘Bullywood’ jibe as NCB summons Deepika, others in Sushant’s caseSawant also referred to film producer Sandip Ssingh’s alleged link to drug dealings and a relative of a Bollywood actor considered to be BJP leaning.“NCB has established a big narrative on the capture of 59 gms of Ganja and summoned leading Bollywood stars in that connection. Let it do it, but we would not allow NCB to overlook BJP drug nexus in Bollywood, Sandalwood and Goa,” Sawant tweeted, while naming several people allegedly linked to the BJP.Also Read: Jaya Saha names four male actors during NCB questioning: reportBJP has invited Sawant to hand over any evidence against the people he named or to move court if he sees any lapses in the probe.“Instead of making noise on non issues, Congress and its leaders should concentrate in Maharashtra where the governance is in shambles. The central agencies are probing the cases on the basis of the proofs they have come across and the investigation is on the right direction,” said Madhu Chavan, adding that “If the Congress has evidence against any BJP worker in any of the cases, it should hand it over to the agencies probing the cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-asks-why-kangana-ranaut-wasn-t-quizzed-for-alleged-drugs-abuse/story-tWmzEiHzfNcc9uL21ZjJ6N.html
24-09-2020||India||Dubai bizman Somesh Prasad gets bail in case that triggered CBI vs CBI||A Delhi court has granted bail to Dubai-based Somesh Prasad who is accused of extorting crores of rupees from a Hyderabad businessman Sana Sathish Babu claiming that he could shield him in the CBI probe against millionaire meat exporter Moin Qureshi.The extortion case was at the heart of the CBI vs CBI drama that played out in 2018 and led to the exit of then CBI chief Alok Verma and his deputy, Rakesh Asthana.The case was initially registered as a bribery FIR against Asthana who had been overseeing the probe against Moin Qureshi in which Sana Sathish Babu was also being probed. Asthana’s name was cleared by the CBI earlier this year and heads the Border Security Force and the Narcotics Control Bureau. According to the CBI, Babu had reached out to Somesh Prasad who made him believe that he had spoken to Asthana and his team would spare Babu if he paid Rs 5 crore.“...due to the registration of the present FIR, there was huge bickering in the higher echelons of the CBI i.e. amongst the top officers and due to which the IO as well as the said Special Director (Asthana) had to endure agony for a long time,” Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal said in his detailed order granting bail to Somesh Prasad and associate Sunil Mittal.Prasad and Mittal were granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh each and two sureties of like amount.In his order granting bail to the two, the court noted that the CBI, which was opposing bail, had not arrested the two accused who faced “serious allegations” according to the charge-sheet filed against them.“The stand of the CBI/Investigating agency is most ambivalent with regard to the matter in hand, on the one hand, they did not arrest the accused persons at any point of time when they appeared before them during the investigations and on the other hand they are opposing their bail applications to tooth and nail. The said stand can be described by way of English idiom “Run with Hare and Hunt with the Hounds’ i.e to be good on terms with both the sides” the court said.The court noted that the accused have been substantially cooperating in the investigation.The FIR against former special director Rakesh Asthana, filed on a complaint by Sana, had stated that Manoj Prasad, a Dubai-based businessman told Satish Babu Sana about his “good connections” in CBI and that his brother Somesh Prasad would help save him in the Moin Qureshi case, being investigated by a special investigation team (SIT) led by Asthana since 2017.Sana claimed that when he met Somesh Prasad in Dubai, he was told that Asthana would surely save him in this case. Somesh Prasad claimed that he had been managing the CBI officer’s investments in Dubai and London for many years.At an earlier hearing in August, the judge had frowned at the lack of forward movement in the February 2017 case registered against millionaire meat exporter Moin Qureshi. In this FIR, the CBI had alleged that Moin Qureshi, apart from his day job of a meat exporter, also worked as a middleman for “certain public servants” and was helped by AP Singh who retired as CBI chief in 2012.On February 11, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had exonerated its former special director Rakesh Asthana and deputy superintendent of police Devender Kumar in the 2018 bribery case registered by then agency chief Alok Verma.The agency had concluded there was “no evidence” whatsoever to suggest that Asthana had ever demanded or been paid any bribe to save Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Babu Sana, the complainant in the case, in its probe against controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubai-bizman-somesh-prasad-gets-bail-in-case-that-triggered-cbi-vs-cbi/story-Sd9sQwIqZvivMsVPXZ1ugM.html

The chief ministers of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Punjab attended the meeting.About 60 districts in these seven states are “a cause of worry”, the PM said. The PM also emphasised that micro-containment zones might be the way out of the situation.What are local lockdowns?Though India is now in the fourth phase of unlocking, local lockdowns are going on at several places. Local lockdowns are restrictions for one or two days when all economic activities, exempting the essential one, are shut. West Bengal, for example, imposed such local lockdowns in August during Unlock 3. In September, the states mostly discontinued with local lockdowns as economic activities have started to pick momentum. section 144, which bars the gathering of four and more people, are in place in some cities, including Mumbai, Noida etc. Chattisgarh has recently imposed lockdowns in 10 districts.What are micro-containment zones?Micro-containment zones are specific areas where a number of Covid-19 cases have been reported in the recent times. Identifying these areas — which might be as small as a building — and isolating them instead of a bigger area will not stop economic activities as well. In its Unlock 4 guideline, the ministry of home affairs specifically mentioned that states would not be able to impose local restrictions without consulting the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-4-what-are-local-lockdowns-and-micro-containment-zones/story-mzBs1RzaatNKaM8BJdL1fP.html

Opposition parties and farmers in some states have been protesting the farm bills passed by Parliament recently.

On Wednesday, the TIME Magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people of 2020.Bilkis and her two friends—the group of three elderly women protesters —more popularly known as “dadis” (grandmothers) of Shaheen Bagh participated in the agitation since the first day and continued till the protesters were evicted on the morning of March 24 following the Covid lockdown. Bilkis was among the few who would reach the protest site at 8am and leave only a little before midnight with prayer breaks throughout the day.When asked what motivated these women to sit on the arterial road no. 13 A in Shaheen Bagh through rain and coldest Delhi winter of the century, Bilkis, 82, told HT in January: “This protest is for our rights and mainly our children. We will not give up till the CAA is repealed.”Also Read: Indians in TIME’s 100 most influential people list 2020: PM Modi, Ayushman Khurrana, Bilkis and othersShe was among the many women from Shaheen Bagh, who had stepped out of their houses to agitate against the CAA law which they called “unconstitutional.” For nearly four months, these protesters, most of them residents of the locality, spent their days and nights under a tent on road No.13 A participating in open-mics to express their fears about the new law and discuss various constitutional themes. On TIME magazine listing the elderly woman in their list of 100 most influential people, Hena Ahmed, who protested at Shaheen Bagh for three months, said, “We are happy that at least someone understood our intentions. The authorities always tried to paint the protests as something wrong. Truth always wins. Bilkis dadi’s name was in the same list as that of our Prime Minister. This means that there was some legitimacy to our movement. Locals who I have been in touch with are happy because of this development and relieved that Shaheen Bagh’s spirit has been recognised.”On the evening of December 15, 2019 a group of around 50 women occupied road 13A at Shaheen Bagh and demanded the roll back of the amended citizenship law. The numbers increased gradually and more protesters poured in, while police was unable to convince the protesters led by elderly women such as Bilkis to vacate the road.

For nearly four months the Delhi traffic police issued an advisory every morning informing people to avoid the Delhi-Noida road via Shaheen Bagh and also plan their journey after checking the road diversion and traffic on the road.Bilkis and her two friends also interacted with the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors in February voicing their concerns over the controversial law and demanding government representatives to speak with them on the issue. The protesters could not be persuaded to vacate the road, until the morning of March 24, when the social distancing norms were in force because of Covid-19. Delhi Police in their charge sheet on the case of conspiracy behind the Delhi riots have claimed that the protest was not a spontaneous but planned and funded by a section of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters. Police have alleged that the road blockades such as the one in Shaheen Bagh, later replicated in other parts of the city, was the spot to make inflammatory speeches against the government and mobilise people for the riots. Police have also said that the alleged conspirators of the riots choose women and children as the faces of the protest to ensure that police found it difficult to evict the protesters by force.On Monday, while hearing a petition over the Shaheen Bagh blockade, the Supreme Court observed that the right to protest in public place should be balanced with the right of the general public to move freely without hindrance.Road 13A at Shaheen Bagh is now clear. The anti government messages on the roads and walls have been whitewashed by civic agencies. The shops are finally open. But police are more careful. A group of paramilitary force personnel still patrol road 13 A keeping a careful watch to ensure that no one sits on the road again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bilkis-dadi-of-shaheen-bagh-on-time-s-list-of-100-influential-people/story-WxcXIuH1ApLLKxuc13p8AN.html

He also acknowledged that his stance was against the “sentiments” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Sometimes we speak something inadvertently which doesn’t go in accordance with our feelings. The words I used yesterday regarding (wearing) the mask were completely wrong. I felt deeply anguished with my own words which were just opposite to the sentiments of the respected Prime Minister. I regret my statement,” Mishra said in a video message posted on his Twitter page on Thursday. Mishra, who appeared in the video with a mask around his neck, went on to add, “I request all the people to wear face masks and follow all Covid-related safety norms.” Also Read: Congress-BJP war on farm loan waivers intensifies ahead of key MP by pollsNotably, during his visit to Indore, Mishra, while responding to questions from journalists as to why he didn’t wear a mask, said, “I don’t wear a mask in any programme. How does it matter?” Narottam Mishra had held the portfolio of health department for more than 3 months this year from March onwards. He was often seen either not wearing a mask at all or not wearing it properly, leading to attacks from the Opposition Congress which even demanded his sacking from the cabinet.

Congress has been saying right from the day one that the BJP didn’t take coronavirus seriously and this very attitude of the party and its government is responsible for the spread of the virus in the state.” (With input from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-minister-regrets-stance-against-wearing-mask-invokes-pm-narendra-modi/story-GNq4oWHh2S3tjiGLyuKO4O.html

24-09-2020||India||British woman rape case accused vanishes from Goa jail, it’s his 3rd escape||More than 48-hours after Ramchandran Yellappa, a prisoner facing trial for allegedly having raped a British tourist in Goa in 2018, went missing, jail authorities are none the wiser over his whereabouts and whether he has escaped from the jail and if so, how he managed to pull it off. Ramchandran Yellappa, 32, was last seen at around 6:10 on Tuesday morning when he complained of a stomach ache and was referred to the dispensary within the jail premises. However, instead of going to the dispensary, he went missing en-route. He was noticed missing 20 minutes later after he didn’t report to the mess. It’s the third time he has given the police the slip.“We are also confused over what happened to him and if he has escaped, how he managed to pull it off,” a jail official said, on condition of anonymity.“We have searched every nook and corner of the jail and have not been able to find him. Neither is there any evidence of tunnelling or him having scaled the walls,” the official said. The Central Jail at Colvale, a village in North Goa, is a newly constructed correctional facility. A prisoner who seeks escape will not only have to manage to get out of his cell, leave his cell block and then get past two concentric boundary walls both of which are believed to be unscalable.“Even if a prisoner seeking to escape manages to get through one wall, he will only end up staring at the second wall that is even higher and believed to be impossible to climb over,” the official said. The outer boundary wall is watched from watchtowers and has only one way to get across -- the main gate. Another official speaking to HT, said he believed that Yellappa could have escaped with the help of an insider who either smuggled him out or helped him escape.Authorities initially believed that Yellappa was hiding within the complex but a search failed to find him or traces of his escape. While the inner wall is manned by armed guards of the Indian Reserve Battalion, the outer gate is manned by civilian security guards. These guards are set to be replaced now. Also Read: Concerned over tar balls sullying beaches, Goa writes to CentreAdditional Inspector General (IG) of prisons, Ashutosh Apte, said that a preliminary inquiry into the incident has found three persons -- one jail guard and two jailors -- guilty of dereliction of duty and have placed them under suspension. “They allowed the prisoner to walk unaccompanied. They have been suspended on account of the lapses. We are viewing this incident very seriously and if others are found to be at fault during the course of the inquiry, action will be taken against them too,” Apte said. A native of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, Yellappa was arrested in 2018 after a 42-year-old British woman complained that she was waylaid, robbed of Rs 20,000 and later raped. Also Read: Goa to approach SC to modify Tarun Tejpal trial timelines in view of Covid-19This is the third time Yellappa has given the police the slip. Last June, on a visit to the court, Yellappa sought the leave of his police escort to visit the toilet within the court complex but made good his escape by removing the glass panels that covered the ventilator at the court complex.Ramchandran Yellappa was first arrested by the Goa police on December 6, 2018 in North Goa in connection with two separate incidents of robbery, including one case where a young couple from Mumbai were relieved of Rs 35-lakh during their holiday in Morjim in North Goa. He however, slipped from their custody, and went on to commit the robbery and rape of a British woman in South Goa a few weeks later.This is the second incident of a prisoner escaping from the jail this year. In late August, a prisoner Hemraj Bharadwaj, who is facing trial in a narcotics case made good his escape taking advantage of the fact that he was given some prison chores and allowed outside the gates for the purpose. He was later apprehended while attempting to cross the border.Earlier this month a jail guard was suspended for trying to smuggle narcotics into the prison complex and placed under arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-woman-rape-case-accused-vanishes-from-goa-jail-it-s-his-3rd-escape/story-MivKsdjFUvUz6nYqc5CWcJ.html

Addressing ministers of Member Nations of WHO, Heads, and Representatives of UN Agencies and partner organisations, Dr Vardhan said, “In India, under the guidance of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, India has accorded high priority for ending tuberculosis by 2025, five years ahead of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).” “Tuberculosis has been in existence since time immemorial and continues to remain a major global public health problem. Despite the progress made over the last decade, TB remains the leading infectious killer disease worldwide,” he said. Lauding India’s efforts towards eradication of TB, Harsh Vardhan said, “With bold and innovative policies supported by commensurate resources, India has taken several critical steps towards ending TB. We have significantly reduced the number of missing TB patients from one million in 2016 to less than 0.5 million in 2019, with 2.4 million cases notified during the year. Most importantly, a third of these notifications were contributed by the private sector. With the scale-up of rapid molecular diagnostics in every district of the country, we were able to identify over 66,000 drug-resistant TB patients in 2019.”He pointed out that poverty is a powerful determinant of tuberculosis and undernutrition an important risk factor of developing active TB disease. “To address this, we are providing cash incentives through Direct Benefit Transfers for nutritional support and since April 2018, Rs 7.9 billion (around USD 110 million) have been distributed to over 3 million beneficiaries. Affordable and quality TB care is a priority for our Government”, he stated. The Minister further spoke about India’s fight against COVID-19 and said: “We reached a historic low in the month of April with lockdown in full force, but through sustained efforts, we have managed an increase of 43 per cent in May and another 25 per cent in June.”To mitigate the impact, the government has been issuing constant advisories to the States to ensure convergence of TB case finding with COVID-19 efforts, he said adding that “we have initiated bi-directional screening among TB and COVID patients, and screening for TB among influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI).” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

24-09-2020||India||Six Union ministers, MPs to lead BJP’s outreach plan in West Bengal||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is planning a massive outreach headed by at least six union ministers and MPs to counter the misgivings about the recently passed farm bills in West Bengal where the party is gearing for a bitter contest against the ruling Trinamool Congress. On Wednesday, a core team of the party from the state unit met BJP president J P Nadda in Delhi to draw up the plan for the outreach with an eye on the electoral battle for 294 seat assembly that is scheduled for May 2021. Also read: BJP outshines ruling TMC in race for social media advertisement campaignsThe state team will also move the high court in West Bengal to seek a CBI probe into the alleged killings of its political workers. As per a functionary privy to the details, the core team, which included state unit president Dilip Ghosh; has asked the central team to spare Union ministers Smriti Irani, Piyush Goel, N S Tomar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Kiren Rijiju and Prahlad Patel to counter the TMC’s campaign against the farm bills passed in Parliament. TMC MPs in the Rajya Sabha had objected to the bills not being sent to a select committee for further scrutiny and were part of the group that created a ruckus in the House. TMC’s Derek O’Obrien and Dola Sen were among the eight who were suspended subsequently for the remainder of the session that ended on Wednesday. These ministers have been specifically chosen because of their familiarity with the region and the language and they will be fielded to counter the narrative on the ground such as the outcry over the recently passed farm bills. “The opposition has been trying to mislead the masses that the farm bills passed in Parliament are anti-farmer and will lead to their lands being usurped. We will counter this through rallies, which will be held virtually as well as a few on the ground where the norms of social distancing will be followed,” said the person quoted above. Pamphlets in Bengali will also be distributed to reach out to a maximum number of people across the state. “The meeting was essential to discuss organisational issues. We will counter the chief minister’s campaign to deliberately distort bills passed by Parliament,” said union minister and MP from the state Babul Supriyo.

According to the forest official, the audio is stated to be more than a year old. HT couldn’t independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip.However, Shahdol’s Gohparu forest range officer Pushpa Singh, who was shifted, called it a conspiracy against her. In the audio the woman officer is heard saying “We always support you and never visited the mine. We shared information with you. But we do have a system and have to give … to the upper level in the area where mine was sanctioned.” “The amount is divided among senior officers. Lower staff also expects some amount. We want you to make progress. Even, I have asked…… that all the nearby illegal mining is accessed by you so that you get more vehicles for (sand transportation). We discussed that and are following the same,” the officer purportedly says on the tape. Chief conservator of forest (CCF), Shahdol division, Prabhat Kumar Verma ordered an inquiry into the matter and attached the forest ranger Pushpa Singh to Umaria forest range office till the completion of the inquiry. “The district forest officer, Shadol (south) will conduct the inquiry. We were told that the voice in the audio is of range officer Pushpa Singh. We have sent the audio clip to a forensic laboratory for an examination. The miners, whose names are heard in the audio, too, will be called for questioning during the inquiry to know the truth,” said Verma.

The mine in Suntola was shut down about 10 months ago. The mine was legal and it was shut down on my recommendations as the miners started mining in the forest area. This is a fabricated audio and I don’t know who hatched this conspiracy and why.” After the video went viral, the Opposition Congress attacked the BJP-led state government alleging a nexus between bureaucrats and illegal miners.“Since the BJP has come to power, illegal mining is going on at a large scale across the state and we all know who are patronising the mining mafia,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson MP Congress committee.

They raised accusing fingers against their own government,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-spar-over-audio-clip-alleging-mining-mafia-officials-nexus-in-mp/story-EYkgRBj8g7xh58TjOsjRUK.html

24-09-2020||India||Farm bills: Congress begins its nationwide mass movement against government||The Congress will launch from Thursday its nearly two-month-long “mass movement” against the government for passing “anti-farmer and anti-poor” bills during the monsoon session of Parliament. The party will also collect two crore signatures from protesting farmers against the proposed laws. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, have been passed by both the Houses of Parliament during the monsoon session and await Presidential assent. The Rajya Sabha (RS) witnessed ruckus during the passage of two of the three bills on Sunday following which eight members – Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Bora of the Congress, Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) – were suspended for the remainder of the monsoon session.Also Read: 28 trains cancelled as Punjab farmers begin three-day rail roko agitationThe session ended on Wednesday, which was eight days ahead of the October 1 schedule, amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The decision by the Congress to hit the streets was taken at a meeting of general secretaries and in-charge of states at the party headquarters in Delhi on Monday. The six-member special committee formed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to help her in organisational and operational matters chaired the meeting in her absence. AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala are members of the special committee. Accompanied by her son and Congress Member of Parliament (MP) Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi had left for the United States on September 12 for a routine health check-up. Both of them returned home on Tuesday morning. “The nationwide agitation will continue till the government repeals the black laws,” Antony had said after the meeting.

The Congress is also seeing the issue as a 2015 moment when Sonia Gandhi had played a key role in bringing 14 opposition parties together against the proposed land acquisition bill that had forced the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government to withdraw the controversial ordinance and shelve the idea of bringing a new legislation to replace the 2013 Act. “It is going to be a people’s movement, a mass movement against this government,” Patel had said. Venugopal, who is the Congress’s general secretary in-charge of organisation, said the party would have a series of programmes across the country in support of farmers. Apart from a chain of press conferences across the country starting from Thursday, Venugopal said senior leaders from states would walk to respective Raj Bhavans on September 28 and submit a memorandum on the farms bills to Governors to be handed over to President Ram Nath Kovind.

There will be protests and demonstrations in every district across the country demanding immediate withdrawal of the farm bills. On October 10, state-level conferences will be held and from October 2 to October 31, the party will collect signatures from two crore farmers from across the country. On November 14, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, a memorandum along with signatures of two crore farmers will be submitted to President Kovind. “First this government did notebandi, then with GST brought vyaparbandi, then with lockdown did deshbandi and is now planning khetbandi,” Surjewala had said. Surjewala will address a press conference in Patna on Thursday. Bihar is slated to go to polls by end-November. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-Congress combine is expected to step up its attacks on the ruling Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition by raising the farmers’ issue. While the JD(U) and the BJP will try to counter that by highlighting the “unruly behaviour” of some of the opposition members as an “insult” to RS deputy chairman Harivansh, who hails from the state, and an attack on Bihar’s pride.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-congress-begins-its-nationwide-mass-movement-against-government/story-Q0Xl10QaHNHPT25vNST32O.html
24-09-2020||India||Intense rainfall to continue over sub-Himalayan WB, Bihar and UP: IMD||Several parts of the west coast, including Mumbai and Konkan, and sub-Himalayan West Bengal were pounded by exceptionally heavy rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday, triggering severe urban flooding and landslides in the hills as the monsoon nears the start of its withdrawal phase.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted very heavy rainfall in parts of north-east India, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Konkan. Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP) for the next two-three days.For example, in Mumbai, the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) recorded 37 centimetres (cm) of rainfall on Tuesday night; Dharavi (36 cm); Panvel (31 cm); and Santacruz (29 cm), triggering flooding in the city and disrupting traffic. In West Bengal, Jalpaiguri and Bagdogra recorded 18 cm of rainfall each. IMD takes into account a 24-hour rainfall data.However, according to IMD scientists most of the rainfall was recorded within 12 hours – between Tuesday night and Wednesday early morning. Updated rain data for Wednesday will be available later on Thursday. “There is a convergence of strong moist southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and adjoining eastern India. This is the reason behind the region receiving heavy rainfall. There is a low-pressure system lying over central parts of western Madhya Pradesh (MP) which is likely to re-curve towards UP in the next couple of days and bring in widespread rainfall,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the IMD’s national weather forecasting centre.There are no indications of the commencement of the monsoon’s withdrawal from north-western India because of moisture incursion into the region, Devi said. IMD is not seeing any parameters of monsoon withdrawal being met until September 28, according to a statement by the department on Wednesday.The monsoon season will officially end on September 30.Rainfall should stop completely; water vapour should reduce and an anticyclonic wind pattern should establish itself before the monsoon’s withdrawal is officially announced, according to Devi.A low-pressure area is lying over central parts of western MP. It is likely to become less marked by Thursday. However, the cyclonic circulation, which is associated with it, is likely to re-curve north-eastwards to Bihar across UP over the next three days.Convergence of strong, moist southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and adjoining eastern India is very likely until Saturday (September 26). A trough, which means a low-pressure area, is running from north-east UP to northern Maharashtra. Heavy-to-very heavy rainfall will continue over sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, parts of Konkan, UP and Bihar until Saturday, according to IMD.The normal date for commencement of monsoon withdrawal from north-west India is September 17 and for complete withdrawal from the country is October 15, as per the new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates issued by the IMD in April. Until last year, the normal date for commencement of withdrawal of monsoon was September 1 and October 15 for a complete withdrawal. The new onset dates are based on monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and withdrawal dates are based on data from 1971 to 2019 analysed by scientists in IMD, Pune.In 2019, the monsoon had started withdrawing only on October 9 against the normal date of September 1 and prolonged rainfall had brought a deluge to parts of Maharashtra, Kerala and Bihar in August when rains usually reduce. The monsoon had withdrawn completely only by October 17.In September, rains are 0.6% deficient across the country. Since June 1, the country has recorded 8.1% excess rainfall, according to the IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intense-rainfall-to-continue-over-sub-himalayan-wb-northeastern-region-bihar-and-up-imd/story-kWLpPjngYPmmMhFMc0xqML.html

Talks are on with several other countries to facilitate two-way international travel. But there are some countries where Indians are not allowed to fly at this moment, implying that no air bubble can be set up with these countries as of now.What are air bubbles?Air bubbles are temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger service at a time when regular international flights across the world are suspended. International flights were suspended in March as all countries imposed lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19. Repatriation flights resumed in May, but these flights are different from air bubble flights as repatriation flights can’t carry passengers both ways.Also Read | International flights: Who are eligible to fly to these 13 countries?Where Indians can’t fly to and whyAs the countries are opening international travel gradually, the governments are in the process of identifying high-risk and safe countries.

24-09-2020||India||Punjab farmers organise ‘rail roko’ agitation in protest against farm bills from today||In protest against the Centre’s farm bills, farmers in Punjab will organise a three-day ‘rail roko’ agitation starting Thursday.After being cleared the Lok Sabha, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 were passed by voice vote in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday. Now they await the President’s nod to become laws.“We have decided to hold a ‘rail roko’ agitation from September 24 to 26 in the state against the farm bills,” Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said last week. The state’s farmers, along with farmers of Haryana and Opposition parties across the country, have been in staunch protest against the bills ever since they were slated to be tabled in the Lok Sabha.Another farmers’ organisation has called for a state-wide ‘bandh’ on September 25.The protesters worry that the bills will dismantle the current Minimum Support Prince (MSP) system and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates. However, the government claims that the MSP system will continue unchanged and the new bills will result in higher profits for the farmers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured the farmers on multiple occasions that the “very historic” bills will benefit them as they will take away the power from the hands of middlemen and give them the freedom to sell their produce where they see more profit.After the passage of the bills in the Upper House, Opposition leaders including Trinamool Congress’ Derek O’Brien and Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh entered the well of the Rajya Sabha while the session was in progress, demanding that the bills be referred to a select committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-farmers-organise-rail-roko-agitation-in-protest-against-farm-bills-from-today/story-OpeuJGVWwM45uv0oqiVu6L.html
24-09-2020||India||Productive but divisive monsoon session ends||Parliament’s monsoon session ended ahead of schedule on Wednesday, setting a new mark for productivity even as several parties sat out large parts of the legislation process, revealing heightened acrimony between the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and the Congress-led Opposition.The session — which was held with unprecedented social distancing norms — also opened a new political front in the form of farmers’ protests, and reinforced the danger posed by Covid-19 as 32 members (including two ministers) tested positive, eventually cutting down the already truncated session by eight more days.Both Houses approved a total of 25 bills, including three contentious bills for farm liberalisation and three for labour reforms, in the face of protests, walkouts and boycotts by opposition parties that accused the ruling side of denying them their parliamentary rights by pushing legislations without review. The Lower House clocked 167% productivity in the session — the highest in the history of Parliament (and broke the 1967 record of 163% productivity in the fourth Lok Sabha), according to Speaker Om Birla, who also announced that on September 21, when the House ran till 12.35am, the productivity stood at 234%, another record.To be sure, both Houses were allotted four hours daily instead of the normal seven-hour schedule as they had to convene on two different shifts in morning and afternoon due to social distancing norms in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Birla said that 370 MPs could participate in the Zero Hour and Under Rule 377, and that this level of participation was almost double of that in the 15th and 16th Lok Sabha.While Question Hour was suspended, the Lok Sabha saw 2,300 written answers while the Upper House 1,567 replies.“The situation was extraordinary. We are also a big Parliament, in numbers. But the way the Houses were run both by the Rajya Sabha Chairperson and the Lok Sabha Speaker was outstanding. The political situation was also very tense,” parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said: “We are shocked to see how bills are passed since this government came to power in 2014. No bill is sent either to a standing committee or a select committee for further scrutiny. This is not good for democracy.”The acrimony was evident even on the last day of the session with leaders of 18 opposition parties visiting President Ram Nath Kovind and requesting him to withdraw the farm bills, even as the Rajya Sabha pushed through the labour reforms with no opposition to any legislative activity.Amid a boycott by opposition parties, Parliament approved the three key labour reform bills on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety with the Rajya Sabha passing them by voice vote.Fierce protests led to nearly two days of the Rajya Sabha being washed out, yet the Upper House utilised 100.5% of its allotted time in what was its second-shortest monsoon session since 1952. Instead of the scheduled 18 sittings, only 10 sittings were held between September 14 and 23.The Rajya Sabha has consistently recorded its highest productivity in the last four sessions and spent a record 58% of the business hours on passing bills during the session, against an average of 28% over the years.But the ill will on display between the treasury and opposition benches bore testimony to a widening fracture in Indian polity, casting a shadow on the session and prompting the Opposition to contend that the productivity achievements being listed were meaningless.One of the key flash points was the suspension of eight Rajya Sabha MPs over their unruly conduct during the passage of two of the three crucial farm bills in the Upper House on Sunday. The members heckled the deputy chairman, tried to uproot microphones and tear rule books and stood on the table.On the last day of the session, members of opposition parties protested in different ways against the contentious farm bills, from holding a silent march in the Parliament complex to carrying bundles of paddy crop in their hands to rushing to the President’s House.They made a representation to President Kovind and requested him not to give his assent to the bills. They conveyed to the President that the passage of the bills in Rajya Sabha was “unconstitutional”.The session, held after a gap of six months due to the coronavirus pandemic, was marked by several new initiatives such as both Houses working in shifts; MPs from one House sitting in the chamber of the other and in the galleries; members working though the weekend and speaking while remaining seated; and plexiglass sheets on every seat as well as strict social distancing norms.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu said in his valedictory speech: “For the first time in this history of this august House, a notice of motion for removal of the Hon’ble Deputy Chairman has been given. It had to be rejected for the reasons I have elaborated while doing so. The developments in the House surrounding this unprecedented move have been deeply painful for all those who hold the stature and the dignity of this august House dear to their hearts.”Naidu also added, “I would like to remind all of you that in 1997 and 2012, this august House had resolved that all the members will uphold the dignity of the House by complying with the Rules and Procedures laid down. If we adhere to these resolutions there will be order in the House and when there is order in the House, the House can function as the country expects it to function.”Afzal Amanullah, former parliamentary affairs secretary said Parliament functioned during a very challenging time and proved once again that it can withstand any challenge.“At the same time, the government should have walked an extra mile to take the Opposition into confidence on key issues and ensure a smooth process of parliamentary discourse. The latter, unfortunately, didn’t happen,” Amanullah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/productive-but-divisive-monsoon-session-ends/story-9p11xe8pTgoXrIHCuq2ChL.html
24-09-2020||India||Military offset part of Rafale deal still pending, flags CAG||Two weeks after the Indian Air Force (IAF) formally inducted five of the 36 Rafale jets ordered from France under a Rs 59,000-crore deal, the country’s top auditor on Wednesday said that the plane’s maker Dassault Aviation and weapons-supplier MBDA have not confirmed the transfer of technology (ToT) to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which was part of the contract.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in a detailed report tabled in Parliament, doubted if the ToT for a key engine would even take place, and pointed out that several offset contracts built into multiple defence deals have “not yielded the desired results”.The critical observations were part of CAG’s scrutiny of the status of a raft of offset contracts — including the September 2016 Rafale deal — between 2005 and 2018.India’s offset policy stipulates that in all capital purchases above Rs 300 crore, the foreign vendor has to invest at least 30% of the value of the purchase in the country to boost indigenous capabilities. In the case of the Rafale deal this was 50%.According to the CAG report, the defence ministry stated as recently as October 2019 (the first Rafale was handed over in France on October 8, 2019) that the vendors had not yet been able to confirm their capability for technology transfer.“In the offset contract relating to 36 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), the vendors M/s Dassault Aviation and M/s MBDA initially proposed (September 2015) to discharge 30% of their offset obligation by offering high technology to DRDO.The DRDO wanted to obtain Technical Assistance for the indigenous development of engine (Kaveri) for the Light Combat Aircraft. Till date the Vendor has not confirmed the transfer of this technology,” said the report.HT has reviewed parts of report and a press release issued by CAG.CAG also said that DRDO should identify the right technologies for transfer, while sharply criticising foreign vendors who made several offset commitments to qualify for a contract but were later not earnest about fulfilling their commitments.Foreign vendors have to select Indian firms as their offset partners to fulfil their obligations.To be sure, in case of the Rafale deal, the DRDO’s offset share worked out to 30%, while 20% has been allocated to the private sector, including Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) -- Dassault’s joint venture (JV) with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group. CAG did not pick any loopholes as far as the 20% allocation to the private sector, and asked the defence ministry to get more details about its progress.The report said the defence ministry stated in October 2019 that the vendors had not been able to “confirm their capability to carry out the requisite upgradation”.“Thus, it is not clear if even this technology transfer (for engine) will take place, and there is need for the MoD/DRDO to identify and acquire the right technologies in order to comply with the directions of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) given in September 2016,” the report said.The defence ministry and DRDO declined to comment on the matter. The response to an e-mail sent to Dassault Aviation was awaited when this report was filed.However, French industry officials said they had given a detailed list of 10 to 15 technologies that could be transferred to the DRDO and the “ball was in the latter’s court”.The officials said that the offset obligations as part of the 36 jet deal were progressing as per the timeline in the case of the private sector JV (with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group) despite the challenges posed by Covid-19.“The DRDO has to figure out what technologies it wants to take and can absorb,” the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.In the case of private offset partners, CAG said since the discharge period had started — September 23, 2019, to September 23, 2020 — the defence ministry “needs to get the details of the specific products/services being offered for discharge of offset, to monitor and ensure that the objectives of the offset are achieved”.The Comptroller and Auditor General of India said that the aim of the offset policy was to develop the Indian defence sector to achieve self-reliance and cut dependence on imports.However, the audit found that the several vendors were not discharging their obligations as per their commitments.“From 2005 till March 2018, 46 offset contracts had been signed with foreign vendors, valued at ₹66,427 crore. Under these contracts, by December 2018, ₹19,223 crore worth of offsets should have been discharged by the vendors. However, the offsets claimed to have been discharged by them was only ₹11,396 crore, which was only 59% of the commitment. Further, only 48% (₹5,457 crore) of these offset claims submitted by the vendors were accepted by the ministry. The rest were largely rejected as they were not compliant to the contractual conditions and the Defence Procurement Procedure,” CAG noted.The auditor said the remaining offset commitments of about ₹55,000 crore would be due to be completed by 2024.“The rate at which the foreign vendors have been fulfilling their offset commitments was about ₹1,300 crore per year. Given this situation, fulfilling the commitment of ₹55,000 crore by the vendors in the next six years (CAG observation is of 2018) remains a major challenge,” the report said.CAG said there were no effective means of penalising the vendors on account of failure to meet the offset commitments.Experts said discharge of offsets by vendors was unsatisfactory and some changes were necessary.Inter-government agreements and foreign military sales have to be brought under the purview of offsets, said Lieutenant General Subrata Saha (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board and a former army deputy chief.“In 2016 with some deft application of policy, offset was associated with the ultra-light howitzer (ULH) procurement from the US. The number of industries that have successfully discharged offsets are very limited. The major issue here is the fact that we have not mapped industries working in defence sector and their capabilities. The number of MSME’s engaged in defence quoted by different agencies widely vary. Proper mapping of defence industries will help in utilising the offset facility much better,” said Saha, who was closely associated with defence procurement as the deputy chief.He said ToT must be given the highest priority with due incentives.“In addition to tightening the avenues for discharging offset, with the aim of improving India’s defence industrial capability, there has to be simplification of process as the multiplicity of agencies involved and sequential process takes too long,” Saha added.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later.This replaced a previous United Progressive Alliance regime decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Congress alleged that the new deal entailed buying the fighter jets at a higher price. The government denied this, and the Supreme Court said in a judgment that the deal did not require scrutiny.The deal also become controversial on account of the fact that one of the offset deals signed by Dassault was with the Reliance Group of Anil Ambani.The Congress claimed that the earlier deal was scrapped and a new one signed to provide Ambani this opportunity for an offset deal. Both the government and Reliance have repeatedly denied this.As mentioned above, the problems flagged by CAG are not this part of the offset deal. A February 2019CAG report said the deal to buy the jets was kosher and cheaper than that was being negotiated by the UPA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-offset-part-of-rafale-deal-still-pending-flags-cag/story-buaMwr182Gkuhjt2pGwcpK.html
24-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There’s a week to go before Unlock 5.0, which some believe will be the last phase of the restart of activities halted when the country went into a lockdown on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The lockdown lasted 68 days, till May 31; a few establishments and activities were allowed to restart even in this period. Since June 1, there have been four sets of guidelines issued by the home ministry, Unlock 1.0 through Unlock 4.0, each detailing a new dimension of opening up. Restaurants have opened up, Metro services have resumed in all but two of the Indian cities that have Metro services, the number of scheduled flights has increased, as has the number of people attending offices (although many still continue to work from home). The latest iteration of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index was at 82.3 for the week ended September 20 (where 100 reflects pre-pandemic level business activity). This is higher than 81.3 the previous week, so the index is clearly on an upswing. This is the highest the index (which was stuck in the 70s for months in between, after falling to the 40s during the hard lockdown) has ever been since the lockdown. Google’s Mobility Trends for workplaces, according to the latest iteration, are 26% below baseline, again, an improvement (they were 30.4% below baseline in June).Guidelines for Unlock 5.0 could come as early as the end of this week. They come against the backdrop of a high number of daily new cases (India continues to lead the world in the number of new cases, although Europe is in the midst of a very strong second wave of infections), but also at a time when most states have moved out of lockdown mode, at least for most establishments and activities. The big announcement everyone is either looking forward to, or not looking forward to, is about the reopening of schools. Lockdown 4.0 allowed high-schoolers to attend school for up to a few hours a day, on rotation (with the teachers too being rotated), with the permission of the parents – and only for “guidance” or “counselling”. The rationale was that these were important school-years and students needed some interaction with their teachers. This wasn’t exactly a “school reopening” as some insisted on calling it. It is likely that Unlock 5.0 guidelines will allow more of this (perhaps for more classes, or for longer durations). With almost half the academic year over, it is also likely that the guidelines allow a more formal reopening of schools. After all, online classes put underprivileged students at a disadvantage although a recent Delhi high court ruling on schools in the Capital having to provide devices and connectivity, and be reimbursed by the state and central governments, could serve as a precedent in other parts of the country as well.I’d rather that governments focus on this (devices and connectivity for all students; and a proper online curriculum to boot) than rush into reopening schools. Cases are yet to peak in India, and experience from around the world suggests that school (and college) reopenings do cause flare-ups in infections.On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal, citing a study by researchers from the University of North Carolina, Indiana University, the University of Washington, and Davidson College, that it said would soon be posted on pre-print server medRxiv (it wasn’t at the time of writing this column) reported that the US saw 3,200 more cases a day on account of college reopenings. The study covered the period between mid-July and mid-September and tracked GPS data of mobile phones to measure infection rates in and around colleges at two points in time – before students arrived, and after they did. The highest increase was in colleges with physical or in-person classes, and the lowest in those with online classes. The UK reopened schools in September but with a sharp increase in cases (a natural consequence of reopening, and not just schools); absenteeism and partial closures of schools have increased over the course of the month. The UK, like continental Europe, is in the midst of a second wave with the seven-day average of daily cases only a thousand below peak-levels last seen in May.Policymakers in India have the case-study of how Covid-19 roiled (and eventually cut short) the monsoon session of Parliament before them – it would be unfortunate if they make students face the risks that lawmakers themselves want to avoid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-7oL83ujBFgVn8KS0SOoLIP.html
24-09-2020||India||PM Modi relaxes SDRF cap to help states fight virus||States can dip further into their disaster relief funds, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a meeting with the chief ministers of the seven states hit hardest by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, while also urging them to consider whether intermittent lockdowns help or are coming in the way of restarting economic activity. The Prime Minister held a video conference with the CMs of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Punjab – regions that the Union health ministry said together account for at least 63% of active cases and 77% of fatalities due to the viral disease. For Covid-19, all states can use up to 50% of their state disease relief fund (SDRF), up from a cap of 35% set in April. “Because of this decision the states will get more money to fight Covid 19,” the Prime Minister said, according to the text of his speech released by the government. The Union government has in all allocated ₹11,902 crore as SDRF to all states, as per recommendations of the Finance Commission. Several states have of late flagged to the Union government shortage in funds, particularly due to delayed payments of the Goods and Services (GST) compensation due to a slump in tax collections. At Wednesday’s meeting, the Union health ministry made a presentation where it said Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi have seen higher deaths with the case fatality rate (the proportion of deaths as per confirmed cases) above 2%, officials said.The Prime Minister and the CMs discussed several issues and shared notes about their economic recovery. The leaders of Karnataka and Punjab flagged potential shortages of oxygen cylinders. Uttar Pradesh chief minister said the state’s tax collections in August had climbed back to levels in the corresponding period last year. Economic recovery was among the key areas of discussions, with the PM recommending the states follow a ‘micro containment zones’ strategy. “The nationwide lockdown in the initial phases yielded very positive results and our focus now should be on micro-containment zones,” he said.The PM also asked the states to take a relook at whether intermitted lockdowns help in controlling spread of Covid. “Is it because of this reason that starting of economic activities in your state is facing problems?” the PM asked. Some states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh implemented weekend lockdowns and West Bengal shut down on two consecutive days in a week. Chhattisgarh has gone for a longer lockdown of 10 days in 14 districts.Overall, the PM said states must further enhance their focus on effective testing, tracing, treatment, surveillance and clear messaging to curb the pandemic. “Some people even make the mistake of undermining the seriousness of the disease,” Modi said, while pitching for the need of an effective messaging especially with regard to use of masks.Prime Minister Modi said it has to be ensured that medicines move unhindered from one state to another and noted that India has also been able to supply medicines across the world during such hard times.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh sought adequate supplies of medical oxygen from other states and release of ₹200 crore of the next tranche of central aid for Covid management. The chief minister said that with no manufacturers of medical oxygen, the state was dependent largely on three big manufacturers for liquid oxygen in Himachal and Haryana.India has over 5.7 million coronavirus cases and more than 90,000 deaths, and is the nation second worst-hit in the world after the US. Over the last 24 hours, 86,941 new cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-relaxes-sdrf-cap-to-help-states-fight-virus/story-DOOlHSsDrzqwHaGXXGfLTL.html
24-09-2020||India||Better infra may boost cycle use post-Covid, projects study||Dependence on public buses and private vehicles for short trips (6km or less) can be reduced by up to 40% if adequate cycling infrastructure is provided in Delhi within the next three years, according to a study by the Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI). It can also help reduce vehicular congestion and pollution, the four-month-long study says, using projections on commuting patterns and use of different modes of transport after comparing data from before and after the lockdown.The study was conducted April onwards. The study used secondary data from different sources to project at least 15% increase in the cycling trips from pre-Covid months. It says that vehicular traffic on city roads is gradually increasing ever since the Centre announced the gradual relaxation in the restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease under the Unlock guidelines. Before the traffic volume hits the pre-Covid level, the government should scale-up infrastructure to encourage non-motorised vehicles for shorter commutes, the study advocates. The research body said six kilometres is a “cycleable distance”, and efforts should be made to convert short trips by cars and other motorised modes of transport into cycling trips. Mukti Advani, principal scientist of the transportation planning division at CSIR-CRRI, said it is the ideal time to push for cycling because traffic is lower than usual, with a substantial percentage of people still working from home.“We should make the most of this time when the traffic on road is far less as compared to before Covid. Currently, a large percentage of the working population is at home. If we can provide the cycling infrastructure now, it will help people gradually get used to it. By second or the third year when the workforce will be back in full strength, cycling, especially for short distances, would have become normal,” said Advani, who conducted the study. As per the study, it is estimated that there could be a 21% reduction in the use of two-wheelers, 14% in cars and 11% of Metro and 40% of buses. “This will help in a big way to bring down traffic on roads and in turn reduce pollution due to vehicles,” she added. Cities such as Berlin, Milan, London, Rome and Paris have created pop-up bike lanes during the pandemic, either by painting the lane or by placing bollards along the length of the roads to encourage people to use bicycles. Transport experts said not much has to be done in Delhi to ensure a “decent network” for cycling. Anuj Malhotra, knowledge partner to the high-powered committee under the Union ministry of home affairs, said this can be easily done by completing the missing cycling links in existing infrastructure. Nearly 40km of cycling infrastructure around games venues was constructed during the Commonwealth Games in 2010, but it was all disconnected.“Protected tracks are needed only on those roads where vehicular traffic speed or traffic volume is high. Prioritising Metro access and to schools is a start. There are several stretches in Delhi which have cycling tracks. The first thing we should do is to connect these tracks and provide proper signages,” said Malhotra. Malhotra’s firm, Centre for Green Mobilities, has done two studies---one in Dwarka and the other around Metro stations -- in Delhi to assess the demand for cycling and how the infrastructure can be provided. “It is easy to cycle for 9-10 minutes, which covers a distance of three kilometres. If infrastructure in the area of three-kilometre radius around Metro stations is improved, then nearly 80% of Delhi’s will have access to Metro on a cycle. In the Dwarka survey, we found that a majority of trips were educational and to work. A majority of the trips were within five kilometre distance, which is covered within 20 minutes,” he said. Transport expert Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that as per data from Census 2011, nearly 48% of the daily trips in Delhi are made within a five-kilometre range.She said these trips can easily be converted into walking or cycling trips by creating safe infrastructure with temporary arrangements. “Cycling is a good option for people who have to travel short distances. It will also take the load off the public transport system. While providing infrastructure, we should ensure that the roads, including the ones in residential colonies, form a network so that people can use it,” said Roychowdhury.With a larger number of people taking to cycling across the world, Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, said, “These pop-up bike lanes can be easily created. We, too, have been creating these dedicated pathways for years during monsoon for the Kanwar pilgrims. All we have to do is to make it a permanent feature on our roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-infra-may-boost-cycle-use-post-covid-projects-study/story-o6vD70wmjCz4U6fxK4g8SN.html
24-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha bids farewell to 11 MPs||Rajya Sabha on Wednesday bid farewell to 11 members whose tenure will end in November. Of the members who will not be present when the House resumes for the winter session, three are from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), four from Samajwadi Party (SP), and two each from the Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). They members who retired include civil aviation minister and BJP leader Hardeep Singh Puri, BJP’s Neeraj Shekhar and Arun Singh, SP leaders Ram Gopal Yadav , Javed Ali Khan, Ravi Prakash Verma and Chandrapal Singh Yadav , BSP’s Veer Singh and Rajaram and Congress’s Raj Babbar and P L Punia.While the opposition members were not present inside the House, only BJP’s Neeraj Shekhar made a farewell speech. “As a kid, I used to come to Parliament House with my father (former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar) and we used to play in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha... There wasn’t much security in those days. Since then, I aspired to become an MP,” he said.Stating that bringing legislations that will change the future of children should be a priority, he said he prays for a clean, educated, and strong country.The vacancies will bring down the SP and the BSP’s strength in the House, while the BJP will add to its tally when the re-elections are held. The party is in power in Uttarakhand and UP.“The retiring members have contributed significantly to the deliberations of this House and the parliamentary committees. I place on record my appreciation for the valuable contributions and service rendered by them with utmost dedication and fervour to further the cause of democracy,” Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said. Naidu said some of the members will return to the House after re-election.Wednesday is the last date of the current monsoon session after the government decided to curtail the 18-day session in view of the pandemic.The session that started on September 14 was to continue till October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-bids-farewell-to-11-mps/story-lB3nsHHL2p1FkEV3j1slFM.html
24-09-2020||India||Oppn meets Kovind, urges him not to approve three farm bills||Opposition parties on Wednesday requested President Ram Nath Kovind to withhold his assent for the contentious farm bills, alleging that the government had “undermined rules, regulations and procedures” in pushing the bill through the Rajya Sabha on Sunday.“The Constitution of India was torn to shreds in the temple of democracy” by the government, leader of the Opposition in the RS, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said.On behalf of 18 opposition parties, the senior Congress leader met the President and told him that the passage of the farm bills in the Rajya Sabha was “unconstitutional”, and that he should return the bills without signing them. The parties included the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Aam Aadmi Party , Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party, Indian Union Muslim League, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, the Shiv Sena, and six others.Two of the three bills were passed through a voice vote amid opposition protests, with members storming the well of the House and rushing towards deputy chairman Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings. They alleged that the bills, which they said would benefit corporate houses and not farmers, should have been sent to a select committee, and that their demand for a division of votes was rejected. Eight members were suspended for the remainder of the session. Most of the other opposition parties also boycotted the rest of the session in both Houses. The third bill was passed on Tuesday, when the Opposition boycotted the session, which ended on Wednesday, eight days ahead of schedule, amid the Covid-19.The bills -- the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- have been passed by both Houses of Parliament and await Presidential assent to become law.Azad told reporters after meeting Kovind that the government should have consulted all the political parties and farmer unions and leaders before introducing the farm bills in Parliament.“The government has crossed all the limits. The Constitution of India was torn to shreds in the temple of democracy. All the rules, regulations and procedures were undermined during the passage of the bills in the Rajya Sabha. We have told the President that these bills have been passed unconstitutionally,” he said.A Congress functionary said leaders of the 18 parties met twice during the day to chalk out their future course of action on the farmers’ issue. It was after the first meeting that the leaders decided to call on the President, this person added on condition of anonymity. The parties also requested Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to revoke the suspension of the eight members, but the government insisted that they first apologise for their conduct. The standoff between the government and the Opposition over the farm bills has escalated with both sides taking a hardline on the issue. While the Congress has decided to hit the streets across the country from Thursday, other regional opposition parties are planning campaigns in their respective states. Oppositions parties also marched from from Gandhi statue to Ambedkar statue in Parliament complex protesting the anti-Farmers, anti-Workers Bills. Opposition leaders also wrote to Naidu urging him not to pass the three labour codes in the Upper House in the absence of opposition parties. “It will be a blot on democracy if bills are passed unilaterally,” they wrote. The Rajya Sabha passed the three labour codes on Wednesday before adjourning sine die. Hailing the passage of key labour bills, prime minister Narendra Modi said, “Long due and much awaited Labour reforms have been passed by Parliament. The reforms will ensure well-being of our industrious workers and give a boost to economic growth.”The Lok Sabha was also later adjourned amid boycott by the opposition. Though Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi returned from the US on Tuesday, a party leader said they did not attend the LS on Wednesday in view of the Covid protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-meets-kovind-urges-him-not-to-approve-three-farm-bills/story-5p0ENyxFVU3PLjJx0LiqLO.html
24-09-2020||India||How will China’s offensive play out in Ladakh? IAF war games have an answer||The deployment of at least 50,000 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and in the occupied Aksai Chin region, apart from heavy weaponry and missiles, is indicative of the Russian influence not only on Chinese military equipment, but also in war planning and execution, according to a top Indian Air Force (IAF) officer. The officer, who dissected the Chinese positioning and war plan in a worst-case scenario for HT on condition of anonymity, said that a Chinese offensive, if and when it comes, is likely to involve troops moving forward under a barrage of artillery and rocket fire, with surface-to-air missile batteries giving protection to their weapon systems from IAF attacks. “This is the old Soviet way of fighting a war, with troops based in depth areas (in this case, Hotan airbase 320km from the Line of Actual Control) providing the air-defence cover,” the officer added. While several strategic experts believe that any future war will be fought with stand-off weapons used to force Indian fighters to remain on ground, the IAF’s “disperse, absorb, recoup and retaliate” strategy has been war-gamed enough times (including in the Gagan Shakti 2018 exercise) to repel China’s plans, the officer said. He explained that the reaction of the IAF to any offensive is faster than that of the PLA Air Force due to the distance of the LAC from air bases such as Hotan, Lhasa or Kashgar, and that PLA’s surface-to-air missile sites become vulnerable to the stand-off air-to-ground missiles of Indian fighters. “Once air-defence missile systems are knocked out, the amassed artillery, rockets and troop concentrations become exposed on the Tibetan desert, where there is no natural camouflage cover for these systems,” the officer said.The officer cited above further said that while the PLA has packed depth areas with troops, any aggression on mountainous terrain will not be easy against a dug-in adversary like the Indian Army in Ladakh. The 1999 Kargil war taught the Indian army that when the aggressor is concentrated and exposed, it becomes vulnerable to air interdiction. This makes the effort to hit Indian troops, who are dominating strategic heights both in the north and south of Pangong Tso, harder in the winter months. Even a Chinese stand-off weapon, given its circular error of probability (a measure of precision) may find it hard to target dug-in troops sitting on mountaintops in sub-polar temperatures, and in the absence of cover from attacking forces in the cold Ladakh desert and the Soda Plains, he added.The officer was confident that Indian forces could sustain a Chinese strike in a worst-case scenario.The military is prepared for a 10-day intensive war, with the Narendra Modi government allowing emergency purchases of critical ammunition and missiles after the 2016 Uri surgical strikes and 2019 Balakot strikes against Pakistan. “Any India-China hostility is unlikely to continue at an intense level without global intervention beyond 10 days,” the officer explained, adding that the indigenous ammunition is available for 40 days and conventional bombs for 60 days. With four or five additional Rafale fighters, on which IAF pilots are training in France, ready to join the Ambala squadron next month, and a new Ladakh Corps Commander, Lt Gen PGK Menon, taking over, both the armies appear quite evenly matched, he said. In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from points they could previously patrol. But the Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the lake’s southern bank that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling the country’s borders in the Ladakh sector, signalling a strong resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC, even as the focus of multiple diplomatic and military talks between the two sides has been to “disengage and de-escalate”. Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd), former Vice Chief of Army Staff, said: “The situation on the LAC is escalating despite intense diplomatic efforts by India and talks between military commanders (of both the nations). It requires full operational readiness all along the LAC to pre-empt any reckless action by China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-war-plan-takes-leaf-out-of-russian-playbook/story-LovIlFVsyTTK2ChWHybUMK.html

24-09-2020||India||Turkish President Erdogan’s J&K remark riles India||India on Wednesday rejected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s comments that Kashmir is a “burning issue” for the stability of South Asia, saying the remarks were tantamount to “gross interference” in the country’s internal affairs. This was not the first time that India and Turkey have engaged in a terse exchange on the Kashmir issue – Erdoğan has repeatedly raised the matter after the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year, and India has pushed back on each occasion. In a video message for a special session marking the 75th anniversary of the UN, Erdoğan said: “The Kashmir conflict, which is also key to the stability and peace of South Asia, is still a burning issue. Steps taken following the abolition of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir further complicated the problem. “We are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of the UN resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.” Soon after, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, tweeted that Erdoğan’s remarks were “totally unacceptable”. “We have seen remarks by President of Turkey on Indian [union territory of} Jammu & Kashmir. They constitute gross interference in India’s internal affairs and are completely unacceptable. Turkey should learn to respect sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply,” Tirumurti said. Erdoğan’s remarks were welcomed by his ally, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who said in a tweet: “Deeply appreciate President Erdoğan once again raising his voice in support of the rights of the Kashmiri people during his address to UNGA. Turkey’s unwavering support remains a source of strength for the Kashmiris in their legitimate struggle for self determination.” Erdoğan was among the few leaders who had raised the Kashmir issue at last year’s UN General Assembly session and he subsequently also raised it during a visit to Pakistan in February. He raised the matter despite India’s external affairs ministry warning that such remarks would affect bilateral ties. In February, India made a strong demarche with the Turkish government on Erdoğan’s remarks on Jammu and Kashmir during his visit to Islamabad. “These remarks reflect neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy. They distort events of the past to advance a narrow-minded view of the present,” the external affairs ministry spokesperson had said at the time. The remarks in February were also described as “one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries”, and India also rejected the “repeated attempts by Turkey to justify the cross-border terrorism practised so blatantly by Pakistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/turkish-president-erdogan-s-j-k-remark-riles-india/story-trWBqv4H5eWhzvQy4BqL8J.html
24-09-2020||India||MoS railways Suresh Angadi dies of Covid-19||Union minister of state for railways and four-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) from Karnataka’s Belagavi constituency, Suresh Angadi, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi on Wednesday evening. He was 65.Angadi, a lawyer and education baron who rose through the ranks in the BJP after being appointed the vice-president of the party’s Belagavi district unit in 1996, is the fourth MP to succumb to the disease that has claimed around 90,000 lives in India. “Shri Suresh Angadi was an exceptional karyakarta, who worked hard to make the party strong in Karnataka. He was a dedicated MP and effective minister, admired across the spectrum. His demise is saddening. My thoughts are with his family and friends in this sad hour. Om Shanti,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.The national flag will be flown at half mast on Thursday in government offices in Delhi due to Angadi’s demise, said a senior home ministry official.Angadi announced on September 11 that he tested positive for the disease. He was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi soon after for treatment. Angadi is survived by wife Mangala, and daughters Spoorthi and Shraddha.“Shocked to know the passing away of Shri Suresh Angadi, Union minister of state of railways. An amiable leader Shri Angadi worked tirelessly for the people of his constituency, Belagavi and Karnataka,” President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted.Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said Angadi was like a brother. “Words fall short to describe his commitment & dedication towards the people. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this hour of need. Om Shanti,” Goyal tweeted.“He will always be remembered for his selfless service to the nation and party. My deepest condolences are with his family. Om Shanti Shanti Shanti,” Union home minister Amit Shah tweeted.BJP president JP Nadda also condoled the death. “Extremely saddened by the passing away of central minister Shri Suresh Angadi Ji. He was a remarkable leader who dedicated all his life for organisation and went on to serve society with utmost diligence and compassion,” he tweeted.YSR Congress MP from Tirupati, Balli Durga Prasad Rao, Congress MP from Kanyakumari, H Vasanthakumar, and BJP Rajya Sabha MP, Ashok Gasti, have also died of Covid-19 so far.A relatively late entrant to politics, Angadi was considered a BJP strongman from the Mumbai-Karnataka region of Karnataka and was instrumental in the BJP winning 25 of the state’s 28 seats in the 2019 general elections. He first won the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat in 2004 and remained undefeated. He was appointed the junior railways minister in 2019.Angadi also ran a clutch of educational institutions under the Suresh Angadi Education Foundation including an engineering college, arts and commerce college, architecture college and international school.His death was condoled by leaders across the political spectrum in Karnataka. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa expressed his shock and said Angadi was a “people’s leader”. Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) chief, HD Deve Gowda, said Angadi was like a younger brother to him. “I feel terrible losing him. This is an unbearable loss to our nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mos-railways-suresh-angadi-dies-of-covid-19/story-5BwqaDOv9OwInLIi7325yN.html
24-09-2020||India||Congress accuses BSY’s family of graft||The Congress on Wednesday alleged that chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s son, grandson and son-in-law had taken a ₹17 crore bribe in connection with the awarding of a ₹666.22 crore construction project of the Bangalore Development Authority in 2017.Citing an alleged sting operation by a Kannada TV channel, Congress’s national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala — on his maiden visit to the state after becoming the party’s general secretary for Karnataka — said: “Is it correct that the CM’s son Vijayendra was in clear knowledge of Rs 12 crore bribe having been taken by the BDA commissioner from the contractor, allegedly in the name of the CM and his son?”Vijayendra dismissed the allegations in a tweet, saying: “Shocking that @rssurjewala...has come all the way to Bengaluru and ended up parroting the false charges & lies made...by a private TV channel with history of character assassination, blackmail, and extortion.”Surjewala demanded a judicial enquiry and the resignation of CM Yediyurappa.Congress released extracts of alleged Whatsapp conversations, phone calls and bank transaction statements to make its point. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents furnished.Former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, who was accompanying Surjewala, said that Vijayendra demanded ₹17 crore of which ₹7.4 crore was transferred through RTGS to Shashidhar (Yediyurappa’s grandson) and the rest was delivered in cash to Virupakashappa (the CM’s son-in-law) at his residence in Hubli.On September 20, Vijayendra had tweeted: “Being in public life is not easy. You refuse illegal demands & reject requests of News channel head and the channel turns vicious against you & your family members. I won’t take this lying down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-accuses-bsy-s-family-of-graft/story-b8bd8SuERHMX8SQdHw1n7O.html

24-09-2020||India||EC: Didn’t ask CBDT to issue notice to Pawar||The Election Commission (EC) of India on Wednesday issued a statement denying reports that it had directed the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to issue a notice to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar over the declaration of his assets in the election affidavits filed over more than a decade.“In some sections of media it has been reported that Income Tax notice has been issued to Shri Sharad Pawar, member of Parliament, on the directions of Election Commission of India. In this context, it is stated that the Election Commission of India has not issued any such direction to CBDT to issue notice to Shri Pawar,” it said.The EC’s comments came after Pawar said that a tax notice had been served to him at the behest of the Commission, and that he had heard similar notices were sent to his daughter Supriya Sule, and Maharashta’s chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya. The NCP and the Thackery’s Shiv Sena are alliance partners in the Maharashtra government. Pawar took a swipe at the Centre over the notice on Tuesday, saying it reflected a “feeling of love” for them. His party on Wednesday confirmed that the notice was sent.A person familiar with the matter, however, said that EC received no complaint against Pawar that could have been forwarded to CBDT. “There have been no such complaints to the EC. In the case of Aaditya and Uddhav Thackeray, the complaints received by EC have been forwarded to the CBDT to investigate,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. EC has forwarded a month-and-a-half old complaint against NCP’s Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter, to the tax watchdog as well. “The EC has not asked CBDT to serve any notices, it has merely forwarded the complaints it has received for their consideration,” the person added. HT could not directly confirm if Sule has been issued any I-T notice yet. On Tuesday, Pawar said he received the notice from the income tax department the previous day. “It was sent on the directives of the Election Commission of India (ECI). They have sought information and clarification related to the details on assets shared by me in election affidavits filed in 2020, 2014 and 2009-10. I heard that [NCP lawmaker] Supriya [Sule] is also likely to get a similar notice soon. I will have to immediately respond to the notice as it also warned of things like raids,” Pawar told reporters.Party spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said that the NCP chief has received notice from the I-T department based on his affidavits filed with the election commission. “Pawar saheb has got the I-T notice is a fact. We don’t know who has directed them but the details sought by I-T is based on the election affidavits filed with the election commission,” Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-didn-t-ask-cbdt-to-issue-notice-to-pawar/story-l7yWMF05nDVM3RXoiLnIsK.html
24-09-2020||India||The farm reforms are good but there are other problems as well | Opinion||Farm sector reforms such as amending the Essential Commodities Act, liberalising the provisions of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Acts and contract farming etc. have been debated for decades. After these reforms have been shaped into law, farmers are on the war path in several states to oppose them. Many opposition parties have come out in support of farmers and are demanding withdrawal of these steps.The agriculture produce market regulation scheme has had a long history. It all started in the British period with the Berar Cotton and Grain Market act of 1887 in the Hyderabad Residency. This law marked the beginning of the agriculture marketing scene in the country which got support of the Royal Commission on Agriculture 1928 that recommended establishment of regulated markets and establishment of market yards. Later, the Government of India prepared a model bill and circulated it to all the states in 1938 but nothing much happened before Independence.Once India gained freedom, most of the states during the sixties and seventies enacted the agriculture produce marketing laws. Over a period of time, several limitations and constraints of the present agricultural marketing system such as lack of sufficient markets and inadequate marketing infrastructure, high incidence of market fee/charges and lack of competition with a long chain of intermediaries became apparent. Accordingly, the Union agriculture ministry formulated a Model APMC Act/Rules on agricultural marketing in consultation with the state governments and circulated it to them for adoption in 2003 and 2007 respectively. Several States initiated steps to amend their APMC Acts/Rules, but there was variation in adoption of the contents and coverage of reforms to the APMC Acts/Rules across the States/UTs. Further, as per government of India documents, during discussions and consultations at various levels, there was a persistent demand for expediting reforms in agricultural marketing in order to facilitate private sector investment in this important area. To suggest measures to overcome the farm sector marketing issues, the UPA Government set up an empowered committee of state ministers in-charge of agricultural marketing on 2 March 2010 to persuade various States/UTs to implement the reforms in agriculture marketing through adoption of Model APMC Act and the Rules.The committee submitted its interim report in 2011 to the then Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and the final report in January 2013, recommending reforms in agriculture marketing to ensure barrier-free marketing of the produce by farmers and participation of private players along with promoting contract farming. The three farm bills are along the lines recommended by this committee of state ministers in-charge of agriculture marketing.Undoubtedly, nobody can oppose the idea that the farmers should have complete freedom to sell their produce to any one who offers them the highest price and they should not be compelled to sell their produce only in the designated mandi. Similarly, the “one nation one market” concept is an ideal, which needs to be pursued and implemented per se. The concept of contract farming is in vogue in cane-growing areas for decades so we have the experience to weigh the pros and cons of this initiative and ensure putting in place such a mechanism which can rule out any possibility of farmers being cheated or taken for a ride by private players. But the distinction between the agriculture produce market and all other product markets has to be kept in mind while carrying out market reforms. It is to be understood that the agri-produce marketing is different from the marketing of manufactured commodities because of the special characteristics like perishability of the products and seasonality of production since they cannot be produced throughout the year. In the harvest season, prices have to fall due to demand and supply mismatch unlike the supply of manufactured products whose production can be adjusted as per demand .With the varying supply, the demand remaining almost constant, the prices of agricultural products crash during the harvest season. This is where the support of the government through minimum support price becomes extremely crucial to prevent distress sale of farm produce. So any kind of market reform and opening up of markets to private players has to be accompanied by effective implementation and continuation of minimum support price scheme for all kinds of agri-products. Looking at the prevailing scenario, no government can dare withdraw the MSP scheme. Hence, farmers need not worry on this count. The PM has also made it clear that the MSP scheme will continue.But these legislations are not going to solve all other problems ailing the farm sector. The government has to take steps to urgently fix the problem of supply of uncertified and poor quality seeds, overuse of chemical fertilizers, corruption in fertilizer subsidy regime, dwindling irrigation potential across the country, lack of proper extension services, wide spread corruption in food crop procurement and storage operations, lack of cold chain facilities, shortages in storage capacity, lack of agro-based industries and fixing of remunerative procurement prices etc. Since nearly 60% of our population is dependent on agriculture, the time has come to turn the nation’s focus towards them. No empty promises but sincere actions are the need of the hour.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

24-09-2020||India||YSRC urges SC to take cognisance of allegations against HC judges in Amaravati land scam||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday questioned the silence of the Supreme Court of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the allegations against certain judges of the state high court with regard to land dealings in Amaravati. Briefing the media on the two-day tour of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in New Delhi, YSRC Rajya Sabha member Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose said as many as 13 judges of the high court had accepted housing plots from the previous Telugu Desam Party government in 2019. Describing it as unethical on the part of judges, the YSRC MP said the Supreme Court should have taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and ordered an investigation into it. He reminded that when there were certain allegations against former President of India VV Giri, the Supreme Court had called him for questioning. “When the SC could question the President of India who appoints the judges, why can’t it act on the allegations against the state high court judges?” Bose asked. “Apart from Supreme Court, the Prime Minister also has the responsibility to order an inquiry into the allegations against the judiciary. We don’t know why they are silent when the image of the judiciary is being damaged because of some judges,” he said. Stating that it was time for the intellectuals of the country to speak out on the allegations of corruption in the judiciary, the YSRC leader said law could not be different for the police, politicians, common man and judges. “Just because they are judges, they cannot get away without being questioned when there are allegations against them. Our intention is not to denigrate the sanctity of judiciary or question the integrity of judges. If the allegations are proved wrong, it only enhances the prestige of the judiciary,” the MP said. On Jagan’s two-day visit to Delhi, the YSRC leader said the chief minister had requested the Union home minister to see that the Centre releases the funds to compensate for the revenue deficit of the state. “Out of Rs 14,000 crore due to be given to the state towards revenue deficit for 2014-15, the Centre released only Rs 5,000 crore so far,” he said. The chief minister had met Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekawat and requested that the department release Rs 4,000 crore due to be released to the state towards the Polavaram major irrigation project. “The Centre has accepted the revised estimates for the Polavaram project. The chief minister requested that the funds be released as per the revised accounts to complete the project at the earliest,” another YSRC MP Mopidevi Venkataramana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrc-urges-sc-to-take-cognisance-of-allegations-against-hc-judges-in-amaravati-land-scam/story-gMMa8T3ToYnLT7IwIrF4BM.html
24-09-2020||India||BJP outshines ruling TMC in race for social media advertisement campaigns||With the crucial 2021 West Bengal assembly elections approaching and rallies of political parties restricted because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit are spending lakhs of rupees for advertisements on social media to improve their digital campaigns. The TMC has spent nearly two million on advertisements on Facebook in the last three months; not to be left behind; the Bengal BJP has caught up and in the last one month has spent more than its main rival. Facebook’s advertisement library report reveals that between June 24 and September 21, the TMC has spent Rs 1.81 million on 93 advertisements on social media while the BJP has spent around Rs 1.22 million on 52 advertisements. But if one considers the data of last one month (August 23 – September 21), then the BJP has surpassed the TMC with such spending. While the BJP has spent 1.04 million on 26 ads during the last 30 days, the TMC has spent around 3.35 lakhs on 42 ads. This means 85% of what the BJP spent on social media advertisement had come in the last one month. “The BJP at the Centre is gradually selling out all assets of the country and hence has loads of money with which they can give such advertisements. Their advertisements will increase as they need to spread lies. The Mamata Banerjee-led government has done a lot of work. Our work speaks for us. People have seen the BJP and what harm it can do,” said Tapas Roy minister of state for parliamentary affairs and a spokesperson of the ruling TMC. While there was a ban on political gathering during the lockdown, the Union home ministry had on August 29 allowed political functions with a ceiling of 100 people from September 21. The Bengal BJP unit’s page, however, has been liked by more than 1.5 million compared to 9.4 lakh likes received by the TMC’s page. “During the pandemic when other modes of political campaigns have been restricted, social media has become a vital means to connect with the people. Most of the advertisements of the BJP relates to outreach programs. The BJP is doing whatever it takes to reach out to the masses,” said Jai Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president. While the TMC and the BJP are gearing up for the polls next year with their social media advertisement campaigns the other parties in the state including the Congress seem to be left behind in the race. “It is true that social networking sites have now become important to reach out to the people. But it involves huge costs and we don’t have enough funds as of now. The last time we spent on social media advertisements was during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. May be we can do the same during the upcoming assembly polls,” said Amitabha Chakraborty, spokesperson of the Congress unit West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-outshines-ruling-tmc-in-race-for-social-media-advertisement-campaigns/story-eTYgfAscNR3BQ7E2aj4ycO.html
24-09-2020||India||Plans afoot to set up megalabs in four states to strengthen surveillance||The Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi has been working with four states to set up “megalabs” that can sequence up to 3,000 viral genomes of the Sars-CoV-2 that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The states, which are expected to make separate announcements to the effect, weren’t named.Not only will genome sequencing be more accurate than the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at detecting infection in clinical samples, but the data will also be used for routine surveillance of the virus and where it originates to help the government in devising more effective strategies to control its spread. RT-PCR is now considered the gold standard for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. “The megalabs will automate genome sequencing, allowing us to process a large number of samples – a couple of thousand – a day. This is being permanently used for routine surveillance in Kerala and has been able to give us very useful information. As we will be sequencing the complete genome, the results of the test will be more accurate than the RT-PCR test, which looks for certain identifying parts of the genome to say whether a person has the virus or not. It will also be immune to any mutation by the virus,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director of the IGIB. The entire sequencing process will not cost more than Rs 2,000 per sample and can be easily implemented by state governments, Dr. Agarwal said. In comparison, a patient pays Rs 2,400 for an RT-PCR test at a private laboratory in Delhi. Kerala, where the machine used in the megalabs was first field-tested in August, is one of the four states that would be using genetic sequencing data for routine surveillance of Covid-19 cases. The state has already benefitted from genetic sequencing data from IGIB for one of is projects. An analysis of 200 samples from the state revealed that most of the infections in the state were brought in by domestic inter-state travellers rather than international ones, according to the researchers. “Analysis of the genetic sequencing data collected by our clinical partner from three districts in northern Kerala shows that most of the infections in the state were brought in by domestic travellers, with three distinct clusters from infections imported from Odisha, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. This also validates the quarantine norms that the state followed with foreign travellers, preventing the importation of the disease from other countries,” said Dr Sridhar Sivasubbu, head of business development at IGIB and a member of the Indian CoV2 Genomic and Genetic Epidemiology consortium. He added, “The Kerala government has now committed to continuing the study in all 14 districts as part of regular surveillance using the megalab. We are working with three other states to set up similar labs. The constant surveillance will tell the government of the origin of clusters of infections, helping them in developing strategies to prevent it at the source.” The researchers found that 94.6% of the genomes sequenced in Kerala spread locally after three distinct introductions – the K1 group where a traveller from Maharashtra introduced it in mid-July; K2 from Odisha, introduced in the first week of March; and K3 from Karnataka, introduced in the beginning of April. The researchers also found a variation in the S-gene — which encodes the defining spike protein the virus uses to enter human cells — associated with the higher infectivity of the virus. There were also five variants in areas of the genetic sequence that are used as probes for the RT-PCR test, which might result in reduced efficacy of the tests, according to the research paper that is currently on the pre-print server BioRxiv. The routine surveillance using genetic sequencing of the virus will also help in detecting cases of re-infection. IGIB is the first institute in the country to have confirmed eight cases of re-infection – two in Noida, two in Delhi, and four in Mumbai. “The cases of re-infection were detected in health-care workers through routine surveillance that allowed us to sequence genomes of the viruses during both the infections,” said Dr Sivasubbu. Dr Agarwal said: “We used to think re-infections were very rare, but we are seeing a few cases now. We were able to establish re-infection in at least eight cases where samples from both the infections were available, we could ensure that there was sufficient genetic differences in both the viruses, and where we were clearly able to show that neither of the samples were positive due to possible contamination. This makes us think that re-infection is not very rare {as thought earlier} but very uncommon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plans-afoot-to-set-up-megalabs-in-four-states-to-strengthen-surveillance/story-jAY7kVgamJ65nhCO0ekzBI.html
24-09-2020||India||G4 nations call for ‘urgent’ UN reforms||The G4 countries – Brazil, India, Japan and Germany – on Wednesday expressed disappointment at attempts to derail reforms of the United Nations and called for text-based negotiations within a fixed timeframe to revamp the world body. The foreign ministers of the four countries, during a virtual meeting during the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, highlighted the urgency of reforming the world body and updating its main decision-making bodies to better reflect contemporary realities. The move is in line with India’s position on the reforms of the UN, including expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council, its main decision-making organ. The foreign ministers – Brazil’s Ernesto Araújo, India’s S Jaishankar, Japan’s Motegi Toshimitsu and Germany’s minister of state in the federal foreign office, Niels Annen, who represented foreign minister Heiko Maas, said the declaration adopted by all heads of state and government on the 75th anniversary of the UN reaffirmed the “common resolve to finally take decisive steps towards the early and comprehensive reform of the Security Council”. Jaishankar tweeted that the G4 ministers had “called for a decisive push for UNSC reforms during #UN75”. He said there was a “unanimous call for text-based negotiations in a fixed timeframe” and India’s approach to the UN is guided by reformed multilateralism. In a joint statement, the G4 ministers noted that the declaration said the “world of today is very different from what it was when the United Nations was created 75 years ago. There are more countries, more people, more challenges but also more solutions. Our working methods need to keep pace and adapt.” “In keeping with this call, G4 ministers highlighted the urgency of reforming the United Nations and updating its main decision-making bodies, in order to better reflect contemporary realities,” the joint statement said. The ministers also “expressed disappointment at attempts to derail this process and committed to addressing the issue in a meaningful way and with increased urgency at this 75th anniversary of the UN”. They also said the expansion of the Security Council in both categories “will be indispensable to make this body more representative, legitimate and effective, enhancing therefore its capacity to deal with the complex challenges the world faces today on questions of international peace and security”. The ministers insisted that only the reform of the Security Council will stop the body “from becoming obsolete”. Broader membership of the Security Council, “with increased and enhanced representation of countries with the capacity and willingness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, including from Africa, will allow it to preserve its credibility and create the political backing needed for the peaceful resolution of today’s international crises”, the joint statement said. The G4 countries have backed each other’s candidature for permanent membership of an expanded Security Council. Except for China, all the other P5 countries – the US, the UK, France and Russia – have also offered unstinted support for India’s membership of the Security Council. The G4 ministers also expressed concern at the lack of “any meaningful movement forward in the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on Security Council reform and expressed their concern that – after two sessions in February and March – the IGN was adjourned due to Covid-19 and no further meetings were held”. They said these negotiations lack the “necessary openness and transparency” and are constrained by flawed working methods. They further said they were convinced the “time has come to leave behind debates based solely on general statements, without substantive text based negotiations actually taking place in an intergovernmental setting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g4-nations-call-for-urgent-un-reforms/story-lNRt27eBxyHPdVe8rPQJGM.html

24-09-2020||India||Kerala records highest single-day spike with 5,376 new Coivd-19 cases||With 5,376 new coronavirus cases, Kerala has recorded the highest single-day spike on Wednesday even as the government eased quarantine norms to avoid crowding in hospitals, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.“The situation is really serious. For the first time, fresh Coivd-19 cases have crossed the 5,000-mark. Most of the patients are asymptomatic and we have asked them to remain in quarantine in their homes. This will help them in getting required psychological support and avoid overcrowding in hospitals,” said the CM. The CM has blamed the ongoing opposition agitation seeking the resignation of minister KT Jaleel for the spike in the number of cases. “Despite our request there is no end to the so-called protest. Their overcrowding won’t serve any purpose and it will only help increase cases,” he said. Opposition parties are on a state-wide agitation seeking the resignation of the state higher education minister KT Jaleel who was questioned twice by customs and the National Investigation Agency in connection with the gold smuggling case. State capital Thiruvananthapuram continues to bear the brunt with 852 new Covid-19 cases. The district reported around 20 per cent of the total cases and 32% of deaths.

24-09-2020||India||Varanasi’s Shivangi Singh to be first woman to fly Rafale||Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh is set to become India’s first woman fighter pilot to fly the Rafale aircraft that was formally inducted into the Indian Air Force on September 10, officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Singh, who hails from Varanasi, is currently being trained to fly IAF’s newest fighter based in Ambala. She is undergoing conversion training to fly the Rafale jet and will soon join the Ambala-based No. 17 squadron, also known as “Golden Arrows.” The officer, who is one of IAF’s 10 women fighter pilots, joined the air force in 2017. After joining IAF, she has been flying the MiG-21 Bison aircraft and was till recently serving at a fighter base in Rajasthan, the officials added on condition of anonymity. Ten women have been commissioned as fighter pilots after the experimental scheme for their induction into IAF’s combat stream was introduced in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history. IAF is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert, amid heightened border tensions with China. IAF’s current fleet of five Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission, officials said.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. The air force formally inducted the planes at the Ambala air base on September 10 though they landed at their home base on July 29. The next batch of three to four Rafale jets is expected to reach Ambala from France in October followed by a third batch in December. All deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021. The head count of women in the military adds up to more than 4,000, but combat roles were off limits to them until IAF took the lead in crushing internal resistance to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. Warships are no longer a no-go zone for women naval aviators with two of them set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels, the navy announced on Monday. Sub Lieutenants Kumudini Tyagi and Riti Singh have been selected for the helicopter stream.“The struggle of two decades has culminated into this storm! In the past three years so much has progressed and now we are seeing yet another door opening .Absolutely delighted that the air force has not dithered and true to its grain has handed over the newest machine to Shivangi. Go girl ....Touch the sky with glory,” said Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), from the first batch of women officers commissioned in the IAF in early1990s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officer-from-varanasi-set-to-be-first-woman-pilot-to-fly-rafale/story-R11imch73m8hpxQUCdsiQP.html
24-09-2020||India||Half of govt school toilets built by CPSEs lack basic amenities: CAG||At least half the government school toilets built by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) under a scheme launched by the education ministry do not have even the basic hand-washing facility, an even greater necessity in COVID-19 affected times, a survey of over 2000 schools by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found.Lack of running water, poor maintenance and unavailability of separate toilets for girls continue to be the bane of Indian school goers, according to the CAG report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.The report mentions that the HRD ministry (now named the Education ministry) had, under the Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan (SVA) sought the help of CPSEs for construction of toilets in government schools.As many as 53 CPSEs participated and constructed 1,40,997 toilets.Seven CPSEs , National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Coal India Limited  constructed 1,30,703 toilets in total, at a cost of ₹2,162.60 crore. CAG examined the construction of toilets by these seven by surveying 2,695 toilets across 2048 schools in 15 States.According to the findings, the CPSEs did not construct 83 toilets though these toilets were identified by them for construction. Of the remaining 2,612 toilets which were reported to have been constructed, 200 toilets were not found constructed in the respective schools and 86 toilets were only partially built.“The non-existing and partially constructed toilets constituted 11 % of toilets surveyed,” CAG’s report pointed out.Of the 1,967 co-educational schools, 99 schools had no functional toilets while 436 schools had only one functional toilet. The aim of providing separate toilets for boys and girls was not fulfilled in 535 schools, a sizeable 27 % of the sample.Out of 2,326 constructed toilets surveyed, 691 or 30 % were found not in use mainly due to lack of running water, lack of cleaning arrangements, damages or other reasons such as the toilets being used for other purposes.During the survey, 1,679 (72 %) out of 2,326 constructed toilets were found without running water.Further, hand washing facility was not available in 1,279 (55 per cent) out of 2,326 constructed toilets, according to the report. The audit also found that 75% of selected toilets were not maintained hygienically.  CAG recommended the concerned ministries to look into the issue of non-existing and incomplete toilets that were claimed as constructed. It also asked the Navratanas and the ministries to address absence of basic amenities in the toilets . Since the survey covered 2% of total toilets, the CPSEs are advised to review the remaining 98% and take appropriate action, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/half-of-govt-school-toilets-built-by-cpses-lack-basic-amenities-cag/story-VrjIuNNcEo9Rzod6nzsYqL.html
24-09-2020||India||CAG pulls up Railways for ‘dressing up’ finances||The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has pulled up Indian Railways for “window dressing” its finances to present its operating ratio and working expenses in a better light during the financial year 2018-19 by including advance freight payments in its calculations.The operating ratio measures expenditure as a proportion of revenue or the amount spent on every 100 rupees earned by the state-owned transporter. A higher ratio indicates poorer ability to generate a surplus.In December last year, the government auditor said Indian Railways recorded its worst operating ratio in 10 years at 98.44% and its revenue surplus decreased by more than 66% to ₹1,665.61 crore in 2017-18 from ₹4,913 crore in 2016-17 .Against the target of 92.8% in the Budget Estimates, the operating ratio of Indian Railways was 97.29% in 2018-19. This meant that railways spent ₹97.29 to earn ₹100, CAG noted in a report on railways presented in Parliament on Wednesday..“However, if advance freight of ₹8,351 crore from NTPC and CONCOR was not included in the earnings of 2018-19, OR would have been 101.77% instead of 97.29%. The Net Surplus in 2018-19 was ₹3,773.86 crore. IR would have ended with a negative balance of ₹7,334.85 crore but for receipt of advance freight and less appropriation to DRF and Pension Fund. Ministry of Railways (MoR) resorted to window dressing for presenting the working expenses and operating ratio in a better light,” the CAG report on the transporter’s finances noted.NTPC is the national thermal power producer and CONCOR stands for Container Corporation of India Limited. . DRF is short for Depreciation Reserve Fund.During 2018-19, Indian Railways generated total internal earnings of ₹1,90,507 crore against the targeted internal earnings of ` 2,01,090 crore, the report said.“The Railways could not achieve even revised estimate target of ₹1,97,214 crore. The total internal earnings also included freight advance of ₹8,351 crore received from NTPC and CONCOR for transportation of goods in 2019-20,” it added.The national auditor also raised concern over delays in projects over the past five years because of inefficiency and weak monitoring.“Projects were to be completed during 2015-20. However, due to inefficiency of Zonal Railways and weak monitoring at the Railway Board level, the progress of projects was slow,” the report said.CAG also raised doubts over railways’ utilisation of its extra budgetary resources (EBR) for financing project that started from 2015-16 onward. Scrutiny of records relating to 395 projects funded from EBR revealed that 268 projects were still in progress as of 31 March, 2019. This resulted in blocking of ₹48,536 crore of EBR funds besides defeating the intended objective of generation of revenue for debt servicing, CAG said.“Ministry of railways resorted to Extra Budgetary Resources for project financing from 2015-16 onwards. Financial assistance of ₹1.50 lakh crore was agreed to by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) over a period of five years (2015-20). Audit observed that the financing arrangement with LIC materialized partially due to regulatory constraints. During 2015-19, only ₹16,200 crore could be raised from LIC. MoR recouped the shortfall of ₹49,164 crore by raising funds through short-term/medium term market borrowings which carry higher rate of interest,” it said.The national auditor said there were instances of irregular utilization to the tune of ₹1,495 crore from EBR funds.HT reached out to the ministry of railways for a comment but received no response till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-pulls-up-rlys-for-dressing-up-finances/story-DKniJInIaBta6kDAtxqluK.html
24-09-2020||India||Understanding the new labour codes||Parliament on Wednesday passed the three labour code bills – the Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020; the Industrial Relations Code, 2020; and the Code on Social Security, 2020 – merging 24 central labour laws in a major boost to labour reforms. The National Democratic Alliance government has now merged 29 central laws into four codes. In August 2019, Parliament had passed the first of the codes, the Wage Code. The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, bring new rules for hiring and firing of labour in mid-sized and large industries, making retrenchment easier. This effectively brings the “north American hire-and-fire model to the Indian hinterland economy in the hope that businesses recoup and add more jobs on a net basis,” said labour economist KR Shyam of XLRI, Jamshedpur. How will the three codes impact workers? The reforms allow industries flexibility in hiring and retrenchment. They will make industrial strikes more difficult by clamping new conditions and also expand the social security net for both formal and informal workers. What are the changes in hiring-firing rules? Under the Industrial Relation Code, the government has allowed companies with up to 300 workers to fire workers or shut plants without the prior approval of the government. Hitherto, prior approval had been required. Firms with more than 300 workers need to still apply for approval. However, if the authorities do not respond to their request, the retrenchment proposal will be deemed to be approved. Earlier labour laws required a 30- to 90-day notice period before retrenching “workmen”, which is a class of mainly shop floor workers. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations, and mines with 100 or more workmen, lay-offs also required government approval. To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes. What’s the economic rationale for this? Economists have long argued that India’s outdated labour laws need change. Stringent hiring-firing rules applied to firms with over 100 employees, making it virtually impossible to lay off workers. This adversely acted as an incentive for smaller firms to stay small so they could escape the rules. According to the World Bank, with less restrictive laws, India could approximately add on an annual basis “2.8 million more good quality formal sector jobs”. How does it affect workers’ right to strike? The Industrial Relation Code lays down new conditions on the right of workers to go on strike. Unions will now have to give 60 days’ strike notice. If proceedings are pending before a labour tribunal or the National Industrial Tribunal, workers cannot go on a strike for 60 days after they are concluded. These conditions apply to all industries. Earlier, workers could go on strike by giving between two weeks and six weeks of notice. Flash strikes are now outlawed. What are the new workplace safety rules? The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, amends laws regulating occupational safety, health and working conditions of employees. The code empowers a state government to exempt any new factory from the provisions of the Code to create more economic activity and jobs. It fixes the maximum daily work limit at eight hours a day. Women will be entitled to be employed in all establishments for all types of work and in case they are required to work in hazardous or dangerous operations, the government may require the employer to have adequate safeguards in place prior to employment. Has the social safety net widened? Yes. The Code on Social Security, 2020 promises universal social security for the first time, including for both organised and informal workers as well as gig and platform workers. The government, the code states, shall formulate and notify, from time to time, suitable welfare schemes, including schemes relating to “provident fund; employment injury benefit; housing; educational schemes for children; skill upgradation of workers; funeral assistance; and old age homes”. The government can tap corporate social responsibility funds (within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2013) or any other such source as may be specified in the scheme. The social security code lays down the setting up of a National Social Security Board to recommend to the central government suitable schemes for unorganised workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-the-new-labour-codes/story-llI015EZK8EYtDHmP9SXVP.html
24-09-2020||India||supreme court issues notices over fb summons||The Delhi state assembly told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that it had summoned Facebook India’s vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan only as a witness to hear his suggestions on devising a system to prevent misuse of the social media company in the backdrop of the misuse of the platform during the communal riots that flared in the city in February.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the legislature, said Mohan had not been summoned as an accused and no coercive action had been intended against the company or its officials.“He was called as a witness, not as an accused. No coercive steps were intended. It had come to light that Facebook was misused (in connection with the communal riots). So, we want to get suggestions from them and devise a mechanism so that Facebook is not misused,” Singhvi said.The apex court was hearing a petition filed by Facebook India and Mohan against notices issued by the Delhi assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee on September 10 and 18 asking Mohan to present himself before the panel on Wednesday in connection with the social media company’s failure to curb hate speech that may have played a role in fuelling the Delhi riots. Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said the notices issued to Mohan by the committee did not give an impression that no coercive action was intended against Facebook.Singhvi offered to file a counter-affidavit clarifying the stance of the Delhi assembly. He also said the meeting of the committee, scheduled for Wednesday, had been deferred and no further meeting with Facebook officials on this subject will be held for the time being because the apex is seized of the case.The court recorded Singhvi’s submissions, asked the Delhi Assembly to file its response within a week and posted the case for further hearing on October 15. This would mean that Facebook officials cannot be summoned by the Delhi assembly until then.The Peace and Harmony Committee, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “In view of the issues of law pending before the Supreme Court, today’s proceedings before the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s Committee on Peace & Harmony has been deferred. Further course of action and next date of sitting of committee will be notified in due course.”The committee chairman Raghav Chadha could not be reached despite several phone calls and texts. The Delhi government did not react. The committee is investigating Facebook’s alleged complicity in the Delhi riots after it received several complaints from the public pursuant to an article was published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.The WSJ report, titled Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics, had alluded to the role allegedly played by top Facebook officials, particularly its public policy head Ankhi Das, in the social media platform refraining from applying its hate-speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) although the entities had been internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence. Das, according to the reports, said Facebook’s business interests may be harmed if it against them.Mohan was first summoned by the committee on September 15 in connection with complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by Facebook in removing hate speech. The committee had earlier said that in its meeting of August 31, it had prima facie (at first sight) found Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead and over 400 injured.Facebook officials failed to appear for the September 15 meeting after which a second notice was issued on September 18 asking Mohan to appear before it on September 23 (Wednesday). Facebook India and Mohan approached the top court on Tuesday, challenging the notices. They contended that the subject matter under investigation by the Delhi assembly falls within the exclusive domain of the central government and a state legislative assembly cannot compel witnesses to appear and provide evidence on such subjects.It was also highlighted that regulation of intermediaries like Facebook falls within the Union list of the Constitution under the Entry “Communication” (Entry 31). Parliament, in exercise of that power, enacted the Information Technology Act, 2000 to regulate intermediaries. Any assessment of the veracity of allegations against Facebook as an intermediary is exclusively a Union government subject, it was submitted.The petitioners also argued that the summons violate the right of the petitioner to remain silent and right to privacy, which are fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The committee’s insistence on compelling Mohan to speak, and its categorical threat that his non-appearance would be a “breach of privilege of the committee and [to take] necessary action as deemed fit” gives rise to a clear and present danger to the fundamental rights and liberties of petitioners, Mohan claimed in his petition.Senior counsel Harish Salve, representing Mohan, submitted that right to free speech under Article 19 of the Constitution includes the right to remain silent.“I am not affecting the working of your committee. As a house, you may do whatever you want to do. But you cannot compel me to appear and give my views. I am not a public servant. I work for an American company. The matter involves serious issues with political overtones. I do not want to get into the middle of all this,” Salve said on behalf of the Facebook executive.Facebook India, through senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, submitted that a private party cannot be forced to appear before the assembly or parliament.“Can a private person be asked to go before the Parliament and answer questions even if he does not want to do so? Can he be penalized if he does not appear?” Rohatgi asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notices-over-fb-summons/story-LUW60hDgr08nB8u2xA1ULK.html

24-09-2020||Today's||The Taste with Vir | Supreme Court vs Sudarshan TV: Free speech isn’t setting fire to a communally complex nation||When the Supreme Court first stopped the telecast of a Sudarshan TV programme which purported to show how Muslims were “infiltrating” government services, various people who might loosely be termed supporters of the government took to social media to express support for Sudarshan TV on grounds of freedom of speech. Significantly, the government itself said nothing. When the Supreme Court complained about offensive content on news TV in general, the government did not attempt to deny that such content existed. Instead it pushed the court to look at social media instead where the content was even more offensive. Now, the government has finally taken a stand. In what may be a disappointment to those of its supporters who were sympathetic to Sudarshan TV’s case, the government went to the Supreme Court on Wednesday (23 September) and said what should have been obvious to anyone who is familiar with the law. The 1994 Cable TV Act, which is the basis of much of the regulation of TV, clearly states that no programme can be carried which “contains attacks on religions or communities or visuals or words that are contemptuous of religious groups or which promote communal attitudes.” You can disagree with the law. But there it is. You cannot vilify Muslims under the law, no matter what your views on free speech are. The government eventually followed the law. It told the Court that it had sent a show cause notice to Sudarshan TV “giving detailed facts” on how the contents of the show were “against the programme code.” So if the Supreme Court and the government both agree that the programme went against lawful standards of controlling expressions of religious hatred, then there is not much more to be said, is there?ALSO READ | The Taste with Vir: In times when hate sells, how will News TV regulation work?Well, actually there is. The fact that this programme should have been scheduled, that the Supreme Court had to intervene to prevent its telecast and that the government took its time to come out against it, tells us something about the state of today’s India. As the Supreme Court pointed out, India does not have a First Amendment granting nearly absolute freedom to the media as the US does. There is a reason for this. India was born amidst Partition-linked communal bloodshed and when the framers of our Constitution sat down to write the laws, this could not have been forgotten. Around that period much of the country was a tinderbox so nobody wanted to grant absolute freedom of expression for fear that it might lead to incitement and a resurgence of communal violence.There are those, like me, who feel that the Congress regime which ruled India in the first decade after Independence, went too far in the other direction. In its endeavour to maintain peace and protect law and order, it lost sight of larger liberal principles and was much too willing to ban plays, books and movies on the grounds that they may cause offence to religious communities.This trend continued in the decades that followed.Obviously, the ban on the Satanic Verses was a mistake. But all too often we forget that the don’t-give-offence principle has been misused time and time again for the silliest reasons. The film of Jesus Christ Superstar was banned in India and some states agreed to even ban The Da Vinci Code. There is a crucial distinction here and it is one which we have lost sight of. If a Hindu, a Christian or a Muslim is offended by something I write about his religion, then it is fine to tell him not to read it. That’s simple enough.But there is a second category of speech. It is not about say, Hindus offending Christian or Muslims. It is about Hindus inciting other Hindus to hate Muslims. It is about Muslims encouraging other Muslims to resort to violence. It was the second category of speech that the framers of our Constitution should have focused on, given the bloody background of Partition. Sadly we have lost sight of that distinction. Turning Hindus against Muslims (or vice-versa) is hardly the same thing as offending people with a painting of Saraswati or with the content of The Satanic Verses. All too often we confuse giving offence (which should, in most circumstances, be fine) with inciting hatred.Full marks then to the Supreme Court for reminding us of that distinction. “You cannot target one community and brand them in a particular manner,” the Court said, terming the Sudarshan TV show an “attempt to vilify Muslims.” It added : “The anchor’s grievance is that a particular group is gaining entry into the civil services. How insidious is this? ….Such allegations without factual basis, how can they be allowed? Can such programmes be allowed in a free society?” Well, the government has finally answered those questions. It agrees that such programmes are against the law. Though God knows, it took its time making this clear. The fact that the Supreme Court and the government are finally united on this issue should set a precedent for the future. Let’s admit that many of the previous bans on books and restrictions on movies were silly and uncalled for. Let’s also concede that they distracted us from the real issue.That issue is the propagation of hatred and the incitement of communities against each other. Sudarshan TV is just one example. There are other channels and the other media --- including the press --- where it is treated as legitimate to spread hatred. Relations between communities are now at the most delicate stage they have been in several decades. If we are to stay peaceful and united as a nation, then we must call out the instigators and silence the hatred. Free speech, as the cliche goes, does not include the right to shout ‘fire’ in a crowded theatre. And it shouldn’t include the right to set fire to a communally complex nation.To read more on The Taste With Vir, click hereFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-supreme-court-vs-sudarshan-tv-free-speech-isn-t-setting-fire-to-a-communally-complex-nation/story-VUhEljey4WHU6fvRR9XCFL.html
24-09-2020||Today's||The Taste with Vir: In times when hate sells, how will News TV regulation work?||Now that the Supreme Court has echoed the sentiments of many sensible people and talked about its concern with the hatred that is spread every night on some TV channels, we are left with the big question: can anything be done about it? The Supreme Court was careful not to give any quick answers. It talked about appointing a committee of eminent people to go into the issue and to come up with some solutions. This was wise. The line between restricting hate speech and censoring the media is a thin one and we must be careful not to cross it.But fair regulation is possible. And it has been done within the Indian TV industry before.Ask me: I saw it done at the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC) in the five years that I was a member. The BCCC was founded in June 2011 as a way of ending the stranglehold of the I&B Ministry over television content. Before the BCCC was formed, a babu (or more rarely, the minister) could decide to take a channel off the air if the content displeased him. There was a legal basis to this: various restrictive laws governing cable TV and the like give the government enormous power.From 2009 onwards, the TV industry had been trying to persuade the ministry that this amounted to arbitrary censorship. Finally, in 2011, the TV industry and the ministry agreed to set up the BCCC which was composed of government representatives, people from the TV industry and four eminent persons from Civil Society. When the Council was founded, Bhaskar Ghose, Shabana Azmi, Professor Anand Kumar from JNU and I were the civil society representatives.We invited complaints from the public (the BCCC still runs a little scroll at the bottom of TV screens from time to time) about the content of entertainment channels. If the BCCC secretariat found the complaint to have any merit, we would call the complainant and the channel or sometimes, just the channel to our meeting. Having heard the channel’s defence, the whole Council, presided over by a former High Court judge, would decide if the complaint was valid.We were lucky to have had two outstanding judges as Chairmen in a row: Justice A P Shah and Justice Mukul Mudgal. They were liberal but fair and inherently opposed to needless censorship.At first I thought that the civil society members would have to act as a buffer between the industry members and the government representatives who would squabble all the time. But by the second meeting, I was surprised to see that we were all on the same side. Decisions were taken by consensus and often industry members were more strident than government appointees when it came to correcting lapses in content creation.The experience brought home a basic reality to me; one that we often forget. If you put a bunch of intelligent men and women together in a room and present them with the facts, the chances are that they will soon lose their biases, begin thinking objectively and usually come to the right conclusions.The Ministry had been obsessed with sex and nudity. We got around that quite easily by setting a watershed time in the evening, after which channels could show adult content. As we pointed out to the ministry, the internet was already here and the streaming services were soon expected to arrive. Could we really impose strict standards on broadcast TV, a genre which would soon be outflanked by the new technology? Instead we focused on the things that really mattered: incitement to hatred, stereotypical caricatures of women or of communities, caste bias, the sexualisation of young children on talent shows, the invasion of individual privacy (shows that used hidden cameras etc.) respect for women (a surprisingly large number of serials lingered for whole episodes on scenes where women were beaten, humiliated or sexually assaulted), etc.The system worked so well for the five years that I was on the council that by the end, we were getting more complaints from the ministry’s monitors than from anyone else. By and large, genuine viewer concerns had been allayed. To the credit of the government (and I was on the BCCC under both the Congress and the BJP governments), the Council’s views were respected and upheld.At around the same time that the BCCC was founded, a similar body was also created for news television. I was never a part of this body and we did not worry too much about it because the news universe was very small compared to what we covered (everything else on TV from entertainment to music to sport to lifestyle). I gathered then, purely anecdotally, that the news body was not as active as the BCCC and certainly I don’t think I ever heard of a single major decision involving the news regulator.I guess that it is a tribute to how well the BCCC functioned (the council continues to thrive though I am no longer a part of it) that there are now hardly any controversies about the content of entertainment channels all over India. Sadly this is not true of the news sector where, as we have seen, even the Supreme Court has expressed concern about the quality of the content. The obvious conclusion is that self-regulation on the BCCC pattern has failed.This leads us into an area where no journalist can be comfortable: external regulation. In essence, it is a step back because the whole point of appointing BCCC type bodies was to arms-length the process away from governments and their political interests.My fear is that even external regulation will either fail or will even be designed to fail. Any regulator can only be set up by the government. And the truth is that the government of the day does not seem as concerned about the content of news channels as the Court is.In fact, many of the channels that draw the most flack for their content are actually pro-government. And all governments know that TV is a weapon of mass distraction: it creates bogus controversies to divert attention whenever there is a serious national crisis. (You might want to turn on your TV set tonight to see what I am talking about.)So who will do the regulation?The only way it will ever work is if regulation is arms-lengthed from the government. If the regulators are drawn from outside of politics and if the regulatory body is given teeth to force the channels to listen, then it could make a difference.But can the Supreme Court set up such a body? Doesn’t it fall to the government to institute a regulator? And does anybody believe that this government will regulate its greatest supporters?So, as much as I admire the spirit of the Supreme Court’s remarks, it is worth keeping in mind that a solution will not be easy to find.That is the problem the Court will face when it sits to find a way out of the present situation. Hate sells and when it benefits the powerful it is almost impossible to fight.To read more on The Taste With Vir, click hereFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-times-when-hate-sells-how-will-news-tv-regulation-work/story-FJuvIRMf3tnkVHF83Zk9uM.html
24-09-2020||Editorials||The impact of air pollution on Covid-19 | HT Editorial||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday wrote to Punjab and Haryana governments, asking them to control cases of crop stubble burning, after early instances were spotted on satellite data of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The early warning to the two states is important because every winter, the air pollution level increases to dangerous levels due to stubble burning, vehicular pollution, lack of proper systems of garbage burning and disposing of construction and demolition waste. This year, however, controlling air pollution is not just critical for civic, political and health reasons. A study published by Havard University on air pollution and Covid-19 deaths in the United States found that even a minor increase in PM2.5 particles can lead to an increase in Covid-19 death rates. Another study reported in Physics of Fluids said wind speed is another critical factor when it comes to the spread of the disease. While none of these studies were done in India, experts here also feel that there is a good chance that increased suspended particulate matters and rising wind speed could transport the virus faster and wider. The Centre and states, which are grappling with a rising number of cases, must take these warnings seriously, implement anti-pollution protocols strictly, increase testing and strengthen the health care system for a potential surge in the number of cases during the winter months, especially in the northern plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-impact-of-air-pollution-on-covid-19/story-MKDtT7P0IAFFPFZnXraJqL.html
