But times are unprecedented, thanks to Covid-19.Like last year, Nepal, the current chair of Saarc, plans to host a meeting (virtual) of the Saarc council of ministers during the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly in the third week of September. Is there anything that these ministers can meaningfully do through Saarc to help reduce economic hardship and, through some quick wins, create hope for greater stability in the region?Despite its limitations, Saarc – if used effectively by Nepal and the council of ministers – may be able to add some value in the current turmoil, and, in the process, enhance its credibility and effectiveness.Perhaps Saarc’s most-important role right now would be to provide a platform for dialogue. South Asia is fraught with a trust deficit that runs across many bilateral relationships. Even convening can be treated with suspicion. When India convened a meeting of South Asian trade officials in April, Pakistan did not participate. On the other hand, when SAARC was involved in the convening, as in the leaders’ dialogue (proposed by India) in March, all countries took part. They were possibly more at ease than if India had convened. Similarly, when Pakistan took the initiative and organised a Saarc-convened meeting of health ministers, all members participated. So, the first order of business is for member states to use Saarc to convene an inclusive dialogue, because the dialogue is the starting point for any collaboration. The low share of intra-regional trade and investment in South Asia penalises its workers, consumers, and exporters. This piece suggests four specific areas where Nepal’s initiatives through Saarc can address the larger issues at stake. All four can be tabled and pursued simultaneously. And whether or not Saarc can nudge things along, the issues will remain, and failure to resolve them will reduce the economic opportunities for the people of South Asia.Direct trade between India and Pakistan has slowed to a trickle since India imposed 200% duties on imports from Pakistan in February 2019 (after the Pulwama attack), and Pakistan banned trade with India in August 2019 (after the passage of the J&K Reorganisation Bill). This has exacted a severe toll on the thousands of families dependent on bilateral trade, as documented by Afaq Husain and Nikita Singla of BRIEF. Through Saarc, if Nepal can bring all countries to the dialogue table to discuss trade, India and Pakistan might be willing to consider face-saving trade resumption on pre-2019 terms. Such face-saving could take the form of resuming trade subject to an annual certification by both sides to the effect that the other party has not taken actions prejudicial to its neighbour’s interest (the exact terminology and content can be decided between India and Pakistan). This is reminiscent of the United States’ annual renewal of “Most Favoured Nation” status (same terms as any other trading partner) to China, throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The resumption of trade between South Asia’s two largest economies will not only help the traders, porters, truckers and other stakeholders on the border, it will also impart some much-needed motivation to the rest of South Asia, which often feels weighed down by the acrimony between India and Pakistan.Afghanistan has long demanded that Pakistan allow it to import Indian goods via the Wagah-Attari border. Its trucks can currently transit across Pakistan and export to India via the Wagah border, as part of the Afghanistan Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement. But these trucks cannot bring back Indian imports and have to return empty to Afghanistan. In the spirit of a Covid détente, could Pakistan be persuaded to allow these Afghan trucks to take back Indian goods? To address its domestic constituencies, Pakistan could insist that the import load be no more than the export load, at least to begin with and review the experience after a few months. Still, it will nonetheless earn enormous goodwill from India and, especially, Afghanistan. Nepal could offer to appoint a neutral mediator via Saarc to resolve contentious issues. As in the earlier case, a solution here would have positive ramifications for the countries involved and Saarc’s self-confidence, achievements that would go beyond the bilateral Afghanistan-Pakistan trade relationship. E-commerce is a fruitful avenue to explore, given the Covid-19 induced increase in digitisation. A World Bank report (Unleashing E-Commerce for South Asian Integration) suggested ways of building on the informal intra-regional e-commerce that already exists. A practical and incremental approach is best suited to address the multiple hurdles. Issues include the lack of consumer access in some countries to foreign exchange for cross-border payments, and the absence of a predictable tariff regime for small value shipments, say up to a value of $100. Nepal can suggest that Saarc be used as a forum for countries to thrash out the core issues between themselves; the World Bank report’s suggestions can be a starting point. The goal would be to kick-start an e-commerce counterpart to the South Asian Free Trade Area, with preferences to products with an explicit local value-added content. The onus on certifying value-added should be placed on the e-commerce platforms. Should such digitally-enabled trade take off, it could help micro and small enterprises, among others, to access cross-border markets and thus gain a vital additional source of demand. To minimise Covid-19 induced disruption to trade, many countries have advanced on digitally-enabled trade simplification — a simple example is acceptance of electronic rules of origin certificates. Nepal can table some suggestions and perhaps help broker some agreed principles for trade clearances and simplification, many of which are already being implemented by individual countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. A recent paper by Prabir De for ESCAP has outlined some useful measures for digitising trade processes.South Asia will always exist as a geographical entity. If it is collaborative, workers, consumers, and exporters in the region will benefit, irrespective of advances in other regional groupings. There is an existing institution - Saarc- that is mandated to facilitate regional cooperation. Making Saarc more effective will be a win for everyone, especially the people of South Asia. There are some significant trade issues that, if even partially addressed, can help Saarc become more credible and effective. Is it wishful thinking? Perhaps. But times are not normal. That expands the boundary of the possible.Sanjay Kathuria is senior visiting fellow, Centre for Policy Research, and former lead economist, World BankThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-to-make-saarc-useful-in-the-times-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-Ai7uyBpSA7lyjxyXgW1S8O.html

The protesters pelted stones, leaving some GLADA officials injured and damaging a tractor. Following this, police pacified the residents.BJP leaders including Jatinder Goryan and Dharmendra Sharma also protested against the drive and sought an FIR against the GLADA officials for hurting religious sentiments. Police detained the BJP leaders.BJP leader Kantandu Sharma said that the idols kept inside the temple were demolished as no time was given to vacate the premises. He added that GLADA initiated the drive amid pandemic when residents are struggling to put food on the table and have now been left homeless.The district BJP unit, led by president Pushpinder Singal, also staged a protest at Moti Nagar police station seeking FIR against the GLADA officials under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli¬gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli-gious beliefs). The protest was ongoing at the time this report was filed.Station house officer of Moti Nagar police station, Simranjit Kaur, said,”No FIR has yet been registered in the case yet and action will be taken after investigating the case properly.”GLADA officials said the temple building was illegal as it was established on government land and the drive was conducted in presence of a magistrate and heavy police force.As per sources, GLADA had conducted an anti-encroachment drive in the area around eight months back, but few were left behind as the occupants had said they would take them down themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anti-encroachment-drive-in-ludhiana-residents-protest-after-glada-razes-temple/story-qBCjMbMB7pbVfe8pUhY4cL.html

However, in the next meeting on August 21, the government decided to set up these cells in each of the 15 police districts of Delhi. The status report was filed in response to a habeas corpus plea by an NGO and a man who claimed that the woman he wanted to marry was being confined against her will by her parents, who were opposed to the union over caste differences.The plea also claimed that the Supreme Court had directed the setting up of special cells to deal with problems faced by intercaste wedded couples and to ensure their protection, but this has not been complied with. The Supreme Court had also directed that the cells be headed by district superintendents of police, the document read. During the earlier hearing, the court had told the Delhi government that if no special cell has been constituted, then they should be set up before August 11 and the man’s complaint must be registered by the special cell and due action taken. Subsequently, on August 11, the Delhi government told the bench that appropriate steps were being taken to comply with the apex court directions.The status report said while initially it was decided that the social welfare department would create and manage a helpline meant solely for couples of intercaste marriages, later it was decided that the Delhi Commission for Women would help such couples through their existing helpline -- 181 -- meant for women safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/have-set-up-15-special-cells-safe-house-to-help-intercaste-married-couples-govt-tells-hc/story-6DhCzDVJHunf9FIvSSvzoO.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||Onion export ban: Political parties, farmers organisations in Maharashtra oppose move||The Centre’s decision to ban the export of onions has turned controversial in Maharashtra as many political parties, as well as farmers organisations, have opposed the move.State Congress unit staged a statewide protest against the ban while senior NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has criticised the Centre’s decision as “anti-farmer”. A delegation of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government headed by the NCP chief Sharad Pawar is also going to Delhi to request the Centre to withdraw its decision. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also decided to write a letter to the Centre demanding them to take back the decision.Even, the state BJP unit, opposition in the state, has urged the Centre to reverse it back. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has written a letter to the Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal requesting him to withdraw the decision immediately.On Monday, the Central government issued a notification and prohibited the export of onions. It has clarified that the decision was taken to control the rising prices of the commodity. The move doesn’t go well within the agrarian community especially in Maharashtra.On Wednesday, Congress leaders staged protests across districts and expressed their resentment. Party workers gathered at district headquarters to register their opposition. State Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat termed the move as “injustice to the farmers”. “The decision is an injustice to the farmers. We want the Centre to reverse it immediately and hence decided to mark our protest across the state,” he said.Ajit Pawar said, “The move is no less than enormity with the farmers as they were already in trouble due to Covid-19 pandemic and this will add to their miseries.”The issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said that the decision has led to a sharp decline in onion prices in markets that will cost huge losses to the farmers. “We have decided that a delegation headed by the NCP chief will meet the concerned central ministers and urge them to withdraw the notification,” the agriculture minister said after the cabinet meeting.Fadnavis in his letter states, “The onions produced in Maharashtra have good demand in the international market which helps them to get proper remuneration against the produce. They are hurt and unhappy with the decision. I request you reconsider it.”On Tuesday, Pawar had opposed the move and met Goyal in this regard. He has said that the ban on the export of onions would immensely benefit the exporters from Pakistan. The sudden decision is a major blow to India’s image as a reliable exporter of onions in the international market, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/onion-export-ban-political-parties-farmers-organisations-in-maharashtra-oppose-move/story-1JgQVNfTdts6fm153Ou00O.html

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||2 govt primary schools in Ludhiana to be made fully air-conditioned||Two government primary schools in the district, GPS Nathowal and GPS Janatpura, will be made centrally air-conditioned to retain new students shifted from private schools.Government primary school, Janatpura, currently has a strength of 56 students compared to 30 in the last academic session. This year, 10 students from private schools have shifted to the school. The school building is under construction and NRI Jagir Singh has donated funds for the construction of the new classrooms. Inderjit Sidhu, an ETT teacher, said, “The youth welfare club, Janatpura, has decided to provide funds to the school to make it fully air-conditioned. Solar panels of five kilowatt will be installed which will generate more energy and save up to 5 lakh units of electricity annually.”At government primary school, Nathowal, 36 new students have enrolled and the strength has reached 106. The new building comprises five classrooms, office, staffroom, high tech library and kitchen. A mid-day meal hall is under construction and expected to be completed in the next few months. The Nathowal Welfare society, which is funded by NRIs, is contributing funds for the construction of the new building and will be providing Rs 25 lakh to make the school building fully air-conditioned. The society has decided to install solar panels which will help school authorities save on electricity bills.District education officer (elementary), Rajinder Kaur, said, “In the new academic session, the enrolment in primary schools have increased by 28.92%. More schools will be made air-conditioned in the future. Presently, both the schools are under construction, and by the next session, these facilities will be provided to the students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-govt-primary-schools-in-ludhiana-to-be-made-fully-air-conditioned/story-ihuCVpvd1knQinhvxpr6NO.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Environment minister assess bio-decomposer method as a solution to stubble burning||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday inspected the functioning of a ‘bio-decomposer’ developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, which will help convert crop stubble into manure. The bio-decomposer , if successfully tested, could turn out to be a viable solution for Delhi’s winter pollution problem, which is worsened by crop stubble burning from neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Rai said. Rai, who met with scientists of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to understand this method, said he will discuss the technique, which involves spraying the decomposer liquid on crop stubble, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to work out a plan for its implementation. Every year between October 15 and October 30, the national capital faces the threat of plummeting air quality as a result of thick smoke blowing in from neighbouring states, where farmers set fire to their fields to get rid of the crop stubble . “Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble, out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes, out of the 7 million tonnes of crop produce, was burnt,” Rai said, quoting data submitted by the state pollution control boards. Data shows that last year, stubble burning accounted for 44% of Delhi’s air pollution. Rai said the Delhi government will provide the bio-decomposer to farmers free of cost and will also hold meetings with the governments of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to reach out to farmers in their respective states to adopt this method. Rai said the Delhi government will also write to the Union environment ministry for coordination in implementing the bio-decomposer technique. “The cost of spraying the decomposer in fields will be borne by the Delhi government so that there is no financial burden on the farmers and an effective solution to the problem of stubble burning can be developed,” he said. The minister also said the Central government has devised a scheme, under which subsidy is provided to farmers for using machines to clear crop stubble. “I believe that the money spent on the purchase of machines and the subsidy can be used for the decomposition of stubble in these states. If successful, the technique will reduce smoke and air pollution, which becomes a prominent cause of Delhi’s deteriorating air quality every winter,” he said. An official of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute said it has received an advance order from the Uttar Pradesh government to demonstrate the technique on 25,000 hectares of land. He said around 10 companies are manufacturing the institute’s bio-decomposer on a large scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/environment-minister-assess-bio-decomposer-method-as-a-solution-to-stubble-burning/story-KFe8wbqm8y99bulqyKXvxH.html

When other bodies have started functioning, why not the quasi-judicial bodies in Maharashtra resume work using online-mediums. We had approached the chief secretary asking for the same but got no reply. We then approached the Bombay high court. If the bodies are shut and non-functioning, then backlogs will go on piling up,” said Shailesh Gandhi, former, Central information commissioner.The RTI activists have also filed another PIL in the Bombay high court seeking a road map for the Maharashtra information commission to provide replies for the second appeal in RTI within 45 days.Citing second appeal reply in Maharashtra at times gets delayed for up to three years.“The Maharashtra information commission should follow the judgement of high courts in the country. The reply for the second appeal takes a lot of time. It often gets delayed. The citizens should know the truth and the government should speak about it. We have asked that the second appeal should be disposed of within 45 days.” said Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rti-activists-seek-resumption-of-services-of-quasi-judicial-bodies-in-maharashtra/story-jwWHLQnazXTWq2Fzy2EKXI.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University online exams: Exams being taken from cafes a mockery of the system, say academicians||With online examinations for final-semester students of PU-affiliated colleges starting on Thursday, private cafes across the state are offering facilities such as internet, laptops and A4 size sheets so the exam can be taken on their premises. Many academicians have expressed concern over this and said it is a mockery of the system as there will have no check on students. Book depots in Chaura Bazaar, Doraha and Khanna have stocked answer-sheets, each comprising 12 pages, available at a cost of ₹10 to ₹20. Social media sites and online marketplace platforms are flooded with posts from café owners and books depots offering facilities to students. Many students in the district which do not have internet connections, due to which they have to shell out ₹200 per exam to take them from cafes. Harpreet Kaur, a resident of Doraha and student from a PU-affiliated college, said, “I don’t know how to send the answer-sheet in PDF format, so I have decided to visit a cafe near my house. They are offering all necessary facilities and will upload the answer-sheet as well. Two of my friends are also going to the same café for the exam.” Kamalpreet Singh, a BA finalyear student, said, “ This is the first time I am appearing in an online exam and had no idea from where to get the answer-sheets from as they were provided by college authorities earlier. But this time, the situation is different, so I visited the books market and the answer sheets were easily available. I got it for all my five exams for ₹100.” Many academicians have stated that online exams are not the right way of testing, rather an open-book exam without any transparency. A member of the PU syndicate, Harpreet Singh Dua, said, “In a meeting of the coordination committee On September 1, it was decided that the matter should be forwarded to syndicate as there is no such provision in the present PU calendar to hold exams in such a manner. The university should have given sufficient time to colleges to gather data on how many students will appear online or offline. The syndicate should form a rule to conduct the exam.” RS Jhanji, syndicate member and principal, AS Khanna, said, “The varsity should have involved stakeholders to discuss the online examination. They should have opted for only one mode, as now, they have asked the colleges in rural areas to make arrangements for offline exams.”Colleges in rural areas have given student the option to submit answer-sheets to the college within two hours after the examPU-affiliated colleges in rural areas including Mata Ganga Khalsa College, Kottan, GNN College, Doraha and GTB College, Dakha have informed students that if they can’t submit the answer-sheets online, they can submit the same in a sealed envelope physically to the nearest nodal centre or college within two hours after the exam gets over. Officiating principal of GTB College, Dakha, Avtar Singh, said, “Over 20 final-year students have informed us that they will submit the answer-sheet to the college after attempting the exam online as they don’t know how to send it in PDF format.” Despite repeated attempts, Parvinder Singh, PU controller examination, could not be contacted for comments.For the convenience of the students, PU will be uploading the question papers on their website on September 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-online-exams-exams-being-taken-from-cafes-a-mockery-of-the-system-say-academicians/story-kQRa2FKjtdtGjZ8fWJOFiJ.html

The Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT), which owns the eastern waterfront area in Mumbai, has floated a tender to appoint an agency to create a Tier-1 oil spill response facility for Mumbai and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) harbour. According to the tender details accessed by HT, the consultant will be asked to carry out a quality risk assessment of oil spill, assess the oil spill trajectory in the worst-case scenario given different weather and sea conditions, carry out sensitivity mapping of the areas most likely to be affected, do a gap analysis of the required and available sources among various other parameters. The consultant will also be asked to prepare a contingency plan with the specific role and functions of the agencies involved. Captain Bhabatosh Chand, deputy conservator, head of marine department, MbPT, said, “We have a plan in place in case of an oil spill for the past five years. As the contract is ending, we are looking for a new agency. We are looking to upgrade it [the plan] and looking at new technology. A ready plan will aid us to control the situation in case of an emergency.” Recently, a Japanese bulk carrier ran aground on a reef on the south-east coast of Mauritius. MV Wakashio struck a coral reef on July 25, spilling about 1,000 tonnes of fuel and endangering corals, fish and other marine life in what some scientists have called the country’s worst ecological disaster. India has also sent equipment and personnel to help Mauritius contain the oil spill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mbpt-to-upgrade-its-oil-spill-contingency-plan-for-mumbai-and-jnpt/story-3MdgYyeI9ZqK0e8sDmuY8K.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt plans to introduce app-based bus service, trial runs likely in 2-3 months||With Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and cluster (orange) buses currently running at half capacity owing to Covid-19 restrictions, and in view of the widening demand and supply gap in public transport, the Delhi government is planning to implement a plan, pending for the past four years -- an app-based air-conditioned bus service. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot is likely to hold a meeting in this regard on Thursday. “The trial service may start within the next two or three months,” a senior transport official, privy to the matter, said on condition of anonymity. The project was under active consideration in the months of November and December last year, but it took a back seat owing to the Delhi Assembly elections, the north-east Delhi riots and then the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown. Under the scheme, the service will be similar to how app-based cab services such as Ola and Uber function. The tickets or bookings for these buses will be available only on the phone app or website.As per the draft prepared by the transport department, these buses will be under the premium segment and will have features such as Wi-Fi connectivity, entertainment systems, reclining seats, premium upholstery, GPS, CCTV cameras and panic buttons.This is not the first time that the government has talked about the scheme. The Delhi government had first given its nod for a premium bus service in May 2016. However, the proposal was struck down by then lieutenant-governor Najeeb Jung over the government not taking his approval first. In 2017 and 2018, the government again worked on the plan but it fizzled out because of permit issues.To ensure passengers are not overcharged, the state transport authority will fix the maximum and minimum fares. “Operators will have to fix the rates based on the distance travelled and payment will be accepted only through digital modes. The buses will be divided into clusters and each cluster will have at least 100 buses pressed into service during peak hours,” the draft scheme read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-plans-to-introduce-app-based-bus-service-trial-runs-likely-in-2-3-months/story-yZe0s3IyfRvW2HgSPmhVoO.html

Cases were also registered against Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and several other attendees of the congregation for violating Covid-19 guidelines.On September 11, a magisterial court had directed the Delhi Police to hand over the keys to the residential portion of the building to Maulana Saad’s family. However, the police challenged the order in the sessions court and additional sessions judge (ASJ) Sandeep Yadav on Wednesday put a stay on the lower court order.The sessions court also issued a notice to Saad’s mother Khalida, on whose application the magisterial court had passed the order, and asked her to respond by October 8.The magisterial court had directed the Delhi Police to inspect the premises within five days and hand over keys to Saad’s family by Wednesday. It had further directed Khalida and her family members to give an undertaking that they would not obstruct the investigation in any manner and the residential portion of the property shall only be used for residing purposes and that they would not enter any other part of the markaz complex.

16-09-2020||Mumbai||Woman duped of ₹5.54L in a matrimonial fraud in Mumbai||A 36-year-old telephone operator from Girgaum was duped into sending ₹5.54 lakh to a ‘foreign national’ who had met her through a Marathi matrimony app.According to VP Road police, the complainant approached them on Wednesday after she realised that her ‘fiance’ had cheated her.In her statement, the woman, who works at a builder’s office in Bandra, told police that she had registered on a Marathi matrimony app in June. In September, she received a WhatsApp message by a man named Sandip Raut, in which he said he was interested in marrying her. Raut allegedly told the complainant that he was a resident of California, United States of America, and had got her details from the matrimony site.After chatting for a few hours, Raut told the woman that he was sending some gifts for her worth ₹57,000 through US-based Kings Cargo Courier, and also gave her a link to the courier company.On September 7, the complainant received an email from Kings Cargo Courier, stating that her parcel was ready for shipping and that she would receive it the following day. The company also gave her the name of the delivery agent — Aparna KR and details of her bank account, stating that she would have to pay ₹57,000 before the delivery. The woman was told that the amount would be refunded after delivery of the parcel.The complainant transferred the amount through mobile banking, however, the same day she received another email stating that the parcel contained US dollars, which was illegal to be couriered to India. It further stated that she would have to get permission from the government or pay ₹1.55 lakh and a fine of ₹16,000 as late fees.She was then given the name of Kalikadevi and her bank account. The complainant sent a cheque of ₹1.55 lakh to the woman, but on September 10 she received yet another email stating that she would have to pay ₹3.36 lakh, equivalent to the dollars contained in the parcel. The woman did the needful and got an email confirming that her parcel had reached India.On Tuesday, she received an email stating that an additional amount of ₹9.55 lakh should be paid to get the parcel.Since she did not have that much money, the complainant contacted Raut, who instructed her to delete her matrimony registration immediately. She did as instructed but when she asked for the money, Raut told her that the courier company had duped her and he had nothing to do with. He then stopped answering her calls or replying to her messages.“The woman realised that she was cheated and approached us. We registered an offence based on her complaint,’ said inspector Santosh Kadam of VP Road police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-duped-of-5-54l-by-man-whom-she-met-on-matrimony-app/story-tJwtEXD5xksMyMuTqxGTQM.html

Till September 15, which was the last day to confirm admissions under the quota, only 2,928 of the 5,371 students who were allotted schools in the first round managed to complete their admission process. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the education department had allowed parents to send their documents to schools online. They were also given time to report to schools in slots given to them to confirm their admissions later. However, very few parents confirmed admissions. In 2019, almost a similar number of students had confirmed their admissions. Officials at the department said that the low numbers despite the relaxations in the process might be a result of migration of parents due to job losses. “Many children are yet to come back to the city from their hometowns. Some parents who might have applied for a seat might not be able to come back due to financial losses. Schools were asked to follow up with all the selected students and the final number is arrived at after having told them to confirm their seats on many occasions,” said an official from the department. This year, a total of 14,135 applications were received for the 7,069 available seats under the quota in the city. Students whose names have appeared on the waiting list will be eligible to claim seats against vacancies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rte-admissions-only-53-students-confirm-seats-in-mumbai/story-lJCXl7FfkJiStXJ7wEvRlL.html

16-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra approves free treatment scheme for road accident victims||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced a road accident insurance scheme under which anyone who gets injured in road mishap is eligible for free treatment in hospitals. The scheme, named after Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, will cost the state exchequer ₹125 crore annually. The Balasaheb Thackeray Road Accident Insurance Scheme was approved in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday.The government has also decided to fill up more than 12,500 vacant posts for constables in the state police force. State home minister Anil Deshmukh said the move would give job opportunities to youth from both rural and urban areas. At present, there are 12,528 posts of constables vacant in the state, for which a recruitment drive will be held.The road accident scheme will provide free treatment up to ₹30,000 to any person injured in a road accident in the state. “It aims at saving lives by providing immediate treatment in the golden hour,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.He said that anyone who gets injured even if he is not from Maharashtra will be considered to get benefit of the scheme. Around 74 types of treatment that are needed in case of road accidents have been included in the scheme.“The injured person can get treatment at a government or private hospital under the insurance scheme. The insurance company will be determined through a tendering process,” Tope added.The scheme is formulated on the lines of Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana wherein empanelled hospitals treat patients and recover the cost from insurance providers sanctioned by the state government. A dedicated helpline will also be set-up for effectively implementing the road accident scheme, which was first proposed in 2017 by the then health minister Deepak Sawant but wasn’t approved.In Maharashtra, around 13,000 people lose lives in road accidents while around 40,000 get injured every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-approves-free-treatment-scheme-for-road-accident-victims/story-FDPR09XLfM9eym8rDUq9lI.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court rejects bail plea of Iqbal Mirchi’s aide Humayun Merchant||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday rejected the bail application of gangster Iqbal Mirchi’s close aide Humayun Merchant. Merchant, who has been lodged in Taloja jail since his arrest in October 2019, had approached the HC for bail on medical grounds after the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court rejected his bail application twice. Earlier in May, the HC had dismissed a petition by Merchant wherein he had challenged the decision of the high-power committee (HPC) to exclude undertrials and convicts arrested and sentenced for serious economic offences. After his petition was dismissed, Merchant, who is over 70 years of age and suffers from various ailments, moved for bail on medical grounds. The bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing Merchant’s bail plea, which was filed immediately after the special PMLA court denied him bail for a second time in February, was informed that his continued detention was against the doctrine ‘bail is rule, jail an exception’, and hence he should be granted bail. While seeking bail in HC, Merchant had submitted that his detention was unsolicited and added that due to his health condition and the rising Covid-19 cases in jails, he should be granted bail. ED, however, opposed the plea alleging that Merchant had “planted” tenants to purportedly usurp three immovable properties — Sea View, Marium Lodge and Rabia Mansion in Worli — belonging to Sir Mohammad Yusuf Trust. It also had also alleged that Merchant then facilitated the deal to develop these buildings. The probing agency had also submitted that as all health-related issues of inmates were being taken care of by jail authorities, he should not be granted bail. The bench accepted the submissions and rejected the bail application.In October 2019, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Merchant while investigating the property dealings of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi — a close aide of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim — in a money-laundering case. ED termed him a “frontman” who was given the power of attorney by Mirchi after the latter fled the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-iqbal-mirchi-s-aide-humayun-merchant/story-POUQhA4GtLdc1sAEqXpdTJ.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||No Kurla terminus on Mumbai Metro-2B line: MMRDA||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) announced on Wednesday that it has scrapped plans for the Kurla terminus station on the Metro-2B line, which will run from DN Nagar in Andheri to Mandale.In a statement released on Wednesday, the nodal authority for Metro projects in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) said the planned station was in the way of the restricted airport funnel zone. Also, the distance between the proposed terminus and SG Barve Marg station on the same line is only about 474 meters. Finally, MMRDA said that the location for the station would mean it would be “sandwiched” between the current Santacruz Chembur Link Road (SCLR) rail overbridge and another permanent structure.In an email to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and MMRDA’s metropolitan commissioner, right-to-information activist Anil Galgali questioned MMRDA’s decision to scrapping the Kurla terminus on Wednesday. Galgali contended that the station could be an important node for commuters. “Why did MMRDA not call for suggestions/objections from citizens if they are making changes to the plan? The station is very much in the detailed project report of Metro-2B, then why did they delete it?” Galgali wrote in his mail to Thackeray. Previously, MMRDA had scrapped the station that was to be built on Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Road and officials said that this station would overlap with the Kalanagar flyover ramp. They also said shifting the station’s alignment would mean there would be hardly any distance between it and the station near the income tax office. Metro-2B is a 23.64-km long elevated corridor which was supposed to have 22 stations, but with the scrapping of two stations it will have 20 stations. The corridor is expected to reduce travel time between Mumbai’s eastern and western suburbs by 40 to 55 minutes and result in a 30 to 35℅ consequent reduction in vehicular traffic. The cost of the project is ₹10,986 crore and it is expected to be operational around 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-kurla-terminus-on-mumbai-metro-2b-line-mmrda/story-ZtBG0cNR9YdTiIxpAbEjAJ.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||SC stay on Maratha quota: Maharashtra to finalise legal move in two days||The Maharashtra government has decided to finalise its next legal move in two days to vacate the Supreme Court’s (SC) stay on the implementation of Maratha reservation. The decision was taken at the all-party meet convened by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. On September 9, the Apex court stayed the implementation of Maratha quota in jobs and education and referred the case to a to a larger constitution bench. The stay is a political setback to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state as the move has stalled the ongoing admission process and created discontent in the Maratha community. This, in turn, has given the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) another issue to target the Thackeray-led government.Thackeray, however, seemed confident of the support of the Opposition and even praised BJP after the meeting. “We will approach the Supreme Court to lift the stay. In the next two days, we will consult all legal experts and decide on further course of action,” he said. Opposition parties, which blamed the MVA government for failing to uphold the quota in the Apex court, however said they would cooperate with the government. “We feel the best option is to approach the Chief Justice and request him to constitute a larger bench,” said Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of Opposition. Fadnavis, however, took a dig at the MVA government and said, “During my tenure as chief minister, I was in constant touch with lawyers, and it was like a running commentary even when they were in the SC. The state government should have approached us before. However, we have decided to leave the past behind as our aim is to get reservation for Marathas.” The Supreme Court in its order held that Marathas do not need reservation, saying the state government has not shown any “extraordinary situation” which warrants the reservation. After the verdict, Maratha outfits started protests against MPs and MLAs. Thackeray has once again appealed to protesters to call of their agitation. “The government is committed to give you reservation and we are all one in this fight,” said Thackeray.Vinayak Mete, who represents the Shiv Sangram party, asked the government to rein in the police who are acting against the protesters and withdraw all cases against protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-stay-on-maratha-quota-maharashtra-to-finalise-legal-move-in-two-days/story-thcV4X3M4iT81oC3kOJsxN.html

The body was tied spirally from head to toe, with iron wires and rope. There were cement blocks as well tied on to the body to allegedly immerse the body completely into the dam.According to police, since the body bloated due to retention of water, it came up floating.

Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in the SDMC, said the civic body has started preparing a list of such properties, located in residential areas falling in the four zones of the south civic body.He said nearly 615 properties were sealed over illegal constructions by the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee between 2017 and 2020. On August 14, the Supreme Court had ruled that the monitoring committee was meant to take action against commercial units operating in residential areas and upon encroachments on public land. The apex court had specified that civic bodies will have the authority under law to take action against illegal construction in residences.“We have identified that overall 615 properties can be de-sealed. As many as 194 properties are in the Central zone, 146 in West zone, 13 in Najafgarh zone and the remaining in the South zone. The de-sealing process will start soon. No fee will be charged from owners for the process,” Chawla said.He said many of these properties were sealed because owners made illegal extensions, such as security guard cabins or a similar structure, in the stilt parking area of the property. “In many of these cases, violations were compoundable (settled through fines or similar penalty). The civic body will later figure out whether to impose a fine and regularise the construction or take action against violators. “But for now, we are going to de-seal these properties,” Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-to-de-seal-over-600-properties-in-residential-areas-locked-over-past-three-years/story-OfiIiA8ebLkxMbLaqKo0wN.html

Consumers and advocates welcomed the upgrading of the forum to a commission in the district and said it will be more beneficial for consumers as it will decrease the case load at the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.“The District Commission (earlier referred to as District Forum) can now entertain consumer complaints having value up to ₹1 crore. Earlier the limit was ₹20 lakh,” Gunjan Sharma, advocate and representative of the Consumer Forum Advocates’ Association said Tuesday.“The State Commission can entertain disputes where such value exceeds ₹1 crore but not more than ₹10 crore, while the National Commission can exercise jurisdiction where such value exceeds ₹10 crore,” said Sharma.According to him, earlier the State Commission pecuniary jurisdiction was between ₹20 lakh and ₹1 crore and that of the National Commission above ₹1crore. “The new act will decrease the load on the National Commission,” he added.“The New Act has widened the definition of ‘consumer’. The definition now includes any person who buys any goods, whether through offline or online transactions, electronic means, teleshopping, direct selling or multi-level marketing,” said Sharma.According to District Courts Bar Association president Sanjeev Verma, the New Act will establish a new regulatory authority known as the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) which will have an investigation wing, headed by a Director-General, which may conduct an inquiry or investigation into violation of consumer rights or unfair trade practices.“The new Act also contains within it enabling provisions for consumers to file complaints electronically and for hearing and/or examining parties through video-conferencing. This will take time as digital infrastructure has to be provided at district commission,” said Verma.He added that the Act has made it a criminal offence to publish false or misleading advertisement for manufacturers and services providers. “If found guilty, they could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, besides fined upto ₹10 lakh,” said Verma.Meanwhile, the District Consumer Commission, which had been non-functional since June 16 as all posts were lying vacant, now has a president and a member. “I and one member have joined and started work from August 21.

16-09-2020||City||Two persons arrested for murdering farmer leader in Jewar||Police on Wednesday arrested two suspects for the murder of a farmer leader in Neemka village in Jewar, which took place on September 2. The victim, Pradeep Atri, 26, was allegedly called by the arrested men – Lawrence and his brother Vipin Singh – and some other suspects at a dhaba where he was shot dead. Police said Pradeep was associated with a farmers’ union and was actively involved in social activities. Police said the suspects allegedly had personal enmity with the victim for over a year.Arvind Pradhan, Atri’s uncle and former village head, alleged that the murder was due to personal enmity. “The personal enmity started last year, when a woman from our village was married to someone in Ballabgarh. When the woman visited her hometown on Raksha Bandhan, the suspect Vipin lured the woman and eloped with her,” he alleged.Arvind alleged that Pradeep, as a farmer leader, felt bad over the incident. “He intervened and helped the woman’s family trace and get her back. Since then, Vipin, Lawrence and his family had developed a grudge against Pradeep,” he added.Rampal Singh, Pradeep’s father, filed a complaint at the Jewar police station after the incident. He alleged that on September 2 at 7pm, Lawrence had called Pradeep on his mobile phone and asked him to come to a dhaba on Jewar Khurja road. “There were some people already sitting at the dhaba. They had an argument, following which they shot him in the abdomen,” he alleged. Locals heard the gunshots and informed the victim’s family. The victim was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead, Rampal added.Rampal named ten persons, including the arrested suspects, in the FIR. Locals had also protested in the village and demanding action against the suspects after the incident took place.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said a case was registered against the ten suspects under Section 302 (murder) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC. “Police investigation revealed that the victim and suspects had personal enmity over a woman in the past. We have arrested the two suspects – Lawrence and Vipin - and launched a search to arrest the absconding persons,” he said. The victim is survived by his wife and three minor daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-persons-arrested-for-murdering-farmer-leader-in-jewar/story-AskWnOEQvP9PyWc3M0q44I.html
16-09-2020||Noida||Noida authority submits action plan to clean Kondli drain, says will 2-3 years||One of the major causes of pollution in the Yamuna, the stinking murky waters of the Kondli drain may take another two to three years to get cleaned as the Noida authority as finally submitted an action plan to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday. The nine-point action plan includes ensuring high-rise societies and industries don not release untreated sewage into drains; strengthening existing sewage network in the city; more public toilets;constructing more sewage treatment plant (STPs); checking encroachments around the drain; and treating the drain through six constructed wetlands. The 40-years-old and 20km long Kondli drain originates from Kondli village in Delhi and enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11. After travelling through Noida for about 17km, through Sector 11, Sector 12, Sector 22, Sector 50, Sector 92 and Sector 168, it empties into the Yamuna near Chak Mangrola in Sector 168. Various studies, done over the years, have identified the sewage carrying Kondli drain to be the main cause of pollution in the Yamuna. According to a report submitted by the Central Pollution Control Board in the NGT, the estimated sewage generation in Noida is 216 million litres a day (MLD) of which only 152 MLD is being treated while the remaining 64 MLD flows through the Kondli drain into the Yamuna.“Treating Kondli drain is one of our priorities and the work on the action plan submitted by us has already begun. Each plan has been given set target -- checking of all high-rises and industries may take one year; enhancing STPs by 180 MLD would take four years; and upgrading the sewage network will take two years. The constructed wetland over the drain may probably take two years. So, for the overall cleaning of Kondli drain, we may about two or three. But concerned agencies in Delhi also need to work at tandem because the drain is more polluted when it enters Noida from Delhi,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority. It was he who compiled the action plan. He added that the authority has already inspected over 68 high-rise societies to check if they are treating their sewage and action has been initiated against violators. The action plan submitted by the authority also involves tapping and channelising the 30 small floodwater drains that illegally carry sewage into the Kondli drain, as a long term remedial issue. “A third party agency has been hired to study these 30 floodwater drains and check their connectivity to ascertain if they can be intercepted and redirected to the STPs for treatment,” Tripathi said. On the constructed wetlands – an artificial wetland that treats the drain naturally -- that will be built along Kondli to naturally treat the effluents, the action plan stated that the detailed project report was being prepared by the irrigation department. “Six wetlands, each about 500 metres in length, will be constructed over the Noida portion of the Kondli drain. An agreement is to be signed between our department and the Noida authority, after which work will start. Once constructed, it will be a unique project in India -- one where a drain is treated naturally through wetlands on such a large scale,” VK Pandey, assistant engineer, Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department, said. The legal battle to clean the Kondli drain was initiated by Noida resident and environment activist Abhisht Kusum Gupta in NGT in November 2018. The next date of hearing in the matter is in November 2020. “It had been two years and we are still talking of making plans to clean the drain while residents suffer and the Yamuna continues to be polluted,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-submits-action-plan-to-clean-kondli-drain-says-will-2-3-years/story-h9Tepe5ie2NhMV5PZT3CqO.html
16-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad revives 74MLD sewage treatment plant in Indirapuram||Ghaziabad: At least three major sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the district, facing operational issues and allegedly discharging untreated water into river Hindon, are now in the process of revival. Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) said that one of them -- 74 million litres a day (MLD) capacity STP at Indirapuram -- was made fully functional on Tuesday after it was handed over to a company under ‘one city, one operator’ scheme. The other two STPs -- 56 MLD capacity at Indirapuram and 70MLD at Dundahera which are also facing issues due to old technology -- will be made fully functional soon, the officials said. SK Singh, project manager from VA Tech Wabag, the company which has now taken up STPs, said that the 74 MLD STP at Indirapuram faced operational issues. “It was taking the sewage from the Sahibabad drain, but not properly treating it. We have replaced equipment and made the STP functional. It is likely to achieve the quality benchmark (of biochemical oxygen demand of less than 10 mg/litre) within a week. But it is treating only 32 MLD of sewage as the outlet of the STP campus is small,” he said. To enhance the capacity of the outlet from the STP campus at Indirapuram, the UP Jal Nigam is presently taking up a project which is likely to get complete by end of November against its earlier timeline of July. The delay is due to lockdown, the officials said. Singh said that the other 56 MLD STP at Indirapuram and 70 MLD STP at Dundahera also face similar issues and the company is in the process of upgrading them too. “The two STPs are also facing issues in treating sewage. They were handed over to us in January as part of the project. We are in process of making them fully operational,” he added. The campus at Indirapuram has three STPs whose discharge goes through a common outlet and thereafter gets drained into Hindon near Chijarsi. The third STP (with 56 MLD capacity) at Indirapuram is maintained by the Ghaziabad Development Authority and fully functional. As a result of the untreated waste flowing from STPs into Hindon, the river stretch at Chijarsi sampling location had no traces of dissolved oxygen (DO) from January to July this year, barring April. The data from the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) shows that at sampling location of Chijarsi, the DO levels were 1.7 mg/litre in April while it was zero for the other six months, January to March and May to July. “It is because of the issues with the STPs that untreated waste water was flowing into the river. This is why the sampling location at Chijarsi was showing zero levels of DO during the lockdown period. Since majority of industrial units were closed during the lockdown period, the DO levels were zero,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB. The dissolved oxygen level in a river is one of the major indicators of its health and high DO levels are suitable for survival of aquatic life and further higher levels make it even fit for drinking purposes. The GMC officials said that the STPs in Ghaziabad were built about 20 years ago and had old technologies. “The STPs have been facing issues for the past couple of years. The state government handed over the STPs to the company. The STPs were not meeting the required benchmark and there were some petitions filed with the National Green Tribunal in this regard. So, the rehabilitation of the STPs is now in progress and it is likely that they will be fully revived by March next year,” said BK Singh, general manager (water works), GMC.According to UPPCB’s ‘action plan for restoration of polluted stretches of Hindon’, the entire stretch of the river from Saharanpur to Ghaziabad has 10 STPs which have a combined capacity of treating 524.5 MLD of sewage but the capacity utilization is only 224 MLD, about 43% of the installed capacity. The Ghaziabad district has a total of eight STPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-revives-74mld-sewage-treatment-plant-in-indirapuram/story-BVXCnIUlV11otoetA7Ku0O.html
16-09-2020||Noida||Ridership on Aqua Line increases nearly fivefold within a week||Noida Metro Rail Corporation’s (NMRC) Aqua Line that connects Noida to Greater Noida has recorded nearly a fivefold increase in ridership since it resumed operations post-lockdown on September 7. The 29.70km Aqua Line, which connects Noida to Greater Noida, has 21 stations of which 15 are in Noida and six in Greater Noida. On Day One, when it ran curtailed operations, it had a ridership of 600 passengers. On September 12, full-fledged operations were resumed, and on Tuesday, it recorded a ridership of 2,882, although the previous day it had recorded 3,241. Sandhya Sharma, NMRC deputy general manager, said, “From September 7-11, the metro services were available in the morning hours (7am to 11am) and evening hours (5pm to 9pm) with trains running at a frequency of 15 minutes. From September 12, trains ran through the day (6am to 10pm).” Sharma said NMRC was following all Covid-19 safety standards essential for a safe Metro travel such as compulsory masks, temperature checks, social distancing norms and one-bag rule. Praveen Mishra, executive director, NMRC, said, “We are observing all safety norms and the ridership is gradually increasing. We hope that more people will use the metro as they get a sense of confidence,” he said. However, the post-lockdown ridership is still significantly lower than what it was before the pandemic arrived. On March 16, for example, the Line recorded a ridership of 19,064. It suspended operations following the Janta Curfew on March 22, three days before the nationwide lockdown was announced. NMRC officials felt that since several business houses and academic institutions were yet to open, the ridership was yet to reach full potential. On Tuesday, NMRC also organised a workshop to sensitise the staff towards the transgender community. The workshop was organised by an NGO that works closely with the community and is involved in generating awareness in society. The NMRC has recently dedicated its Sector 50 metro station to the transgender community and renamed it as “Rainbow Station.” The metro has also recently come out with vacancies for persons of the transgender community to provide them with employment opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ridership-on-aqua-line-increases-nearly-fivefold-within-a-week/story-YAomrAYo5MO2cNSSvOIkOP.html

16-09-2020||City||ICU bed occupancy at all-time high in Ghaziabad, district to ramp up testing||Ghaziabad health department is in spot of bother as the number of ICU beds in the district is getting filled quickly.During the past fortnight, there has been a surge in number of Covid-19 cases. Around 3,224 new cases were reported in September already, as per the state control room records-- almost 201 cases a day. According to the district health department records, 30 of the 37 ICU beds in government’s Covid hospitals were occupied, while of the 98 ICU beds in the private sector read 90% occupancy till September 16. “This (occupancy of ICU beds) is the highest it has ever been. We are trying our best to arrange for more ICU beds and also asking hospitals to add up more beds. The occupancy is because cases are rising fast. In our L-1, L-2 and L-3 hospitals, 485 out of 1276 are occupied. Of these, the two L-2 hospitals have 176 Covid beds, and 146 are occupied. The occupancy in 10 private hospitals is also ranging between 80-90%,” said Dr. NK Gupta, Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer.Uttart Pradesh follows a three-tier hospital system for Covid-19: L-1 for mild cases, L-2 for moderate cases and L-3 for severe cases. The 10 private hospitals providing paid Covid-19 treatment have a combined strength of 663 beds and more are likely to be added within the week. The district has been told to increase tests to 4000 per day, as testing and containing infected individuals is the only way forward to check the spread of the disease.According to the records of the district health department, the test positivity rate (TPR, or the number of positive cases per 100 tests) was about 3.04% during the first 15 days of August when it had conducted 46,617 tests giving 1419 cases. The first 15 days in September saw a TPR of 5.76% with 51,797 tests giving 2986 positive cases. The district’s overall TPR stood at 4.58% till September 15. Officials said that more cases with moderate to severe conditions were being discovered with the increase in tests. “So far, we have been conducting about 3000-3500 tests per day. For increasing tests, we require more lab technicians. We had sent a proposal for hiring 20 lab technicians to the district committee. A decision is expected soon,” Dr. Gupta said. According to the official records, the district completed 249390 samples till September 15 and 142363 of these were done through the use of rapid antigen kits. The use of rapid antigen kits was initiated on June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/icu-bed-occupancy-at-all-time-high-in-ghaziabad-district-to-ramp-up-testing/story-ZDUc9IRmnWspQGQFC2ezVP.html
16-09-2020||Noida||Despite surge, only 35% of Covid beds occupied in GB Nagar, most remain in home isolation||Despite the surge in Covid-19 patients this month, nearly 65% of the 2,857 beds in Gautam Budh Nagar’s Covid-dedicated hospitals are vacant. A further analysis will show that most of the beds reserved for mild cases are the most unoccupied as patients chose to be home isolated rather than spend time in an institution. Facilities that treat severe and moderate cases, meanwhile, have just over half their beds occupied. The paid facilities show nearly 85% occupancy.On Wednesday, the district had 1,966 positive cases, but over 950 of them were under home isolation, and the recovery rate was around 81%.District magistrate Suhas LY said the administration was working to increasing the number of beds. “To cope with any emergency, we have plans to take number of dedicated beds for Covid-19 patients to at least 5,000. And, since the state government has already announced the price caps for private medical colleges and hospitals, many of them have already started developing exclusive facilities for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” he said. The DM also said that all private and government hospitals have been asked to ensure that all patients be treated without delay. “If any hospital has any difficulty in treating the patients, they can refer them to hospitals with better treatment facilities. However, the referring hospital must co-ordinate properly with the referred hospital so that the patients don’t suffer. Following standard protocol for Covid-19 is mandatory for all the hospitals,” he said. According to the official sources, there are 171 patients in the four L-1 (for mild cases) category hospitals that has 1,430 beds. This includes the 250 in Tata hospital (sector 125) and 240 in Noida Institute of Medical Science, 900 in Bennett Hospital and 30 in community health centre (CHC, Bisrakh). Acting district surveillance officer Dr. Sunil Dohre said that Bennett Hospital and CHC (Bisrakh) have been kept as reserve to accommodate the patients in case of emergency. “In the L-2 category hospitals (for moderate illness), the Kailash Hospital (Sector 10), which has 140 beds, there is 90% occupancy, the Child PGI (in Sector 30) has over 95% of its 120 beds unoccupied, JP hospital (Sector 128) has 75% of its 112 beds occupied, Yatharth Hospital with 200 beds and Tata hospital with 250 beds in sector 39 have 87% and 72% occupancy, respectively,” he said.Yatharth, JP and Kailash hospitals offer paid facilities.In the L-3 category (severe cases) hospitals, out of 697 beds available, a little over 50% beds are occupied. “While 138 beds are occupied out of 250 in the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, 170 Covid-19 patients are being treated at Sharda hospital having 400 beds. The occupancy at 47-bedded Fortis is almost 100%, where 46 patients are being treated,” said Dr Dohre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/despite-surge-only-35-of-covid-beds-occupied-in-gb-nagar-most-remain-in-home-isolation/story-ne68O06Y24xtwaeI8XiO5L.html
16-09-2020||City||Farmers threaten to stop work on Delhi-Meerut Expressway, demand hiked compensation||Hundreds of farmers from different villages of Ghaziabad and Meerut districts gathered at the Govindpuram Anaj Mandi and demanded increase in compensation for their land and service roads used for the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) project. The farmers have threatened to stop work for phase 4 of the DME if their demands are not met within the next 10-12 days.The DME has four phases, two of which are under construction and two are operational. Phase 2 is under construction over a stretch of 19.2km from UP-Gate to Dasna while phase 4, about 32km, is proposed to connect Dasna to Meerut with the help of a six lane access-controlled expressway.“Farmers of villages from where land is acquired for DME walked from Meerut and Ghaziabad and gathered at Govindpuram. We intended to stage a protest outside the district collectorate but administrative officials sent a delegation to hold discussions. We have given them 10-12 days to decide our demand, else there will be a complete stoppage of work,” said Babli Kasana, president of Kisan Ekta Sangh, a farmers’ association.He said the association has demanded that famers who have received less than Rs 8,500 per square metre for compensation should be given this amount for their land. He said land for the DME was acquired from 19 villages in Ghaziabad and five in Meerut district.“The rate of Rs 8,500 is the highest given to farmers from Dasna. Further, we have demanded 14km of service road between Pilkhuwa to Kharkhauda and Mohiuddinpur to Kharkhauda alongside the DME alignment. This will help farmers get a better connectivity to their fields through the underpasses constructed for DME,” he added.Phase 4, like phase 2, is also in an advanced stage of construction and is likely to be completed by the 0end of December. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), meanwhile, said they have already given a heavy compensation to farmers as per norms and the average rate is about Rs 6,000 to Rs 6,500 per square metre (sqm).“If we compare, we have given about Rs 60 crore per kilometre under the DME project while Rs 40 crore per kilometre was given for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The rates are very high when we compare it to the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project, which were about Rs 6 crore per kilometre. If service roads are given, there will be no use for the expressway and commuters will start using these roads in order to avoid toll,” said an officer from the authority, requesting anonymity.The farmers, on the other hand, said NHAI is providing about 8.5km of service road which is not a single connecting road. The NHAI said that they have proposed about 45 underpasses under phase 4 and will help farmers with internal connectivity.“We have complied with norms while providing compensation. Now, it is up to the Ghaziabad district administration to decide upon issues raised by farmers. At our sites, we need adequate police protection as the work is going on at a fast pace and we cannot afford any hindrances,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.The district administration said it held meetings with farmers when they came to Ghaziabad on Tuesday night and also during their stay on Wednesday.“The administration is reviewing the progress of different cases (related to land compensation) which are in arbitration and also those which have been referred to the state administration. A regular progress review is taken up on a daily basis. We held discussions with farmers and have also urged them not to stop work as it is a public utility project. The committee of farmers has given us 10-12 days to look into their demands,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-threaten-to-stop-work-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-demand-hiked-compensation/story-uTwmyEJShAniXbZYCq2uuI.html
16-09-2020||Noida||Noida to revise its Master Plan, building by-laws; more area allowed for industrial units||The Noida authority on Wednesday started the process to make amendments in the Master Plan 2031 of the city and the Building By-laws 2010. It has invited objections and suggestions from residents before paving the way for the changes in the plan and the bylaws, which regulate structural development in the city. According to rules, the authority has to seek objections or suggestions from the public before finalising any changes in the master plan or the building bylaws. Once the changes are made, industrial units in Noida, which was set up as an industrial town, will be able to build more floors in a building and cover more floor area with built-up structures, said officials.“The move will enable people to utilise the maximum area of an industrial plot as owners will be able to expand structures vertically and at the same time, use more ground for coverage. The authority has a limited amount of land meant for industrial purposes at its disposal while the demand for it is high, increasing the floor area ratio will boost the industrial growth and fuel economic activity,” said Ishtiaq Ahmed, chief architect and town planner, of the Noida authority.Floor area ratio (FAR) means the proportion obtained by dividing the total covered area (plinth area) on all floors by the area of the plot. The FAR of a plot dictates how many floors an owner can add (vertical expansion) and how much of the plot area can be covered with construction (horizontal expansion).In the changes plan and bylaws, the authority has increased FAR for individual industrial plots and integrated industrial township plots which have an area of 1,800 square metres (sqm) or above, located on a road which is at least 24 metres-wide, to a maximum of 3.5. According to officials, this was done so that owners of industrial units can build more floors and set up more industrial units on a single plot, unlike earlier when only one unit was allowed on a single industrial plot. Previously, the maximum FAR which was allowed was 1.5 for industrial plots, said officials.The authority decided to make the changes in a follow up of directions of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in a review meeting held on May 14 this year. During the meeting, the CM had directed to make more industrial land available in Noida where demand for industrial plots is on the rise, said officials. To make that happen, the authority, in its 199th board meeting held on August 18, had approved a proposal to make the changes.If the changes are approved, then the new bylaws will be applicable to the industrial plots which are to be developed in sectors 156, 157, 158 and 159, among others, said officials. For example, if a plot of 100 sqm has an FAR of 1.5 according to previous bylaws, the owner can now build 2.5 floors and develop 1,500 square feet area, if the FAR is 2.5 then four floors can cover 2,500 square feet area, and an FAR of 3.5 will enable the owner to build six floors and cover 3,500 square feet. However, an FAR of 3.5 can be allowed on plots with a size of 1,800 sqm or above, and also if the plot is located on a road which is 24 metres-wide or more to bear vehicular pressure, said officials.“The changes will impact the new industrial sectors to be developed along the Noida Expressway, where land is being acquired,” said Sudhir Kumar, senior town planner of the authority.The general public can give their objections in the next 15 days at the Sector 6 administrative building. Once the objections are submitted, the authority will work to resolve them and subsequently prepare a proposal to be sent to the state government for a final nod on the changes, said officials.In the Master Plan 2031, a total area of about 2,806 hectares is planned to be developed as industrial. So far, only 1,500 hectares have been developed, said officials. Officials said the authority is not sure how much land it will be able to acquire from farmers in the time to come. According to Master Plan 2031, out of the total of 15,279.90 hectares on which Noida is developed, industrial area is 18.37%, residential area is 37.45 hectares and recreational (green) areas are 15.92 hectares. The remaining land is meant for commercial, institutional, water bodies and agricultural activities, as per the plan.The revised master plan is expected to change the city’s skyline in sectors along the Noida Expressway, say stakeholders.“As of now, the business sector is witnessing an all time low due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. But yes, the changes, enabling industrial units to go vertical, will impact the future of business positively. It will boost growth and fuel the economy in the future,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida entrepreneur association (NEA).“Revising the Master Plan 2031 and Building Bylaws 2010 to increase FAR means increase in population density, which will over burden infrastructure such as roads, sewer networks and the drainage system, among others. If we do not make adequate provisions to accommodate the vehicular pressure, chaotic situations will be seen on Noida roads as road design hasn’t been changed. Also, an increase in FAR will require more housing facilities for industrial workers that we have not done. If the authority is to make changes in the master plan then it should look into these issues as well, else it will create a mess,” said Atul Gupta, president of Architects’ Association of Noida Zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-revise-its-master-plan-building-by-laws-more-area-allowed-for-industrial-units/story-erQsP1ReuNAAMUBuWehC6K.html

16-09-2020||City||Farmers take out protest march in Mohali against proposed agri laws, power bill||Continuing their agitation against Centre’s agriculture ordinances and power amendment bill, several farmers’ organisations on Wednesday held a protest in Mohali.The farmers, including members of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal and Lakhowal, began their protest march from Amb Sahib Gurudwara in Phase 8 towards the Punjab governor’s house in Chandigarh, but were stopped at the Chandigarh-Mohali border near YPS roundabout.However, eight members were later allowed to proceed to the governor’s residence. When they reached at the gate, the ADC to governor came to receive their memorandum of demands, but the farmers refused to hand it over saying that they will do so only if the governor agreed to meet them.Earlier on Tuesday, BKU workers were booked for blocking NH 21 and violating social distancing norms during a protest in Kharar.BKU Rajewal president Balbir Singh Rajewal stated that the BJP’s anti-farmer face had been exposed with the introduction of the three agriculture ordinances in the Lok Sabha. Other farm leaders said the Union government wanted to sell commodities to the corporate houses by not giving the right price to the farmers. Farmers of Punjab were meeting 70 to 80 per cent of the food grain requirement of the country, but such laws would destroy them, added the BKU chief.The protesting farmers also discussed their issues and pledged to fight for their rights in a united manner. The farmers wore black robes and raised slogans against the Union government.The spokespersons appealed to the farmers not to allow the MPs, who had voted in favour of the ordinances, to enter their villages.Rajewal said due to the lethal policies of the Centre, farmers were already on the verge of suicide and now with the implementation of new laws, there was a feeling of uneasiness, resentment and insecurity among them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-take-out-protest-march-in-mohali-against-proposed-agri-laws-power-bill/story-GJHHAJxqNscw1QPBfVFi2O.html

16-09-2020||City||Farmer bodies declare Punjab bandh on Sept 25||Chandigarh/Amritsar Around 10 farmer organisations have given a call for Punjab Bandh on September 25 as a mark of protest against the “anti-farmer Bills being enacted by the Parliament. The decision was taken by the representatives of the farm bodies during a meeting in Ludhiana on Wednesday. All businesses, road and rail transport will be shut during the bandh, they said. Farmer leaders said the ordinances related to the agriculture sector proposed by the Narendra Modi government, set to become laws soon, will sound a death knell for farmers and farm labourers. They said the struggle will continue till the ordinances were shelved. To work out modalities for the bandh, a meeting of the farmer bodies has been convened on September 19 in Moga where representatives of organisations related to agriculture sector will chalk out a strategy to intensify the movement. Ludhiana meeting was attended by leaders of Azad Kisan Sangharsh Committee; Jai Kisan Andolan; Punjab Kisan Sabha All India Kisan Sabha Punnawal, Punjab Kisan Sabha; Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakonda) and Kirti Kisan Union, among others. Meanwhile, a delegation of farmers led by general secretary of a faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union, Harvinder Singh Lakhowal, staged a dharna outside the Raj Bhawan in Chandigarh on Wednesday. They had sought an audience with the governor, which was denied. Lakhowal said farmer organisations will write messages on the walls in villages, urging villagers to not entertain politicians. Blockades lifted from 3 Majha bridges Farmers on Wednesday lifted the blockades on three main bridges of Majha region, taking cognisance of the ‘inconvenience’ they caused to the people. Farmers, however, have announced to intensify their protest against the ordinances. Thousands of farmers, under the banner of Kisan Sangharash Committee (KSC), had laid siege to the Harike bridge connecting Majha and Malwa, the Beas bridge on the Amritsar-Delhi highway and the Hargobindpur bridge in Gurdaspur on Monday afternoon. Farmer leaders, while lifting the blockades, said since the Centre appears to be adamant on passing the “anti-farmer” ordinances in Parliament, they will scale up their protest and a decision will be taken in a high-level meeting on Thursday. KSC’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher, who led the protest on Beas bridge, said, “We have lifted the protest, but that doesn’t mean our struggle has finished. Now, the protest will be intensified.” He said, “Our further action plan may include barring the entry of political leaders, especially the Central ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs, in Punjab’s villages. We may also plan to launch rail roko andolan (stir), besides organising long protest marches in all cities and villages of the state.” KSC’s Punjab president Satnam Singh Pannu held responsible both the ruling Congress in Punjab and the BJP’s ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for playing with the sentiments of the state’s farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-bodies-declare-punjab-bandh-on-sept-25/story-ss7XlxwmFUtlWcX26gakBM.html

He demanded that the government should bring one more ordinance to ensure that all farmers will be able to sell their produce on Minimum Support Price and that action will be taken against the purchaser if the food grains are brought below MSP.The Congress leader has also demanded an emergency assembly session to discuss the ordinances and its impact on farmers. He said the government should also withdraw the cases registered against farmers for protesting at Kurukshetra’s Pipli.“We will meet Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya soon to demand a special session of the state assembly on this issue. We want that the issue, which is critical for farmers, be discussed threadbare,” Hooda, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly, told reporters.“Imposing the three farm sector bills, introduced in Parliament to ratify the three ordinances promulgated earlier without the consent of farmers, will amount to dictatorship,” he said. Hooda said his party will oppose a “forcible” implementation of the laws. “The party is ready to launch a mass movement on this,” he added.Hooda claimed that if the government continued to “force its decisions” on farmers, the “black laws” will be “abolished as soon as the Congress government is formed in the state”.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-to-seek-special-session-of-haryana-assembly-over-farm-bills-bhupinder-singh-hooda/story-yxucnZfoMC3XgewleixGwN.html

The examination for final year students began on Tuesday and students are paying extra money to stay in paying guest (PG) accommodations and other places outside the campus.The varsity had issued an order on September 12 stating that the students will be allowed to enter the hostel a day before the commencement of the examination. “The students opting for hostels will have to vacate them after the examination. The students will have to give an undertaking that none of their family members was infected from Covid-19. If any student was found infected, he/she will have to vacate the hostel immediately. Mess facility will not be given and students should arrange their food themselves,” the order issued by dean academic affairs Nina Singh had stated.Sanjay Kumar, a MSC Chemistry final year student from Palwal, said he reached MDU premises for his final year examination and asked his teachers about the hostel facility. “The teachers told me to contact the hostel warden, who refused to provide the room to me and many others. My two friends and I had to pay Rs 2,500 each to get a paying guest accommodation for five days,” he said“Social distancing norms can be implemented only because nearly 200 students are appearing in the examination and the varsity has 10 hostels,” he added.Another student, Manoj Kumar studying MSC Chemistry, said he travelled over 200km from Sirsa to appear in the final year examination. “Our teachers told us that hostel facilities will be provided to students during examination and even the varsity authorities had issued an order in this regard. However, the authorities refused to provide us an accommodation and instead told us to opt for online examination,” he added.A female student, pleading anonymity, said she visited the campus on September 14 to get hostel facility. “My warden refused to provide me a room. I had no option to stay in Rohtak and unfortunately I opted for online examination. This is the only varsity in India which forced its students to vacate hostels amid the pandemic and now has refused to give them a hostel even after issuing an order,” she said.“The varsity has not revoked its decision to provide accommodation facility to students so far. They are only verbally denying the facility,” she added.Randeep Rana, chief warden of MDU, said they had not provided the hostels to students due to fear of spread of Covid-19. “Students will have to stay a week for the examinations and they can manage the accommodation on their own,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mdu-students-a-harried-lot-after-varsity-refuses-hostel-facility-during-exams/story-Yo8QYwbJBGZRVNLBVQkRvK.html
16-09-2020||City||Cracks surface in farmers’ unions in Haryana||: Cracks have started appearing in the unity of farmers’ unions in Haryana as a few of them held demonstrations in favour of the Centre’s three agriculture Bills at some district headquarters of the state while supporters of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU Charuni) continued their protest for the second day on Wednesday.The Delhi Police also detained BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni, who has been spearheading the agitation, for two hours at police station Alipur in outer north district of Delhi while he along with six others were on their way to meet a farmer union leader.Charuni has also reiterated that 17 farmers’ unions protesting under the BKU umbrella stand united against the ordinances.According to Charuni, who had announced to hold the protests in Delhi on Wednesday, the call to hold demonstrations was cancelled due to “the reluctance of Punjab-based farmers’ unions”.“The Punjab-based farmers’ unions should have at least marched up to the inter-state borders and forced the police to arrest them...We had to cancel the Delhi protests because Punjab farmers’ unions said restrictions have been imposed on their movement,” he said.Charuni said farmers owing allegiance to the BKU will continue district-level protests and on September 20 they will block vehicular traffic movement for three hours across the state.“After September 20 demonstrations, we will chalk out our next course of action,” he added.Meanwhile, farmers associated with Pragatisheel Kisan Sangathan, Kisan Utpadan Sangh and Cooperative farmers’ organisation took out a march in support of the Union government in Panipat and a few other districts. They applauded the Centre for giving farmers the option to sell the produce in open market. Earlier, farmers in Panipat also submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner in support of the Bills. “The new laws will ensure that the farmers get direct payment of their produce,” a farmer said. Though the BKU (Charuni) affiliated farmers continued their protest at the district headquarters, the strength of protesters was thin. In Karnal, members of the BKU (Charuni) alleged that the government was trying to divide the farmers. They said the agitation will continue till September 19 and roads will be blocked on September 20. “We will continue our protest as per the schedule until the government withdraws the Bills,” said Harpal Singh Sudhal, state secretary of BKU. Members of BKU (Tikait) are also agitating against the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cracks-surface-in-farmers-unions-in-haryana/story-OTSJJ4TWSLKAd6M66Xy5IN.html

He also condemned both the Congress as well as the Aam Aadmi Party for “teaming up to avoid voting” on the amendments in the Essential Commodities Bill. In a statement, Chandumajra said by taking up the cause of the farmers and farm labourers, the SAD president had made it clear that his party will always ensure that the interests of the farming community are safeguarded at all costs. “We have also made it clear that unlike the Congress party, we do not indulge in doublespeak and don’t play with the sentiments of the farmers by betraying their interests in Parliament,” he said. Chandumajra said the party president spoke with a cross-section of farmers, farmer organisations and agriculture experts as part of an exercise to take their opinion on the central ordinances. He also made it clear that the SAD action should be seen from the prism of the welfare of the farmers of the state. “I want to put it on record that the NDA government has taken a number of pro-Sikh and pro-Punjab steps at the instance of the SAD. However, in case of farm ordinances, the Centre did not hold consultations with the SAD and ignored the reservations expressed by the farming community, forcing the party to take a stand against amendments in the Essential Commodities Act in Parliament.” ‘Capt should apologise to farmers’ The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday said chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh should have apologised to farmers for failing to protect their interests in Parliament. “The CM should have resigned from his post instead of indulging in a roadside drama in a desperate attempt to wash away the anti-farmer tag which would now be attached to his name forever,” said SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema. Cheema said it was ridiculous that at a time when Parliament was in session, the CM was expressing his views on roads here instead of directing his party MPs to express solidarity with the farming community by voting against the ordinances. The SAD leader also snubbed Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann for indulging in “cheap theatrics”, by claiming that no voting took place in Parliament to pass the Essential Commodities Act. “The two-time MP did not even know that Bills were passed through voice vote in Parliament and was mouthing blatant lies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-upheld-its-rich-traditions-by-opposing-ordinances/story-OLA6VStaFVYFOrOTOSMAyN.html
16-09-2020||City||Farmers lift blockadesfrom 3 Majha bridges||AMRITSAR Farmers on Wednesday lifted the blockades on three main bridges of Majha region, taking cognisance of the ‘inconvenience’ they caused to the people. Farmers, however, have announced to intensify their protest against the agriculture ordinances that are being introduced in Parliament to make them laws.Thousands of farmers, under the banner of Kisan Sangharash Committee (KSC), had laid siege to the Harike bridge connecting Majha and Malwa, the Beas bridge on the Amritsar-Delhi highway and the Hargobindpur bridge in Gurdaspur on Monday afternoon.Farmer leaders, while lifting the blockades, said since the Centre appears to be adamant on passing the “anti-farmer” ordinances in Parliament, they will scale up their protest and a decision will be taken in a high-level meeting on Thursday. KSC’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher, who led the protest on Beas bridge, said, “We have lifted the protest, but that doesn’t mean our struggle has finished. Now, the protest will be intensified.”He said, “Our further action plan may include barring the entry of political leaders, especially the Central ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs, in Punjab’s villages. We may also plan to launch rail roko andolan (stir), besides organising long protest marches in all cities and villages of the state.”KSC’s Punjab president Satnam Singh Pannu held responsible both the ruling Congress in Punjab and the BJP’s ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for playing with the sentiments of the state’s farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-lift-blockadesfrom-3-majha-bridges/story-QYSaYx8XxzuzUyVvZuwD8H.html
16-09-2020||City||Cong panel meets governor, Capt warns of social unrest if agri ordinances enacted as laws||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday apprehended that enacting laws on the farm ordinances will lead to unrest in the border state, already a target of Pakistan to foment trouble. He led a delegation of his party to submit a memorandum to governor VP Singh Badnore, seeking his intervention in non-pursuance of the agriculture Bills in Parliament. Flanked by state party chief Sunil Jakhar and other lawmakers, the CM told the governor that the party felt that any move to tinker with the present procurement system may deepen social unrest among the farmers of the state. “It may not be conducive for the peace and development of the region, which faces serious challenges of public order due to a live international border,” he said. Pointing to Pakistan’s bid to disturb the state’s peace and stability through narco-terror and other anti-India acts, the chief minister later told mediapersons outside the Governor House that these anti-farmer legislations will lead to rise in the people’s anger. “Why are we playing into the hands of Pakistan?” he asked. These Bills, one of which has already been passed in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, are against national interest, and particularly detrimental to Punjab, where the majority of the farmers tilled less than 5 acres of land and would be the worst hit, Amarinder said. He said the Centre had failed to take the interest of the farmers into account in introducing these ordinances and instead took a stand in favour of corporate houses. The CM said he had written to the Prime Minister thrice on the issue but had not received any response to far. Taking on the Akalis and Sukhbir Badal over their “theatrics and U-turns” on the issue, the CM pointed out that all, except the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), were on board at the all-party meeting he had convened on the issue. “All were unanimously against the ordinances except the Akalis, who are now pretending to be opposing them,” he said. Terming the passage of one of the Bills in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday a black day in the history of Parliament, Jakhar said that under pressure from the farmer unions, the Akalis may even go to the extent of enacting the drama of resigning from the NDA government but it will be another farce on its part. The delegation comprised cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, MLAs Rana Gurjit Singh, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Dr Raj Kumar Verka and PPCC secretary Capt Sandeep Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-panel-meets-governor-capt-warns-of-social-unrest-if-agri-ordinances-enacted-as-laws/story-IQKf47ylB925aQQ1zo1QOI.html

The survey which started in August this year has found 1,248 malnourished kids in the rural areas of Pune which was close to 2,500 during the last survey conducted eight months ago. This survey was conducted among children six years of age and below. An official who was part of the survey said, “Due to the lockdown, children are not coming to the anganwadi and so we are providing dry ration under the government schemes. We have surveyed children for their height, weight and developmental outcomes and based on the result they are categorised into underweight or malnourished and the ration is provided according to the needs of the child.” A total of 3,20,608 children are registered at anganwadis who are surveyed under the malnourishment scheme out of which 2,84,461 could be examined of which 2,71,104 were found healthy, 10,763 were medium underweight, 1,346 are severely underweight and 1,248 were found malnourished; 197 severely malnourished and 1051 mild malnourished. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of Zilla Parishad said, “During the survey, we found about 1,248 malnourished kids among the 2.84 lakh kids that we surveyed. We will ensure that no child is left behind. The children identified through the survey would be medically examined by the community health officers. They shall try to determine if the malnourishment is because of underlying health conditions or is it because of poor nutrition. Under the VCDC programme and take-home ration programme the child would be given concentrated nutrition.” Prasad also added that in the last eight months, the number of severely malnourished children have reduced by half due to intensive nutritional programmes delivered to their homes to increase haemoglobin levels in pregnant women who are anaemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/zp-survey-finds-1-248-malnourished-children-in-pune-district/story-W3qdzTjhyn5SGtK1Qzp74K.html

The survey, part of a state-wide campaign, will screen all citizens for flu-like symptoms and also spread information to clear rumours in order to identify suspected patients of Covid. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We will kick start the mission which will include surveying every household and every citizen. We will have teams with pulse oximeter and thermometer. The approach now will be Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and or any active flu-like symptoms, especially among comorbid people.” According to the administration, educational institutions have been identified for involving students in the survey. “We have got commitments from various educational institutions wherein college students will be roped in to reach out over 50,000 citizens living in Pune city and we will also take help from religious leaders and political leaders to spread the word and encourage people to come forward. This time will become more community-driven and administrative supportive. With the support of people from NGOs, political parties and religious leaders, we will be able to efficiently complete the survey,” said Rao. The Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations have already carried out door to door survey in urban parts of the district. The state government has now launched this scheme across the state and so the survey will now be restarted. Every team will have a thermometer and an oximeter will be given and for every ten families, there will be one supervisor. BOX Nitrogen tankers to supply oxygen To ensure of the supply of oxygen in nearby districts too so that the patients do not load onto city beds, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that now with permission, we will be able to supply to use nitrogen tankers to supply oxygen to overcome the shortage of tankers. He said, “We will need to increase testing even among suspected patients who might increase positivity rate of the district but it will be necessary to do so to break the chain.” The district has now reached up to one lakh tests per ten lakh. Every district will now be ranked as per their testing, mortality rate number of comorbid, SARI, ILI or flu-like symptoms patients found for per thousand under the new scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/admin-to-rope-in-college-students-and-religious-leaders-for-door-to-door-survey/story-GhpqEF9GzUQDdyq8c7CrKO.html

Under this program, every person from a hotspot would be screened and if required tested to ensure early isolation to break the chain. The district administration till date screened close to 1.68 lakh people, of whom only 442 were found positive. This indicates that the containment measures have worked in rural Pune, claims the administration. There are 98 hotspots spread across 98 gram panchayats. In the 1,405 gram panchayats included in rural Pune, there are 23 hotspots. A total of 21 gram panchayats and two municipal councils were screened. In total, 1,68,448 people were screened, of whom 2,730 were suspected and tested for the Covid-19 infection. Of these, 442 tested Covid-19 positive. The administration claims that this indicates that containment measures in these hotspots are working. The survey was conducted from September 8 to September 13. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “These are the people who would have gone unnoticed if we did not detect them in the house-to-house survey. They were not aware that they are infected or could have possibly come in contact with someone. This also indicates that there is no widespread of the infection even in the hotspots in rural Pune.” Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad, who is at the forefront of the initiative, said, “The credit goes to Asha workers who have made sure that every person is screened and detected as soon as possible. These hotspots are mainly located in Chakan, Hinjewadi and Wagholi, along the highways, or along the city area. We identify people through multiple government lists including election list, Anganwadi list and school list. We also mark on the nail of the people who have been screened. In addition to checking temperature levels and oxygen saturation levels, we also carry out simple tests like lack of taste or smell using household items and then refer them for further inspection if required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/my-family-my-responsibility-campaign-claims-covid-not-widespread-in-rural-pune/story-elLvpJMiu4Ksh0f8sPZp8M.html

The estimated period for completion of this tunnel was less than six years but it was completed in 10 years,” chief engineer KP Purushothaman said. “There are CCTV cameras at every 60 metres and emergency exit tunnels at every 500 metres inside the tunnel. The tunnel will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46km and four hours can be saved,” he said. Fire hydrants have also been installed inside the tunnel in case of any fire incident. “The induction and de-induction of resources was a difficult task while it was under construction. We did face a lot of challenges but together we were able to complete its construction. The tunnel is 10.5 metres wide, including a 1-metre footpath on both sides,” he said. Atal Tunnel project director Colonel Parikshit Mehra said that many experts working within the team were of the opinion that the alignment of the tunnel should be changed. “We have had this dream to connect Leh and this was the first step to the connectivity ladder. This tunnel was a challenging project because we were working from two ends. The other end was in North, across the Rohtang Pass which was accessible only for five months in a year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/world-s-longest-highway-tunnel-above-10-000-feet-connecting-manali-with-leh-ready-after-10-years/story-BvCFxuzGa1kGZdY0ZT5i8M.html

16-09-2020||City||Agra’s Mughal museum to house Braj artefacts as well: Official||Agra’s under-construction Mughal museum, which will be named after Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, will house artefacts from Braj region of Uttar Pradesh as well, a senior government official said here on Wednesday. “The Braj region comes under Agra division. Braj region and Agra division will be included in the museum and work will be done in a speedy manner,” additional chief secretary (home and information) Awanish Awasthi said. Also read: Taj Mahal’s reopening to give Agra’s marble trade a new lease of lifeBraj, also known as Brij or Brijbhoomi, is the region around Mathura-Vrindavan and is considered to be the land of Lord Krishna. The area stretches from Mathura, Jalesar, Agra, Hathras and Aligarh to Etah, Mainpuri and Farrukhabad districts. On Monday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced that the museum would be named after Chhatrapati Shivaji. However, former chief secretary of the state Alok Ranjan claimed that Braj was anyway part of the initial plan conceptualised in 2015. He said the project was conceptualised in 2015 and it was to be completed in 2017-18. “An interpretation centre is built there (in Agra). It consists of videos, books and audios about Taj Mahal and other monuments. It also houses the art and craft of the local area. The local art, culture and heritage is available to the foreign tourists in their language. There were stalls of art and craft of Agra as well as the Braj area. A very good complex had come up,” he said. Asked if Braj was included in the initial plan itself, Ranjan said, “I think it was.” He said the basic objective behind planning the museum was to earn more revenue for Agra. “Tourists come from Delhi, visit Agra and go back. As a result, the hotel industry, restaurants, shops, craftsmen don’t earn any revenue,” Ranjan, a 1978-batch IAS officer, added. “More revenue will be generated if people spent a night in Agra. For a night halt, the attractions will have to be increased. How long will people keep watching the Taj Mahal? Certain things were thought of and we developed the entire area around the Taj Mahal...We built an interpretation centre, art and crafts centre on the lines of monuments abroad, cobble-stone pathways, antique lighting. One part of it was also to develop the Mughal museum. The idea was to reflect the Mughal history, their lifestyle and culture of that period, along with art, literature,” he said. Meanwhile, member of Parliament (MP) from Agra, SP Singh Baghel has expressed gratitude towards Yogi Adityanath for his decision to rename the under-construction Mughal Museum after Shivaji. He said, “As Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj came to Agra Fort, it is being named after him. As Agra’s MP, I welcome this.” Baghel said Agra’s history was not just Mughal history. “When there is a museum, Mughal emperors will be mentioned, we will not remove them,” he said, adding, “but when foreign tourists come, we cannot tell them that there were only Mughals here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agra-s-mughal-museum-to-house-braj-artefacts-as-well-official/story-OjiBtThVHGCmMzI2h3WeHL.html

Measures are being taken to contain the spread of the disease, government officials said. The animal husbandry department and Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University, Jabalpur, has ordered isolation of infected bovines for 12-14 days and also put a ban on their inter-state and intra-state transportation, as per officials. Animal husbandry department’s additional chief secretary, JN Kansotia, said, “Spread of the virus was limited to some districts but we have issued instructions to district officers of animal husbandry department of all the districts to contain the disease.”Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University, Jabalpur, dean RK Sharma said, “The disease is spreading very fast due to four main factors- contact, secretion of dung and urine, flies and mating with affected bovines. Isolation and proper medication are the only ways to contain the disease.” “The first case was reported in Anuppur in the second week of August when some cows showed the symptoms of the viral disease. The tested samples from Anuppur confirmed the presence of the virus from family Poxviridae which causes lumpy skin disease,” said PK Solnaki, a senior veterinary surgeon of animal husbandry department, appointed as nodal officer for disease containment efforts. “In just one week, we came to know that it had spread to at least six districts. In less than one month, it spread to more than 10 districts and affected over 15,000 cattle-- mainly domestic. The worst affected district is Balaghat where 8700 cases were reported,” said Solanki. “The local municipal bodies and panchayat officials of all the 52 districts have been asked to remain on alert and ensure isolation of stray cows if found infected. Owners of bovines have been asked to make a separate shed for infected ones and not leave the infected ones for grazing in an open ground,” said the officer. Also Read: MP assembly session truncated to one day; minimum number of MLAs to attend Solanki says that the ban on organising animal fairs, which were on hold due to Covid-19, will continue for the next two months. The bovine owners have also been asked to mate their animals only after testing. To create awareness among people and to provide medicines to infected bovines, camps are being organized in more than 500 villages of 10 districts of east and south east of MP, said JN Kansotia.

In 2019, the first known LSD infection in India was reported from Odisha. The disease then reached MP from Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. It normally spreads through insects or ticks. “The disease has a very rare chance of mortality but the morbidity rate is very high. It causes secretion of milk in affected cows and buffalos. There is no report of transmission of the disease from animals to humans so far,” said RK Sharma, dean of the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/lumpy-skin-diseases-infects-over-15-000-cattle-in-mp/story-xLqY3jofha1MvZdGBZ0U0O.html
16-09-2020||Pune||Study shows at least 99% of surveyed sex workers in Pune in search of alternative livelihood||At least 99 per cent of sex workers living in Pune want to take up alternative means of livelihood, if given an opportunity, reveals a study conducted by the Asha Care Trust (ACT). The lockdown necessitated due to the Covi-19 pandemic decimated the demand for sex trade forcing these workers to borrow loans for survival. For the study, 300 (around 10%) of sex workers in Budhwar peth were surveyed. According to the survey conducted by ACT, a forum that works towards the welfare of sex workers, at least 85 per cent of the workers have taken loans and 98 per cent of them have taken it from their brothel owners, managers and moneylenders, subjecting themselves to further exploitation. “What is more alarming is that 87 per cent of workers stated that even before the pandemic struck, their incomes were not sufficient to support themselves or their families. Key factors like lack of education and employable skills compel them to depend on one source of income i.e. earning through sex work and remain trapped in the vicious circle. Majority of the workers now want to explore alternative sources of livelihood,” said Shilpa Shetty, president of ACT. “Covid-19 epidemic has presented us with an opportunity to create a mechanism to rehabilitate sex workers in mainstream society. Our survey suggests almost all of them are looking at alternative sources of livelihood in Budhwar Peth region. For the women who opt-out of sex work, trafficking victim relief fund should be provided to help them pay-off their debt and get started with a new chapter,” she added. A delegation led by Asha Care Trust along with representatives of other organisations including, Shailesh Badhai from Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samiti; Yogesh Bhokre of Maharashtra Itak Kamgar Sangathana; social worker Pratibha Shinde; Fayyaz sheikh of Pune Jilha Grahak Sanrakshan Samiti, Bhola Vanjale and avocate Vidya Pedankar met Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Monday and submitted the survey report. The delegation also requested quick action supporting the findings of the study. Shetty said, “The meeting was good and the mayor gave us a very positive response. We are very hopeful that the district administration will help us in this regard. We also plan to meet other district and state level decision makers to help them take the initiative forward and provide requisite support to the sex workers in this difficult time.” Tejaswi Sevekari, director of Saheli NGO, which works for sex workers, said, “The condition of the sex workers during the lockdown and now is not good. The income has stopped and they are definitely is search of alternative sources of income. If such initiatives are been taken of doing the survey or helping these women, then Pune Municipal Corporation and the state government should consider this issue prominently. Without the support and help of the government, nothing substantial can be done.”Key highlights of the survey report: 82% of the workers fall in the age group of 25 to 45 years. Some of them were forced into the trade when they were minors. While 84% of the sex workers have not had any formal education and the rest 16% were pushed into the trade even before they finished high school. Also, 92.7% stated that they fear resuming sex work, but are also crippled with the fear of starvation. Harassment from brothel managers has led them to worry about their daily bread and butter. While 68% believe that the sex trade will pick up in the days to come, 99% stated that they will take up any alternative livelihood option, if given an opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/study-shows-at-least-99-of-surveyed-sex-workers-in-pune-in-search-of-alternative-livelihood/story-EOwSUHBUtpMfQLZa7ZzizH.html

Promotion does not come without a change in designation commensurate to the pay scale.”These doctors are among those dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayKumar said a government panel in 2016 agreed to DACP with elevation in rank and pay for doctors. “The government accepted its recommendations in toto. Yet, the health department has not been giving us promotion in rank...”Kumar said 3,000 positions are vacant from the first promotion level—senior medical officer to director-in-chief —because the department has not promoted doctors for 24 years. “The total vacancy of doctors will add up to 5,000 if the 2,000-odd positions at GDMO [general duty medical officer] and specialist level are taken into account despite the recent appointment of 4,100 doctors.”Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit was unavailable for comments.An officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there are human resources issues in the department. “Rules have been overlooked and standard norms of executive business bypassed, as the lower level staff held sway. This has been happening for long, leading to a disgruntled workforce of doctors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/doctors-unhappy-as-bihar-promotes-them-without-ranks/story-8cNy52dJ5M2RHUe2uCzg4I.html

16-09-2020||City||Ex-cricketer Bhupinder Singh Senior alleges scam in PCA||Former cricketer and selector Bhupinder Singh Senior has alleged major discrepancies in the functioning of the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA). Addressing a press conference in Ludhiana on Tuesday, the former cricketer alleged that the funds released by PCA, in favour of the Patiala District Cricket Association, its registered affiliate, were siphoned off to a family-owned trust -- Patiala Cricket Association-- which was a “huge financial scam”. He added that two office-bearers of PCA allegedly managed disbursement of funds in the name of Patiala Cricket Association by manipulating the records. PCA receives grants under various heads from Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to ensure that the same is spent for the betterment of the game of cricket in the state. “Instead of spending the funds for the improvement of the game, they were illegally transferring it to their family trust which was formed in 1988,” he alleged.“Since 1988, the above mentioned persons have been embezzling funds to their family trust by misleading everyone and claiming it to be a registered society. As a result, they have accumulated over crores in the bank account. When questions were raised regarding this trust, the members of Patiala Cricket Association had answered in writing to the apex council that they had changed the name of Patiala District Cricket Association to Patiala Cricket Association in 1995,” he said. He also alleged that the aforesaid persons had illegally occupied provincial government land in 1988 under the name of Patiala Cricket Association by preparing false documents in conspiracy with other unknown persons. Bhupinder Singh Senior further questioned that if the name of Patiala District Cricket Association was changed in 1995, then how did the family trust acquire the land in 1988 under the name of Patiala Cricket Association. Former cricketer Rakesh Handa also raised objections over the appointment of PCA secretary Puneet Bali, alleging that the latter had submitted incorrect information at the time of filing his nomination papers and claimed to be a ‘representative’ from Ropar district cricket association, Roopnagar. When contacted, Puneet Bali refuted the allegations. He said that there are no discrepancies at all in the PCA. “The PCA body is following all norms and constitution and working for the benefit of cricketers,” he said, adding, ”Some persons want to defame the body for the reason better known to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-cricketer-bhupinder-singh-senior-alleges-scam-in-pca/story-M0B8ju3G0EDqfHTzYU4oJN.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Activists’ press conference condemns Umar Khalid’s arrest||A group of civil society activists on Wednesday condemned the Delhi Police’s arrest of student activist Umar Khalid under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA) Act, 2019, calling it an “inquisition of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 protests” and a “witch-hunt against young minds”.Khalid has been arrested for his alleged role in orchestrating the north-east riots in Delhi in February, which had claimed 53 lives and injured over 400 people.The press conference was attended by former member of the Planning Commission Syeda Hameed; Supreme Court (SC) lawyer Prashant Bhushan; Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation, or CPI (ML), leader Kavita Krishnan; senior journalist Pamela Philipose; and former Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president Nandita Narain.Also Read: Umar Khalid in 10-day custody, police to show him 1.1mn pages of dataCommunist Party of India (CPI) leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who was also a speaker and had been arrested along with Khalid in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) sedition case in 2016, could not attend the event. However, he released a statement on social media. “Questions must be raised over the investigation of Delhi riots as the purpose of this probe is not to ensure justice but to take political revenge,” Kumar said. He demanded questioning of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, who had “incited the riots”.Those present at the gathering, including Khalid’s mother and civil society activist Harsh Mander, wore masks with faces of other arrested student activists to show solidarity and also held placards of their names. The organisers played a pre-recorded video of Khalid before his arrest.Also Read: Why no action against ruling party leaders, ask former top cops“I gave a 17-minute speech out of which 20-30 seconds is being made viral stating that I conspired in the north-east Delhi riots. The part, where I had talked about satyagraha, is nowhere to be heard. The ones who spoke up are being put behind bars but my message to everyone is that one must not be scared and speak out against injustice,” he said in the video.Bhushan said, “Police said that the members of a WhatsApp group, organised with the objective to support the exemplary peaceful [anti-CAA] protests, are conspirators. But people like Kapil Mishra, who were instigating violence by saying ‘goli maro’, did not face any action.”Mishra, who had denied allegations of his involvement in the riots, on Monday released a video congratulating Delhi Police for arresting Khalid and “people like him”, and likened the February riots to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Also Read: Umar Khalid’s arrest: Activists, academicians, politicians express solidarity, call it a ‘witch-hunt’Bhushan alleged that the Delhi Police was indulging in “criminal conspiracy” in the name of investigation. “In the name of investigation, the Delhi Police is indulging in criminal conspiracy to frame innocent people who were protesting peacefully against an unconstitutional law. It is a conspiracy to let off those against whom unimpeachable evidence is available to show their involvement in these riots. Some of us wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind a few days ago that there needs to be a commission of inquiry (CoI) into the investigation by the Delhi Police itself as it had happened during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots,” he said.“We have gathered here today to express our collective anguish at the sheer brazenness with which the Delhi Police has turned the investigation into the February violence in the national capital into an inquisition of the anti-CAA protests,” the attendees said in a statement.“We demand an immediate end to this outrageous investigation that is being conducted with prejudice and mala fide intent. We demand that activists booked under the UAPAA be immediately released; and a judicial enquiry commission be constituted to punish the real culprits and ensure justice for Delhi violence,” it added.Delhi Police had contended that an examination of witnesses revealed that Khalid was coordinating between protest sites in Delhi in connivance with other arrested accused. Delhi Police had claimed that Khalid, along with some other prominent anti-CAA protesters, had used the protest sites to plan and orchestrate the riots.Delhi Police has argued almost an equal number of Hindu and Muslims rioters were booked and it is conducting a ‘free and fair investigation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-activists-press-conference-condemns-umar-khalid-s-arrest/story-ytYu7ObphVAfGM6yzaM3YO.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Man who duped over 2,500 by offering phones on easy installments held||A man (32) has been arrested from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh (UP) for allegedly using fake websites to con unsuspecting public by offering cheap mobile phones on easy equated monthly installments (EMIs), Delhi Police said on Wednesday. Two mobile phones that were used in the crime were seized from the accused, while his two associates are still absconding, the police said. Also read: Using demonetisation ruse, man, 55, cheats Delhi trader of Rs 2 lakhJitender Singh, who holds an undergraduate degree in computer applications, has reportedly confessed to his alleged crime. He along with his two accomplices had duped more than 2,500 people across the country in the past two years using fake websites and luring his gullible victims with cheap mobile phones and easy EMIs, said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (south-east), Delhi Police. “We are verifying his claims of cheating over 2,500 people. The bank accounts that the fraudsters used are being examined to ascertain the money transactions related to the scam. We have arrested Singh in one case that was being investigated by our district’s cyber cell team since January,” said DCP Meena. An investigating officer (IO), who did not want to be named, said that initial analysis of one bank account has reflected around five deposits made by the victims for buying cheap mobile phones. “We will approach the depositors to know whether they had filed any police complaints regarding the cheating. Singh has told us that his gang used to dupe two or three persons daily,” the officer added. DCP Meena explained the gang’s modus operandi.The fraudsters would create fake websites, where they promised mobile phones on rates cheaper than available market prices and also offered easy EMIs. They would dupe a certain number of people and then deactivate the website. They would choose a new domain name for the website in a bid to avoid refund or delivery demands of the purchased mobile phones by their duped victims.“They used to charge between Rs 1,999 and Rs 7,999 for each mobile phone. The prices were deliberately kept low in a bid to ensure that the victims would not approach police even after being conned. They only accepted payment through a virtual payment address (VPA) mechanism to make the detection of a financial transaction difficult,” added Meena. On January 9, the DCP said, one Irfan Pathan filed a case at Govindpuri police station in south Delhi regarding a similar fraud.Pathan alleged that last December while surfing online to buy a mobile phone, he came across a website that promised phones on cheaper rates and also offered easy EMIs. “An executive of the website tricked him into depositing R 5,998 in three EMIs through a VPA. However, the fraudsters neither delivered the phone nor returned the amount. They deactivated the website and all their contact numbers. Pathan filed a complaint at Govindpuri police station in January after he was defrauded,” said Meena. During the probe, the police collected details of the phone numbers that were linked to the website and were used to contact Pathan. The call details of one phone number revealed that it was registered with an e-commerce payment system site and a bank account in the name of one Rajat Shukla. The details of the alleged VPA used by the fraudsters were obtained from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It was found that the VPA was registered with Shukla’s bank account through which the money was transferred to another account opened in the name of accused Singh, said the DCP. “We arrested Singh from his home in Ghaziabad and seized two mobile phones used in the crime. Singh disclosed that Shukla and Praveen Kumar were his partners in crime,” said Meena.“Raids are in progress to arrest the two absconding suspects,” the DCP added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-conman-who-duped-over-2-500-by-offerings-phones-on-easy-installments-held/story-CVu3Y3G4AutuGZryd2TUnI.html

On the last date of the hearing, the court did away with the provision of asymptomatic persons having to produce a prescription for Covid-19 tests. The bench also asked the Delhi government to put up maps of testing centres at Metro stations.On Wednesday, the bench expressed its displeasure over the low number of RT-PCR tests conducted between September 8 and September 15, compared to the number of rapid antigen tests (RAT). It posed a query to advocate Satyakam, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, as to why the rapid antigen tests were still being conducted when their accuracy is about 60%.It said that more RT-PCR tests should be conducted because they are more accurate.Also Read: Substance use disorders linked to Covid-19 susceptibility“Having regards to the fact that results of the RAT tests are 60% false-negative leaving a great doubt on the infection in asymptomatic persons, we are of the view that RT-PCR should be increased.

It asked the committee to file a report and posted the matter for further hearing on September 30.During the proceedings, Directorate General of Health Services Nutan Mundeja told the court that they have started mobile testing facilities in a few Metro stations. In an affidavit, the government also told the court that 79 mobile teams are active in the city.

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM announces withdrawal of FIRs against protesting farmers||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday appealed to farmers not to stop traffic or violate Section 144 of the CrPC in the state over the agriculture Bills, but made it clear that no cases would be registered against them for violation of prohibitory orders as they were fighting for their lives. “FIRs already registered against farmers protesting in violation of Section 144 would be withdrawn,” Capt Amarinder Singh told mediapersons outside Punjab Raj Bhawan after submitting a memorandum against the anti-farmer Bills on behalf of the Punjab Congress. “The farmers are violating the law as the ordinances will ruin them and their families,” he said in response to a question. The state Congress and his government are with the farmers, the chief minister said. “The ordinances would pave the way for ending the minimum support price (MSP) regime,” he added. Captain Amarinder urged the farmers to take their protests to Delhi, at the doorstep of the central government, and assured them that the Congress would stand with them in their fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-announces-withdrawal-of-firs-against-protesting-farmers/story-XygKfcwV16rSZ3S7MsHWDJ.html
16-09-2020||Education||Two govt schools open on trial basis; Haryana may adopt formula for higher classes||Karnal/Rohtak: Two government schools in Haryana’s Karnal and Sonepat divided students into groups as per colour codes to help them and their teachers maintain social distancing when they opened on a trial basis for two days last week as per the Centre’s Covid-19 Standard Operating Procedures. The trial involved groups of 20 students each.The Centre’s Unlock 4 guidelines issued late month to ease the restrictions imposed in March to check the pandemic spread allowed students of classes 9 to 12 to return to schools on a voluntary basis from September 21 to seek academic guidance. Schools across the country were shut and exams suspended as part of measures to deal with the pandemic in March.“We adopted this [colour-coding] formula when the school opened for three hours and over 70 students of Class 12 attended the school,” said Karnal school principal, Dharampal. He added the students were divided into four bubbles or groups, and given coloured masks and badges as per the colour of their groups. He said their benches were also colour marked for identification in separate classes. Dharampal said the formula worked well.The teachers were instructed not to share books, chalks, and dusters with the other teachers and students. Also, the school authorities modified the toilets and pedals were installed to control water taps.An education department official said students were not allowed to interact with their schoolmates in other groups.The state education department has decided to adopt this formula as it is planning to reopen schools for Class 9 to 12 students.A second official, who did not wish to be named, said the two schools were reopened to check whether they are prepared to restart classes. “We have received videos of students during their trial classes. A team of experts from the school education and health departments will access the videos and check the loopholes. If all the safety protocols were followed, we will send these videos to other schools, otherwise, we will discuss with experts what other steps should be taken to maintain safety standards.”The second official said they got the bubble system idea from schools in the UK and other European countries.Chand Kishor, the headmaster of the Sonepat school, said 40 students of Class 10 returned to the school. “We divided them into two groups and students wore assigned bubble colour code and ribbons on their sleeves. The same colour code was used for the roll numbers and names pasted on their desks. Students brought their food and water bottles. A five-minute break was given after 40-minute class. One student was allowed at a time to go to the toilet...” He said they are confident that they will be able to run the school if the government gives them the go-ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/two-govt-schools-open-on-trial-basis-haryana-may-adopt-formula-for-higher-classes/story-CTrKgyOMOkyz7fJzUZBdkO.html
16-09-2020||City||SIT formed to ‘probe’ interfaith marriages in Kanpur||The Uttar Pradesh police have formed a nine-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe cases of interfaith marriages in Kanpur, inspector general Mohit Agarwal said. Agarwal said the SIT has been given 10 days to complete the probe after a woman’s family claimed she was a victim of “love jihad”.Radical Hindu groups have popularised the term “love jihad”, which they use to describe what they believe is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriage. In February, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy told Parliament the term “love jihad” is not defined under the laws and no such case has been reported by any central agency.The SIT probe has been ordered even as the woman recorded her statement in Delhi’s Tis Hazari court, saying she married on her own volition. The case fell flat but the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) joined the family in staging a demonstration in Kidwai Nagar alleging a pattern in five interfaith marriages. As of now, the SIT has 15 such cases to look into.“There is a new case every day; the investigation clearly cannot be completed in 10 days. It will need more time,” said Kanpur (South) police superintendent Deepak Bhuker.Circle officer Vikas Pandey will lead the SIT and look into the 15 cases of interreligious marriage. “The investigation entails collecting information on couples, recording the statements of their family members, checking call records of Muslim youths, their bank account statements,” said Pandey.Agarwal said apart from tracing any links between the Muslims involved in such cases, the probe team would explore the conspiracy angle and look at whether the men were receiving overseas funding.The SIT is collecting details from the police stations from where the cases were reported. Deen Dayal Gaur, a local VHP functionary, said the organisation’s representatives met Agarwal and sought the probe because they felt these cases were not merely about love. “They are a result of a well-hatched conspiracy to target the Hindu girls; most of them are minor as per our inputs,” he said.“We demand a comprehensive probe to expose this conspiracy and funding from overseas. Love does not see caste and religion but as it is turning out there is a pattern, which would lead to communal disharmony.”The SIT is also pursuing the case of a Muslim man, who allegedly adopted a Hindu identity, and allegedly abused a minor after renting a room in her house. Station house officer Kunj Bihari Mishra said the man has been arrested on charges of rape. Police said they have recovered two Aadhaar cards, one in his original name and the other based on the fake identity, from him. The girl, in her statement before a local court, has maintained she was duped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sit-formed-to-probe-cases-of-interfaith-marriages-in-kanpur/story-aXZD04aH4DKAShSynu6YyL.html
16-09-2020||City||Uttarakhand village boy’s journey from being a porter to PhD scholar||The life of Virendra Rana (35), who belongs to a tiny hamlet Lata in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district, has come full circle. At 18, he had worked as a part-time porter and guide for six scientists, who were involved in a field project in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve that proved to be a turning point in his impoverished existence.The fleeting experience stood him in good stead as he ended up pursuing a doctor of philosophy (Ph.D) degree on the Himalayan glaciers under one of the six scientists in Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna(HNB) Garhwal Central University, Srinagar, in Uttarakhand’s Pauri Garhwal district, followed by post-doctoral researches in the country’s premier institutes such as Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)- Kharagpur and the Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The field researchers had fired Ram’s imagination to attain the academic goal of a Ph.D on Nanda Devi glaciers. At present, he is doing a post-doctoral research from BHU. Rana, who belongs to a humble background, is the second among five siblings and his father is a retired havildar of the Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP).Rana grew up in the lap of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve as his native village Lata is located there. The reserve is also the natural habitat for the famous Valley of Flowers. The summer of 2003 changed the course of Rana’s life, who as a teenager used to work as a part-time porter and guide to tide over the family’s financial hardships.“I was in the first year of my undergraduate course that summer (in 2003). I was only 18. During summer vacations, I used to work as a part-time porter and guide to earn my pocket expenses and to support the family. I had joined a team of six scientists who needed porters to carry their luggage up the mountains in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. The expedition changed my life forever,” said Rana while speaking over the phone from Varanasi. Rana recalled that he was particularly attached to one of the scientists from the group -- MPS Bisht, who is currently the director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre. “I curiously watched Bisht sir picking up some stones on the way and explaining to his two students, who were accompanying him. Though I had enrolled for a Bachelor in Science (B.Sc) degree in geology, I had no clue what he was talking about. However, his actions caught my attention. I used to listen to him attentively whenever he used to explain anything to his two students,” Rana reminisced. He said while trekking they took a halt during which Bisht asked him about his education and family background after spotting his keen interest. “I told him during our brief conversation that I belong to a family with limited financial means. I was pursuing my undergraduate studies in geology from a government degree college in Gopeshwar. Soon, our interactions became more frequent and we kept in constant touch,” he said.He got a call from Bisht about his future academic plans following his completion of the B.Sc degree in geology in 2005.“In 2005, Bisht sir was a professor of geology in HNB Garhwal Central University. He got me enrolled in the university, from where I completed my postgraduate degree in 2007. I was fortunate that he helped a poor village lad like me to realise my dreams,” Rana said. During his postgraduate course, Bisht would ask Rana to accompany him on trips to the Himalayas, especially in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve. On one such trips, where Bisht was working on a project on the Valley of Flowers approved by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), he adviced Rana to pursue his Ph.D on the Nanda Devi glaciers. “I readily agreed to his proposal, as I had gained the basic knowledge under him on the subject during those field trips. I did my Ph.D. under his able guidance from HNB Garhwal Central University and was awarded the degree in 2014. Then, I went to IIT-Kharagpur the same year for a four-year post-doctoral research programme on Dharwar Craton in Karnataka as a research associate,,” said Rana. “Currently, I am pursuing another research under a fellowship programme of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in BHU, Varanasi,” he said. In retrospect, Rana said his life is full of struggles as he has to take care on all fronts, including farming at his native village because he is the eldest son of the family. “It has been a long and hard struggle. I had to work in fields in my village and help my mother in other household chores,” said Rana, who has been a farm hand since his school days as his father was serving in the ITBP. “Even now, I collect fodder for the cattle and livestock during my annual visit every year to my native place during October-November for a month. The fodder needs to be stocked up ahead of the harsh winter in the hills,” he said. He said his family’s financial conditions have considerably improved since he finished his Ph.D.‘I am thankful to Bisht sir for nurturing my talent and helping me realise my cherished dream,” he added.Bisht recounted how he spotted Rana.“Whenever I used to explain anything to my two students on various geological aspects, he used to listen very attentively, which was unusual for any part-time porter. On that trip, at times, when I would get confused about the spot from where I picked any sample, he would promptly correct me by saying that ‘sir you picked it from there’. That attitude is what got me interested in him,” said Bisht. “Today, I am proud of what he has achieved through his hard work and dedication. I consider him like my eldest son, such is our affinity,” he said. Rana’s hard work and dedication has struck a chord with his mentors in IIT-Kharagpur and BHU. Professor MA Mamtani from IIT-Kharagpur, under whom Rana pursued a four-year research project as a research associate on Dharwar Craton of Karnataka, said, “He was one of the most sincere and hard-working researchers under me in that project.” He added: “He brought an invaluable experience of working in the Himalayas in the project as the terrain is very difficult, as compared to the plains.” Professor Mamtani said that Rana executed every task in a systematic and organised manner with hardly any error. “He had taken the responsibility of managing my laboratory for the project. He didn’t need many instructions. It has been two years since he left the institute, but I still miss such sincerity and dedication in my team,” said Mamtani. His mentor at BHU, Professor HB Srivastava, under whom he is currently pursuing another research project, also lavished praises on him. “I have worked for a significant time in the Himalayas of Uttarakhand. I know how the people from that area. When I came to know that Rana has applied for the research here, I was very happy to welcome him,” said Srivastava. “Also, when I came to know that he hails from a poor family, I decided to support him as much as I can. He is a very nice person and he never shies away from hard work,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttarakhand-village-boy-s-journey-from-being-a-porter-to-phd-scholar/story-ouncbEwGjvGTI3ue3gbjuO.html

16-09-2020||Mumbai||BMC eases restrictions on sealing buildings with Covid-19 cases||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have decided to ease the rules for sealing residential buildings, where coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases have been reported in the city. The new rules will come into effect from Thursday.Instead of sealing these buildings, where viral outbreak cases have been reported, the civic authorities have directed office-bearers of respective housing societies to take more responsibilities in a bid to tackle the spread of the contagion, which has been causing havoc for the past six months in Mumbai.Also Read: Substance use disorders linked to Covid-19 susceptibilityThe new BMC protocol has stated that a building would be sealed if 10, or more Covid-19 positive cases, are found in the premises, especially on more than two floors. A part of the building such as a wing or a floor would be sealed if a single Covid-19 positive case is found or multiple persons are found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the viral disease, in a single household, stated a circular of the new protocol issued by the BMC. ‘However, the final call will be taken by an assistant commissioner, or a ward officer, who is in charge of an administrative ward, or a medical officer of health (MOH) on whether sealing the floor or wing is adequate, or if the entire building needs to be sealed in a bid prevent the spread of Covid-19,” the circular stated. The new BMC protocol fixes the accountability on a residential building’s office-bearers and local civic authorities to ensure social distancing, a ban on entry of outsiders in the sealed area and monitoring the health and ensuring supplies of essential commodities of home quarantined patients. Also Read: Coronavirus study to trial vaccine delivery through inhalersBesides, home quarantined patients’ high-risk contacts will also needed to be monitored by a residential building’s office-bearers.Earlier, the BMC used to seal an entire building, if more than three Covid-19 positive cases were reported. While a floor or a wing was sealed, if less than three cases of the viral outbreak were reported. Initially, when the civic body started sealing neighbourhoods and residential buildings in March and April following the viral outbreak, it had stipulated that even if one person from the building premises was found to have tested Covid-19 positive, then the entire premises would be sealed.The office-bearers of a residential building have also been directed to ensure that foolproof containment measures are put in place such as a ban on the entry in the sealed area for visitors like maids, vegetable and fruit vendors. Emphasis needs to be laid on online delivery of essential items in a safe and secure manner while complying with all necessary protocols issued by the civic authorities.The home quarantined patients and their high-risk contacts in sealed buildings will have to download Arogya Setu application (app) on their phones in a bid to monitor their movements, ward war room or the BMC’s control room number (1916) should be alerted if patients develop symptoms and the infected persons should be in touch with MOH of a ward on a regular basis. In the BMC-run area, there were 8,763 sealed buildings and 592 containment zones, including slums and chawls, until Monday. While between Sunday and Monday, the civic authorities had tracked down 16, 304 high-risk contacts within a span of 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-eases-restrictions-on-sealing-buildings-with-covid-19-cases/story-aNUpBlEtYGyCtR45VusNeP.html
16-09-2020||City||Milking success: Pulwama emerges as Anand of Kashmir||The day dawns early at Bundzoo village, barely 4km from Pulwama town on the highway to Shopian. Women and youngsters, most of them educated, queue up and wait their turn outside the milk collection centre as Kashmir wakes up to a silent dairy revolution. A hotbed of militancy, Pulwama district is seeing a churn and has emerged as the Anand of Kashmir with dairy cooperatives run by women and youngsters revolutionising milk production in the Valley. Today, there are more than 40 milk collection centres besides vendors and their middlemen who procure milk from every village house for milk plants in Pulwama district. WHERE MILK FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE Last year, official figures show Pulwama produced 31 crore litres of milk, which was supplied across J&K, and in 2017-18, it produced 28.04 crore litres. Every day, 8.5 lakh litres of milk is produced in Pulwama. The abundance motivated entrepreneurs to set up processing units and the district has five big milk plants come up in 12 years. “My unit has a capacity to process 50,000 litres of milk and the venture is running in profit. There is no shortage of milk here. We market and process more than 20,000 litres of milk and milk products every day,” says Shabir Ahmad, the owner of one of the units in Pulwama. “We get all our milk from local villages and our collection vans go everywhere in the district. Earlier, we used to collect milk from house to house, however, the network ended after the 2016 agitation when the Valley remained shut for six months. Now, we have suppliers who bring milk from households across the district,” he says. Sharing the secret behind Pulwama’s dairy revolution, district chief animal husbandry officer Syed Abas says, “The topography of the district is such that it is full of orchards and has vast swathes where fodder is grown. Almost every house has milch cattle. Many educated youngsters have also set up small dairy farms.” Secondly, Abas says, the government provided incentives such as subsidy to buy cows, equipment, tractors, milking machines, milk vans and automatic milk collecting units. Women cooperative societies and self-help groups helped make the milk business a successful venture. SHOPIAN TAKES TO MILK PRODUCTION, TOO Villagers in neighbouring Shopian district have drawn inspiration from Pulwama’s success story. “Most rural families here were into horticulture but they have now shifted to rearing cows and collectively produce three lakh litres of milk a day,” says Muneer Ahmad Quershi, the chief animal husbandry officer of Shopian. “For women, the milk produced by cows generates enough to run their homes and gives them financial independence,” he says. Showkat Hussain Mir, a postgraduate running a successful dairy unit with 20 cows at Pahoo village, 6km from Pulwama, says, “I worked in the private sector before taking a loan to set up this dairy farm last year. Today, I get more than 200 litres of milk from the dairy that I sell locally and to milk plants. I receive payment from milk plants after every 10 days. I plan to expand the business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/milking-success-pulwama-emerges-as-anand-of-kashmir/story-XgvIwCdckTPiEOg9D0YofO.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||13 of 24 Mumbai wards have over 1,000 active Covid-19 cases||As Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases increase, 13 of 24 administrative wards in the city have recorded over 1,000 active cases, of which four wards have recorded over 1,500. Nine other wards have recorded over 500 active cases, while the R Central ward of Borivali has recorded over 2,000 active cases. The current situation is a cause of concern for the civic administration as only two of the 24 wards,the R South ward and the R Central ward (Kandivali West and Borivali West), had recorded over 1,000 active cases just a month ago in the second week of August. The number of active cases is calculated after deducting the number of recovered and dead patients from the number of infected persons. According to official figures, until Monday, there were 26,710 active cases. On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 30,938 active cases. Also Read: Coronavirus study to trial vaccine delivery through inhalersThe worst-affected wards continue to be suburban wards in Borivali, Dahisar, Malad, Andheri, Mulund and Bhandup. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained these wards have a high number of active cases due to their proximity to Mumbai’s satellite cities of Navi Mumbai, Thane, Mira Bhayandar, Vasai and Virar, from where a large number of people come to Mumbai every day for work. Many domestic workers and shop owners in these wards also travel from these cities. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the civic public health department said on Sunday, “Two trends we have continued to note are that more cases are coming from high-rises as opposed to slums. And more cases are from the north wards, due to their proximity to Mira Bhayandar, Thane, and the other cities. I visited the north wards on Sunday to take a stock of the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/13-of-24-mumbai-wards-have-over-1-000-active-covid-19-cases/story-Ew7Rt3FwsT5dedpktIXJ9N.html

As a result, there is no fresh supply of tidewater affecting the entire biodiversity of this area.” Pawar said untreated toxic chemicals drained from the dumping ground have been killing fish after regular intervals.Also Read: Covid-19 waste: Maharashtra pollution body asks BMC to enhance abatement measuresMangrove Cell range forest officer Nathuram Kokare said an investigation into the matter would be undertaken.Soil pollution from bio-medical waste and leachate is caused due to excess waste, especially from discarded medicines, and chemicals. Excessive amounts of trace nutrient elements and other elements including heavy metals in soil are harmful to the natural biodiversity of an area.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai generates 5,400 tonnes of solid and approximately 24 tonnes of biomedical waste. Of this, 60% of the waste is sent to Kanjur while the remaining to Deonar.Also Read: Ganga’s water quality improved between 2014 and 2019, experts say pace is slow“We are not dumping any garbage beyond the land [at Kanjur] belonging to us. There is no question of leachate entering the creek area. We are also taking adequate precautions. However, I will ask my team to visit the site, verify what has been happening, and submit a report to me. We have no intention of causing any environmental damage and corrective measures are being taken to see to this,” said BMC’s additional municipal commissioner, Suresh Kakani.Stalin D, a member of the high court-appointed panel, said this is not the first time when aquatic biodiversity has been lost. “Pristine mangrove forests near the Bhandup pumping station start stinking with every high tide. The treatment facility at Kanjurmarg is woefully inadequate... leachate is regularly being leaked into the creek. It has increased much more since the landfill was expanded.”Also Read: Delhi’s ridge board to rule on projects without independent membersScientific waste disposal is undertaken at the 121-hectare Kanjurmarg dumping ground. It is adjacent to the 1,690-hectare sanctuary but has been left out of the proposed eco-sensitive zone (buffer area).Until earlier this year, the sanctuary was spread across 68.5 hectares but the BMC expanded the size of the landfill by acquiring an additional 52.5 hectares. The move was challenged in the high court. The petitioners argued it was done in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone norms and threatened the safety of the sanctuary.The court allowed the expansion in December saying BMC had acquired all necessary clearances. The Supreme Court in February directed the high court to close the issue within three months, and BMC was allowed to begin dumping waste across the entire 121 hectares.“Though Kanjurmarg landfill is actually surrounded by reserved forest. It has been carefully left out of the protected area to make way for solid waste management within an ecologically sensitive zone,” said Stalin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/soil-pollution-from-kanjur-landfill-killing-fish-less-than-500m-from-flamingo-sanctuary/story-D2JTlJsPWYZp3qeBChF6eK.html

Police said the decomposing body of Jyoti Rani, 40, was found wrapped in a blanket on a blood-stained bed at her government accommodation. Her husband, Mandeep Singh, 42, who is absconding, has been booked for murder as well as attempting to kill their 13-year-old son, who was pushed into a canal in Ludhiana district. Their younger son, aged 9, is missing.Mandeep is a teacher at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 47, while Jyoti taught social science at the government school in Karsan, Ram Darbar. The murder came to light when the Ludhiana police accompanied the 13-year-old back to his house after he was rescued from the Neelon canal. Around Tuesday midnight, the Ludhiana police approached their Chandigarh counterparts after the house was found locked from outside. The lock was broken to gain entry into the house as foul smell was coming from inside, and the body was discovered, said Ram Rattan, station house officer (SHO), Sector 17. Preliminary examination revealed injury marks on Jyoti’s head and face. Father pushed me into canal: 13-year-old sonA Class-8 student, the son told police that on September 13, Mandeep asked the two brothers not to go to their mother’s room on the first floor as she had tested positive for Covid-19 and was in isolation. The next day, the accused left for Ludhiana with the two children in his car. After paying obeisance at a gurdwara, Mandeep allegedly gave some medicine to the children, claiming that it would protect them from coronavirus infection, but it made them vomit.Later in the night, Mandeep stopped his car near the Neelon canal, claiming that it had developed a snag. While the younger son was seated on the rear, the father took the 13-year-old towards the canal and before he could figure out anything, he was pushed into it.“I shouted a lot, but there was no one around to help. After flowing along the stream for some distance, I managed to catch hold of a tree branch,” he is reported to have told police.Constable Manpreet Singh of the Ludhiana police told his Chandigarh counterparts that the child was rescued the next day by some people at the Gurdwara Katana Sahib and police were informed. Accused had returned to Chandigarh: CopsMandeep’s mobile phone is switched off, said investigating officials. His last location has been traced to Sector 40 on September 15, indicating that he had returned to the city.Jyoti’s body is kept at the mortuary in Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. The Covid test conducted before the postmortem found her negative. Mandeep belongs to Fatehgarh Sahib while Jyoti was from Nabha in Patiala. People known to the family claimed Mandeep did not interact much with the neighbours or colleagues. In fact, he was not even in touch with his relatives and had not talked to his father for five years. Meanwhile, Sanjeev Singla, principal of the school where Jyoti worked, said: “The news has come as a shock to us. We have lost a good teacher who was also deft at administrative work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/woman-in-home-quarantine-found-murdered-in-heart-of-chandigarh/story-5bS9tJOweXx9zAeE05yVlM.html

Some of these private hospitals have started increasing their non-ventillator beds. However on Tuesday, an association of private healthcare providers said it would move court to seek relief on the Delhi government’s order.“We will be filing a petition in the Delhi high court (HC) for striking down the order. We have also given a representation to the Delhi government and Dr Harshvardhan, Union minister for health and family welfare. The order was suddenly issued without any consultation with us or prior intimation,” said Girdhar Gyani, director-general, Association of Healthcare Providers (India).“Our data showed that the in-patient occupancy in private hospitals, which was just 20% to 25% in April and May, has gone up exponentially. The patients, who had been postponing their surgeries, are no longer willing to wait indefinitely because of the viral outbreak. If 80% ICU beds are reserved, these treatments have to be stopped. What if such a patient gets critical and needs an ICU bed? These are the biggest private hospitals in the city that specialise in surgeries such as transplants. These patients have waited for long and some of their condition may well have turned life threatening. In any big hospital, up to 30% admission happens in the emergency department. Road accident patients and those suffering from trauma, cardiac arrest need immediate medical attention and that cannot be stopped because of Covid-19 treatment,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-hospitals-start-increasing-icu-capacity/story-Mu2wdt28zE49G8CbXwKHBM.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||SDMC fast-tracks scheme, life insurance for contract staff by Sept 30||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to expedite implementation of its scheme of providing life insurance cover to its contractual staff and daily wage workers. In an order released by the civic body earlier this week, the officials have been asked to cover all contractual employees and daily wage workers under the scheme by September 30. The corporation has asked them to obtain consent forms from contractual employees and submit them to the bank partners along with the premium for insurance scheme. Also read: Veggie vendors, locals oppose curbs imposed by south Delhi RWA, file police complaintUnder the scheme, SDMC contractual workers will be provided life insurance of Rs 2 lakh in case of death or accidental death at a premium of Rs 330 per year. This premium amount will be borne by the civic body.The south Delhi civic body, in an order released on September 8, said that officials should ensure 100% coverage of contractual and daily wage employees by September 30. “The progress in enrolment of employees under this scheme has not been satisfactory, despite instructions. To expedite the implementation of this scheme, it is now decided that the department will obtain consent forms from employees and hand them over to the bank providing the insurance, along with the premium amount,” the order said.According to SDMC officials, contractual and daily wage employees of the municipality do not get service benefits such as life insurance. They said that eligible employees of the corporation had to enrol themselves for the scheme but the process was hampered due to coronavirus pandemic and other reasons. “But now the plan has been revived and fast-tracked to ensure that eligible contractual employees get life insurance benefit at the earliest. This will be the first-of-its-kind move by any corporation in the city,” the official said.The scheme was launched by SDMC in November last year with an aim to benefit around 14,000 contractual employees and daily wage workers of the municipality and is applicable for employees up to the age of 55.SDMC had signed an MoU with the State Bank of India (SBI) and Allahabad Bank for the scheme on November 20 last year. Contractual employees include sanitation workers and mosquito breeding checkers.SDMC mayor Anamika Mithilesh said that eligible employees would not have to pay anything to avail the benefits of this life insurance scheme. “The insurance scheme is part of the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana. We are expediting the process to cover all our contractual employees under the scheme by the end of this month,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-to-fast-track-scheme-life-insurance-for-contract-staff-by-sept-30/story-QutEZHlHuqQqcqsBPWHwqO.html

He gave the explanation after the three-day deadline set by the media persons expired on Tuesday. The CM was given the deadline to withdraw his comment on not forgiving the newspapers, whose reports are purportedly trying to confuse the public over the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. He recently made the remark at Sabroom in the state’s South district. “I didn’t hurt anyone in my speech. I am dedicated to work for the interests of people of Tripura, keep them healthy and safe and also prevent them from falling into conspiracies. The people should know the truth. I have always tried to present the truth before them. If the CM of the state doesn’t say anything, then the public will think whatever is being said is true. Propaganda can turn monkeys turn into tigers,” said Deb while explaining his Sabroom speech.Also Read: Tripura HC cites poor treatment facility for Covid-19 patients, seeks report from govt“Duties and responsibilities of such people (media persons) should be understood. We should also introspect whether we are able to carry out our responsibilities properly or there is any shortcoming. Our government also introspects on its actions,” said Deb. However, the media persons are not satisfied with the CM’s explanation. “We are not satisfied with the CM’s explanation. We are going to hold a meeting soon and will decide our future course of action,” said Subal Dey, chairperson of newly-formed Tripura Assembly of Journalists.

16-09-2020||Bhopal||Chhattisgarh minister demands probe in death of tribal man in encounter||Minister for forests, Chhattisgarh, Mohd Akbar wrote to Madhya Pradesh (MP) chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday, demanding a high-level probe into death of a tribal man from Chhattisgarh who was allegedly killed in an anti-Maoist operation by police in Balaghat district of MP on September 6. HT has seen a copy of the letter. A resident of Balsamund village of Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh, Jham Singh Dhurve, 45, was allegedly killed in an encounter with police on Bansbehra area of Kanha tiger reserve of Balaghat district on September 6. Talking to media persons on Tuesday the minister confirmed that he had written to the MP CM on Monday, demanding a probe into the death. The minister states in the letter, “In a preliminary inquiry, Jhalmala police of Kabirdham district in Chhattisgarh have pointed out that MP police allegedly opened unprovoked firing on two tribals in which one of the tribals was killed. I wrote a letter to you (MP CM) in this regard but so far I haven’t received any reply about any action being taken by MP government. It is a very serious matter regarding murder of an innocent tribal and attempt to murder another one.” “Due to no action by MP government on this even after a week of the incident, there is massive resentment in the tribal community in this region”, said Akbar, who is an MLA from Kawardha in Kabirdham district. Talking to media persons, Jham Singh’s son Narendra Singh said, “My father had gone fishing in Kanha Tiger reserve area, which is 5km from my village, with Naim Singh Dhurve on September 6. Naim Singh informed the family that they were returning to the village in the evening when police stopped them. They panicked and started running away. The police personnel opened fire on them. Naim Singh succeeded in saving himself but my father died.” Balaghat’s Baihar constituency MLA Sanjay Uikey also raised questions on the encounter and demanded action against the guilty for “killing an innocent tribal man”. Balghat superintendent of police Abhishek Tiwari said, “We received information regarding movement of two Maoists in Bansbhera area of Kanha Tiger Reserve. Police cordoned off the area. The members of Vistardalam started firing at the police. In reply, the police also fired at them. On September 7, an additional force was called and in the search operation, the body of 45-year-old man was found. Raw food and a rifle were found near his body. Later, the district collector Deepak Arya ordered a magisterial inquiry in the matter.” MP’s director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri said, “It was not a fake encounter. The police took action after receiving information from reliable sources.” Principal secretary to chief minister of MP, Manish Rastogi said, “The claims of the Chhattisgarh minister are baseless. A magisterial inquiry is going on. Any further action in the matter will be taken after the inquiry report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/chhattisgarh-minister-demands-probe-in-death-of-tribal-man-killed-in-encounter/story-5l5Ys6mKPCd4lZr0uU1viO.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||‘Good’ air days over as AQI starts to spike?||After a spell of clean air and several days on which a clear blue sky was visible, seasonal changes and resumption of businesses and commercial activities are leading to meteorological conditions that aren’t favourable to the dispersion of pollutants hanging over Delhi, scientists said. This year, clean air days could be all but over with forecasts showing heavy showers, which help wash away pollutants, are unlikely in the coming days and with the lifting of the 68-day lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, the scientists added. The national capital has recorded “moderate” air quality days (when the air quality index, or AQI, reads 101-200) for a week since September 9, with Tuesday’s AQI standing at 144. In comparison, August recorded four “good” days (when AQI was 0-50) and 27 “satisfactory” days (when AQI was 51-100), as the air quality never slipped to the “moderate” level. “Rain has stopped. Wind speed has reduced. The accumulation of particles in the atmosphere is building up. There are possibly more vehicles (on the road) as services get unlocked. Suspended dust will start increasing as we approach winter,” said Sachin D Ghude, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology who also works on Delhi’s early air quality warning system under the earth sciences ministry. During the lockdown (imposed on March 25), photographs of Himalayan peaks visible from northwestern plains in the absence of pollutants surfaced on social media and became a talking point. The rainy season that followed also helped wash pollutants away. “Every year, just when monsoon starts retreating, we start seeing adverse meteorological conditions for dispersion...This is also the time when crop stubble burning takes place. The air quality in the winter of 2019 was better than that in 2018. It will be very interesting to see what happens this year,” said Sagnik Dey, an associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi. Experts also said the opening of several sectors and an increase of vehicles on the roads, too, have contributed to the shift in air quality. “There are multiple factors that lead to higher pollution levels, including emissions and meteorology. During the initial lockdown period, emissions from industries and vehicles had come down drastically. So, obviously, it improved the air quality. Thereafter, meteorology was also favourable; there were high winds,” said Prashant Gargava, member-secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).According to CPCB data, Delhi did not record a single “good” air day in 2015 and 2016. Two such days were recorded in 2017 (on July 30 and 31) with AQI readings of 43 and 47. There was no good air day in 2018. The next year, two consecutive “good” air days were recorded on August 18 and 19 with AQI readings of 49 on both days. So far, five “good” air days have been recorded this year in the national capital.Delhi also recorded an AQI of 41 on August 31, the lowest since 2015 — the benchmark year from when AQI records are being maintained in the city. And on August 6, one of the days when Delhi residents saw a clear blue sky, the ventilation co-efficient — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed, and one of the factors that determine pollution potential — was around 45,500 m2/s, over three times higher than that on Tuesday. A higher ventilation coefficient means better air quality. It can drop very low in winter when the atmosphere is calm. This year, Delhi residents witnessed several blue sky days. According to experts, molecules in the atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions and blue light gets scattered more than the others because it travels in shorter waves. A clear blue sky is visible in the absence of factors that act as obstacles to this scattering, such as clouds, fog, pollutants and smoke. Although India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said there were no immediate indications of monsoon withdrawal from northwest India, it was unlikely that there will be heavy showers in the coming days. Delhi has so far recorded a rain deficit of 15% in the monsoon.Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said it was not likely to rain anymore in Delhi, except for a very light drizzle on September 18 and 19. “Meteorological conditions are not conducive for dispersion (of pollutants). Vehicles have increased and industries are opening up. It’s unlikely that we will see blue sky days like we saw in August,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/good-air-days-over-as-aqi-starts-to-spike/story-oUkPqabg9TZDqZuhFzVVcO.html

16-09-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan MP questions Covid test at Parliament||Rajasthan MP Hanuman Beniwal has dismissed Covid-19 test done at Parliament as “fake” after it found him to be Covid 19 positive more than a month after he was declared recovered from the disease after successful treatment at a Jaipur hospital in August. To confirm his negative status, the MP got his sample tested again by the Jaipur hospital, which was found to be negative, Beniwal said.Beniwal, MP from Nagaur, gave a sample for testing at Lok Sabha on September 11 and was informed three days later that he had tested positive. The report left Beniwal puzzled since he had already undergone treatment at SMS Hospital in Jaipur after testing positive on July 26 and even completed the 14-day quarantine period after his discharge on August 6. “After learning about my report from LS secretariat, I spoke to doctors at Jaipur who suggested that I get tested again here. I gave my sample and the SMS Hospital report says I am negative,” the MP said. Doctors at SMS Hospital said that he was fit and could even donate plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients, Beniwal added. Also Read: Battle against Covid-19 far from over: Harsh Vardhan in ParliamentHe said between July 26 and Monday, he has tested negative thrice and called the Delhi test fake. “I appeal to Lok Sabha Speaker to probe this. False positive is harmless but imagine if a positive person is sitting in the Parliament because he has falsely been tested negative,” he said. Beniwal is the founder of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), which is supporting National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at Centre. “What pains me more is the fact that despite me being an NDA ally, no one from the government has spoken to me yet to find out about this test fraud,” Beniwal said.

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Industrial Training Institutes to reopen in Punjab on September 21||Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) of Punjab are set to resume classes from September 21 after six months of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a circular issued by the directorate of technical education, administrations of state-run and private ITIs have been directed to make all arrangements for classes in adherence with Covid-19 guidelines. ITIs will be the first educational institutes in the state that will restart classes in the Unlock 4 phase since the lockdown imposed in Punjab on March 22. Last week, the ministry of health and family welfare had allowed the reopening of educational institutes offering skill or entrepreneurship training. Punjab has 347 state-run and privately managed ITIs in which 55,000 students have been enrolled. FOCUS ON PRACTICAL TRAINING, EXAMS IN NOVEMBER Principal secretary, technical education, Anurag Verma said on Wednesday that the focus of the classes will be to impart practical training. After these classes, exams will be held in November that will enable students to join the profession after getting diplomas from their respective institutes. “Every trade comprises 70% curriculum of practical and it will be completed in about 40 days. After a fortnight of the lockdown in Punjab, our instructors started holding virtual classes from mid-April and these remain quite successful. But it is important to have hands-on practical training using machines and tools,” he said. Verma said students who took admission recently will continue to attend online lectures for theory parts of various subjects. The principal of the Government ITI for Women in Bathinda, Nirmal Singh, said work to hold staggered practical classes has begun. “Students and instructors will be called on alternate days to ensure physical distancing. As ITI workshops are normally spacious and every trade has an average of 20-25 students thus it will not be much challenging to arrange practical training,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industrial-training-institutes-to-reopen-in-punjab-on-september-21/story-5h9jS9b49PRIZJwxFyEFqN.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Chawri’s unusual wardrobes||A blue lungi is hanging in front of a shuttered shop, folded within a mishmash of power cables. Nearby, a baniyan and underwear are on a similar exhibit. Across the road, a pair of shirt and pants are on a string hitched to electric poles.This is a morning scene in Old Delhi’s Chawri Bazar. The streets are decked with thick power cables looped around tall bent poles most haphazardly. Dangling over the pavement, these wires resemble the zigzag lines that complicated graphs are made of. The spectacular anarchy somehow works, and the electricity is successfully supplied to the surrounding buildings.The more visible use of these cables (the ones in plastic coverings) is as clothes hangers for the hundreds of daily wage labourers of Chawri Bazar. Mostly single men with families back in the villages, the labourers tend to live in groups. If you walk the bazaar at midnight, you might see them slumped next to each other in long rows, asleep on the unlit pavements, and on carts and rickshaws. “We don’t have a house, we don’t have a suitcase, so we hang our clothes on the cables,” explains Deepak, a labourer. He informs that most labourers don’t have many material possessions and live on two sets of clothes. “Every morning, while taking a bath under the handpump, we wash the previous day’s clothes, hang them on the cables to dry and put on the clean set for the day ahead.”Some labourers also have quilts and bedsheets too heavy to be hung on cables. Deepak points to an electric pole with stuffed bundles tied around it with ropes. “These sarkari khambas (government poles) are of great help.”And now, a young man, fresh from his bath, picks up a red shirt hanging from a cable, and casually puts it on. He walks over to a street barber and combs his hair in front of a small mirror.Meanwhile, some steps away, a stretch of cable is looking pretty with... well, two, little facemasks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chawri-s-unusual-wardrobes/story-aV2ED3CD53vyM19fh68mjN.html

16-09-2020||City||340 NORI visa holders return from Pak via Attari||At least 340 people, most of whom had gone to Pakistan on NORI (no objection to return to India) visas, were allowed to come back via the Attari-Wagah border in Amritsar district on Tuesday. Indian High Commission in Pakistan recently said it was facilitating the return of 363 such visa holders and 37 Indians on Tuesday. These people were stranded in various parts of Pakistan due to the closure of borders for the containment of the coronavirus pandemic. In the last week of June, India and Pakistan operated a shuttle service for people stuck on both sides of the border due to the pandemic. Barring NORI visa holders, nearly 2,000 Indians and Pakistanis have already been allowed to return to their respective countries though the border since June. But this is the first time that NORI visa holders were allowed through the land border since the closure of the borders in March. The Indian government issues NORI visas to Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who leave their home country and live in India or are married in India but have not yet obtained Indian citizenship. Sub-divisional magistrate (Amritsar 2) Shiv Raj Bal said, “These people are from different states of India. Their apid diagnostic tests are being conducted, and only those found to be negative will be allowed to go back to their home states. Those found to be positive for the coronavirus will be isolated in Amritsar.” Till 9pm, 340 people crossed over to India, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/340-nori-visa-holders-return-from-pak-via-attari/story-iLVjxX0uRhAkOQ07S7wG3N.html
16-09-2020||City||Punjab farmers continue siege of 3 key bridges, block highways against agri ordinances||Hundreds of farmers under the banner of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee continued to block three major bridges on the Beas river in the Majha region for the second consecutive day on Tuesday against the central government’s three agriculture ordinances. Due to the blockade of the Harike bridge connecting Majha and Malwa, the Beas bridge on the Amritsar-Delhi highway and the Hargobindpur bridge in Gurdaspur, thousands of commuters were hassled. Long lines of stranded trucks and other vehicles was seen on both sides of the bridges.The farmers were seen taking meals to the protest site. Hundreds with their tractor-trailers were also seen joining the protest on Tuesday. The farmer leaders said their protest would continue until they get assurance regarding the revocation of the agriculture ordinances.Addressing the protesters in Amritsar’s Beas, committee’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “We don’t want to harass the commuters, but the governments have left us with no option. The ordinances are not only against the farming community, but also against every Indian. These ordinances, which were presented in Parliament on the first day of the ongoing Monsoon session, are only in favour of the corporate sector. The Central government is trying to make the Indian farmers landless by making this legislation, but we will not let it happen.”At the Harike bridge, committee’s state president Satnam Singh Pannu said, “These ordinances were introduced to give benefit to the corporate sector close to the influential leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which is an ally of the BJP, should take a tough stance on the issue. The Akali leaders are shedding crocodile tears on the issue.”TRUCK DRIVERS STAGE PARALLEL PROTESTDrivers of hundreds of trucks, which have been stuck on both sides of the Beas bridge for the last two days, staged a parallel protest against the farmers. The drivers impeded the movement of the farmers’ vehicles towards the bridge for at least two hours in the evening. The truck drivers threatened to intensify their protest on Wednesday if they were not allowed to move. They said due to the coronavirus pandemic they have already been suffering huge losses. Apprehending the possibility of a clash between the truck drivers and the farmers, a heavy police force was deployed there. “We have made adequate arrangements for the movement of commuters thorough alternate routes. But there was a problem for heavy vehicles,” said Amritsar superintendent of police (SP investigation) Gaurav Toora.Farmers blocked the National Highway (NH -44) at Khanna in Ludhiana district for two hours in protest against farmer ordinance. The farmers first blocked the Doraha-Neelon road and then marched towards Khanna where they were joined by arhtiyas and other labour organisations. During the blockade of the highway, they allowed passage to emergency vehicles only. Later, the police got cleared the traffic jam on NH-44. Congress MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli also joined the protesting farmers and expressed his party’s support to the cause of farmers.‘WON’T ALLOW MPs SUPPORTING BILLS TO ENTER THE VILLAGES’“MPs who support these farm bills in Parliament will not be allowed to enter villages and we will teach him a lesson,” warned Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal who was holding an agitation along with other farmers at Neelon. In Moga, some agitating farmers wore black robes while some of them tied a noose around their necks. Traffic between Jalandhar-Phagwara-Ludhiana, Phagwara-Nakodar and Phagwara-Nawanshahr-Chandigarh was blocked, causing inconvenience to commuters.At Phagwara, farmers blocked the national highway-44 near the Sugar Mill Chowk. At 11am, over 2,000 farmers started a protest march and blocked both sides of the highway to mark their protest.Also, farm labourers, arhtiyas and those connected with agricultural activities participated in the protest. Traffic movement was hit, with police diverting commuters to other routes. There were long queues in the service lane.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-continue-siege-of-3-key-bridges-block-highways-against-agri-ordinances/story-4GN1u193vxll3c1vC51PML.html

The 50-year old English teacher from Gujarat, who had been imprisoned for sexually molesting and abducting two underage students, had jumped parole and eloped with another 18-year-old pupil.He was arrested in Solan by Delhi police on Tuesday.The teacher had earlier been awarded life imprisonment after being arrested in Punjab in 2014 for sexually assaulting, abducting and eloping with two underage girls he taught. Out on parole, he was running a coaching centre when he eloped with another teenaged pupil from Chotila in Gujarat’s Rajkot district in 2018 .Even as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh to find him after it took over the case filed at a local police station (in Chotila) by the girl’s parents, the couple could not be traced.Trivedi changed his name to Satnam Singh alias Mukhtiyar Singh and the couple moved from one gurdwara to another in various cities. They travelled to at least 25 places, including Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Patna, Haridwar and Kathmandu where he found teaching jobs to survive.Both also attempted to flee to Canada as preachers of Sikhism, but failed to furnish the relevant documents.Things started unravelling for Trivedi after the girl, who had given birth in the interim, returned home with her 11-month-old child after an altercation with him. Both were then living in Haridwar in Uttarakhand.CBI had in the meantime issued an advisory to all states and also reached out to Nepal and Bhutan police through Interpol, issuing blue corner notices (to have someone’s identity verified, obtain particulars of a person’s criminal record, locate someone who is missing or is an identified or unidentified international criminal whose extradition can be requested).Left on his own, Trivedi had come to Solan, where he was arrested by Delhi police after they traced him through technical surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/teacher-who-raped-2-underage-girls-and-eloped-with-another-pupil-nabbed-in-solan/story-vuMYJSlKY3x7jbguLGsU3M.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||HC puts on hold colonel couple’s posting to two different locations||The Delhi high court on Tuesday put on hold the army’s decision to post two of its senior officers, a married couple, to different parts of the country. The decision by a bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon came on a plea moved by the husband -- Colonel Amit Kumar -- challenging the May 15 posting order issued by the Military Secretary Branch, his lawyer said. Senior advocate Rana Mukherjee and advocate Sunil J Mathews appeared for Col Kumar. Mathews said that the court has asked the army to consider the plea as a representation and to take a decision on the couple’s plea for a posting at the same or geographically close location. The high court also asked the army to inform it about the decision on the representation after four weeks when the matter will be taken up, he said. He also said that till the next date the bench put on hold the May 15 orders posting Col Kumar and his wife Col Anu Dogra, both of whom are in the Judge Advocate General (JAG) branch of the army and presently posted in Jodhpur, to Port Blair in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Bhatinda in Punjab, respectively. Central government standing counsel Harish Vaidyanathan said he opposed the plea moved by Col Kumar. Col Kumar, in his plea filed through advocates Ashim Dua and Tasmin Singh, has said that he had requested the Army in August for reconsideration of his date of movement and also leave of 30 days to attend the “piping ceremony of his wife”, and secure the relocation of his family, which included his aged parents and minor son, to Bhatinda. However, his requests were denied, the petition has said and added that the decision taken to transfer them without considering their preferences was in violation of the laid down policy and standard operating procedure regarding posting of senior officers. His petition has alleged that the decision to transfer him and his wife to far off locations has been taken as he had filed a statutory complaint against the JAG, Indian Army as well as Deputy JAG, Headquarters Southern Command, Pune. He has contended that the two senior officers allegedly influenced the said posting orders. Col Kumar, in his petition, has said that since his requests were denied he has been forced to put up his papers for voluntary premature retirement “despite an unblemished and stellar service”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-puts-on-hold-colonel-couple-s-posting-to-two-different-locations/story-QSZfIDi7yg13KfakV3TdvL.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Monsoon session: Furore in HP Assembly over benami land deals||The Opposition on Tuesday created a furore in the Assembly over benami land transactions, and suspicious sale and purchase of properties in Himachal. As soon as the House assembled, Congress legislator Rajinder Singh Rana asked about the adjournment notice given by the Opposition under Rule 67 seeking discussion on benami land deals and suspicious sale and purchase of properties in the state. However, speaker Vipin Singh Parmar denied permission to raise the issue, saying the notice had been forwarded to the government for the final decision. The speaker said he will allow discussion after receiving the government’s reply. Dissatisfied with the response, Congress leaders started raising slogans and demanded that the matter be discussed. The speaker said he will not allow the discussion but if the Opposition tables any documentary evidence, he will examine it. In response, Rana asked, “What is the government hiding? Why is the Opposition not being allowed to raise the matter?” When they did not get their way, the Opposition staged a walkout. Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj said, “The House has already held discussions under Rule 67, which lasted three days. The Opposition is raking up the issue for the sake of sensationalism and in doing so is causing losses worth lakhs by disrupting the question hour.” “Notice for Rule 67 was given in the morning but no facts were stated in it. How can the matter be discussed without facts?” he said, adding the matter had been forwarded to officials and will be discussed under an appropriate rule. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur also condemned the Opposition’s behaviour. “A lot of information has to be collected to run the question hour and it should not be disrupted. Earlier, too, the government had allowed an adjournment motion on Covid-19 given the gravity of the issue. The Opposition had raised the issue but did not hold any logical discussion.” “We need time because the matter pertains to the entire state. The Opposition should exercise some restraint. It is not appropriate walk out of the house just to remain in the limelight,” said Thakur. Opposition stages protest outside Speaker’s office The Opposition on Tuesday morning staged a protest outside the speaker’s office. Several Congress members, including leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, staged the sit-in before the proceedings of the house began, alleging their voice was not being heard. After a brief protest, the Opposition members met with the Speaker. The chief minister condemned the protest, saying, “Today, members of the opposition sat on a dharna outside the Speaker’s office. This has never happened before and it is condemnable. A wrong precedent should not be started.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/monsoon-session-furore-in-hp-assembly-over-benami-land-deals/story-RVneAetuTIvevdnwlczfQK.html
16-09-2020||City||Ludhiana tweeted about ‘romance’ the most among 22 Indian cities||Punjab’s industrial hub, Ludhiana, tweeted about ‘romance’ the most among at least 22 Indian cities in 2019, conversations on microblogging site Twitter on a variety of themes have revealed. Commissioned by Twitter India, a study titled ‘Conversation Replay’ analysed 8,50,000 tweets from these cities between September and November last year. Besides ‘romance’, Ludhiana was among the top three cities to have conversations on themes of ‘doing good deeds’, ‘food’, ‘animals’, ‘friendship’, and ‘humour’. The study focused on ‘top joyful conversations’ “to look back and rejoice moments” in the pre-pandemic time when there was no work from home culture or social distancing norms. Southern cities like Ernakulam, Hyderabad and Chennai led conversations on themes of sports, food, celebration, celebrity content, and ‘humour. Chhattisgarh’s capital city Raipur led conversations around animals. Odisha’s Bhubaneswar had the most conversations around ‘family’ and ‘doing good deeds’, whereas Mumbai talked about ‘nostalgia’, the study found. Ludhiana was followed by Ahmadabad and Kolkata on the theme of romance. The 10 most talked about themes across the cities were ‘animals’, ‘celebration’, ‘celebrity content’, ‘doing good deeds’, ‘family’, food, humour, nostalgia, romance and sports (listed in alphabetical order). Twitter India managing director Manish Maheshwari says, “Twitter is a modern public square where diverse voices discuss and share their views on topics and conversations that interest them. Last year, people were celebrating and reveling in many joys of life, and with Conversation Replay, our intent is to throw back to those vibrant conversations, across varied themes from diverse parts of India, to encourage people to celebrate life. Sharing these conversations is our way of giving Indians a moment of happiness and reminding them that joy can still be found in little pleasures.” “On Twitter, we see people celebrating moments of romantic love. These include vibrantly-coloured pictures of couples smiling, laughing, embracing, or posing together on holidays. Cropped shots of interlocked hands also feature on the site. Images are usually decorated with stickers and text, showing a touch of playfulness and light-heartedness,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-tweeted-about-romance-the-most-among-indian-cities/story-gOLdl5v5Ez9Bt7zjHN4iXL.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||SAD’s pretence of protecting farmers exposed: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said the presentation of the farm ordinances in Parliament by the Centre has totally exposed the farce of the Shiromani Akali Dal’s pretence of protecting the interests of the farmers of the state. In a statement, Amarinder said the fact that SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal stayed away from the House when the ordinances were presented for legislation, showed that the entire drama of seeking postponement of their enactment was played out by him to appease the farmer organisations. “There is clearly a conspiracy to undermine the farmers’ interests and that of the states, which are constitutionally mandated to be responsible for agriculture. The SAD chief knew all along that the ordinance would be brought to the House,” the CM claimed. He said the SAD, which had endorsed the ordinances, was now indulging in the drama of seeking clarifications and amendments to the ordinances. He also ridiculed the statements of AAP MLAs, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and Aman Arora, alleging connivance between Congress and SAD-BJP, asking them to check the facts before shooting their mouths off. In its haste to criticise the state government, AAP has become habitual of making unsubstantiated statements without a grain of truth in them, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-s-pretence-of-protecting-farmers-exposed-amarinder/story-SnnFAszebNnBYlzuKe8WtJ.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Lok Sabha clears contentious farm bill, SAD votes against it||Shiromani Akali Dal, the key constituent of the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance at the Centre, voted against a contentious farm bill that was passed in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.Three farm sector-related ordinances were cleared by the Union cabinet recently and the corresponding bills were tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday. One of them -- the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 -- was taken up for a discussion and passed by a voice vote. Participating in the debate, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal described the bills as anti-farmer and said that the Centre never consulted his party before the ordinances were framed. “Even when the ordinances were being discussed in the cabinet, my wife and Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had raised objections and conveyed the concerns of farmers. She had requested the ordinance be put off, but her voice was not heeded to,” Sukhbir said, adding that Punjab will be the worst-affected state by these legislations.Underlining that he himself hails from a farming family, Sukhbir, in an emotive speech, said: “Every Akali is a farmer and every farmer is an Akali at heart. The SAD has always championed farmers’ cause.” “The party’s legacy cannot and will not be compromised or diluted, no matter what price we have to pay,” he said, speaking in Punjabi. The SAD’s strident stand is seen as a sign of fissure in its over two-decade-old alliance with the BJP. Farmers in many states, including Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against these bills. Sukhbir said all Congress and Aam Aadmi Party MPs from Punjab abstained from voting.Responding to the debate, minister of state for consumer affairs Raosaheb Patil Danve said the amendment is aimed at transforming the farm sector and raising farmers’ income. (with agency inputs)WILL MOVE COURT: AMARINDER Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said the state Congress will challenge the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 in the court. He described the legislation “a direct and deliberate assault” by the Centre on the farmers’ interests. Riding roughshod over the farmers’ concerns, the Modi government has imposed a central law on a state subject, thus “eroding” the federal structure of the country, said the CM. “We will challenge it in court,” he said in a statement .Amarinder said the enactment of the legislation is a step towards the “abolition” of the MSP (minimum support price) regime. “It is a conspiracy on the part of the BJP-led NDA government to destroy Punjab and its farmers,” he alleged and declared that the Congress will fight this “attack” on the state’s interests tooth and nail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lok-sabha-clears-contentious-farm-bill-sad-votes-against-it/story-UaeY43Dbftx9ph9Zp8CtXM.html

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid effect: Kashmiri weddings no longer a grand affair||Kashmiri weddings are traditionally a grand affair that last around four to five days, involve a couple of scrumptious 12-course feasts (the Kashmiri wazwan) and a large gathering of friends and relatives who breathe life into the party. However, these days with the Union Territory of Jammu Kashmir recording around 50,000 Covid cases and 850 deaths, guests are making do with a serving of Khewa (green tea with saffron), meat and large dollops of sanitisers. Many families have decided to postpone the weddings till such a time they can hold a grand feast, others who are going ahead are adapting traditions to ensure guests’ safety. “My brother was to get married this year and all arrangements were almost done, but in light of the growing number of Covid cases we have deferred the wedding to next year. Besides, what is a Kashmiri wedding without a big gathering,’’ says one Adnan Ahmad of the old city. In Kashmir, the peak marriage season is between August to November. Those in the wedding industry say few weddings have taken place since the outbreak of the coronavirus and the weddings that did take place were hardly a two-day affair with few people in attendence and masks and sanitisers part of the wedding paraphernalia. Haji Shabir Ahmad, a wholesale dealer of disposable wedding items, says, “Earlier, we would sell disposables ranging from ₹60,000 to ₹1,50,000. Now, the bills have whittled down to ₹20,000- ₹30,000. Even the number of weddings have come down by 70%.’’ He, however, says they have added sanitizers and masks and personal protective equipment (PPW) kits in the list of items. TRADITIONS TAILORED In Kashmiri weddings hosts traditionally serve a couple of feasts known as Kashmiri wazwan comprising seven to 12 courses served in big copper plates. Each plate is consumed by four people. While a simple marriage lasts for two days, affluent families stretch their marriage ceremonies four to five days where quintals of mutton prepared by trained chefs (wazas) is served. Nowadays, wazwan is being served in single copper plates instead of bigger plates known as (trami). Some have replaced the plates with clay bowls . “I recently attended a marriage at Iqbal Nagar Sopore, it was a simple function, the guests were served in clay pots instead of copper plates. Many people like the way, our ancestors used to eat in clay pots,’’ says a resident Shiekh Haroon, adding “ A curtailed guest list has also made marriages simple, with many skipping the wazwan altogether and serving tea or Khewa. Peer Ishfaq, the cousin of a groom-to- be, says, “Last time when we had a marriage at our house, the function lasted for four to five days and we ended up serving seven quintals of meat to nearly 1,000 guests. This time we are preparing just 100 kilograms of meat and our guest list is not more than 100.”Mohammad Yaqood a chef from north Kashmir says, “The wazas have been hit by the successive lockdowns imposed after August 5. Earlier, they had to be booked months in advance. The Kashmiri wedding industry is at its nadir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-effect-kashmiri-weddings-no-longer-a-grand-affair/story-JHgRMlY5PPgUUVuudvWmIL.html

16-09-2020||Delhi||Ex-staff alleges ‘politically sensitive’ bid via Facebook to influence Delhi polls||A ‘politically sophisticated’ attempt to influence the Delhi elections played out on Facebook before it was taken down silently, a former employee said in a memo that cited examples of how the company failed to act in time or with transparency in tackling efforts to undermine democratic processes around the world.The memo, written by data scientist Sophie Zhang, who worked at Facebook and was recently laid off, was obtained by Buzzfeed News, which reported about it late on Monday.The memo cited instances of alleged attempts by political parties to sway elections in Azerbaijan and Honduras, and similar but unattributed campaigns in Ukraine, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador, besides India.“I worked through sickness to take down a politically sophisticated network of more than a thousand actors working to influence the election,” Zhang wrote about the 2020 Delhi elections in the 6,600-word memo, according to the report.The takedown was not officially reported by Facebook and the employee did not specify who were behind the attempt.The Buzzfeed News report is the third since an August 14 story by Wall Street Journal that first detailed how Facebook struggles to manage content on its website, especially those involving politicians. Facebook India’s policy team members personally intervened to halt action against a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Telangana, citing a potential risk to the company’s commercial interests in the country, the first report said. Facebook, which has been attacked by both the opposition Congress and the ruling BJP, has since banned the politician, and denied that it acted in a biased manner. The company is being investigated by a parliamentary panel and a Delhi legislative assembly committee.Raghav Chadha, the chairperson of the committee on peace and harmony, said the recent disclosures were worrying and unless such practices are deterred in time, they can affect the country’s democracy. Also read: Facebook in contempt, warns Delhi Assembly panelBefore she was fired, Zhang was with Facebook’s Site Integrity team tasked with combating fake news, the Buzzfeed report said.It was not clear why she was fired, but the report noted that she had turned down a $64,000 severance payment in order to avoid a no-disparagement deal.“In the three years I’ve spent at Facebook, I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions,” she wrote in the memo. The disclosure adds to questions of transparency in how the social media company acts on problematic content, which includes hate speech and fake information that has been proven to succeed in influencing elections. It also spotlights the problem of who takes these calls, which in Zhang’s case appeared to be a mid-level employee. A Facebook spokesperson said the company deals with each issue thoroughly. “Working against coordinated inauthentic behaviour is our priority, but we’re also addressing the problems of spam and fake engagement. We investigate each issue carefully, including those that Ms Zhang raises, before we take action or go out and make claims publicly as a company,” this person added.Zhang could not be reached for a comment.Experts say that the latest memo highlights a recurrent problem with social media websites in general and Facebook in particular. “Facebook normally comes out with a transparency report. It is important to ask why there was no disclosure of the takedown but, more importantly, also ask Facebook what it considers as inauthentic activity. The ex-employee expresses how she was overwhelmed by the larger political repercussions of her decision. When a company’s content moderation begins to impact the world outside their users, it becomes a democratic duty to intervene and determine how these decisions are taken,” said Jyoti Panday, researcher at the Internet Governance Project, Georgia Institute of Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ex-staff-alleges-politically-sensitive-bid-via-facebook-to-influence-delhi-polls/story-gGjRmiPb1NlC3cN723TIAN.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||Ban on export of onions will benefit Pakistan exporters, says NCP chief Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday opposed the Centre’s decision to ban export of onions across the country. He has requested the Central government to reconsider the decision and pointed out that the move will benefit exporters from Pakistan. The sudden decision is a major blow to India’s image as a reliable exporter of onions in the international market, he said.The veteran leader, who is in Delhi to attend the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, has also met Union minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal in this regard.“The Central government has abruptly announced a ban on onion exports. This has led to strong reactions from the onion growing belt in Maharashtra & therefore the representatives of various political parties contacted & requested me to convey their demands to the Central Government,” Pawar said in a series of tweets.“To address this issue, I met Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Shri Piyush Goyal today and apprised him of the plight of onion growers. I pointed out to him that these onion growers are mainly small land holders and Jirait (rain water dependent) farmers. I also brought to his notice that onions are in good demand internationally & we have been exporting onions consistently. But a sudden decision to this effect by the Central government is a major blow to India’s image as a reliable exporter of onions in the international market,” he tweeted.“I also emphasised on the fact that Pakistan and other onion exporters will benefit immensely from this situation. In view of all this, I urged Piyush Goyal ji to reconsider the ban on onion exports,” the NCP chief added.Goyal told him that the ban on onion exports was proposed by the Union ministry of consumer protection on the basis of rising onion prices in the market and the decision will be reconsidered in consultation with the Union ministry of commerce, ministry of finance and ministry of consumer protection.The farmer’s organisations have also opposed the ban and warned of agitation.Dr Ajit Nawale, general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), condemned the ban and said, “Recently, the Central government claimed that farmers have been given a big relief by making onions free from regulation and removing it from the list of essential commodities. This ban is a betrayal to the farmers. AIKS and other farmer organisations condemned the move and the Centre will have to face the consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ban-on-export-of-onions-will-benefit-pakistan-exporters-says-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar/story-QK3IIvDnX1ues4ZkOTbI7H.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||No NAAC grade for University of Mumbai this year as well||The long-awaited National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grade for the University of Mumbai (MU) will remain elusive in the 2020-21 academic year as well. Officials from the varsity confirmed that the process of submitting the self study report (SSR) had to be re-started after the process was left incomplete in March due to the lockdown. Once the SSR is submitted, a peer team from the NAAC committee visits the university to verify the details submitted in the application. Thereafter, the committee is expected to take around six months to announce the university’s new grade, which makes it impossible for MU’s NAAC grading process to be completed in the current academic year. An MU official said that by December 2019, the varsity had submitted the institutional information for quality assessment (IIQA) and the same was approved by the apex grading body. “We had started the process of uploading the SSR early this year. The process was almost 95% complete when the pandemic led to a national lockdown. All our work had to be stopped and eventually, the apex body asked us to restart submitting our SSR as the previous documents could not be saved due to its incomplete status,” said an MU spokesperson. While IIQA is a document recording the university’s compliance with the criteria and policies of the NAAC committee, SSR is a self-evaluation identifying strengths and rectifying deficiencies. NAAC accreditation is a performance indicator for higher educational institutes and is mandatory for funds from Central agencies. The university was given a ‘Grade A’ score by NAAC in 2012, which expired on April 20, 2017. Since then, MU has failed to apply for re-accreditation. In the absence of a NAAC grade, the university has lost out on grants worth crores of rupees from the Centre, and dropped in annual national and global rankings. “The fact that the university sat on the re-application process in 2017 itself was a big mistake but not having managed to complete this process for three years now is unacceptable. Several students have suffered over the years and we hope the problem ends soon,” said Vaibhav Narwade, a senate member of the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-naac-grade-for-university-of-mumbai-this-year-as-well/story-E0dXK2TUc4CxS9hjctSetN.html

We have also raised awareness among hawkers to not litter and about plastic usage,” said Santosh Patkar, sanitary director, solid waste management department, TMC.The fine for using plastic is ₹5,000. “This is a huge sum that we have to pay. We are here out of helplessness as we do not earn much nowadays and fewer people step out.

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||3-storeyed illegal building comes up in McLeodganj under MC’s nose||The Dharamshala municipal corporation (MC) has issued a notice to Yashi Dolma, a woman of Tibetan origin, for illegally building a three-storeyed building adjoining Hotel Norbu House, 250 metres from the abode of the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. The MC notice was issued last week on the complaint of a local resident, Ashok Rai, on whose plot (about 780 yards) the illegal construction was made during the lockdown. “There was no construction on the site till the middle of April,” Rai said, demanding action against the owners of Hotel Norbu House who raised the building “by taking advantage of the Covid-19 lockdown”. Not only has the structure come up without the approval of the civic body and town planning department but it has also been built on encroached land and three trees have been damaged at the site. One tree has been taken inside the construction site. Meanwhile, Ghazala Abdullah, a green activist who took the matter of illegal felling to the high court, alleged that the same people had carried out digging for the construction of a water tank endangering four Deodar trees. MC commissioner Pradeep Thakur said, “A case has been registered against owner Yashi Dolma under Section 253 of the Himachal Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, and a notice has been issued to her.” The section provides for demolition of illegally raised structure if violations are confirmed. Yashi Dolma and her husband, Indian citizens of Tibetan origin, run hospitality business in Mcleodganj and own several properties. When contacted, Wangdu admitted that the construction they raised was illegal. He, however, maintained that the construction was an old one and they had submitted a regularisation plan to the authorities.He alleged that person who submitted complaint with the MC wanted to grab his land. Wangdu also denied commissioning the digging. Dharamshala mayor Devinder Singh Jaggi said that the civic body will take strict action not only against the owner but also against officials who failed to keep a track of such activities. “Responsibilities will be fixed and action will be taken as per law,” said Jaggi. OFFENDER LEFT OFF THE HOOK EARLIER MC sources said that this was not the first time that Dolma was involved in illegal construction. Two years ago, the water and power supplies to Hotel Norbu House was cut after she built a six-storeyed building despite having permission for only two storeys. The case is still pending in the court. In recent years, illegal structures have come up in McLeodganj. After High Court took cognizance of the matter notices power and water supply to about 180 hotels and guest houses for violation of building and environmental norms. The court also appointed a local commissioner and had “warned” to stop the salaries of erring officials after the commissioner had reported rampant violation in McLeodganj area. Later, court provided some relaxations by restoring the water and power supply on the condition that the illegal portions shall be demolished or fine be imposed as per the law. The owners had also submitted affidavit in the court in this regard. The matter is still pending. The town and country planning department allows only two-storeyed buildings in the hill town as it is in the seismic sensitive zone. Also, in July 2019, the National Green Tribunal had banned any kind of commercial construction in McLeoganj area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-storeyed-illegal-building-comes-up-in-mcleodganj-under-mc-s-nose/story-DcO0RNuwH54FhrbEJFktUJ.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Pulwama gunfight: Police assault two photojournalists||Two photojournalists were allegedly assaulted by the police while they were covering a gunfight between militants and security forces at a village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama on Tuesday. Kamran Yousuf, a multimedia journalist working with an online portal and Faisal Bashir, a freelancer, were beaten up by policemen near the gunfight site at Marwal Kakapora in Pulwama. Yousuf’s right leg was fractured and he had to be hospitalised at a hospital in Srinagar. Kamran said, “Many journalists had reached the outer security ring near the encounter site in the morning to cover the incident and were taking pictures when the CRPF personnel present told them to move a bit farther from the spot. When we started leaving, suddenly some policemen came rushing towards me. They told me to stop and simply started raining batons without asking anything.”“I was surrounded by them and somehow managed to escape. They even chased after me,” he said.Faisal Bashir also said that he was assaulted without a reason. “I was on the bund of the Jhelum when they told me to come down. They rained batons on my back and also hit my camera. After assaulting me they caught hold of Kamran, who was behind me,” he said.Police in a statement said: “Today an exchange of fire took place at village Marwal between terrorists and SFs. Cordon was placed to prevent people from venturing inside as that would have endangered their security. However some media persons tried to move closer, they were duly stopped”.The incident has caused outrage among journalists, with two prominent bodies – the Kashmir Press Club (KPC) and Kashmir Editors Guild (KEG) – slamming police for the assault.The two bodies asked LG and police top brass to ‘sensitise’ the cops about working of media persons.Senior journalist Yusuf Jameel said that thrashing,harassing & intimidating journalists in Kashmir was not new. “We’ve lived with & endured it for yrs.What is,however,more disgusting rather despicable is the authorities,after every such incident,assuring “it will not happen again’.I see it also as rubbing salt in the wound,” he said in a tweet (sic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pulwama-gunfight-police-assault-two-photojournalists/story-3qwQRbESZ9pB5Am9jH252I.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 outbreak: Lawyers in Mumbai permitted to travel on local trains to attend hearing in Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the railways and state authorities to permit those advocates who have been issued letters by the court, to travel by local trains to reach HC to attend physical hearings in their matters. The initiative will be undertaken on an experimental basis for two weeks from September 18 till October 7. HC said that based on the outcome of the initiative, the relaxation would be considered for advocates from lower courts, too. The court has also directed the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa to take action against lawyers who misuse the facility. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Chirag Chanani and other lawyers through advocate Shyam Dewani, and another plea through advocate Uday Warunjikar, was informed that advocates were unable to attend the limited physical hearings in HC, as they were not permitted to travel by local trains. The permission for train travel has been restricted to state, municipal and health staffers and others in essential services owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. In the previous hearing on September 10, the bench had directed the state and railways to consider starting an initiative in which lawyers with letters of certification from the HC’s registry could be allowed to travel on locals to attend physical hearings or visit their offices. On Tuesday, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state and additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the railways informed the bench that they were agreeable for travel arrangement for lawyers on experimental basis. Kumbhakoni placed on record a note, setting out the arrangement that can be made for lawyers who are required to attend physical hearings in their matters. As part of the procedure, such advocates will have to apply to the HC registrar, who will scrutinise and issue certificates. The advocates will then have to show the same to the railway authorities, so that they may be issued a pass or a ticket for the particular date of physical hearing. Kumbhakoni’s suggested that if the system worked, it could be applied for trial court advocates too. The court said that though it was not inclined to grant similar relief to trial court lawyers immediately, it would consider the suggestion during the next hearing on October 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-outbreak-lawyers-in-mumbai-permitted-to-travel-on-local-trains-to-attend-hearing-in-bombay-high-court/story-QCJVZR8fybQcOddekj8obI.html

On Monday, the boy’s 36-year-old father tweeted to Thane Police, requesting them to celebrate his son’s birthday and arrange a cake for him, if possible, as there was no one with him to organise the celebrations this year. The man and his wife, who are residents of Diva near Shil Road, tested positive for Covid-19 a week ago and had been admitted to a hospital in Vashi. Their three children are now being taken care by their grandmother. “Since both, my wife and I, are admitted in a hospital, we will not be able to be with our son. His dream is to be a cop when he grows up, so we request the Thane Police to send some officers to our home and celebrate his birthday, as that will make him very happy,” the Diva resident had tweeted on the police’s official handle. He also gave his address in the tweet. After the tweet came to the Thane Police’s notice, senior inspector Chandrakant Jadhav, from Shil Daighar police station, along with his team arranged for a cake and went to the boy’s house to celebrate his birthday. “The couple’s three children are being looked after by their grandmother, who is old and cannot make any arrangements for her grandson’s birthday.

16-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic corporation says daily Covid-19 tests surged to 15,000 from 10K in last week of August||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has steadily increased the number of tests conducted for Covid-19 this month. In the second week of September, Mumbai conducted up to 15,000 tests per day, of which up to 40% were rapid antigen tests and the remaining were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. This is a sharp increase from the last week of August, when 7000 to 10,000 tests were conducted per day, of which up to 28% were rapid antigen tests. So far, Mumbai has conducted 9,25,148 tests and its positivity rate is 18.34% at present. BMC’s data shows that compared to the first week of September, when approximately 67,500 tests were conducted, there was a jump of approximately 20% in the second week of September, when approximately 81,500 tests were carried out. In the last week of August, BMC conducted approximately 60,100 tests, which was 45% more than the number of tests carried out in the first week of August (approximately 26,800). Along with the number of tests, the percentage of rapid antigen tests has also risen. In July, when the city saw 5,000 to 7,000 Covid-19 tests daily, rapid antigen tests were 10% of the total. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 taskforce, said, “We still need to do more tests to control the spread of the virus. Also, we need both methods – rapid antigen kits and RT-PCR – considering rapid antigen is required for its fastness. We can always go for the RT-PCR method if those suspected test negative in rapid antigen tests.” While RT-PCR tests are considered the gold standard for Covid diagnosis, it takes several hours to arrive at results. In contrast, results of rapid antigen tests can be delivered in approximately 30 minutes. However, rapid antigen tests continue to have a low positivity rate (between 5% and 10%, with a few exceptions) while RT-PCR has a high positivity rate of between 20% and 30%. Positivity rate is the percentage of people correctly diagnosed as Covid-positive from the total tests conducted. The low positivity rate for antigen tests means that on when Mumbai saw more of these tests being conducted, the positivity rate for the day also dropped. For example, on September 9, Mumbai conducted 15,700 tests of which 7,300 were rapid antigen tests. The city’s positivity rate for the day was approximately 16%. Similarly, on September 19, Mumbai conducted 15,100 tests of which 6,700 were rapid antigen tests, and the city’s positivity rate was 17%. In contrast, on September 13, Mumbai conducted 9,400 tests of which 1,900 were rapid antigen tests, and the recorded positivity rate was 24%. Since antigen tests deliver quick results, they are preferred in cases where a suspected Covid-19 patient may have a high number of risk contacts. Last week, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told HT, “Rapid antigen kits have to be used for suspicious patients who have heavy symptoms. We cannot use the kits randomly on say citizens or frontline workers. The positivity rate for RT-PCR is much more but this doesn’t mean we will not use rapid antigen kits.” BMC has already used more than 1 lakh rapid antigen kits till now, and has ordered more rapid antigen kits. A senior officer from BMC said, “BMC started out using rapid antigen kits for shopkeepers, frontline workers, in slums, and high risk contacts of Covid-19 patients. Because we get immediate results, it helps to quarantine suspected patients immediately and break their contact with the community. We will use rapid antigen kits for repeated testing of frontline workers with greater interaction with the community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-corporation-says-daily-covid-19-tests-surged-to-15-000-from-10k-in-last-week-of-august/story-WtvSPxCXhRuhFHHebf59WL.html

Part of state’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ programme, the campaign will continue till October 25. The civic body will give out a set of instructions/advisories to be followed by individuals and families at home as well as in housing societies or colonies, at shopping malls and markets, workplaces and while travelling in public transport. Some of these instructions include no sharing of masks among family members, avoiding talking face-to-face when outdoors, speaking less while eating your meals outside, wearing masks while driving your car, regular temperature, and if possible oxygen level, checks, care to be taken while handling non-perishable goods ordered online.BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “In order to effectively curtail the spread of coronavirus, it is imperative that all members of the family take necessary care and are vigilant to avoid even inadvertent mistakes. Citizens will be informed about the important steps that should be taken to achieve positive results against Covid-19.”BMC has also initiated a door-to-door survey to screen over 1.24 crore population of the city. Under this, it has formed 5,000 teams of 15,000 officials to screen citizens for symptoms for the next 40 days. Each team will have three BMC officials and has to cover 50 households daily. The team has to cover 40 lakh households in the city in the coming days. BMC officials said the deadline could be extended until 40 lakh households are covered. Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “We will undertake the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign for the next 40 days to cover maximum population. We have already undertaken screening for senior citizens earlier, and this will be similar to that.” So far, BMC has screened around 10 lakh citizens in the city, of which around 3,100 citizens have been referred for oxygen therapy, considering their oxygen count was low.Several areas of the western suburbs, Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Jogeshwari, Andheri and Vile Parle, have the highest number of active cases in the city. The city has around 31,123 active cases, as of Monday. Shankarwar said, “The drive will be more aggressive in areas namely Dahisar, Borivli and Kandivli. There will be more surveillance and testing from these areas.”The campaign will also provide referral treatment to people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, obesity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bmc-to-teach-mumbaiites-to-live-with-covid-19-safely-responsibly/story-exx7Vqw2R05LE4z3JMJjmI.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Question hour: 87 cases pending under Section 118 of HP Land Tenancy Act||Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj on Tuesday said 87 appeals seeking permission under Section 118 of the Himachal Pradesh Land Tenancy and Land Reforms Act, which provides for restriction on transfer of land in favour of a person who is not an agriculturist in the state, were still pending, while 122 cases had been sent back to deputy commissioners for reconsideration. Jawalamukhi MLA Ramesh Dhawala had asked whether land purchasing procedure had been simplified for establishing industries and how many cases had been accepted under Section 118 during the question hour of the ongoing monsoon session. Bhardwaj said 417 permissions had been granted under Section 188 and 388 cases had been approved. “From 2013 to 2017, the Congress-led state government had approved 543 cases and sanctioned 844 housing projects and 1,387 cases under Section 118 while the BJP government has approved 805 cases so far,” he said. No amendment has been made in sections of the act to facilitate ‘ease of doing business.’ However, some rules had been changed and the process simplified. Responding to Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh, agriculture minister Virendra Kanwar said the title of the Totu sabzi mandi land had not been cleared yet. “Once the court takes a decision, the government will construct the fruit market,” he said, adding that 13 bigha land had been earmarked for the project, which will cost ₹3.75 crore. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur told Jogindernagar MLA Prakash Rana that the government had not yet decided to create the post of a sub-divisonal magistrate (SDM) in Lad Bharol tehsil. However, as people were being inconvenienced, the Jogindernagar SDM has been asked to serve there at least three-four days in a month. In response to BJP MLA from Hamirpur Narinder Thakur, health and family welfare minister Rajiv Saizal said the construction work of a medical college in Hamirpur had been awarded to a Delhi-based company. The medical college will be built by CPWD and the construction work will start soon. Forest Minister Rakesh Pathania while responding to a question posed by BJP MLA Arjun Singh said as Pong Dam was the largest wetland in the state, laws will not be broken to allow agricultural activities in the area. Pathania said agricultural actives could not be performed in the Pong Dam Sanctuary as the Supreme Court has banned removal of dead and dry trees from national parks and sanctuaries. The removal of grass is also prohibited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/question-hour-87-cases-pending-under-section-118-of-hp-land-tenancy-act/story-7EGP2vWTKuFopFRQMvsjWK.html
16-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department to form committee to look into private school fees||After several parents of private schools urged the state government and the education department to look into the issue of fee hike during the pandemic, the department has now decided to form a committee. “After receiving complaints from parents, it has now been decided to conduct a detailed audit of the schools in question. After the preliminary enquiry, if schools are found breaking any norms concerning fees, notices shall be sent to them and an explanation will be sought for the same. If they fail to comply even then, action will be initiated from the department,” said an official from the education department. Last week, several parents from different schools in the city met member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Bacchu Kadu, state minister of school education. Jayant Jain, president of the Forum for Fairness in Education who coordinated with the delegation of parents from around 35 schools said, “The minister has ordered officials from the education department to look into the same. Several schools in the city are flouting norms concerning fees and strict action needs to be taken against them,” he added. Bacchu Kadu could not be reached for a comment despite several calls and messages. Meanwhile, an official from the education department said that the committee would be further split into multiple panels and officials shall be allotted schools that they need to investigate. “The committee shall submit a report to the education department and the government. The further course of action will then be decided,” added the official. A government resolution (GR) released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-to-form-committee-to-look-into-private-school-fees/story-BTUTMCi2Qi3hIlkY48eGNM.html

16-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut vs Shiv Sena: A new fight begins in Maharashtra||The ongoing spat between the Shiv Sena and actor Kangana Ranaut is not the first instance of a fight between the party and Hindi film personalities. It, however, is the first one where a Bollywood personality has taken the Sena head-on. Over the years, the Sena has taken up issues targeting films or actors as and when it suited their political agendas – from batting for the rights of Marathi manoos to raking up anything related to Pakistan or Hindutva. Sena supremo and party founder Bal Thackeray had personal relations with actors Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar and Sunil Dutt, among others. The stories of the evening sessions between Thackeray senior and these actors on the terrace of Matoshree, the Thackeray residence in Bandra East, are well-known in political circles. However, his party had run-ins with almost all Bollywood biggies, from Dev Anand to Dilip Kumar to Shah Rukh Khan. Political observers said this is the first time a Bollywood actor has taken the fight with the ruling Shiv Sena, albeit with the backing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to the Centre. The recent war of words is a new type of a clash, the one the Sena is not used to. Bollywood and Shiv Sena The party’s first skirmish with the Hindi film industry came early on after the Sena was founded in 1966. In 1971, Marathi actor Krishna Kondke, popularly known as Dada Kondke, turned to Bal Thackeray for help after the owner of Kohinoor cinema did not screen his movie, Songadya, despite booking it three weeks in advance. Instead, the cinema hall screened Dev Anand’s Tere Mere Sapne. Angry Shiv Sainiks protested outside the cinema hall after it replaced the Marathi film with Anand’s film produced under the Navketan banner. Back then, the Sena’s primary agenda was ‘Marathi manoos’. The Sena, which had adopted the Hindutva agenda, targeted Dilip Kumar for accepting Nishan-e-Imtiaz, a civilian honour by the Pakistan government in 1998. The Sena, which was Maharashtra’s ruling party in alliance with the BJP then, questioned the patriotism of Dilip Kumar, who was born Yusuf Khan in Peshawar in undivided India. In 1995, Bal Thackeray was given a special screening of Mani Ratnam’s film Bombay, which was based on the 1993 Mumbai riots, and he demanded some cuts. In 1998, the Sena protested against the screening of Deepa Mehta’s film Fire and did not allow the release of Water as the former was depicting lesbian relationship and the latter “hurt Hindu sentiments”. In 2010, the party protested and prevented screenings of the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer My Name Is Khan after the lead actor spoke for inclusion of Pakistani cricketers in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Sena leaders have protested against films such as Salman Khan-starrer Tiger Zinda Hai in 2017, as its producers booked most screens, leaving no space for Marathi movies in multiplexes. Bollywood hasn’t hit back at the party on most occasions as Mumbai is a big market for Hindi movies and offending the Sena would mean disturbing the release in theatres. Besides, the Sena controls the Mumbai civic body (which is an authority for a number of things, including houses and offices as well as permissions for shooting at public places). The Sena always had a strong ground presence. Thackeray was also an authority for several Bollywood personalities who would approach him if they faced trouble from either unions or any local trouble-makers. Questioning the Sena or even ignoring it was not a preferable option for Bollywood. Ranaut versus Sena Political observers point out that be it protests or blessings from Matoshree, nobody wanted to rub the Thackerays the wrong way. However, this changed recently after Ranaut’s attack on the party. Political analyst Prakash Bal said Bal Thackeray built ties with the film industry, at the same time, ruled with an iron fist, which meant going against the Sena would hurt their business. “Thackeray had personal equation with several Bollywood stars; Uddhav Thackeray did not do so after he took over the reins of the party. He moved away from street politics in a bid to project the Shiv Sena in a different light. On the other hand, Raj Thackeray (who moved out of the Sena to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena) inherited his uncle’s way of functioning. Therefore, in 2010, Karan Johar and Shah Rukh Khan went to Raj (when they faced a problem with their movie’s release) and not Matoshree, although Bal Thackeray was alive then,” Bal said. In 2016, Johar also had to meet Raj Thackeray after the latter’s party objected to the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which had Pakistani actor Fawad Khan as one of the leading actors. Bal added that had Uddhav Thackeray built a rapport with the film industry, it would have helped his son during this “political gimmick”. He also added that as film’s economics changed, the industry biggies needed less protection from political parties. “Now, they make more money from overseas rights and other things than from here [the box office],” he said. Another political analyst Surendra Jondhale said Ranaut shifted the dimension of Sena’s run-ins with Bollywood. “The Sena always picked issues of Marathi culture and common man with the film industry. It was the cultural protector, but this has turned into a hard core political battle with the BJP operating behind Kangana. The Sena has so far handled it well and it will have to deal with it politically,” he said. A Shiv Sena Member of Parliament, who did not wish to be named, said being in power puts certain restrictions on reactions. “We have to remain conscious of not breaking the law. What happened in the case of the ex-Navy officer was an aberration. Shiv Sainiks will not tolerate anything against the Thackeray family,” he said. Amid the criticism over the assault of the former Naval officer, Sena minister Anil Parab said, “Although we are sitting in power, it does not mean that anybody can say anything to us. Our activists will not tolerate this.” He added that restraint should be observed from both sides. Sena MP and party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said Mumbai and Maharashtra are being projected in poor light as part of a “conspiracy” to defame the Maharashtra government. He said the issue is being kept alive for Bihar elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-vs-shiv-sena-a-new-fight-begins-in-maharashtra/story-qzdgKnJOBR7mK7mCWMjRAP.html

16-09-2020||City||Gurugram: 28-year-old man beaten to death; personal enmity suspected||Gurugram: Ten days after a 28-year-old man came to the city in search of a job, he died of injuries suffered from an assault by two unidentified men on Jharsa road near sector 31 early on Tuesday morning, said police. Police said the motive for the alleged murder is still unclear. The deceased was identified by his first name as Pankaj, a native of Bhadaf village in Kanina of Mahendragarh district. Arriving in the city on September 5, Pankaj stayed at the house of his friend, construction supervisor Ajay Kumar, in Rajiv Nagar in sector 13. In the police complaint, Kumar said that around 1am Tuesday, a woman had come to visit Pankaj. ”Pankaj told me to withdraw some money from his account. I withdrew ₹500 and gave it to him and went to the roof to lie down on a folding bed,” it read. “After the woman left, Pankaj came to the terrace and was talking to someone on the phone. He said he has to meet someone and asked me to accompany him.” At around 2.10 am, said police, they rode a motorcycle towards Atul Kataria Chowk. Near a restaurant on Jharsa service road, the motorcycle broke down. While dragging the vehicle towards the nearest fuel station, two men arrived on a white scooter and intercepted them. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The suspects parked their scooter and slapped the victims. Ajay managed to run and hide in a lane nearby. Pankaj was severely beaten up and kicked. The assailants then left on their scooter and also took the keys of the motorcycle along.” Kumar allegedly told police that Pankaj had lost consciousness and a commuter helped rush him to a private hospital in Jharsa. “After treatment, I gave him a medicine and we returned home. At 5am, he complained of severe pain in his private parts where the accused had kicked him repeatedly. So, I took him to a private hospital in sector 13, from where he was referred to another private hospital in sector 38. The doctors then referred him to civil hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.” Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Personal enmity could be the reason for the alleged murder. The victim had received a phone call following which he and his friend went to meet someone. The victim’s phone is locked at the moment. We will check the call detail records and ascertain who had made the phone call. We are also checking CCTVs in the area to trace the suspects.” The victim’s body was handed over to his family after the post-mortem. A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) at sector 40 police station on Tuesday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-28-year-old-man-beaten-to-death-personal-enmity-suspected/story-ejw8kulKdtQ33osIFXnL3H.html
16-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: ‘Burglars looked for uncollected newspapers, unclean floor to target homes’||The police arrested two persons, allegedly members of a gang, on Monday night from Badshahpur for their alleged involvement in at least 50 daytime burglaries in various residential areas across the city over the past year. Jewellery, laptops and other valuables were recovered from their possession, said police. Police said the suspects used to visit residential areas during the afternoon and target houses on the basis of uncollected newspapers and unclean floor. This indicated that the house was temporarily unoccupied, said police. Police identified the two suspects as 22-year-old Kallu and 24-year-old Sonu, from Nadia in West Bengal and were allegedly two of the four members of the alleged gang. Police said they had a criminal history and were jailed and later released from Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Acting on tips, the crime team arrested the duo while they were partying at one of their relative’s house in Badshahpur. Police said that a hunt is on to arrest two other members of the gang. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that a person named Amit Kumar, a resident of Sector 57, had complained on February 13 that his home was burgled. Kumar and his family had gone out of town for two days and, upon return, found that burglars had made away with cash, jewellery and electronic gadgets. In all, items worth ₹5 lakh were stolen, said police. “We recovered leads from several CCTV footage from crime scenes. The two suspects were seen making rounds of the area several times. Their modus operandi was to get inside residential areas and target houses that were locked by posing as domestic helps looking for jobs. They would steal whatever they could and carried them in bags stolen from victim’s houses,” said Sangwan. The police suspect that the two were aided by two others, who kept watch while their accomplices broke into the houses. “They would switch off their mobile phones to avoid police’s technical surveillance. They also bought new SIM cards after every theft,” Sangwan said. The police said that the gang members armed themselves with knives but had never used them in the cases. “They would enter the residential areas looking for jobs and if anyone stopped them, they would give false information and fake names to get in.”The suspects would allegedly sell the stolen jewellery to a goldsmith in Old Delhi and in remote areas of Uttar Pradesh. The police said that cases are registered against the gang members in at least six police stations of the city, and they are working on identifying more such cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-burglars-looked-for-uncollected-newspapers-unclean-floor-to-target-homes/story-SbZRQyUcBKO8WfKiklxL8K.html
16-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG to issue notice to officials for being absent from finance meeting||For ensuring greater accountability and better supervision of its engineering department, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to start issuing show-cause notices to officials who remain absent from the civic body’s finance and contract (F&CC) meeting. The civic body has also decided that from now on, a copy of every project work order will have to be submitted to the three mayors and the local councillor of the area to which the project has been allocated. These measures are meant to prevent any irregularities in the project. The F&CC meeting, which is chaired by the three mayors, is responsible for approving civic projects costing between ₹1.5 crore-₹2.5 crore. Projects costing above ₹2.5 crore are sent to the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) for approval. As per mayor Madhu Azad, most executive engineers remain absent from the F&CC meetings despite directions from MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, asking them to be present.Azad said that all eight executive engineers of MCG have been directed to attend the F&CC meeting as projects pertaining to their area need to be approved and questions pertaining to the projects need to be answered.“We need the presence of executive engineers in the meeting as various questions and doubts pertaining to projects need to be addressed. If something seems amiss, they need to be present physically so as to clear the doubts or else the approval is delayed till the next F&CC meeting. This often hampers the development work. As such, a decision has been taken to issue a show-cause notice to officials concerned so that disciplinary action can be initiated against them if they are absent from the meetings,” said Azad.Azad further said that for projects costing below ₹1 crore, which is approved by engineering officials themselves, it has been decided that a copy of every project work order needs to be submitted to the three mayors and the councillor of the area to which the project has been allocated.“There have been many cases in the past one year, where major discrepancies and irregularities have been found in both the work allotment and payment of funds for projects by the engineering wing officials. Hence, for greater transparency and close monitoring of development works it has been decided that a copy of each work order would be sent to the three mayors as well as the local councillor of the area,” said Azad.Azad pointed out that the ULB had also issued directions to municipal corporations across the state, asking their engineering wing to submit a copy of every work order to mayors and local councillors.“Reminders have been sent to the engineering wing for attending the F&CC meetings as well as submitting a copy of work orders to mayors as well as local councillors. If both these directions are not followed, disciplinary action would be taken against concerned officials as per the law,” said the MCG commissioner.Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, said, “Directions have already been issued to all executive engineers concerned to submit their work orders to the mayors and councillors. Further, they have been warned against remaining absent from any future F&CC meetings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-to-issue-notice-to-officials-for-being-absent-from-finance-meeting/story-Ofy0wuFAGrKGrpDCk9h4oL.html
16-09-2020||City||Gurugram’s air quality deteriorates in September||Gurugram: For the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, the city recorded air quality in the ‘moderate’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin. The city’s AQI reading on Tuesday stood at 130, and has ranged between 116 and 177 since September 9. This is in contrast to the period between September 1 and September 8, when Gurugram’s air pollution levels were largely in the ‘satisfactory’ category, with an AQI value oscillating between 51 and 100. Experts said this phenomenon is a natural occurrence for this time of the year, but also attributed a growing quantity of vehicular emissions for rapidly deteriorating air quality in Gurugram. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist who regularly tracks data from government and privately owned monitoring devices, said, “August had a lot of good air days because of fewer vehicles and also a good amount of rain, much more than in the last two or even three years. September has been drier and with more traffic. There is still just enough moisture in the air to make particulate pollutants, like PM2.5 and PM10, heavy enough that they won’t be blown away by wind, but not heavy enough that they settle down on the ground. They continue to remain airborne.”Panwar added that a strong spell of rain would be enough to break this trend. This view was echoed by Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Gurugram. Singh explained that the prevailing spell of moderate air has more to do with the absence of rain than a steep drop in temperature. “The summer heat has passed, but the process of thermal inversion, where a sudden drop in mercury brings down the mixing heights of pollutants closer to the earth’s surface, will occur much later into the winter,” he said.However, Singh and Panwar both emphasised that the incoming winter pollution cycle is likely to be less severe this year, due to reasons stemming from the Covid-19 outbreak, coupled with favourable rainfall patterns. “For one, there will be less travel happening and fewer cars on the street. Emissions from the summer season have a direct impact on pollution levels during the winter, and since air quality during the lockdown, during peak summer, was largely favourable, we can expect the winter pollution levels to be the lowest in a few years,” Panwar said. On the other hand, the HSPCB regional officer said that the onset of severe air quality, which typically happens around mid-November, may be delayed this year by about a week or two. “While AQI numbers from the past year can’t be compared with 2020, because they are now calculated based on a larger data set from new HSPCB monitors, the individual monitors are all recording pollution parameters at lower concentrations than you’d typically expect. We usually start seeing poor air around the end of September, but this year poor air may set in around mid-October, owing to the lockdown’s impact,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-s-air-quality-deteriorates-in-september/story-Uof9wB6jx3crqMCIAFEtBN.html
16-09-2020||City||Centre okays Haryana Orbital Rail link between Palwal and Sonipat||The Union cabinet on Tuesday approved the construction of the Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor Project from Palwal to Sonipat aimed at decongesting the railway network in the National Capital Region (NCR).The project is estimated to cost Rs 5,617 crore and completed over five years.The project will see rail lines bypassing Delhi and is a crucial infrastructure project for the Indian Railways. A Haryana government spokesperson said the corridor will render rail travel facility to 20,000 passengers everyday other than carrying more than 50 million tonnes of freight every year. The alignment of this 121-km project is adjacent to the western peripheral (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal) Expressway and has been under consideration for some time. The project will have connectivity with all the existing railway routes originating from Delhi and passing through Haryana State as well as with the Dedicated Freight Corridor network.“This rail line will start from Palwal and end at the existing Harsana Kalan station (on Delhi-Ambala section). This will also connect with the existing Patli Station (on Delhi-Rewari line), Sultanpur station (on Garhi Harsaru-Farukhnagar Line) and Asaudha Station (on Delhi Rohtak Line),” read a statement from the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).The project will be implemented by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HRIDC), a joint venture company set up by the ministry of railways with the government of Haryana. Private stakeholders will also participate.It is expected that the districts of Palwal, Nuh, Gurugram, Jhajjar and Sonipat districts of Haryana will benefit with this rail line.“This will facilitate diversion of traffic not meant for Delhi thus decongesting NCR and will help in developing multimodal logistics hubs in Haryana State sub-region of NCR. It will provide high-speed seamless connectivity of this region to Dedicated Freight Corridor network resulting in reduction of cost and time of transportation for EXIM (export-import) traffic from NCR to ports of India, making exports of goods more competitive,” the Cabinet statement read.In a statement, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said this would strengthen the roads and railways network in the national capital region||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-okays-haryana-orbital-rail-link-between-palwal-and-sonipat/story-QAisciX7qQpgyfN1dhbTSI.html
16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Centre tells HC: Ashok Khemka not eligible for central government appointment||The Centre has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that senior Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka cannot be considered for appointment to the central government as he did not fulfil the eligibility criterion. The Centre said Khemka had ‘nil’ central experience at the time of consideration of his batch for empanelment at additional secretary level. “Empanelment at senior levels cannot be claimed as a matter of right; and it is for the competent authority to decide the suitability of the officer for empanelment in terms of the relevant guidelines/ instructions. ..petitioner has been left out from empanelment ....because he did not fulfil the eligibility criteria,” Subandhu Basu, under secretary, department of personnel and training, said in an affidavit. In July, Khemka had filed a plea challenging a Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order, wherein, his plea seeking direction to Centre to consider his empanelment was dismissed. The Centre’s response has come in that plea. The court was told that after April 2016, officers who had not completed a single year of central deputation but were currently serving at the Centre may be considered for empanelment along with the next batch. Otherwise, officers who had been serving at the Centre for more than a year were also being considered for empanelment with their batch. The petitioner lost opportunity for consideration of his candidature on his own volition, it stated. The Centre told court that even the CAT had recorded that his claims on deputation at the Centre on various occasion were ‘at best, intermittent and not sustained’ and that he appeared to be misleading the court by citing example of other officers who were serving at Centre. The court was given details of some such appointments. The Centre also stated that Khemka’s claim that his consent was taken for appointment in the Prime Minister’s Office, was never recommended by the appointment committee of the cabinet (ACC). It has also been argued that appointment at top level posts at Centre requires some level of experience at lower level posts in Union government to understand its system and functioning. Even CAT had opined that it is a perfectly logical expectation and hence such classification cannot be considered unreasonable, it has submitted. “...Empanelment is more of a suitability of an officer to occupy senior levels in the central government,” the Centre told the court, denying allegations of arbitrariness or discrimination and seeking dismissal of petition with ‘costs’. The Centre also said that a certain record sought by Khemka on central government appointments can’t be shared under RTI Act 2005 as they are exempted from disclosure. The matter will be taken up on October 14 for final hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-tells-hc-ashok-khemka-not-eligible-for-central-government-appointment/story-wGxK2IWIGozHudNJBB2MtO.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s ridge board to rule on projects without independent members||The fate of at least 10 major infrastructure projects that will directly affect the city’s Ridge— the green lungs of the national capital — is likely to be decided by the Supreme Court-mandated Ridge Management Board (RMB), on Friday without its two independent expert members present. The RMB, headed by the chief secretary, was formed in 1995 on the directions of the apex court, to preserve the Ridge. It has scheduled a meeting on September 18 to discuss at least 10 projects that will affect the Ridge. The Ridge is the northern extension of the Aravalli Range, extending from Tughlaqabad in south-east to the north near Wazirabad, covering a distance of about 35km.The Delhi Ridge acts as the green lungs of the capital and, through various government orders over the years, all construction has been banned in the Ridge in an effort to preserve it. While six of the eight members of the RMB are permanent, two are nominated environment experts who represent the public interest and ensure transparency in the functioning of the board. Sunita Narain, director-general of environment NGO Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Vimlendu Jha, executive director of NGO Swechha, were nominated as the two independent expert members for a tenure of two years, which ended last March. But since new independent experts are yet to be nominated, the board will meet on September 18, minus the two experts. Officials privy to the RMB’s workings, said both Narain and Jha have been asked to attend the meeting as ‘special invitees’, but they refused on the grounds that the board needs to be reconstituted before any meeting can be scheduled. They also confirmed that since Narain and Jha are not “nominated members” anymore, their opinions will not be binding on the board. “The board technically has not been complete since March 2019. Both these experts have been invited as special guests and they can give their suggestions only as experts, but the board will be under no obligation to follow them. However, if they were attending as members, their votes could have swayed the fate of the projects discussed,” a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified, said. The list of projects to be discussed includes permissions for the 22km Tughlakabad-Aerocity corridor of the Delhi Metro’s Phase 4, which has proposed four stations on Ridge land. The meeting agenda will also look into the proposal for the Delhi-Alwar corridor of the Regional Rapid Transit System, which will cross the Ridge area. The meeting agenda also includes proposals for the construction of the campus of Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, two skill centres and a new laboratory complex, all abutting the Ridge. Documents accessed by Hindustan Times show that tenure of the last RMB expired last March , after which the board was not reconstituted. A senior official from the forest department, without wanting to be named, confirmed that a request for the reconstitution of the board was sent to the Delhi environment minister’s office in November 2018, but the proposal is still awaiting a clearance. “The proposal to renominate Narain and Jha was sent from our end but the file is pending approval,” the official said. Responding to HT’s query, environment minister Gopal Rai’s office Tuesday said “the file, with the names of the expert members, is in the process of being cleared”. While both Narain and Jha refused to comment on the matter, Narain confirmed that she had written to the Delhi government that she will only attend the RMB meeting once the board has been reconstituted. Environment activist Ravi Agarwal, a former member of the RMB for over 12 years, said the board was constituted to ensure that decisions taken by government agencies were transparent. “It is illegal to have meetings of the RMB without all members present. The whole idea behind the board was to ensure public scrutiny, and independent members made that possible. Without them, the board is just an internal group headed by the chief secretary. Which junior official will ever go against the CS’s decision?” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-ridge-board-to-rule-on-projects-without-independent-members/story-0EridLCfOQ8UPuNJcQhvOP.html
16-09-2020||Gurugram||Sohna road project: Work on ground level to resume this week, says NHAI||The work on Sohna road project, which was suspended after an elevated section collapsed span on August 22, will be restarted in stretches at the ground level within the week, said National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials on Tuesday. However, the elevated section work would resume only after a report is received from a five-member high-level technical committee that is probing the incident. A report by an independent engineer on the measures taken to improve the safety and to reduce vulnerability has, meanwhile, been submitted to the authority, NHAI officials added.Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, said that seamless barricading and grilles have been installed and marshalls deployed for traffic management at the ground level work. This, he said, could be started in the next two to three days. “The report on the safety measures and related issues by the independent engineer is being studied. The work on stretches at ground level where no major construction is taking place and spans are not being launched can be allowed to resume in next two to three days,” he said. The elevated sections of the project, Mittal said would begin only after they have studied the high-level committee report on the incident in which spans between pier 10 And pier 11 near Vipul Greens condominium collapsed. Mittal did not clarify by when the report was expected.The five-member technical committee has directed for testing the strength of concrete being used for construction of spans from a private laboratory. It has also sought the details of statement used for launching the spans at the project site. The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project is being constructed in two packages. The first part comprises an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk towards Badshahpur covering 6 km. The section that collapsed was a part of the first package. The second part comprises the expansion of 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and involves construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch. The deadline for both these projects is July, 2021.A senior official of Oriental Structures Ltd, the contractor for the project said that they have taken all safety related measures recommended by NHAI. “The independent engineer has already submitted the report and we are expecting the project director to hold an inspection on Wednesday after which the work could be allowed to be restarted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sohna-road-project-work-on-ground-level-to-resume-this-week-says-nhai/story-alWiqQvxnOMpCpQMZmygBI.html
16-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana: Districts asked to ramp up Covid-19 facilities||As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to spike, the state health department on Tuesday asked all districts to ramp up facilities for management of the pandemic. Gurugram on Monday reported 324 new cases, taking the total count of coronavirus patients in in Gurugram to 15,909. With this, the number of active cases has also reached 2439, almost 15.33% of the total cases.“Special focus is on Covid-19 bed management. Due to an increase in the number of cases, hospitalisation has been increasing. Besides hospitals, all private medical colleges have also been asked to ramp up the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer. He said that dedicated Covid-19 hospital — Medeor — in Manesar for seriously ill patients will also make its 120 beds fully functional in the coming weeks. On Monday, the district administration directed all private hospitals to increase Covid-19 bed capacity from 25% to 35%. Currently, 200 patients are hospitalised in 40 hospitals of the city, while 2203 are under home isolation and 36 in dedicated Covid-19 isolation facilities set up by the district administration. To ensure that hospitals have facilities to handle Covid-19 patients, the district health department has been asked to ensure adequate oxygen availability in all healthcare set up, along with unrestricted intra as well as inter-state movement of oxygen cylinders. “Gurugram is not facing any problem related to oxygen availability at present,” said Yadav Also, two deaths were confirmed on Tuesday, taking the toll to 151. Of these, 106 are deaths due to co-morbidities and 45 without co-morbidity. “Although the mortality rate of the district is 0.94%, the state has directed to keep a check on it,” said Yadav. In September alone, 18 deaths have been reported, more than the August’s count of 10. At the state level too, the total number of fatalities have reached 1026. The current fatality rate of the state is 1.04%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-districts-asked-to-ramp-up-covid-19-facilities/story-wmpKE6gBaVuMaNNL9zR2hK.html
16-09-2020||City||As Covid-19 cases rise, Rohtak’s PGIMS engaged to test samples from Gurugram||Gurugram: As the number of Covid-19 cases rise in the district, about 500 samples for confirmatory reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are now being sent every day to a government lab at PGIMS, Rohtak. According to officials, the health department collects an average of 1,700 samples per day for RT-PCR testing, but has the capacity to test only about 1,200 of those samples in a day at the Civil Hospital in Gurugram, which has necessitated outsourcing some of the tests.“Naturally, increasing number of cases has put a strain on our ability to test and we have to send some samples elsewhere. Gurugram is still processing more samples each day than any other district in Haryana. A vehicle is sent to Rohtak every day after sample collection. The vials are stored in an ice box to maintain the integrity of the swab and a lab technician is present in the vehicle, as was done earlier when we did not have testing facilities here,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.Data from the health department’s daily bulletin also shows an increased backlog of tests awaiting lab results, which stood at 3,382 samples on Tuesday (up from 3,288 samples on Monday). However, an official clarified that about 1,600 of these samples included swabs collected for RT-PCR tests on the same day itself. “The actual backlog is much lesser, though still a bit higher than it used to be,” said a senior lab technician with the health department, who is also tasked with transporting samples to Rohtak.The health officials also said they are considering sending some samples to be tested at private labs, to expand the district’s capacity to 5,000 tests per day, with a focus on RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard in diagnostic testing for Covid-19. For the past two days, the district has been conducting about 4,000 tests per day.“With an increasing number of cases, the focus needs to be on RT-PCR. Rapid antigen tests are the quickest way to isolate, but many people are coming in with flu symptoms and they will need to be retested in any case. So, the plan is to maintain a higher number of RT-PCR tests. We may use the private labs’ surplus capacity to test our own samples if necessary,” said Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram.However, the health department officials did not mention any plan to boost the existing testing infrastructure, by procuring more RT-PCR machines or newer generation RT-PCR kits, which produce results in about three hours. “At the moment, we have enough capacity to conduct RT-PCR tests. When the need comes, then of course the necessary equipment will be procured,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-19-cases-rise-rohtak-s-pgims-engaged-to-test-samples-from-gurugram/story-Wb81ZYT4d7u7JXzX1ra1YI.html

Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause paralysis and affects mostly children under five years. It is mostly spread through unhygienic practices. The pulse polio immunization usually involves setting up booths and house visits by around 15,000 health care workers in the districts. But with the pandemic, around 13,000 workers are engaged in surveillance and testing for the coronavirus disease Covid-19.Health officials said that, this time, only 2500 health care workers will be involved in the pulse polio drive to innoculate 77,000 children in high-risk areas from September 20 to 22. “In the pre-coronavirus time, at least 350,000 children were covered, which has been reduced to 77,000 kids as most of the healthcare workers who are deployed for pulse polio drive are already involved in the surveillance and monitoring of Covid-19 patients,” said Dr. Naresh Kumar Garg, Gurugram deputy civil surgeon, who is also the nodal officer for polio immunisation.Although there have been no cases of polio reported in the district since 2010 in the state, unhygienic practices remain a concern.“Gurugram is among the 13 high-risk districts of Haryana. It is, therefore, crucial to conduct polio immunization drive. It cannot be held back due to the pandemic,” said Garg. Recently, Uttar Pradesh government postponed its pulse polio vaccination drive citing the Covid-19 pandemic and that its accredited social health activist (ASHA), auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and other health workers were currently exposed to Covid-19 patients. In April, the Union ministry of health and family welfare had issued guidelines on resuming non-Covid essential services, including polio immunisation. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that those at risk have to be prioritized while catching up with the vaccination if services are suspended.Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer, said, “At least 425 high-risk locations have been identified where pulse polio booths will be set up. Since staff is limited, the department has approached the deputy commissioner to get assistance from non-government organisations (NGOs) with volunteers. In these polio high-risk areas, Covid-19 test will also continue with the help of different teams. Covid-19 testing will not be affected.” High-risk zones have been identified under each Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC). These are mostly slum areas or small colonies inhabited by migrant population. “Like in Pataudi, there are 80 booths and 70 in Badshahpur since these area are largely dominated by migrant population,” said Garg. The vaccination drive will continue for three days. On September 20, booth activity will take place, while on the second day, health care workers will do house-to-house visit to give polio drops to infants and children till five years of age. On the last day, September 22, children, who could not be reached out on the first two days, will be covered. According to Dr. Garg, health care workers will be tested for Covid-19 before the vaccination drive. “They will be equipped with masks and sanitisers. They will not touch the kid as parents will be asked to open the child’s mouth and the vaccine will be dropped from a distance by the health worker taking safety measure,” said he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-decides-to-curtail-polio-drive-as-staff-battle-with-covid/story-A8ex2TXKPwA2Lpu6OS6qpN.html
16-09-2020||Education||St Stephen’s cut-off out, 99.25% needed for Eco (hons)||Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College on Tuesday released its first cut-off for ten undergraduate courses with the highest being 99.25% for applicants for BA Economics (Hons). This is a marginal increase of 0.50 percentage points from last year when the highest cut-off was set at 98.75% for students from commerce background opting for BA Economics (Hons).The college has also issued a caveat that for admission in Economics (Hons) students need to score 95% or above in Mathematics. Last year, it was 90%.Most of the other courses have also seen an increase of 0.25 to one percentage point in the cut-offs. At 99%, the cut-off for BA English (Hons) has gone up by 0.25 percentage points from last year. Students hoping to get admission in the course must also score more than 90% in English Core or 85% in English elective.Applicants from commerce and science backgrounds, who want to get admission in BA History (Hons) also need to score 99% or above in order to be eligible for the course. For Philosophy (Hons), the cut-off stands at 98% this year for students from Commerce background and 98.75% and 97% for students from Humanities and Science streams.For the BA programme too, the cut-offs have increased by a percentage point at 99% for students from Commerce and Science streams. For Humanities students, the cut-off has seen been set at 98%. The lowest cut-off, like last year, is for Sanskrit (Hons) at 70%.The cut-off for BSc Physics (Hons) has also been increased from 96.66% last year to 97.66% this year. For Chemistry (Hons) too, the cut-offs have increased from 96.33% last year to 96.67% this year. For Mathematics (Hons), applicants from Science and Commerce streams must score 98% and above in the subject to be eligible for admission.The college will begin conducting interviews for various subjects since there will be no written test this year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the college had earlier announced that it would conduct online interviews of the applicants.St Stephen’s College, being a religious minority institution, fixes its own admission process and reserves 50% seats for Christian students. After releasing cut-offs for undergraduate courses, the college conducts tests and interviews, which together have a weightage of 15 marks. The remaining 85 marks are decided on the performance of candidates in their Class 12 exams. However, this year, the entire 15 marks will be given on the basis of the interview.While St Stephen’s College principal John Verghese did not respond to calls, Hindu College principal Anju Shrivastava said, “I don’t foresee any decrease in the first cut-offs compared to last year. This is based on the data that we have seen in media reports so far. If Stephen’s has also kept cut-offs on the higher side, it is likely that the numbers will remain similar or higher than last year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/st-stephen-s-cut-off-out-99-25-needed-for-eco-hons/story-4062L4BYnCAIO8uE2er1sN.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro launches first indigenous signal system||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Tuesday took a major step towards development of an indigenously-built communication-based train control with the launch of i-ATS — the first Made-in-India signalling system.The ATS (or Automatic Train Supervision) is a computer-based system, which manages train operations, including basic functioning such as running and halting. The i-ATS will significantly reduce the dependence of Indian Metros on foreign vendors dealing with such technologies, officials said. The prototype,as well as a state of the art laboratory for further development of the technology, was inaugurated on Tuesday at the Metro’s Shastri Park depot by Union housing and urban affairs secretary, Durga Shanker Mishra, amid the presence of DMRC managing director Mangu Singh, Bharat Electronics Ltd director Shikha Gupta, and other senior officials from DMRC and BEL.  Some of the important features of this technology are that it can work with train control and signalling systems of different suppliers, which ensures that in case of a snag, the operators will not have to depend on foreign manufacturers. The i-ATS can also work with different levels of technology of train control and signalling systems. Mishra said, “It is a really proud occasion to start something like this which is going to add strength to our Aatma Nirbhar Bharat initiative.” Mangu Singh said that the new technology was a step forward towards the development of indigenous systems required in operation of Metro railways. “I am sure that we will be able to work together and scale newer heights to completely indigenise Metro railway construction as well as operations,” he said. Technology systems such as the CBTC, which are also currently in use in the Delhi Metro corridors, are primarily controlled by the European countries and Japan. As part of the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had decided to indigenise the CBTC technology. DMRC has decided to use indigenous ATS (i-ATS) while upgrading the ATS of line 1 (Red Line) i.e. from Rithala to Shaheed Sthal, Ghaziabad. The same shall also be used in all of the upcoming corridors in phase-four.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-launches-first-indigenous-signal-system/story-uhlhq1AxqooHdyfOESCZNL.html

All such files are to be uploaded again using a different app or cropped so as to remove the app watermark.Since the nationwide lockdown in March, Delhi courts have been hearing cases virtually via video conferencing. That required lawyers and officials to scan all pertinent documents and email them to the parties and the judge concerned.The circular also noted that some officials are forwarding copies of circulars, bail orders, daily orders etc after scanning them on Chinese apps, which is in violation of the Centre’s directions.“It has also been noticed that some circulars and orders have already been updated on the official website after being scanned on banned Chinese applications,” it read.In August, a Delhi court had asked a lawyer to avoid the use of banned app CamScanner in legal work. Additional sessions judge Sunil Chaudhary said the bail application, filed by advocate Praveen Chaudhary, was scanned using CamScanner.“This is an application for grant of bail as received through mail. The application as filed is scanned using CamScanner which has been banned by the Government of India. The counsel is advised to avoid using banned apps for legal work in the future,” the court said on August 5.On June 29, the IT ministry, while banning 59 mobile apps, had cited numerous complaints from various quarters, including reports about misuse of some apps for allegedly “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting user data in an unauthorised manner to servers located outside India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stop-using-banned-chinese-apps-for-legal-work-says-circular-to-all-officials-in-delhi-courts/story-evY5Kur1RlUrQj3TqqeOGM.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||36 succumb to Covid-19 in Delhi, highest in 60 days||Delhi reported 36 deaths due to coronavirus disease on Tuesday, the highest in over 60 days. Of the 36 deaths, 33 happened on Monday and three on Sunday, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. Despite the increase in the absolute number of deaths, the case fatality ratio (CFR) – fraction of people who die among those who test positive – has been on the decline. The cumulative CFR of Delhi since March 2, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in the city, stands at 2.13% so far. However, Delhi’s CFR over the last seven days stands at just 0.65%, meaning most of the deaths in the city were recorded during the surge in cases in June. The number of hospitalisations also saw a record high of 6,658, according to Tuesday’s health bulletin. The highest number of hospitalisations on any given day was just over 6,200 during the surge in cases in June. “The number of deaths are unlikely to shoot up this time as all the treatment protocols have been standardised,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. About 101 deaths had been recorded in a single day during the previous surge in cases, according to data provided by the CM office.Also read| Covid-19: Concerns over antigen test strategy after Delhi assembly scareAfter a dip on Sunday, Delhi conducted over 62,000 tests for Covid-19, the highest number of tests conducted in a day so far. The city recorded 4,263 new cases – similar to the numbers previously recorded – even with the high number of tests. Of the total tests, only 16.5% were conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR test. The other rapid antigen test is known to throw false negatives. This resulted in a drop in the positivity rate – fraction of people who test positive among those tested – to 6.8%, according to Tuesday’s daily health bulletin. This is the first time the positivity rate has dipped below 7% since third week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/36-succumb-to-covid-in-delhi-highest-in-60-days/story-IGpVwaEmkPrIGWAO9mbiQN.html
16-09-2020||Delhi||Three held for killing man, dumping his body on street||A 24-year-old woman, along with her sibling and a friend — both of whom are transgender persons, according to the police — were arrested Monday for allegedly killing a man and dumping his body on a street near the man’s home in north Delhi’s Wazirabad five days ago, the police said. The man worked with a weekly newspaper in north-east Delhi. The man’s body was found near the stairs of a house by its occupants around 8am on September 11. By afternoon, police had identified the body as that of Sahil, 23, after circulating his photographs on local WhatsApp groups. The man’s mother saw the pictures and identified the body, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse. After finding strangulation marks on the body, the police registered a murder case and scanned CCTV footage in which three women were seen dumping the body after bringing it in an auto. “We focused our probe on the auto-rickshaw. After minutely scanning the footage, we found “Ansul Ki Gaddi” written on the rear of the auto. We examined nearly 200 autos and finally found the driver who had dropped the women along with the body,” said an investigator. His questioning led them to a hospital and from there to the suspects, police said. A senior police officer said Sahil’s friend Priya and two trans women assaulted and strangled him at their home in Shastri Park during a fight that started when he began making sexual advances at Priya in front of the other two after consuming alcohol on the night of September 10. “When she tried to stop his advances, Sahil burnt her with a cigarette. The three of them got angry over this and a fight broke out. The trio then throttled him to death with his belt,” said a senior police officer associated with the murder case. DCP Alphonse said the trio panicked and decided to take Sahil to a hospital. They hired an auto-rickshaw and reached Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital. But they did not go in for fear of being arrested. They hired another auto-rickshaw and told the driver that the “unconscious man” was their relative and they wanted to take him home as the doctors told them his chances of survival were minimal, police said. The three took Sahil’s body into a lane some 100 metres away from his home. After the driver left, the trio dumped Sahil’s body near the stairs of a house and fled. When the police found the auto driver, he told them he didn’t know that it was a body he was transporting. The police scanned the footage from hospital and found the women in it. “We showed their images to Sahil’s family and they identified one of them as his girlfriend. A police team searched her home but found her and her two relatives missing. We traced them to their village in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-two-transgenders-held-for-killing-man-dumping-his-body-on-street/story-0w5g6Xx73tLzvu5xRmz9nI.html

One of the reasons behind parents unable to complete the admission process was the arrangement and submission of necessary documents in time due to the lockdown and other issues during the Covid period. As on September 15, out of the total 100,926 seats selected for the RTE admissions, 64,311 students have confirmed the admission. While 36,615 students have been unable to complete the admission process and so their admissions were not confirmed. The RTE admission process was delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the 9,331 RTE registered schools in the state for this year, 115,460 RTE vacancies were available. For this, 291,368 applications were received and 100,926 students were selected. In Pune district, at the 972 RTE registered schools for this year, 16,949 RTE vacancies were available. A total of 62,919 applications were received and 16,617 students were selected. As on September 15, 10,419 students have confirmed the admission. “We have got the RTE selection for my son in Class 1, but as we were unable to get all the necessary documents, still the admission procedure is not completed. The authorities should extend the deadline by at least a month so that parents who are unable to get necessary documents can do so. With many schools yet to open citing coronavirus restrictions, we are unable to contact the school administration and cite our case.” said Ramesh Jadhav, a parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-36-000-rte-seats-remain-vacant-in-the-state/story-Srfg8kX8pvyj0N6rcJAaWL.html
16-09-2020||Pune||Nashik farmers protest Centre’s ban on onion exports||PUNE: The Centre’s decision to ban export of onion has angered farmers and traders from Nashik and other districts in western Maharashtra with growers resorting to agitation at Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). According to Suvarna Jagtap, chairman, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, the rates of the commodity came down at Lasalgaon, home to among the largest onion markets in the country, as farmers and traders held protest on Tuesday. “Before the export ban circular, the average rate in the Lasalgaon APMC was Rs 2,500 per quintal. After the Centre’s decision, rates have crashed to Rs 500 per quintal. The farmers and traders have warned that the market will remain closed on Wednesday if the central government does not withdraw the decision,” said Jagtap. Protests were also held in other parts of Maharashtra, including Mungse, Pimpalgaon, Nampur and Umrane markets along with Pandharpur in Solapur where farmers stalled auctions. The onion growers from Nashik blocked the Mumbai-Agra Highway. Jagtap raised the question that if the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) had the stock of 1 lakh metric quintal, instead of export ban, they can bring these stocks in the market to control the prices. On Monday, rates were Rs 1,100 per quintal on the minimum side and Rs 3,209 on the higher end with Rs 2,950 as an average. However, the decision to ban exports brought down the price to Rs 2,700 per quintal hours later. The Union government on Monday banned the export of all varieties of onions with immediate effect, a move aimed at increasing availability and checking price of the commodity in the domestic market. The decision invited sharp political reactions with the Congress and the NCP, demanding withdrawal of ban. Maharashtra Congress unit chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “Just as onions had started getting a good price, Modi government has suddenly banned exports, which is injustice to the farmers. The ban should be immediately reversed. Against this unjust decision taken by the central government, Congress party will on Wednesday, September 16, hold statewide protest.” NCP chief and former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar met Commerce minister Piyush Goyal in Delhi. “The central government has abruptly announced a ban on #onionexports. This has led to strong reactions from the onion growing belt in Maharashtra & therefore the representatives of various political parties contacted & requested me to convey their demands to Central Government. To address this issue, I met Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Shri. Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) today and apprised him of the plight of onion growers. I pointed out to him that these onion growers are mainly small land holders and Jirait farmers,” Pawar said in series of tweets. Nampur APMC chairman in Nashik district Sanjay Bhamare who is also Bharatiya Janata Party’s Nashik district vice-president said, “Farmers and traders did the agitations on Tuesday. After the central government’s decision on Monday, despite the auction, traders rejected the purchase of the onion. It happened to almost all the APMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nashik-farmers-protest-centre-s-ban-on-onion-exports/story-cCu9NUBsMkY6cLUalnNiKI.html

Post-induction of the Rafale aircraft into the Indian Air Force, the ambassador said that strong strategic cooperation, military to military, exist between the two nations and areas like space cooperation, launching a satellite for climate observations, for example, will be a part of the future partnership strategy for the two nations. Lenain was speaking, via video-conference, on ‘Strategic Autonomy: A driver of French–Indian relations in the times of changing geopolitics’, at the launch of the ‘Ambassador Speaks’ series by the Pune International Centre. Referring to the emerging global security landscape, Lenain said, “This year has been an eye opener for Europe. The world is becoming dangerous and the world has powers that do not want to play by the rules. We consider India as positive and trust it for exemplary dependency. France will support India’s bid for a permanent seat at the United Nations.” Lenain said that both, France and India, have a strong bilateral relationship and the Covid crisis, which he called a “medical emergency”, has seen both nations do their level best to mitigate the crisis. As to a post-Covid world, Lenain said “The world will be a challenging place laced with unprecedented consequences. The crisis has exacerbated the problems further. Biodiversity, global terrorism, cyber threats are faced by the world and there is a need for corrective action. “During the pandemic situation, more cooperation is needed. A global strategy is needed to tackle emerging health issues and subsequent crises.” Former foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, chaired the session, while director general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), Prashant Girbane moderated the question-answer session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/launching-satellite-for-climate-observations-part-of-india-france-future-plans-lenain/story-4wMQBFmrEzY6ynNgabFyWI.html

16-09-2020||Delhi||Auto driver, phone repairman arrested for robberies in Delhi||Delhi police have arrested an autorickshaw driver and a mobile phone repairman for their alleged involvement in more than 15 recent robberies in Delhi and recovered two countrymade pistols from them.Police identified the two men as 28-year-old Mursleen alias Sameer Faheem and his associate Irshad, 32. While Faheem used to drive an autorickshaw before he took to crime, Irshad worked at a mobile repair shop. Police said Faheem has admitted his involvement in at least 15 cases of robbery and snatching. Irshad is involved in more than 20 previous cases.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said on September 11 his team got information that a man wanted in several cases of robbery and snatching would come to meet his associate near Nanaksar Gurudwara.“Around 3.50 pm when the suspect was spotted, he was intercepted and overpowered. A countrymade gun with two live cartridges was recovered from him and he was identified as Faheem. He was arrested,” the DCP said. During interrogation, Faheem said he had procured the weapon from one Jameel, who is a distant relative of his friend Irshad. “He said he is involved in many cases of robberies and snatching in Delhi along with his associates Sariq, Irshad and Mukul. As Sariq and Mukul had already been arrested in Seelampur recently, on Mursleen’s information, a police team travelled to Etah in Uttar Pradesh and arrested Irshad,” the DCP said.A countrymade pistol and two live cartridges were recovered from him. Irshad allegedly told police he is involved in 12 recent cases of robbery in Delhi with his associates. With the arrest, police claimed to have solved four robbery cases, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/auto-driver-phone-repairman-arrested-for-robberies-in-delhi/story-azFyKR3ewreMGhMgdGHuBM.html
16-09-2020||World||Greece: 4 Afghans charged with arson for fire at Lesbos camp||Four Afghan migrants were formally charged with arson Wednesday for their alleged involvement in fires that destroyed most of a large refugee camp on Greece’s eastern island of Lesbos, authorities said.The men, who have not been named, were led to a court on the island and later returned to police detention after being given three days to prepare their testimony.The fires swept through the overcrowded camp at Moria on two nights last week, prompting more than 12,000 migrants and refugees to flee. Nobody was hurt. Most of them remain without shelter, camped on a roadside near the gutted camp.Two other migrants allegedly involved in setting the fires are minors who are being held by police on the Greek mainland but have not been formally charged. They were among around 400 unaccompanied minors from Moria who were flown to the mainland after the fires.The Greek government maintains that the fires at Moria were set deliberately by migrants protesting confinement after the site was locked down due to an outbreak of Covid-19.Athens on Tuesday urged the European Union to jointly run new refugee camps on Greece’s eastern islands as part of an overhaul of the EU’s migration policies.“The images of the Moria camp are a painful reminder of the need for Europe to come together,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday during her state of the union address.“Everybody has to step up here and take responsibility – and the commission will do just that,” von der Leyen told lawmakers at the European Parliament, adding that the commission was working on a plan for a new camp on the island.“But I want to be clear: if we step up, then I expect all (EU) member states to step up, too. Migration is a European challenge ,and all of Europe must do its part,” she said.Greek army personnel have been building a new camp on the island, using tents for emergency housing for asylum-seekers left homeless by the fire. But many are reluctant to go to a new facility they fear could end up like the squalid Moria camp.The U.N. refugee agency’s representative in Greece, Philippe Leclerc, said about 1,100 people, mostly those considered vulnerable, had been housed at the new site by Wednesday afternoon, but that up to 8,000 could be accommodated. Leclerc encouraged more of the Moria camp’s former residents to move there.Greek officials have said they could forcibly remove people from the road near the burned-out camp where they have been sleeping rough and take them to the camp if people refuse to go.Leclerc noted that relocation to other European countries would only be for “a limited number of persons, in particular the unaccompanied children and some more vulnerable individuals.”Several European countries have pledged to take in some of the unaccompanied minors who were staying in Moria.“We asked for the support of other European countries to continue assisting Greece, which is hosting...more than 100,000 asylum-seekers and refugees,” Leclerc said.He stressed violence was not a solution for migrants and refugees to get off the island.“Despair is understandable, but it cannot justify the violence,” Leclerc said. “Violence...and burning will not provide any solution. We need (a) peaceful, orderly way of getting people out of Lesbos gradually. And this is what we are supporting,.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-4-afghans-charged-with-arson-for-fire-at-lesbos-camp/story-FjB8x5ZrtKtMB67WQGDkCN.html
16-09-2020||World||He’s 91 and worth billions. Now Jimmy Pattison is hunting deals||Canadian billionaire Jimmy Pattison says his phone won’t stop ringing. There’s nothing like a global crisis to drive deals to those with cash.“We’re looking today at opportunities like we’ve never had before,” Pattison said in an interview Monday via video conference from Vancouver. “We’ve never been in better shape to invest. The question now is, where do we feel comfortable?”Sometimes dubbed Canada’s Warren Buffett, the 91-year-old Pattison has a view of the pandemic’s impact that few can match. He presides over an empire that operates in some 85 countries spanning an array of industries: supermarkets, lumber, fisheries, disposable packaging, theme parks, auto dealers and more. Last year, the closely held Jim Pattison Group Inc. had C$10.9 billion ($8.3 billion) in revenue and employed 48,000 people.Pattison said he has been contacted by a number of private companies, some of them “significant” in size, that need money because of Covid-19 and the recession. He won’t speculate on where he’ll do his next deal. But he is certain that some of the economic changes wrought by the pandemic will be lasting. Airlines are out, downtown hotels face a difficult road back and the restaurant industry will never be the same, Pattison said.Among his own companies, the hardest hit have been tourism-related stalwarts like Ripley Entertainment Inc., which typically hosted 15 million visitors annually at its museums and aquariums, and the Canadian franchise of Great Wolf Lodge, a chain of indoor water parks.“I can tell you one thing -- there’s never been anything like this in the history of the world,” said Pattison, who grew up in western Canada during the Great Depression. “Going forward, it’s certainly going to affect what we buy.”Before the pandemic, “I’d have put 100% of our money into a Great Wolf Lodge, but I wouldn’t today.” The coronavirus isn’t a one-time risk either, he said. “It can happen again.”Climate FocusPattison, Canada’s fifth-richest person, built his empire from a single, loss-making Vancouver car dealership he acquired in 1961. His fortune today is worth about $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In his office hangs a framed photo of Pattison and Buffett with a message scribbled across the top by the head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: “To a man who’s built a business as interesting as Berkshire’s.”Pattison sits in a conference room at his 18th-floor headquarters in a tower that typically looks onto Vancouver’s pristine harbor and craggy, forest-draped mountains beyond. Recently, that view has been obscured by a sickly gray haze. Smoke from forest fires raging along the U.S. West Coast has been drifting north, at times making Vancouver No. 1 on the list of cities with the world’s most polluted air.“We have got to focus on the environment, the environment, the environment,” Pattison said. “Anything that is negative, in my opinion, to do with the environment is going out of business sooner or later.”It’s a remarkable shift in Pattison’s preoccupations. When interviewed by Bloomberg in 2018 over the course of two days, he never once mentioned climate change.But the signs have become impossible to ignore. Exploding pine beetle populations are decimating the province’s lumber industry, with major impacts on companies such as Vancouver-based Canfor Corp., of which Pattison holds 51%. The 700 boats his fishing business owns are finding it harder to catch fish in some places as oceans get warmer.“It is absolutely the number one thing that we have on our list when we’re looking at buying something -- how does that affect the environment,” Pattison said.Yet that conviction wavers when it comes to Westshore Terminals Investment Corp., the largest coal loading facility on the west coast of the Americas.“If people want to buy the coal -- we’re not selling the coal, we’re a service department, if you like, shipping it -- that’s not our decision,” he said, acknowledging it’s a cash cow with a shrinking life span. “There will be a day, in my opinion, when there will be no thermal coal going out of that terminal.”In the meantime, the former used car salesman is getting familiar with the trappings of the new energy economy. He spent last weekend test driving a Toyota hydrogen car around southwestern British Columbia.“All I’ve driven is engines all my life and so when you get something that’s this smooth and fast and goes like a dart and quiet,” he trails off, marveling. “Boy, I never drove anything nicer.”Succession PlanLike most, the coronavirus has changed Pattison’s daily life in unexpected ways. He values face-to-face interaction so much that he drives across part of Canada every year to visit his supermarkets and auto dealerships in person. Today, he estimates 70% of the desks at Pattison Group’s headquarters are empty and he’s wondering how to plan that annual road trip when communities fearful of the virus don’t welcome out-of-town license plates.“I’ll go as soon as I think they won’t throw tomatoes at me,” he said.Yet some things remain constant. Pattison still comes into his headquarters every day, as does Maureen Chant, his executive assistant for the past 57 years. He’s still acquiring car dealerships -- four more in the last 120 days.Pattison, who turns 92 on Oct. 1, talks matter-of-factly about his group’s succession plan, which he reviews and updates every quarter.“If I don’t make it to dinner tonight, we’re all set to go,” he said. He has lined up the directors, the management team, a role for a foundation, as well as the next chief executive officer.“There’s got to be one boss,” he said. Who will it be? “You’ll find out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-s-91-and-worth-billions-now-jimmy-pattison-is-hunting-deals/story-6BEeaGqqlUVfXnGsM5QzIK.html

According to reports, the new diktat has come from Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s sister. Seoul-based Daily NK has reported that the new diktat on ‘Greatness Education’ was introduced on August 25. It is aimed at “cultivating loyalty and trust toward North Korea’s leadership”. Previously, pre-school children had to attend only 30 minutes class on Kim Jong Un.The new curriculum reportedly tells preschoolers that when Kim Jong Un was just five years old, he was a bright child who “rode a yacht, did target practice, and liked to read”.Kim Yo Jong has become the de facto second-in-command in North Korea, South Korea’s intelligence agency has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-90-minutes-must-to-learn-about-kim-jong-un-north-korea-s-new-order/story-CXFEzs1zfcM8slcsUAVf4I.html
16-09-2020||World||After Senate defeats, Pak govt passes all FATF-linked bills via joint session||After a series of defeats in Senate, Pakistan government on Wednesday pushed all pending legislations on terror financing linked to FATF compliance through a joint session of parliament amid loud protests and a walkout by Opposition members.The Imran Khan government’s desperate move is part of efforts to get Pakistan out of the Financial Action Task Force’s ‘grey list’ and to prevent it from going further down to a ‘black list’. The global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering is set to review Pakistan’s compliance in October. FATF put Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action by the end of 2019, but the deadline was extended due to the coronavirus pandemic. The joint session of parliament was convened just hours after the Senate rejected the Anti-Terrorism (Third Amendment) Bill, 2020 in a 34-31 vote, a day after it was passed by the lower house, National Assembly.That was the third legislation rejected by the 104-member upper house in the past one month. The bill aimed to give powers to investigators to conduct undercover operations, intercept communications and access computer systems. It sought the insertion of Section 19-C in the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) relating to application of investigation techniques. At the joint session, all outstanding FATF-linked bills were moved by Advisor to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan. This included The Islamabad Capital Territory Waqf Properties Bill, 2020, The Anti-Money Laundering (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, and The Anti-Terrorism (Third Amendment) Bill, 2020.Prime Minister Khan was present in the house in a rare appearance to show his support for the passage of the bills. The Islamabad Capital Territory Waqf Properties Bill, 2020 is aimed at proper management, supervision, and administration of waqf properties in the territorial limits of the country’s capital. The Anti-Money Laundering (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020 is aimed at streamlining the existing anti-money laundering law in line with international standards prescribed by FATF. As the session started, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari sought Speaker Asad Qaiser’s permission to address the floor. But the request was denied, prompting many opposition leaders including Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif of PML-N to walk out. Pakistan has to meet a 27-point action plan to escape getting blacklisted by FATF as a non-compliant nation.Last month, Khan’s government enacted several laws and designated over 100 people as terrorists, in its efforts to evade the possible blacklisting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-senate-defeats-pak-govt-passes-fatf-linked-bills-via-joint-session/story-S9ep7yUFGKW17ZLzKOWM6M.html
16-09-2020||World||Belarusian police say officers’ personal data leaked online||The Belarusian police said on Wednesday that the personal data of 300 of its officers had been leaked online since the opposition began trying to expose the identities of members of the security forces involved in cracking down on mass protests.Unrest since an Aug. 9 election marred by vote-rigging allegations has tested the loyalty of the security forces and their backing has become critical to president Alexander Lukashenko’s chances of clinging onto power.During regular protests by tens of thousands of people over more than five weeks, some protesters have tried to physically unmask members of the security forces on the streets.On Wednesday, Andrei Parshin, a senior security official at the interior ministry, said 43 criminal cases had been opened against people who he said had threatened police, the Belta state news agency reported.“The data of about 300 police officers for the period from Aug. 9th have ended up online. More than 250 officers and their family members were subjected to pressure,” he was quoted as saying.Lukashenko denies rigging his landslide victory in last month’s election. Many prominent opposition figures have since either been jailed or fled.

16-09-2020||World||US outlines sweeping plan to provide free Covid-19 vaccines||The federal government outlined a sweeping plan Wednesday to make vaccines for Covid-19 available for free to all Americans, even as polls show a strong undercurrent of skepticism rippling across the land.In a report to Congress and an accompanying “playbook” for states and localities, federal health agencies and the Defense Department sketched out complex plans for a vaccination campaign to begin gradually in January or possibly later this year, eventually ramping up to reach any American who wants a shot. The Pentagon is involved with the distribution of vaccines, but civilian health workers will be the ones giving shots.The campaign is “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses,” said the playbook for states from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Among the highlights:— For most vaccines, people will need two doses, 21 to 28 days apart. Double-dose vaccines will have to come from the same drugmaker. There could be several vaccines from different manufacturers approved and available.— Vaccination of the U.S. population won’t be a sprint but a marathon. Initially there may be a limited supply of vaccines available, and the focus will be on protecting health workers, other essential employees, and people in vulnerable groups. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the National Academy of Medicine, and other organizations are working on priorities for the first phase. A second and third phase would expand vaccination to the entire country.— The vaccine itself will be free of charge, and patients won’t be charged out of pocket for the administration of shots, thanks to billions of dollars in taxpayer funding approved by Congress and allocated by the Trump administration.— States and local communities will need to devise precise plans for receiving and locally distributing vaccines, some of which will require special handling such as refrigeration or freezing. States and cities have a month to submit plans.Some of the broad components of the federal plan have already been discussed, but Wednesday’s reports attempt to put the key details into a comprehensive framework. Distribution is happening under the umbrella of Operation Warp Speed, a White House-backed initiative to have millions of doses ready to ship once a vaccine is given what’s expected to be an emergency use approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Several formulations are undergoing final trials.But the whole enterprise is facing public skepticism. Only about half of Americans said they’d get vaccinated in an Associated Press poll taken in May. Of those who wouldn’t get vaccinated, the overwhelming majority said they were worried about safety. To effectively protect the nation from the coronavirus, experts say upwards of 70% of Americans must either be vaccinated or have their own immunity from fighting off COVID-19.Since the poll, questions have only mounted about whether the government is trying to rush COVID-19 treatments and vaccines to help President Donald Trump’s reelection chances.Before the Republican National Convention in August, the FDA granted authorization for treatment of COVID-19 patients with plasma from people who have recovered, even though some government scientists were not convinced the clinical evidence was sufficiently strong. And last week it was reported that Michael Caputo, a Health and Human Services Department political appointee, tried to gain editorial control over a weekly scientific publication from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.As public confidence in core health agencies has taken a beating, Trump administration officials have been forced to play defense.“We are working closely with our state and local public health partners ... to ensure that Americans can receive the vaccine as soon as possible and vaccinate with confidence,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Wednesday. “Americans should know that the vaccine development process is being driven completely by science and the data.”That could be a tough sell. In the AP poll, 1 in 5 Americans said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine, and 31% said they were unsure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-outlines-sweeping-plan-to-provide-free-covid-19-vaccines/story-3sb9tpxC5sNyIyqlyP583L.html
16-09-2020||World||Pak Senate defeats yet another anti-terror bill linked to FATF compliance||Pakistan’s Senate on Wednesday defeated yet another bill that sought to empower agencies investigating terrorist operations, in compliance with the requirements for terror financing watchdog FATF. With this, the Upper House of parliament has voted against four out of seven legislations moved by the Imran Khan government to comply with the Financial Action Task Force. This is a setback to the government’s efforts to get Pakistan out of FATF’s ‘grey list’ and to prevent it from going further down to a ‘black list’.The defeated legislation would have given powers to investigators to conduct undercover operations, intercept communications and access computer systems. It sought the insertion of Section 19-C in the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) relating to application of investigation techniques. The amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Bill, 2020, was rejected a day after the National Assembly, the lower house, passed it. It received 34 votes against it , while 31 voted in favour in Senate, in a major embarrassment to Khan’s government.Last month, the 104-member Senate rejected the Anti-Money Laundering (Second Amendment) Bill and the Islamabad Capital Territory Waqf Properties Bill, both also related to FATF compliance, objecting to some of the provisions and linking its cooperation to retraction of remarks made by Leader of the House Dr Shahzad Waseem about certain leaders.Pakistan was placed under the FATF grey list in June 2018 after the global watchdog found deficiencies in Islamabad’s money laundering and terror financing laws.Last month, Khan’s government enacted laws and designated over 100 people as terrorists, in its desperate efforts to evade a possible blacklisting at the next FATF review meeting. The meeting, which was initially scheduled for June and got postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is now expected to be held in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-senate-defeats-yet-another-anti-terror-bill-linked-to-fatf-compliance/story-Stsa8NYilufGOEf1BYzpPL.html
16-09-2020||World||Hurricane Sally makes landfall on Alabama’s Gulf Coast||Hurricane Sally made landfall on Alabama’s Gulf Coast on Wednesday morning as a Category Two hurricane, spreading strong winds inland across southeastern Alabama and western Florida.Upon landfall, winds were clocked at 105 miles per hour (165 km per hour), able to cause extensive damage, according to the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane also poses the risk of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding along portions of the north-central Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory around 6 a.m. CDT (1100 GMT).The NHC earlier said the hurricane could bring more than 2 feet (60 cm) of rain to some areas as it creeps inland.Sally made landfall at Gulf Shores, Alabama, and was creeping toward the Alabama-Florida border at 3 mph (5 kph). Its winds and rains will stretch from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said.In Dauphin Island, Alabama, winds sustained 81 mph (130 kph), while in Pensacola, Florida, winds were at 61 mph (98 kph), NHC said. In Mobile, Alabama, strong winds shook windows while trees and power lines swayed. Officials across the South had called on residents of low-lying areas to shelter away from the winds and rain. But for some, Hurricane Sally’s slow approach brought a chance to relive childhood memories of storms past, and to witness the power of nature first-hand. Thomas Harms braved the wind and rains on Tuesday to watch the waves crash into the Fairhope Municipal Pier, and reminisced about past storms. As a child, he went with his grandfather to see storms arrive, and he did the same on Tuesday for his son. “It kind of takes a little bit of the fear out of it and also help you understand the dangers of it too,” said Harms. “I’ve been kind of passing that on to my son in doing the same thing.”Others joined him on the pier to catch a glimpse of what was to come. “We were at home saying ‘we’re bored’, so I was like ‘how ‘bout we go to Fairhope and see how bad it is out there.’ As you see, it’s pretty bad,” said Warren Babb.Damage from Sally is expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which tracks tropical storms and models the cost of their damage. That estimate could rise if the heaviest rainfall happens over land, Watson said.Ports, schools and businesses were closed along the coast as Sally churned. As the storm track shifted east, ports along the Mississippi River were reopened to travel on Wednesday. But they were closed to vessel traffic from Biloxi, Mississippi, to Pascagoula, Florida.Energy companies also shut more than a quarter of US Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas production and some refiners halted or slowed operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-sally-makes-landfall-on-alabama-s-gulf-coast/story-UGWLjcOppiesfN8M6pmQYM.html
16-09-2020||World||For Covid fight, London mayor reaches out in Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali videos||London mayor Sadiq Khan has released videos in Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu and other languages to highlight precautions against Covid-19, amid concerns that official guidance is not reaching south Asian communities in parts of Britain. The videos feature Khan, with deputy mayor Rajesh Agarwal joining in Hindi, along with others promoting the importance of face coverings, social distancing and regular handwashing. Due to lockdown curbs, major cultural and religious events have not been celebrated as they usually would through communal gatherings. London has several boroughs with large population of Indian and south Asian origin. Campaign group Doctors of the World UK and several organisations including the Greater London Authority had recently written to health secretary Matt Hancock over the lack of translation of updates to key advice in languages other than English.South Asians and other ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with the Boris Johnson government setting up an inquiry to find the reasons behind it. Latest figures in England show that 793 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ have died.South Asian Londoners are more likely to be employed as key workers in frontline health and service industry roles, and a recent study suggested that in hospital settings, people from South Asian backgrounds are 20% more likely than white people to die from Covid-19.The videos are part of Khan’s efforts to deal with the disproportionate impact of the virus on South Asian communities. He said: “From key workers on the frontline to families staying home, London’s South Asian communities have made extraordinary sacrifices to help stop the spread of this virus”.“We know that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected South Asian Londoners and yet, at a time when access to clear and accurate information is more important than ever, this government is failing them. A person’s ethnicity should never mean the difference between life and death”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-covid-fight-london-mayor-reaches-out-in-punjabi-hindi-bengali-videos/story-I8ALAItdQvw8EJ8Z6JlawL.html
16-09-2020||World||China again engages in blame game against India on border tensions||China claimed on Wednesday that it has been honouring agreements signed with India and is committed to maintaining peace in border areas, a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh said Beijing is not respecting the customary alignment of the boundary.Singh had told Parliament that China has engaged in massive mobilisation of troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), engaged in aggressive behaviour, and sought to unilaterally change the status quo, in contravention of existing border agreements and pacts.Responding to Singh’s statement, the Chinese foreign ministry again blamed New Delhi for the tensions, saying it is India which has breached agreements made to maintain tranquility along the disputed boundary.“For the Chinese side, we have been honouring the agreements signed between China and India. We are committed to peace and stability in the border area,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on Singh’s statement. “We are committed to our sovereignty and territorial integrity. But China is not to blame for the current situation. It is the Indian side that has breached the agreements, first trespassed the territory first and fired shots to threaten the safety of the Chinese border troops first,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing.“So, what is imperative is for the Indian side to address these mistakes to follow through the disengagement agreements and take concrete actions to ease up the situation on the ground,” Wang said, repeating Beijing’s stand on the months-long border standoff that’s plunged bilateral ties to the worst level in decades. India has already dismissed similar allegations made by China earlier, saying the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops were the first to provoke and not ready to disengage.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava clearly spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process earlier, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas.”“During the Moscow meeting the two foreign Ministers reached five point agreements on the border situation,” spokesperson Wang said, referring to the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting of foreign ministers in Moscow.“We hope India will work with China to follow through on the agreement and also other previously reached agreements and put the border issue at an appropriate position in the bigger picture of China India relations,” he said.Wang added that China is ready to work with India to remain in dialogue and consultation through diplomatic channels, jointly ensure peace and tranquility of the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-again-engages-in-blame-game-against-india-on-border-tensions/story-QqZ1c8rAT3ZCUZeFIPsY7N.html
16-09-2020||World||After Beirut blast, a young surgeon finds new sense of duty||It was a night Dr. Bassam Osman says changed his life. At around 6 p.m. on Aug. 4, the 27-year-old surgical resident was about to leave his daily hospital shift. Then a massive explosion shook Beirut.The floodgates opened and hundreds of wounded poured into the American University of Beirut Medical Center, one of Lebanon’s best hospitals.The medical staff of around 100 doctors, nurses and aides juggled priorities and space in treating the torn-up and bloodied men, women and children. They sutured wounds by mobile phone lights when electricity conked out. The wounded kept streaming in because several other hospitals closer to the port were knocked out of service by the blast.Veteran doctors who had worked through Lebanon’s civil war said they’d never seen anything like it. In six hours, they used up a year and a half’s worth of emergency supplies.Osman ended up working the next 52 hours straight. He treated more than two dozen patients. He lost one.“There was no moment in my life where I felt more in touch with my own and my surrounding humanity,” Osman said of those 52 hours in a tweet afterward.Osman, at the beginning of his career, finds himself in a medical field far different from what he expected when he entered the profession.Lebanon’s health facilities were once considered among the region’s best. In a short time, they have been brought to near collapse, battered by Lebanon’s financial meltdown and a surge in coronavirus cases, then smashed by the Beirut explosion.But the blast has also given Osman a greater sense of duty. That day’s trauma, he says, forged a deeper emotional bond between doctors and patients, left with no one else to trust in a country where politicians and public institutions take no responsibility.The disaster, caused by explosive chemicals left untended for years at Beirut’s port, has stoked anger at Lebanon’s corrupt officials, who are also blamed for driving the country of 5 million into near bankruptcy. More than 190 people were killed in the explosion, thousands hurt, and tens of thousands of homes were wrecked.“Day by day, these (crises) are becoming our normal life,” Osman told the AP. “We are tired... It feels like one long marathon.”Harder days may be ahead, he feels.The blast exacerbated shortages in medical supplies caused by the financial crisis. Replacement supplies are not coming fast enough.In one of Osman’s recent operations, lack of supplies nearly turned a small but critical procedure into invasive surgery. Osman and the other surgeons didn’t have the right size balloon to expand the patient’s arteries and were about to open her chest, before they found a way to improvise a replacement.Medical facilities hit by the economic meltdown are laying off staff. More doctors are emigrating. Osman’s salary, denominated in Lebanese pounds, dropped in value from nearly $1,300 to just around $200 a month because of the local currency’s crash.It will cost nearly $30 million to repair health facilities damaged by the blast, the World Health Organization estimates. Eight hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage. Two hospitals remain largely out of service. One, deemed totally unsafe, has to be leveled and rebuilt.The blast damaged the WHO’s main warehouse for medical supplies, destroying a shipment of Covid-19 protective equipment. It destroyed a Covid-19 isolation center used for migrant workers and vulnerable groups, and damaged centers for HIV and tuberculosis.The strained health system faces a coronavirus surge. Since the Aug. 4 blast, there has been a 220% increase in reported infections, according to the International Rescue Committee.Covid-19 patients are filling hospital and ICU beds. More than 25,000 confirmed cases have been reported, and 8% of all tests are coming back positive, according to the lead Covid-19 doctor Firas Abiad. More than 250 people have died. The number is expected to rise, with 115 patients in ICU, up from single digits before July.The increase is partly due to the explosion’s after-effects, including overcrowding in health facilities, displaced people sheltering with family and friends, and disrupted water networks and loss of hygiene items, said Christina Bethke, a WHO coordinator of the emergency response.Hit by the financial crisis, many cannot afford medical treatment. In the weeks preceding the explosion, Osman said he and his colleagues thought things had hit their worst when they saw people leaving the hospital because they couldn’t pay for admission.Then the blast came.Osman can’t forget the patient he lost that day.The young man came in with a hole in his heart and was whisked to the operating room. When the hole was closed, the team noticed bleeding in the abdomen and tended to that. But he also had a brain hemorrhage. In the chaos, the doctors had no time for imaging to detect it. The patient died.Osman knows only the first digits of his medical number: Patient AAA. He’s trying to find out his identity — at least his name, or where he was when the blast went off, or whether he has family looking for him.“I feel like I need to find closure for this operation, especially because we tried so hard,” he said.Since the blast, there is a new “intensity of emotion” between doctors and patients, Osman said.One woman reached out to Osman on social media, seeking advice for a plastic surgeon because her wounds were stitched badly on the day of the blast — not realizing he was the one who did the stitching.Osman admitted responsibility, saying the sutures were done under mobile phone lights. He invited her to return. She did, for coffee. He got to apologize in person, and she, in an Instagram post, thanked him for “putting her back together” and saving her life.Osman called it one of the most rewarding and heartwarming experiences.Another difference: Patients want to talk. Needing to unburden themselves, they talk about how they lost their homes, what happened to them in the blast, how they can’t afford treatment — “then they start talking about the whole situation in the country,” he said.“People can trust us, not only with their health but also their emotions ... I think the emotional injury is much more severe than the physical one,” he said.Osman said he welcomes it. “I try to make it personal with patients,” he said. “I’m not here just to do my job and leave.”Osman has two more years in his residency, then he plans to go on a fellowship abroad. He said that previously it was “a question mark” whether he would return to Lebanon when it was over.After the explosion, he is certain he will.“After I witnessed how much potential there is to give as a doctor in a country like Lebanon ... I realized that the question marks have all gone away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-beirut-blast-a-young-surgeon-finds-new-sense-of-duty/story-g6JJzks7hpLQbuhjbWMF4K.html
16-09-2020||World||EU chief calls for ‘European Health Union’ amid Covid-19 pandemic||The president of the European Commission urged EU members to build a stronger health union on Wednesday, promising a biomedical research agency and a global summit.In her first annual State of the European Union address, Ursula von der Leyen said the coronavirus pandemic had underlined the need for closer cooperation, stressing that people were “still suffering”. “For me, it is crystal clear -- we need to build a stronger European Health Union,” she said. “And we need to strengthen our crisis preparedness and management of cross-border health threats.”Addressing MEPs in the European Parliament, von der Leyen said her commission would try to reinforce the European Medicines Agency and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.And she announced the creation of a new agency for biomedical advanced research and development dubbed BARDA.She said she would work with Italy during its presidency of the G20 -- a grouping of the world’s richest countries -- to convene a global health summit next year to share the lessons of the coronavirus crisis.“This will show Europeans that our Union is there to protect all,” she said.Health policy remains the responsibility of EU member states and, while Brussels has tried to coordinate the bloc’s response to the epidemic, national lockdowns and border rules have varied widely.Von der Leyen, a doctor by training, also warned countries not to act selfishly when on vaccines, which are widely seen as the solution to end the crisis.“Vaccine nationalism puts lives at risk. Vaccine cooperation saves them,” she said.She also called for a reformed and strengthened World Health Organization “so that we can better prepare” for future pandemics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-chief-calls-for-european-health-union-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-kWAcOmgDIM1XpTs2uBlVgJ.html

16-09-2020||World||End of Shinzo Abe era leaves Japan still searching for way forward||Among the challenges awaiting newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is the urgent challenge of how to keep the world’s third-largest economy growing as its population ages and shrinks.Yoshihide Suga, Abe’s former chief spokesman, was appointed prime minister on Wednesday after Abe resigned because of a chronic health problem. He has vowed to stick with the “Abenomics” playbook of cheap credit and stimulus spending, but has yet to articulate a vision for the future for a nation wary of the sweeping changes needed to keep the economy growing.Suga has so far talked mainly about issues that were initiatives a quarter century ago, such as deregulating phone carriers and boosting investment in rural areas, said Michael Cucek, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple Universty in Tokyo.Vision does not appear to be his strong point.“He knows how to get things done but seems dogmatic to the point of obtuseness on what those things should be,” Cucek said.It’s unclear that Suga, dubbed the “iron wall” for his resistance to answering reporters’ questions, has the charisma and political heft to sell to the public and business world the kinds of sweeping changes to tax codes and other policies that are needed to help the country break out of its slow decline.During Abe’s more than seven years in office, the central bank pumped tens of trillions of dollars, supporting a modest economic recovery that never gained the momentum needed to break out of the rut Japan has been in since its financial bubble burst in the early 1990s.Time is not on Suga’s side: Japan’s population has been falling for eight straight years and is projected to sink by about 40% by 2050.The trends are evident in Tokyo, but even more so in smaller cities like Mito, 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) north of the capital. Countless small mom and pop style shopfronts remain shuttered for good, many unoccupied. The same is true for many houses around the city engulfed by vegetation after the owners died or moved away.The aging of the country is even more apparent in Suga’s home region of Akita, where more than a third of the population is older than 65 and the population has fallen by more than a quarter since it peaked in the 1950s.The economic outlook was cloudy for most of last year, as tensions between the US and China disrupted trade and global growth slowed. In October, a sales tax hike, to 10% from 8%, dented spending by consumers and businesses. Now, the “Corona shock” has hammered drivers of recent growth such as tourism and exports: In April-June the economy contracted at its worst ever rate of about 28%.To prevent the economy from shrinking further, and bringing on lower incomes and deepening poverty, economists say the country needs to ramp up its productivity — the value it gets from the amount of labor and money invested — or to allow far more immigration than it has so far.Despite the stellar efficiency of a few big companies like Toyota Motor Corp., the latest data show Japan 21st in productivity among 36 major economies in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, at about $47 per hour — between Slovenia and Slovakia — compared with about $75 per hour in the U.S. and more than $100 in Ireland, the world’s leader.Low productivity translates into poor quality jobs and low wages: Household average incomes have actually fallen over the past 20 years and Abenomics’ tax breaks and easy credit have not brought the wage hikes needed to entice consumers into splurging on big ticket items like cars and new homes.A chart of consumer spending in recent years resembles a seismometer, with a few big jolts from tax hikes but little change otherwise. Widening inequality due to stagnant incomes is stifling the consumer spending and investment needed to revive growth.“Abenomics deserves credit for many things. Stock prices rose, and company earnings have improved. That’s great. But individuals’ incomes have not increased, and that’s also a fact,” said Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister who lost to Suga in the LDP leadership vote.Abe’s vow to make Japan a nation where women “shine” has likewise barely nudged the gender equality barometer: By this measure the country is dead last in the OECD. The poverty rate for single-parent households, overwhelmingly headed by women, was more than 50% according to the most recent figure.“What we need to change is the economy,” Ishiba said in announcing his candidacy. “It has not provided enough support for low-income earners… The people’s voices have not been fully heard.”Suga’s background as the son of a strawberry farmer who worked to put himself through college has many in Japan thinking he might be more in touch with the problems of ordinary people than Abe and others politicians with elite backgrounds.More of a pragmatist than conservative ideologue Abe, Suga has pledged to “protect jobs and businesses.”While working as the chief government spokesman, Suga backed changes in visa policies to help along the tourism boom and increased competition among mobile phone carriers. He also favors reforming regional banks that are key to local economies.He has also signaled interest in raising the minimum wage, which rose by just 1 yen (less than 1 cent) this year to 902 yen (about $8.50) an hour.“Suganomics could include a much faster reorganization of the regional banking sector, higher immigration, and more aggressive hikes to the minimum wage,” said Tom Learmouth of Capital Economics. “That has the potential to lift productivity.”Policies in place for the past 60 years have encouraged Japanese to stick to setting up tiny companies — average number of workers 3.4 — that have little capacity or incentive to invest in new equipment, said David Atkinson, a former investment banker and government adviser.Businesses must grow in scale to afford to invest in advanced technology and increase their efficiency, Atkinson said in a recent web seminar held by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.So despite its image as a cornucopia of advanced technology, from bullet trains to AI to robotics and new materials, Japan is one of the least efficient countries among developed nations, and productivity has not risen appreciably for a half-century, he said.Tackling that problem is politically tricky: Small businesses employ more than two-thirds of all Japanese, albeit inefficiently. But there’s little choice, Atkinson contends.“If you don’t increase productivity, the economy will implode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-shinzo-abe-era-leaves-japan-still-searching-for-way-forward/story-wGbjW1WIOZfzyH6VnroB0L.html

16-09-2020||World||Most Indian Americans back Biden but Trump gains ground, says poll||A poll of Indian Americans has found that 66% of respondents favour Democrat Joe Biden for the presidential election in November, while President Donald Trump trails way behind at 28%.But Trump has made considerable headway, coming up from 16% in 2016, according to the Indiaspora-AAPI Data survey released on Tuesday.The poll also affirmed the growing clout of the Indian American community’s 1.8 million registered voters — 56% of them reported being contacted by Democrats and 48% by Republicans, compared to only 31% reached by any party in 2016.As a community with the highest earnings, Indian Americans are also “flexing their financial muscle” as the survey put it . A quarter of those polled said they had made donations to a candidate, political party or some other campaign body this year; $3 million anecdotally, with double-digit aspirations.A majority of Indian Americans, 54%, identified themselves Democrats while the second biggest group of 24% identified themselves as Independents and only 16% called themselves Republican, compared to 45%, 35% and 19% respectively in 2016.The most significant shift, or the beginning of it, was reflected in the numbers for the race for the White House. While Indian Americans’ support for Biden was an overwhelming at 66%, it was far lower than the 77% support for Hillary Clinton, then Democratic nominee, in 2016, and the brutal 84% that President Barak Obama got in the 2012 election.Trump, on the other hand, has gone up from 12% in 2016 to 28% , and could go up to 30% if he and Biden split up the 6% undecided respondents proportional to their current tallies.That should worry Democrats. “The Biden campaign has to be especially attentive” and should conduct a vigorous outreach to the community, said Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. Eventually, he added, these voters will “come home” to the Democratic Party because of their concerns about other issues, specially Covid-19.Neeraj Antani, a Republican member of the Ohio state legislature, attributed Trump’s expanding support among Indian Americans to the president’s outreach to the community, his visit to India in February and for standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and neutrality on issues like Citizenship Amendment Act and the abrogation of Article 370 on the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, as opposed to Biden’s opposition to those issues.Biden campaign’s position on Article 370 and the CAA has indeed antagonised a section of Indian Americans and has led to talk that a Biden administration will be less friendly to India.The former vice-president has sought to address those concerns and assured the community that relations with India will be a “high priority” for his administration if elected. He promised that his administration will also prevent China from acting with “impunity” and show no tolerance for cross-border terrorism, putting Pakistan on notice. He also rolled out an expansive plan for Indian Americans, focusing on hate crimes and immigration.As part of its outreach to the community, the Trump campaign has released a video of clip from Howdy Modi and Namaste Trump events the president attended with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US and India respectively, highlighting their relationship and support of the cheering crowds.The community is being wooed aggressively by both parties, as the survey findings showed — 56% reported being contacted by Democrats and 58% by Republicans compared to merely 31% by any party in 2016, far below then 44% for white voters and 42% for white voters.The reasons fairly simple. Trump won the 2016 election with narrow victory margins in key battleground states, which he can hold on to with the support of Indian Americans, or lose them if Democrats are able to persuade the community to vote for Biden, and in larger numbers.Indian Americans have the numbers that both Biden and Trump would want in these states. “Indian Americans are positioned to make a difference in several swing states that may be close in this election, such as Florida ( 87,000 ), Pennsylvania (61,000), Georgia (57,000), Michigan (45,000), and North Carolina (36,000), and perhaps even Texas, which has 160,000 Indian-American voters,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy and political science at UC Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data.He added that a high turnout driven by Senator Kamala Harris’s “historic vice-presidential nomination” and the “highly publicised” Houston and Ahmedabad rallies that Trump and Modi held together “could make a huge difference in this election”.M R Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, said, “Given the Indian diaspora’s increasing political importance in the US, it’s no surprise they are being courted by both sides of the aisle.”He added: “It’s great that both major political parties have begun to realise just how critical it is to reach out to Indian Americans – our impact is only going to increase over time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-indian-americans-back-biden-but-trump-gains-ground-says-poll/story-Wj2ycVlEnd8M10X25mEZiK.html

He was 94.In a blog post, Gates said his father lived a long and meaningful life and his passing away is a “tremendous loss for our family”.“I never stopped learning from his wisdom, kindness, and humility. Melinda and I owe him a special debt because his commitment to serving the community and the world helped inspire our own philanthropy,” Gates wrote in the blog post.“As I’ve said many times before, my dad was the real Bill Gates. He was all the things I strive to be,” he further said.Gates saw his middle child grow from a headstrong boy to one of the most admired business leaders of his generation who became the world’s second richest person, with a net worth of more than $123 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. When Bill Gates started giving away the billions he’d made as co-founder of Microsoft Corporation he turned to his father to advise his charitable foundation.“I never imagined that the frequently argumentative little boy I faced each night at dinner, the one eating my food and using my name, was to be my future employer,” Gates said in a 2003 speech to fellow members of Rotary International, a worldwide service organization.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which his father helped set up, has committed more than $50 billion to expand childhood immunisation, eradicate polio, provide seeds to African farmers and improve American public schools, according to its website.The cause of Henry Gates’ death was Alzheimer’s disease, his family said in an announcement on Tuesday. He was born November 30, 1925, in Bremerton, Washington.In addition to his son, Bill, he is survived by his wife; his daughters, Kristianne Blake, who is known as Kristi, and Elizabeth MacPhee, who is known as Libby; and eight grandchildren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-never-stopped-learning-from-his-wisdom-bill-gates-shared-heartfelt-blog-post-after-father-s-death/story-g6DkeakLH6v6ugRHOPiIlO.html
16-09-2020||World||Yoshihide Suga elected as Japan’s new prime minister, will succeed Shinzo Abe||Japanese ruling party leader Yoshihide Suga was elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote Wednesday, becoming the country’s first new premier in nearly eight years.Suga’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party used its majority in the powerful lower house of parliament, which is empowered to pick the premier, to elect him to lead the world’s third largest economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Following the vote, Suga is due to enter the Prime Minister’s Office as the new leader and name his cabinet later in the day.Suga’s appointment, two days after he was selected as LDP leader, brings the curtain down on outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s record run of almost eight consecutive years in the country’s top job. The 71-year-old Suga, who previously served as Abe’s right-hand man, has pledged to keep in place his former boss’s flexible fiscal stance and ultra-easy monetary policy known as “Abenomics.”Any sign of a departure from Abenomics could send the yen surging and stocks sliding, triggering a re-evaluation of the outlook for the nation. The Topix index briefly fell when Abe announced on Aug. 28 his intent to resign, but quickly steadied itself since then, with market players seeing Suga as embracing continuity.In contrast with Abe’s rarefied political pedigree, Suga hails from a rural area in northern Japan and took a job in a cardboard box factory when he first moved to Tokyo. He worked his way through university, before starting his political career as a secretary to a politician. He was first elected to parliament in 1996.Suga’s home of Akita prefecture, where his family farmed strawberries, is one of the areas most affected by the economic malaise born of Japan’s shrinking and aging population.While Suga has pledged to pick reformers for his cabinet, Kyodo News and other media reports say he has already decided to retain key players Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai, a veteran political broker, will also stay in place under the new administration, the party announced Tuesday.The role of chief cabinet secretary -- which Suga held for a record term -- will be given to Katsunobu Kato, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who most recently served as health minister, according to public broadcaster NHK.Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, will become defense minister, NHK reported, while current Defense Minister Taro Kono will take over as minister for administrative reform.Speculation about an early general election has simmered following a surge in support for the cabinet. Suga has repeatedly said it would be difficult to hold a vote while the coronavirus outbreak is still spreading. The power to dissolve parliament for a general election lies with the prime minister, and none need be held for another year.Suga has been outspoken on some specific issues, including the need for more competition among mobile phone providers to reduce costs for households. He has said Japan has too many regional financial institutions, and he is a strong proponent of introducing casino resorts to bolster tourism.While Suga has little direct experience in diplomacy, he has said that Japan’s alliance with the U.S. will remain the cornerstone of its foreign policy and that he wants to maintain stable ties with China, his country’s biggest trading partner.Local media, including national public broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News, have compiled lists of the likely lineup that will be announced in the afternoon. Here’s who they say will be in the cabinet:(Updates with lower house vote on Suga.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yoshihide-suga-elected-as-japan-s-new-prime-minister/story-EQHB2zzVA8Pkxicdf4ci4J.html
16-09-2020||World||Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe resigns, clearing way for successor||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Cabinet resigned, clearing the way for his successor to take over after parliamentary confirmation later Wednesday.Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, announced last month that he was stepping down because of health problems.“I devoted my body and soul for the economic recovery and diplomacy to protect Japan’s national interest every single day since we returned to power,” Abe told reporters at the prime minister’s office before heading into his final Cabinet meeting. “During this time, I was able to tackle various challenges together with the people, and I’m proud of myself.”He said his health is improving thanks to treatment and that he, as a lawmaker, will support his successor-to-be, Yoshihide Suga, from now on. He also thanked the people for their understanding and strong support for the upcoming leadership under Suga.Suga, chief Cabinet secretary for Abe’s government and long seen as his right-hand man, was chosen Monday as the new head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, virtually guaranteeing his election as prime minister in a parliamentary vote Wednesday because of the party’s majority.Suga, a self-made politician and the son of a strawberry grower in the northern prefecture of Akita, has stressed his background in promising to serve the interests of ordinary people and rural communities.He has said he will pursue Abe’s unfinished policies, and that his top priorities will be fighting the coronavirus and turning around an economy battered by the pandemic. He gained the support of party heavyweights and their followers early in the campaign on expectations he would continue Abe’s line.Suga has been a loyal supporter of Abe since Abe’s first stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007. Abe’s tenure ended abruptly because of illness, and Suga helped him return as prime minister in 2012.Abe, 65, has ulcerative colitis and his current treatment requires IV injections. He said last month his condition has improved but, facing ongoing treatment and physical weakness, he decided to resign.Suga has praised Abe’s diplomacy and economic policies when asked about what he would like to accomplish as prime minister.Suga, who does not belong to any wing within the party and opposes factionalism, says he is a reformer who will break down vested interests and rules that hamper reforms. He says he will set up a new government agency to speed up Japan’s lagging digital transformation.In a reshuffle of the ruling party key posts, however, Suga evenly allocated top posts to key factions, a balancing act seen as a return of favor for their support in the leadership race.Suga said he will appoint “reform-minded, hard-working people” to the new Cabinet, to be launched later Wednesday. About half of the members in the Abe Cabinet are expected to be retained or shifted to different ministerial posts.Media reports say some key ministers, including Finance Minister Taro Aso, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto, and Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, will stay. Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, is reportedly tapped as defense minister, replacing Taro Kono who is expected be shifted to administrative reforms minister.Compared to his political prowess at home, Suga has hardly traveled overseas and his diplomatic skills are unknown, though he is largely expected to pursue Abe’s priorities.The new prime minister will inherit a range of challenges, including relations with China, which continues its assertive actions in the contested East China Sea, and what to do with the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed to next summer due to the coronavirus. And he will have to establish a good relationship with whomever wins the U.S. presidential race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-pm-shinzo-abe-resigns-clearing-way-for-successor/story-Bp9YjAUMzNoDtYhhP8BT6O.html
16-09-2020||World||Donald Trump says coronavirus vaccine could be ready in a month||US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a coronavirus vaccine may be available within a month -- an acceleration of even his own optimistic predictions -- but added that the pandemic could go away by itself.“We’re very close to having a vaccine,” he told a town hall question-and-answer session with voters in Pennsylvania aired on ABC News.“We’re within weeks of getting it you know -- could be three weeks, four weeks,” he said.Only hours earlier, speaking to Fox News, Trump had said a vaccine could come in “four weeks, it could be eight weeks.”Democrats have expressed concern that Trump is putting political pressure on government health regulators and scientists to approve a rushed vaccine in time to help turn around his uphill bid for reelection against challenger Joe Biden on November 3.Experts including top US government infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci say vaccine approval is more likely toward the end of the year.At the ABC town hall Trump was asked why he’d downplayed the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed close to 200,000 people in the US.Trump replied by saying: “I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action.”But Trump himself told journalist Bob Woodward during taped interviews for the new book “Rage” -- published Tuesday -- that he had deliberately decided to “play it down” to avoid alarming Americans.- ‘Herd mentality’ -Returning to one of his most controversial views on the virus, that has ravaged the economy and which government scientists say will remain a danger for some time, Trump insisted “it is going to disappear.”“It would go away without the vaccine but it’s going to go away a lot faster with it,” he said.Challenged about how the virus would go away by itself, he said “you’ll develop like a herd mentality,” apparently meaning the concept of herd immunity, when enough people have developed resistance to the disease to effectively stop transmission.“It’s going to be herd developed and that’s going to happen. That will all happen but with a vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly. But I really believe we’re rounding the corner,” he said.The president, who is rarely seen wearing a mask in public and long refused to push Americans to adopt the habit, said “a lot of people don’t want to wear masks and people don’t think masks are good.”Asked what people he meant, Trump answered: “Waiters.”“They come over and they serve you and they have a mask,” he said. “I saw it the other day when they were serving me and they’re playing with the mask. I’m not blaming them. I’m just saying what happens: They’re playing with the mask. So the mask is over, and they’re touching it, and then they’re touching the plate, and that can’t be good.”Polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the health crisis.The latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Tracking poll Tuesday found that 52 percent of adults do not trust Trump’s statements about an upcoming coronavirus vaccine, compared to 26 percent who do.sms/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-a-month/story-IU204nB219gtY5G8Pi4bcM.html
16-09-2020||World||US wildfires bring climate crisis to election campaign||The raging wildfires in the US West Coast have brought climate crisis to the forefront of the election campaign, with Democratic challenger Joe Biden attacking Republican President Donald Trump for his attitude towards the issue.While touring parts of California, Trump on Monday reiterated his scepticism of climate change, saying, “It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch.” He said many other countries have “more explosive trees, meaning they catch fire much easier”, but they don’t have problems like this. “I think this is more of a management situation,” he added. “When you get into climate change, well, is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia? Is Russia going to change its ways?” Trump questioned after landing in McLellan Park in California.Calling Trump a “climate arsonist”, Biden pledged to rejoin the historic Paris Agreement on climate change if elected in the November 3 presidential election. “If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighbourhoods will have been flooded out?” he asked in a policy speech on climate change.“While he (Trump) turned against our allies, I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I will put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change, and I will challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments.” The Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision by the US, one of the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases, to exit the pact had led to condemnation from environmentalists and world leaders.Biden said, “I’ll also see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programmes and highways all across the country.”Wildfires in 10 states including California have burnt down nearly 5 million acres of land and killed dozens of people.Local officials of Democrat-ruled California accepted the importance of forest management but argued climate change should be accepted as having played a role in the fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wildfires-bring-climate-crisis-to-election-campaign/story-SDTePtXOEn3gnhxnRvPTWP.html

The reception held over the summer had violated state virus guidelines.The August wedding reception at the Big Moose Inn in Millinocket is linked to more than 175 confirmed cases of the virus, the Maine Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.The virus cases stemming from the wedding have spanned hundreds of miles in a state that had largely controlled the spread of the coronavirus through the summer. Maine has reported less than 5,000 cases of the virus in total since March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-study-on-covid-19-in-us-shows-greater-toll-on-black-hispanic-youth/story-8A5pYFgB3HshrT8nDvECTM.html
16-09-2020||World||Fear of more coronavirus-like pandemics as land rights ‘under siege’||Governments’ failure to recognise the land rights of indigenous communities and their role in protecting biodiversity could lead to more coronavirus-like pandemics, researchers said on Tuesday.A study of more than 40 countries found many local people’s land claims were being ignored, amid increasing deforestation and wildlife exploitation, which may be contributing to a rise in diseases, like Covid-19, that pass from animals to humans.“Despite compelling evidence that indigenous peoples, local communities, and Afro-descendants protect most of the world’s remaining biodiversity, they are under siege from all sides,” said Andy White of the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI).“Our work suggests the answer is to invest in the countries and communities that are ready to scale up land rights. Failure to do so puts at risk the health of the planet and all of its people,” White, the study’s co-author, said in a statement.The study by the RRI - an alliance of more than 150 organisations advocating for community land rights - comes ahead of a United Nations pledge expected to be agreed in 2021 to set aside 30% of the planet’s land and sea for conservation by 2030.Despite local people managing and protecting 50% of the area studied - which included Brazil, India, China, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia - governments recognised only half of community land claims, RRI said.This needs to be addressed urgently, said researchers, as a growing number of zoonotic diseases – including Ebola, MERS, West Nile fever, Zika, SARS and Rift Valley fever – have recently jumped from animal hosts into the human population.The most dramatic example is the new coronavirus, which is believed to have emerged in a market in China last year after jumping the species barrier from the animal kingdom to infect humans. It has killed more than 930,000 people so far.Anthony Waldron, a conservation finance researcher based at Cambridge University, said securing indigenous peoples’ land rights was key to stemming the spread of such diseases.“If there is chaotic development in a forest where people and wildlife are coming more into contact with one another, then it’s only a matter of time before a virus jumps into the human population,” he told a virtual briefing.“If you don’t have defined land rights, you don’t know who owns what part and anyone can happily invade. If you have clearly defined land rights ... which indigenous groups can manage ... there is smaller risk those viruses can jump.”About 60% of known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, largely due to the increased interaction between humans, animals and the environment, according to the United Nations.Most efforts to control zoonotic diseases have been reactive rather than proactive, said environmental experts, calling on governments to invest in public health, farm sustainability, end over-exploitation of wildlife and reduce climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fear-of-more-coronavirus-like-pandemics-as-land-rights-under-siege/story-tP5AUzzUkp6I8RG1RyegeM.html
16-09-2020||World||US broke trade rules by putting tariffs on China, finds WTO||The World Trade Organization found on Tuesday that the United States breached global trading rules by imposing multibillion-dollar tariffs in President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, a ruling that drew anger from Washington.The Trump administration says its tariffs imposed two years ago on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods were justified because China was stealing intellectual property and forcing US companies to transfer technology for access to China’s markets.But the WTO’s three-member panel said the US duties broke trading rules because they applied only to China and were above maximum rates agreed to by the United States. Washington had not then adequately explained why its measures were a justified exception, the panel concluded.“This panel report confirms what the Trump administration has been saying for four years: the WTO is completely inadequate to stop China’s harmful technology practices,” US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in response.China’s Commerce Ministry said Beijing supported the multilateral trading system and respected WTO rules and rulings, and hoped Washington would do the same.The decision will have little immediate effect on the US tariffs and is just the start of a legal process that could take years to play out, ultimately leading to the WTO approving retaliatory measures if it is upheld - moves that China has already taken on its own.The United States is likely to appeal Tuesday’s ruling. That would put the case into a legal void, however, because Washington has already blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO’s appellate body, preventing it from convening the minimum number required to hear cases.The WTO panel was aware it was stepping into hot water. It noted that it had looked only into the US measures and not China’s retaliation, which Washington has not challenged at the WTO.“The panel is very much aware of the wider context in which the WTO system currently operates, which is one reflecting a range of unprecedented global trade tensions,” the 66-page report concluded.‘Take stock’The panel recommended the United States bring its measures “into conformity with its obligations”, but also encouraged the two sides to work to resolve the overall dispute.“Time is available for the parties to take stock as proceedings evolve and further consider opportunities for mutually agreed and satisfactory solutions,” it said.During a two-year trade war with Beijing, Trump threatened tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports - more than $500 billion - before the two countries signed a “Phase 1” trade deal in January. Extra tariffs are still in place on some $370 billion worth of Chinese goods, and $62.16 billion in duties have been collected since July 2018, US Customs data https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade show.Trump has described the WTO as “horrible” and biased towards China, often threatening to quit.As he left the White House for a campaign rally, Trump said he would “have to do something about the WTO because they’ve let China get away with murder.”He said he needed to take a closer look at the ruling, but added: “I’m not a big fan of the WTO - that I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favor.”The decision could help fuel a Trump decision to leave the WTO or underpin US arguments for reforming the 25-year-old trade body, said Margaret Cekuta, a former USTR official who helped write a crucial report on China’s intellectual property abuses that preceded Trump’s tariffs.“It gives the administration ammo to say the WTO is out of date. If they can’t rule on intellectual property rights, then what is their position in the broader economy going forward?” said Cekuta, now a principal with the Capitol Counsel lobbying firm.Trump, critical of multilateral institutions, has already quit the U.N. cultural organisation UNESCO and plans to leave the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-broke-trade-rules-by-putting-tariffs-on-china-finds-wto/story-Fx86ho7pFB4W6uWrTzddbO.html
16-09-2020||World||In coronavirus vaccine race, China inoculates thousands before trials are completed||China is inoculating tens of thousands of its citizens with experimental coronavirus vaccines and attracting international interest in their development, despite expert concerns over the safety of drugs that have not completed standard testing.China launched a vaccine emergency use programme in July, offering three experimental shots developed by a unit of state pharmaceutical giant China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and US-listed Sinovac Biotech. A fourth Covid-19 vaccine being developed by CanSino Biologics was approved for use by the Chinese military in June.Aiming to protect essential workers and reduce the likelihood of a resurgence, the vaccines are also grabbing attention in the global scramble by governments to secure supplies, potentially helping reframe China’s perceived role in the pandemic.Beijing has not released official data on the uptake in domestic targeted groups, which include medical, transport and food market workers.But China National Biotec Group (CNBG), the Sinopharm unit developing two of the emergency use vaccines, and Sinovac have confirmed that at least tens of thousands of people have been inoculated. Additionally, CNBG said it had given hundreds of thousands of doses; one of its vaccines requires an individual receive two or three shots to be inoculated.Beijing has engaged a public, top-down approach to endorse the experimental vaccines and foster community support. Among those lining up for shots early on were the chief executives of Sinovac and Sinopharm and the military’s research chief.The chief biosafety expert at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed this week that she too had been injected in April as she announced the potential that at least some of the vaccines would be ready for public use as early as November.“So far, among the people who who were vaccinated, no one has been sick with the disease,” Guizhen Wu said on state TV. “So far, (the vaccination scheme) works very well. No side effect occurred.”Wu’s comments were broadly in line with comments by CNBG last week that none of tens of thousands of people who travelled to high-risk countries and regions after being vaccinated had been infected, and there was “no case of obvious adverse reaction”.SAFETY CONCERNSChina’s approach runs counter to that of many Western countries, where experts have warned against authorizing the emergency use of vaccines that have not completed testing, citing a lack of understanding about longer-term efficacy and potential side effects.Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University, described China’s emergency use programme as “very problematic,” saying it was impossible to judge efficacy without a clinical trial standard control group.“You’re vaccinating people and you don’t know if it’s going to protect them,” Durbin told Reuters, adding recipients of the experimental vaccines could eschew other protective measures.Vaccine safety came into sharp focus last week when AstraZeneca Plc paused late-stage clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development.The company resumed British trials over the weekend after receiving the green light from safety watchdogs, and, along with other leading Western vaccine makers has pledged to uphold scientific study standards and reject any political pressure to rush the process.Russia is one of the few other countries to authorise the use of an experimental vaccine, making its own “Sputnik V” vaccine mandatory for certain groups including teachers. India is considering emergency authorization for a vaccine, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces.FOREIGN BUYERSThe UAE authorized the emergency use of a Sinopharm vaccine this week, the first international emergency clearance for one of China’s vaccines, just six weeks after human trials began in the Gulf Arab state. UAE officials reported mild and expected side effects, but no severe side effects, during those trials.CanSino has been approached by several countries, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters, adding the military’s approval helped attract foreign interest. The person declined to name the countries engaged in talks.CanSino, which has trials planned in Pakistan and Russia for the vaccine developed with China’s military research unit, did not respond to a request for comment.Zhang Yuntao, CNBG vice president told Reuters his company has received interest from foreign countries to buy about 500 million doses of its experimental vaccine.“China clearly wants to reorient that narrative in a way that it is viewed as a solution rather than a cause of the pandemic,” Yanzhong Huang, Senior Fellow for Global Health, Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S.-based think tank.“That narrative, ironically, may become more convincing when Trump’s America First approach denies many countries opportunities to access the US-made vaccines.”Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday vowed to prioritise China and Russia in his country’s global shopping for a vaccine, saying his government had already had talks with both. He said China was unlike other countries seeking a “reservation fee” or advance payment.“The one good thing about China is you do not have to beg, you do not have to plead,” Duterte said. “One thing wrong about the western countries; it’s all profit, profit, profit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-coronavirus-vaccine-race-china-inoculates-thousands-before-trials-are-completed/story-bwU5PrUfpYy946AFrfiE6M.html

In August, Novavax signed a deal with Serum Institute, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, to produce a minimum of one billion doses of its vaccine candidate, when approved, for low- and middle-income countries and India.As part of the expanded agreement, Serum Institute will also manufacture the antigen component of the vaccine, dubbed NVX‑CoV2373, which Novavax said will bring its manufacturing capacity to over two billion doses by mid-2021.Novavax’s vaccine is currently in mid-stage trials after an early-stage study showed it produced high levels of antibodies against the novel coronavirus. The company plans to begin late-stage trials in the third quarter. Last month, Novavax said it will supply 60 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine candidate to the UK beginning as early as the first quarter of 2021.The company is also preparing to deliver 100 million doses to the United States by January after it was awarded $1.6 billion for its potential vaccine, and has also signed supply agreements with Canada and Japan.Other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc have already begun large late-stage studies of their experimental vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-doubles-aims-for-2-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-with-expanded-india-deal/story-0YjPq6LsPg42mvkVuRjpJK.html

The epicentre of the tremor has been recorded at Ramche of Sindhupalchok district which has already been ravaged by flood and landslide and earthquake of 2015.“An earthquake of magnitude 6.0 occurred around Ramche of Sindhupalchok district at 5:19 am,” the National Seismological Centre tweeted minutes after the tremors.The tremors were felt in the most eastern part of the country as well. “It is a continued aftershock of 2015’s earthquake,” Chief Seismologist of NSC Lok Bijay Adhikari confirmed to ANI over the phone.No damages have been reported yet from the epicentre of the earthquake.“Since the jolt was felt, we haven’t received any reports of damage or loss of human lives. We have already contacted all the wards inside the district to confirm if any mishap occurred or anybody needs any assistance. As of now, we haven’t received any information on the matter,” Rajan Adhikari, Superintendent of Police stationed at Sindhupalchowk, confirmed to ANI in a telephonic conversation.In 2015, nearly 10,000 people had lost their lives and thousands were injured when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 Richter scale had struck the Himalayan nation. Sindhupalchok, one of the epicentres of the earthquake, had suffered the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-wakes-up-to-6-0-magnitude-earthquake-no-damage-reported/story-xvmRJXCxxklwdPXFUuUm3I.html
16-09-2020||World||Joe Biden courts Latino voters in 1st trip to Florida as nominee||Joe Biden made his first trip to Florida as the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday with an urgent mission to boost support among Latinos who could decide the election in one of the nation’s fiercest battleground states.“More than any other time, the Hispanic community, Latino community holds in the palm of their hand the destiny of this country,” Biden said during a Hispanic Heritage Month kickoff event in Kissimmee. “You can decide the direction of this country.”A win for Biden in Florida would dramatically narrow Trump’s path to reelection. But in a state where elections are often decided by a percentage point, there are mounting concerns that Biden may be slipping, particularly with the state’s influential Latino voters.An NBC-Marist poll released last week found Latinos in the state about evenly divided between Biden and Trump. Democrat Hillary Clinton led Trump by a 59% to 36% margin among Latinos in the same poll in 2016 — and Trump won Florida by about 1 percentage point.To regain lost ground, Biden made the case Tuesday night that he would be a better president for Hispanics than Trump, touting his commitment to immigration reform and a new plan to support Puerto Rico’s economy.“Donald Trump has failed the Hispanic community time and time again, and that’s not a secret,” Biden said. “Whether it’s in his heinous act of separating children from their families at our border, or his repeated attacks on Dreamers, or his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need.”Still, Hispanic voters in Florida tend to be somewhat more Republican-leaning than Hispanic voters nationwide because of the state’s Cuban American population. Nationally, little public polling is available to measure the opinions of Latino voters this year and whether they differ from four years ago.But Democrats aren’t taking chances. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has pledged to spend at least $100 million to defeat Trump in Florida.And by spending his day along the Interstate 4 corridor, Biden is devoting time to one of the most critical regions of the state. While Republicans typically post big numbers in the northern and southwestern parts of the state and Democrats are strong in coastal cities, campaigns typically battle it out for every vote in central Florida.Biden’s first event, in Tampa, focused on veterans and was aimed at pushing a potential opening with military voters, who broadly supported Trump in 2016 but are seen as potentially persuadable because of controversial remarks the president reportedly made mocking American war dead as “losers” and “suckers.” Trump has denied making the remarks, first reported through anonymous sources by The Atlantic, but many of the comments were later confirmed by The Associated Press.“Nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive, to me at least, than when it comes to his denigration of our service members, veterans, wounded warriors who have fallen,” Biden said. Speaking of his late son Beau, who served overseas as a Delaware Army National Guard member, Biden said, “He’s gone now, but he’s no sucker.”Biden spoke about his experience as vice president escorting military caskets home and working on military issues, and about his own commitments to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs and tackle the mental health crisis among veterans. And he attacked Trump for what he said were failed promises to veterans.“President Trump likes to say he passed VA Choice, but just like everything else he seems to say, it’s a figment of his imagination or a flat-out lie,” he said, referencing a program passed under the Obama administration that steers more patients to the private sector.Biden’s decision to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month in Kissimmee reflects a focus on the state’s rapidly growing Puerto Rican community. Many Puerto Ricans relocated to Florida after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.The campaign announced a new plan Tuesday focused on boosting Puerto Rico’s economy and helping the island recover from Maria. Biden would create a federal working group focused on aiding Puerto Rico in rebuilding and would forgive disaster relief loans to Puerto Rican towns, expand a food stamp program to residents, invest in Puerto Rico’s power and schooling infrastructure and health care services, and help alleviate the territory’s massive debt load.Biden expressed support for Puerto Rican statehood on Tuesday night, though he said the decision should be left up to the U.S. territory’s residents.Puerto Ricans may be more open to Biden than Cuban Americans concentrated in Miami are. Many of them are attuned to Trump’s message that the Democratic ticket would embrace socialism.Indeed, surrogates for the Trump campaign focused on Cuban immigrants during a call with reporters. Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, a Republican, accused Biden of trying to “feign interest in the Hispanic community” after “neglecting us.”She said a Biden presidency would, among other things, appease and enrich Cuba’s leadership at the expense of the people. Some foreign policy analysts, however, say the Trump administration’s tough economic restrictions on Cuba only contribute to the oppression of the Cuban people.Biden, who hasn’t been to Florida since last October, has struggled with Latinos in part because of the record-setting number of deportations when President Barack Obama was in the White House. Biden has apologized for that policy.But unlike his Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who used strong support among Latinos to notch key primary victories in Nevada and California, Biden has refused to adopt the most liberal positions in his party — especially when it comes to calling for decriminalizing illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border and halting all deportations indefinitely. He supports a 100-day moratorium on deportations.As for Trump, despite many of his anti-immigration policies, some Latino voters have responded positively to the president’s embrace of religious conservative positions and his warnings of protest-related violence and socialism. Trump also frequently visits his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and the president votes absentee in the state.As Biden campaigned in Florida, Sen. Kamala Harris made her first trip to her home state of California as his running mate. She toured wildfire damage in the small foothill community of Auberry, declaring that federal disaster aid is “not a partisan issue” in response to Trump’s threats to withhold aid from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-courts-latino-voters-in-1st-trip-to-florida-as-nominee/story-Z1PhbepMB4fuwnUWWkrHuK.html
16-09-2020||World||Oracle ‘very close’ to deal with TikTok, says Trump||President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had heard Oracle Corp was very close to a deal over ByteDance’s TikTok, even as sources said the Chinese company was seeking to keep majority ownership of the popular short video app.Trump has ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok amid US concerns user data could be passed to China’s Communist Party government. He has threatened to ban TikTok in the United States as early as Sunday if ByteDance does not comply.Under ByteDance’s proposal, however, the Beijing-based company would keep a majority stake in TikTok’s global business and create headquarters for TikTok in the United States, the sources said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that ByteDance has also offered to create 20,000 US jobs with TikTok.Also read: What does a deal between TikTok and Oracle mean?Oracle would become ByteDance’s technology partner responsible for the management of TikTok’s data and take a minority stake in TikTok, the sources added.“I heard they are very close to a deal,” Trump said, adding his administration would be making a decision soon on whether to approve it, and that he was a fan of Oracle’s Chairman Larry Ellison.The ByteDance proposal calls for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the US government panel that is overseeing the deal talks, to supervise how TikTok will be operated, one of the sources said.Mnuchin, who chairs CFIUS, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross were meeting at the White House on Tuesday to consider ByteDance’s proposal, two of the sources said.It is unclear whether Trump will approve ByteDance’s proposal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. The White House, ByteDance and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Signing off on a deal for TikTok that would allow ByteDance to retain majority ownership would represent a U-turn for Trump and the US government agencies and departments that comprise CFIUS.Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 calling on ByteDance to divest TikTok in the United States.In its lawsuit against Trump’s previous executive order, dated Aug. 6, which calls on TikTok to be banned, the app said CFIUS had not identified any mitigation measures that would address the national security risks, despite TikTok proposing to bring in “trusted US technology partners,” as it has now branded Oracle.Some CFIUS experts said the deal’s approval would signal a major departure from the traditional national security reviews of deals driven by US civil servants. “Nothing about this transaction is usual. It appears to be in the hands of the politicians rather than the professional CFIUS staff,” said Paul Marquardt, a regulatory lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. “What is extraordinary here is how public and political the process is, and the continuation of negotiations after the issuance of a divestiture order.”While TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, US officials have had concerns since last year about whether the personal information of its 100 million US users could be compromised under its Chinese owner.ByteDance’s plan calls for restrictions in its control of TikTok, the sources said. It asks CFIUS to agree to operational arrangements similar to those it put in place when it allowed SoftBank Group Corp to acquire US wireless carrier Sprint in 2013, according to the sources. These could include the US government approving board directors at TikTok, as well as its relationships with major vendors, the sources said.ByteDance is also hoping that Ellison’s fundraising for Trump, as well as Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz’s backing of Trump’s transition team four years ago, will boost its chances, Reuters has reported.Deal does not envisage payment to US governmentByteDance’s top investors - General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management LLC - have discussed taking minority stakes in TikTok, though their participation in the deal remains uncertain, one of the sources said.Also uncertain is Walmart Inc’s participation in the deal, after Microsoft Corp, which the retail giant had aligned with, was rejected by ByteDance.Walmart and the investment firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump said last month “a very substantial portion” of any proceeds ByteDance receives from selling a stake in TikTok should go to the US government “because we’re making it possible for this deal to happen.” ByteDance’s proposal, however, does not envision paying any such fee.China also got involved in the process last month, updating its export control rules to give it a say over the transfer of technology, such as TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, to a foreign buyer. Chinese officials have said ByteDance should not be coerced by the United States into a deal.Reuters reported last week that China’s government would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than see it be part of a forced sale.The proposed deal with Oracle would not require ByteDance to apply to Chinese authorities for an export license for TikTok’s algorithm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oracle-very-close-to-deal-with-tiktok-says-trump/story-rCphFakA7QTVh5CSY8zjXI.html

16-09-2020||World||Poland seeks more flu vaccines amid shortage during Covid-19 pandemic||The Polish government is trying to secure more flu vaccines from international producers amid a national shortage fuelled by higher demand during the coronavirus pandemic, Poland’s health minister said Tuesday.Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said Poland generally has very low flu vaccinations rates and is seeing a vaccine shortage now because orders for this fall and winter were based on last year’s demand. He told Radio Zet that his ministry met Monday with key vaccine suppliers to explore the possibility of getting more vaccine shipments.During the last flu season, only about 1.5 million people, or 4% of Poland’s population of 38 million people, were vaccinated for the flu, he said. Some 100,000 vaccines went used.The low flu vaccination rates in Poland are the result of wide distrust in pharmaceutical companies and in vaccinations.During the swine flu outbreak 10 years ago, Poland was the only country worldwide to reject the vaccines over safety fears and distrust in drug companies. When that outbreak proved not as deadly as some initially feared, many Poles felt their government was vindicated.But fears of Covid-19 have created an unprecedented demand for flu vaccines. The Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported Tuesday that pharmacies across Poland are unable to meet demand and have created waiting lists for future deliveries.Tomasz Leleno, spokesman for the Polish Pharmacological Chamber, said he expects the situation to improve with new deliveries in late September and early October.Health experts are stressing that the seasonal flu vaccine is especially important this year because reducing the number of flu cases helps preserve medical resources for treating Covid-19 patients.“Both are respiratory illnesses and it’s likely that they would put a strain on the same parts of the health care system at the same time,” the health minister of Poland’s western neighbor, Germany, said Tuesday.Jens Spahn said Germany has ordered 26 million doses of vaccine for this flu season, a significant increase compared to the 18-19 million doses the country normally buys.“If we manage, together, to get the flu vaccination rate so high that all 26 million doses are actually used then I’d be a very happy health minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-seeks-more-flu-vaccines-amid-shortage-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-QwcvdmBQOpAuuk6DkAv6JJ.html
16-09-2020||World||Donald Trump’s aide apologises for video slamming Covid-19 scientists||A Trump health appointee who used his position to launch political attacks and is accused of trying to muzzle a government publication apologised Tuesday for a video in which he reportedly disparaged scientists battling the coronavirus and warned of violence after the elections.Michael Caputo, the top spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, apologised to his staff for the Facebook video, said an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.The case of Caputo, a Trump loyalist and former New York political operative, has become the latest distraction for a White House still struggling to define its coronavirus response.He also can be heard on an HHS podcast asserting that Democrats don’t want a coronavirus vaccine in order to punish President Donald Trump.News reports alleged last week that his office tried to muzzle a scientific weekly published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Then on Monday came an account of a video on Caputo’s personal Facebook page in which he accused government scientists of conspiring against Trump and suggested “shooting” could break out after the election.Caputo was named the top HHS spokesman in April, during a tense period in relations between the White House and HHS Secretary Alex Azar.On a taxpayer-funded podcast earlier this summer he accused Democrats and the media of not wanting a coronavirus vaccine until after the elections in order to punish the president.“There are people in the United States government on the Democrats’ side ... (who) do not want a vaccine,” he said.“They don’t want a vaccine until November 4th,” he added, citing the day after the presidential election. It’s highly unusual to use an agency communications platform for such a blatantly political message.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOver the weekend, Caputo made headlines when Politico and The New York Times reported that his office had tried to gain control over a CDC publication known as the MMWR, or Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In previous administrations, political appointees in the HHS secretary’s office maintained a hands-off policy with regard to the publication from CDC, which is under the department’s umbrella.The story took a strange turn on Monday, after the Times reported about a live video hosted by Caputo on his personal Facebook page. In it, Caputo reportedly accused government scientists of conspiring against Trump as part of a “resistance.”The message turned apocalyptic when Caputo reportedly predicted that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would refuse to concede defeat to Trump in the election, and violence would break out. The Associated Press was unable to independently view the video.HHS supported Caputo, with a statement that called him a “critical, integral part of the president’s coronavirus response, leading on public messaging as Americans need public health information to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.”There was no immediate statement from the White House.Attempts to reach Caputo were unsuccessful.On Capitol Hill, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called on Azar to fire Caputo, accusing the spokesman of trying to interfere with CDC reports to the medical and scientific community, as well as the public at large. And Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Azar himself to resign, citing interference with the CDC as one example of what he termed the administration’s failures.Officials at CDC have privately complained of recent efforts by political appointees at main HHS to try to edit or press for changes in the agency’s weekly MMWR publications, a go-to resource for public health professionals.“They have been trying to insert themselves into a lot, especially the MMWR, and they’re interested in editing it,” said a person outside the agency who spoke with insiders involved. The person providing the information spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.Also read: Donald Trump defies coronavirus rules as ‘peaceful protest’ rallies growMMWR articles are technical, but they reveal telling details. One published earlier this year noted that while Trump’s travel restrictions dramatically reduced travel from China in February, nothing was being done at that time to restrict travel from Italy and Europe, where the coronavirus was spreading widely and rapidly. Analysis of virus samples from hard-hit New York in March suggested it was introduced there from Europe and other parts of the US, the CDC article reported.Caputo is an unswerving Trump loyalist. His recent book, “The Ukraine Hoax,” claims the president’s “phony” impeachment was rooted in a vast conspiracy.His appointment at HHS was seen as an attempt by the White House to exert more control over Azar, whom other administration officials were trying to blame for the government’s slow response in the initial weeks of the pandemic.At HHS, he’s been closely affiliated with Operation Warp Speed, the government’s effort to have millions of doses of a Covid-19 vaccine ready for distribution as soon as one is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Caputo interviewed Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a top outside adviser to the vaccine effort, on an HHS podcast July 31. Commiserating with Slaoui over news articles that were critical of the doctor, Caputo said:“There are people in the United States government on the Democrats side, we’ve seen these calls for all kinds of ethical stuff on you from the Democrats, they are calling for -- because they do not want a vaccine.“I know that’s hard to believe, but the people who are abusing you, and who are beating down Operation Warp Speed, and the incredible historic work that’s going on, they don’t want a vaccine until November 4th. I don’t want to talk about politics here, but November 3rd is an important day. They don’t want a vaccine now because of politics, sir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-aide-apologises-for-video-slamming-covid-19-scientists/story-KbJIYSz3VhltKIBosMJp0O.html
16-09-2020||World||UK hands over 3 stolen ancient idols to India||The British police on Tuesday handed over to India ancient idols of Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita that were stolen from Tamil Nadu in 1978, as part of growing efforts to return artefacts of India’s cultural heritage from across the world.The handover ceremony at India House was attended by officials of the Metropolitan Police and remotely by Union minister for culture and tourism Prahlad Singh Patel from New Delhi, as well as officials in Chennai. The idols, being sent back to Tamil Nadu, were stolen from a temple built in the Vijayanagar period in the Nagapattinam district. They were voluntarily handed over to the police by an unidentified UK-based collector when informed that they were stolen property. Information from S Vijay Kumar of the India Pride Project helped trace and identify the idols, officials said.Patel said that only 13 antique items were returned to India between 1947 and 2014, but after that, more than 40 such antiquities have returned home. “Efforts are also on to return one idol from the British Museum”.Indian high commissioner Gaitri Kumar called it an “auspicious day” and thanked the police for their efforts to recover the idols. She recalled recent instances when idols stolen from India were recovered and repatriated to India by the mission.Detective chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police Tim Wright said: “The Metropolitan Police are proud to have been involved in the return of these Chola bronzes to India. Not only are they beautiful and historically significant, they are of course of religious importance, and therefore it is particularly gratifying that they are to be returned to the temple from which they were taken”. Indian officials said renewed impetus in recent years to the protection of India’s cultural heritage has led to coordinated action by various agencies, including the ministry of external affairs, Archaeological Survey of India and law enforcement agencies such as the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.Successful restitutions have taken place in recent years from various countries including Germany, France, Australia and the US, while work is ongoing on more such items. The high commission in London has so far repatriated the following idols:> The Bramha- Brahmani sculpture, stolen from the world heritage site Rani-Ki Vav, was returned to the Archaeological Survey of Inida in 2017. It has found a prominent place in the Purana Quila museum in Delhi.> On August 15, 2018 a 12th century bronze statue of Gautam Buddha was restituted to the high commission by the Metropolitan Police. > On August 15, 2019, two antiques – a 17th century bronze idol of Navanitha Krishna and a 2nd century limestone carved pillar motif were returned to the high commission by the US embassy in London.> On July 29, 2020, the Natesha Shiva statue stolen in 1998 from the Ghateshwar temple in Baroli, Rajasthan was repatriated to the ASI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hands-over-3-stolen-ancient-idols-to-india/story-m1JlyLBQZYraMdFtGPHyIP.html
16-09-2020||World||Water shortages in US West likelier than previously thought||There’s a chance water levels in the two largest man-made reservoirs in the United States could dip to critically low levels by 2025, jeopardizing the steady flow of Colorado River water that more than 40 million people rely on in the American West.After a relatively dry summer, the US Bureau of Reclamation released models on Tuesday suggesting looming shortages in Lake Powell and Lake Mead — the reservoirs where Colorado River water is stored — are more likely than previously projected.Compared with an average year, only 55 per cent of Colorado River water is flowing from the Rocky Mountains down to Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona line. Due to the below-average runoff, government scientists say the reservoirs are 12 per cent more likely to fall to critically low levels by 2025 than they projected in the spring.“This is a pretty significant increase over what was projected in April due to the declining runoff this year,” hydrologist Carly Jerla said.The forecast could complicate already-fraught negotiations between Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Mexico over future shares of the river that supplies their cities and farms. Those talks will draw up new agreements by 2026 over use of the river that’s under siege from climate change and prolonged drought.Some of urban and agricultural water users have been forced to conserve water to secure the river long term, but it remains overtapped. And as cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas keep growing, the region is only getting thirstier.“We know that warmer temperatures have contributed to the drought of the last 21 years, and we know that they have exacerbated it,” Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman said.Unlike the 24-month projections that the agency uses to allocate water to the seven states and Mexico, the models released Tuesday simulate various weather and usage patterns to help water users prepare for different scenarios.Scientists use what’s called the Colorado River Simulation System to project future levels of the two reservoirs. They employed “stress testing” techniques based on river flows since 1988 to determine potential shortages if drought conditions persist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/water-shortages-in-us-west-likelier-than-previously-thought/story-XYjMMAy4xj5B7Bzs9d6yfI.html
16-09-2020||India||Ties with neighbours haven’t declined: MoS||New Delhi Amid the dragging border standoff in Ladakh sector and the first use of guns along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 1975, the minister of state for external affairs wrote in response to a question to Parliament that India’s relations with its neighbours, including China, has not deteriorated recently. “No,” was minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan’s written reply to a question from Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy in Lok Sabha on whether bilateral ties with neighbours such as Nepal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Myanmar had deteriorated recently. The government accords highest priority to relations with neighbours and India is an “active political and economic partner of its neighbours and is involved in various projects, including development projects, with these countries”, the minister added.Interestingly, the minister appeared to contradict himself; in response to another question he reiterated India’s position that there had been enhanced deployment of troops and armaments by China in border areas and along the LAC since April-May, and that the Chinese side “attempted to transgress the LAC in several areas of the western sector” since mid-May. These attempts received an “appropriate response” from India, and China departed from the consensus for disengagement reached at a meeting of corps commanders on June 6 and “tried to unilaterally change the status quo”, he said. This resulted in a “violent face-off” in Galwan Valley on June 15, in which both sides “suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the senior commanders level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side”, Muraleedharan said.People familiar with developments said the minister of state’s answer was in response to a question about an overall assessment of India’s relations with all its neighbours collectively, and not on a particular bilateral relationship. On the specific issue of India-China relations, defence minister Rajnath Singh had outlined New Delhi’s position in his detailed statement in Parliament on Tuesday, the people said on condition of anonymity. Singh had said in his statement the current situation in the border areas with China was very different from past standoffs “in terms of the scale of troops involved and the number of friction points”. He also said the Chinese side had engaged in provocative military manoeuvres and violated agreements by amassing troops. On September 11 following external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, the ministry said that the Indian side had made it clear to the Chinese that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is “essential to the forward development of ties”, and that recent incidents in eastern Ladakh had “inevitably impacted the development of the bilateral relationship”. In a written reply to another question in Lok Sabha on whether India has started discussions with China regarding the recent tensions on the border, Muraleedharan noted the contacts between the foreign and defence ministers, military commanders and Special Representatives of the two sides and meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border issues since June. He noted that Jaishankar and Wang agreed on a five-point roadmap during their meeting in Moscow on September 10, whereby both sides will take guidance from the consensus reached by the top leadership, work to quickly disengage troops, abide by all agreements and protocols boundary affairs, continue dialogue through various mechanisms, and expedite work on new confidence-building measures for the border areas. “Accordingly, it is expected that the two sides will continue to have meetings of military and diplomatic officials to implement the agreements reached between the two foreign ministers and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” Muraleedharan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ties-with-neighbours-haven-t-declined-mos/story-OrkMdaFfSmDw9O2dmQoktN.html

16-09-2020||India||With Durga Puja a month away, Bengal govt gears up for festive season amid pandemic||With the festive season starting from Thursday and just around a month left for the Durga Puja, the Mamata Banerjee administration has started its preparations on how to organise the festival and the puja during the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has asked the police commissioners and superintendents of police of the districts to gather information about the pujas that are held in their respective areas. The local police stations would be asked to collect information about the pujas that would be held this year. “Even though such information is collected every year for crowd management, this year information would be gathered on how they plan to sanitise the pandals and maintain social distancing among visitors. Special stress would be given on crowd management this year,” said a senior government official. Also read: Union minister Nitin Gadkari tests positive for Covid-19, attended Day 1 of Parliament monsoon sessionChief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that the government would urge puja organisers to keep the pandals as much airy and open as possible to maintain free flow of air. This would stop the virus from spreading. The suggestion had come from the global advisory body set up by the government with Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee. The state government would hold a meeting with prominent puja organisers on September 25 to finalise the crowd management plans and other aspects of the festival this year. The festive season starts from Thursday with the Viswakarma Puja and Mahalaya. “We have already come up with an informal list of dos and don’ts for the members to follow. That needs to be finalized. We would soon hold a meeting with the government. The puja would be held this year but the festivities and the grandeur would be scaled down,” said Saswata Bau, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab. Out of the 4500-odd community pujas held in Kolkata alone, the forum has more than 370 of the most prominent and biggest pujas under its banner, including the ones that are patronised by some senior ministers in Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet. More than one lakh pujas are held across the state. This is the biggest festival in West Bengal. The forum had come up with a set of guidelines in July. The list of Dos and Don’ts includes reducing the size of pandals and idols so that they could be sanitized, restricting the number of pandal hoppers to 25 at a time, less decorative lighting to discourage crowding at night and allowing food stalls in pandal premises sans any seating arrangements, among others measures. “The 17-point code prepared by the forum also calls for offering only whole fruits to the goddess, less of interior decoration and airy pandals which can be seen from outside, thermal guns and sanitizers to be provided at pandals. No visitors would be allowed without wearing a face mask,” said Partha Ghosh, a member of the forum’s executive committee. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee was apparently keen on organizing the festival this year despite the pandemic. “Durga Puja is coming. We have to organize it. For that we have to stay fit from now,” she had said in July while addressing local clubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-durga-puja-a-month-away-bengal-govt-gears-up-for-festive-season-amid-pandemic/story-FBqxv2xTYCJwqvlM0qkMhK.html

The minister also pointed out that for the third successive year, large parts of Karnataka had been ravaged by floods and the Centre had sent a team recently to assess the extent of damage.During his visit, Yediyurappa is also likely to discuss cabinet expansion and reshuffle. Several aspirants, including some who crossed over from Congress and JDS to help BJP form the government, are waiting in the wings to get into the cabinet. A senior cabinet minister who did not want to be identified said: “This exercise has been overdue and everybody has been waiting patiently as all attention has been consumed in combating Covid. Not just aspirants who came from other parties to help us form government but some of our loyal MLAs who are 5-6 term legislators. They also need to be rewarded.”Some of the BJP MLAs like Umesh Katti, MP Kumaraswamy, Appachu Ranjan, Murgesh Nirani, Paranna Munavalli and N Thippa Reddy have been vocal about how they are aspirants for ministerial positions. While Yediyurappa has tried to accommodate some as chairmen of various boards and corporations of the state run entities, some have rejected those offers. Political analyst Manjunath said that the CM needs to do a careful balancing act of taking care of caste and regional interests as well as those of loyalists. “While ostensibly he is going to ask for immediate release of flood relief, cabinet expansion which has been stalled for nearly six months now would definitely be on the agenda. There are six vacancies, so some ‘non-performing’ ministers might be dropped and others accommodated with a few vacancies remaining to ensure that there is no trouble.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cabinet-expansion-flood-relief-in-yediyurappa-s-delhi-visit-plan/story-MSoEjHD4uIrWRqPF9ii04O.html

The call was made in a joint statement issued after external affairs minister S Jaishankar chaired a customary meeting of foreign ministers of the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) grouping via video conference. The other delegations were led by Brazil’s vice-minister for national sovereignty Fabio Marzano and South Africa’s minister of international relations Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor. The ministers discussed ways to further IBSA cooperation and exchanged views on global issues such as security, countering terror, climate change, sustainable development, multilateral trading system, non-proliferation and South-South cooperation. They also shared the experiences of their countries in countering the Covid-19 pandemic and appreciated the work done by the IBSA Fund for poverty alleviation and hunger. Also read: China belts out Punjabi numbers for Indian soldiers at Ladakh.

The three countries said they remain committed to enhancing the voice and representation of emerging and developing countries in decision-making bodies of multilateral institutions. “In light of the increasingly complex and inter-connected international challenges, we emphasise that the existing international governance structure is obsolete and cannot be fit-for-purpose to effectively address current peace and security challenges,” the joint statement said. While there has been some progress in international efforts for a comprehensive reform of the UN system, “advancing the reform of the Security Council should remain an urgent and key priority”, it added. The failure to reform the Security Council has “serious implications for international peace and security”, and accelerated reform is critical to ensure that the body is more representative, effective and responsive, the three countries said. Also read: Rajnath Singh to make statement on LAC in Rajya Sabha tomorrowThe grouping also expressed frustration at the slow progress in inter-governmental negotiations on Security Council reforms, which lacks transparency, and said the time has come to “move towards a result-oriented process, with provision for substantive negotiations based on a single comprehensive text, in a formal setting”.

16-09-2020||India||Lok Sabha passes bill to bring co-operative banks under RBI supervision||Protecting depositors’ interests, the Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, to bring co-operative banks under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured the House that the legislation empowers the central bank to regulate only the banking activities of co-operatives and it is not applicable to a primary agricultural credit society or a co-operative society providing finance for agricultural development.The Bill is not to “undermine” the importance of co-operatives, she said. “But, if a co-operative is performing banking functions, there is a need to regulate it... so that it functions professionally,” she said while replying to queries raised by members.The amendments do not affect existing powers of the state registrars of co-operative societies under state co-operative laws.Referring to the woes of depositors of Mumbai-headquartered Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC) and Bengaluru-based Sri Guru Raghavendra Co-operative Bank due to their lack of professionalism, she said while 430 co-operative banks faced liquidation in the last two decades, not a single commercial bank, whose depositors are protected by the Banking Regulation Act, have gone for liquidation. The legislation also enables making of a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation of a banking entity for protecting the interest of depositors without resorting to moratorium that freeze withdrawals by depositors. The Bill replaces an ordinance that was promulgated in pursuance of the commitment “to ensure safety of depositors across banks” by the President on June 26.Sitharaman said the government was compelled to come out with an ordinance during the lockdown period because conditions of cooperative banks were “grave” and there was “uncertainty” regarding the normal legislative business due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government had tabled the bill in the Parliament in March this year, but it could not be enacted due to the outbreak of the pandemic.“During the budget session in March, we introduced this bill in order to have the amendments brought in so that depositors’ interest will be taken care of. But unfortunately, during the budget session, we could not have this bill passed,” Sitharaman said.Moving the bill in the House, Sitharaman said that financial health of several cooperative banks was becoming “very delicate”. She said that 277 urban cooperative banks were reporting loss and 105 co-operative banks were unable to meet the minimum capital requirement.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said, “Cooperative banks have been under severe criticisms with rising scams especially involving small retail depositors. State Governments and their respective regulatory Boards have not been able to keep up the monitoring mechanisms efficiently over these institutions. The Government was waiting for an opportune moment to bring them under the purview of RBI and the timing couldn’t have been better.”“Capital adequacy ratios of most of these banks are concerning and the present regulatory structure does not make the restructuring of these institutions practically feasible. The Bill strikes the right chord and has given a mechanism to restructure these banks and also significantly improves their regulatory oversight by a competent and efficient regulator, the RBI. This move should certainly improve the confidence in the cooperative banks and the interest of all the stakeholders would be protected in the long run,” he said.Keeping agricultural cooperatives outside the ambit of the Bill is a tactical move, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-bring-co-operative-banks-under-rbi-supervision/story-4OhrZF52GG8EgWkWeDT6hP.html

16-09-2020||India||‘How many police stations have CCTV cameras?’: SC asks states to respond in 2 months||Two years after the Supreme Court directed installation of CCTVs in police stations across the country, a three-judge bench on Wednesday issued orders to Chief Secretaries of states and Union territories to inform the progress on affidavits before November 24.“The Registry (of Supreme Court) is directed to issue notice to the Chief Secretary of each State and Union Territory to respond on the following points: what exactly is the position with respect to CCTV cameras fitted in each and every Police Station in the State or Union Territory and what is the position qua constitution of Oversight Committees in accordance with our order dated April 3, 2018,” said a bench of Justices RF Nariman, Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee.The Court, in its April 2018 order, had approved the “Centrally Driven Plan of Action” suggested by a Committee of the Ministry of Home Affairs to strengthen the rule of law. This talked about audio-video recording of statement given by accused to police under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and videography of crime scene. Additionally, the Court directed, “With a view to check human rights abuse, CCTV cameras be installed in all police stations as well as in prisons.” The order further required every state to have an independent oversight committee that would study the CCTV camera footage and periodically publish reports of its observations.Also read: China belts out Punjabi numbers for Indian soldiers at Ladakh. It is a ‘62 trickReviving the case in an incident involving alleged custodial torture in Punjab, Justice Nariman appointed senior advocate Siddharth Dave as amicus curiae and sought a report on steps needed to check such violations. The Court even requested Attorney General KK Venugopal to assist in the matter.Speaking to HT, amicus curiae Siddharth Dave said, “The affidavits filed by the Centre from time to time do not mention whether all states/UTs have installed CCTV cameras in all police stations and prisons. No details of police stations having CCTV cameras have been provided by states either. There is a Central Oversight Body under the Ministry of Home Affairs monitoring the directions of the Court passed in April 2018 but not much progress has been made.”On Wednesday, the AG could not appear but Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Madhavi Divan told the bench that details of CCTV installation in prisons and police stations are in the process of being gathered. The bench gave further time to the Centre to collect the same and added states and UTs for compilation of statistics by the amicus.“We expect the Chief Secretary of the States and Union Territories to take this matter seriously and in right earnest, since it involves the fundamental rights of the citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the Court observed in its order and posted the matter for hearing on November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-many-police-stations-have-cctv-cameras-sc-asks-states-to-respond-in-2-months/story-tJGCL0PANHYTlBsX5Z7TRJ.html

Five people who were injured in the Kozhikode air crash last month are still receiving medical attention at hospitals, the minister said.On August 7, an Air India Express flight from Dubai with 190 people overshot the tabletop runway during landing at the Kozhikode airport in heavy rain and fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into pieces, killing 21 people, including the pilots.A day after the crash, Puri had said 149 people have been admitted to hospitals, 23 have been discharged, while three were critically injured in the B737 plane crash. In a written reply to a question, Puri told Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, “As on 14.09.2020, there are five persons who are still receiving medical attention at hospitals.” On August 13, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) had announced the formation of a five-member panel to inquire into the circumstances of the Kozhikode plane crash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kozhikode-air-crash-report-to-be-submitted-within-5-months-says-hardeep-singh-puri/story-UeEQJIqUGIf0ItKH7CHN3L.html

In Mumbai Central Jail and Tihar Jail in Delhi, the number of inmates is almost three times of the sanctioned capacity, the number of inmates getting infected was also high.Also read: Ban on export of PPE coveralls, hydroxychloroquine, sanitizers lifted“We may not conclusively say that congested jails reported higher Covid-19 cases as sufficient data is not available. However, states such as Punjab and Rajasthan moved prisoners from congested jails to lesser congested ones to prevent spread of Covid-19,” said NCAT coordinator Suhas Chakma.A study by Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative in July said that about 61,100 inmates or about 15.4 percent of total prisoners were released from jails in a bid to decongest the jails because of the pandemic. “The overall reduction of 15.4 percent in overall occupancy is not adequate to address the overcrowding of 40 percent of the Indian prisons,” Chakma said.As Covid-19 started spreading in jails, several state governments took steps, such as mandatory quarantine for new prisoners in temporary jails, mandatory Covid-19 tests for new inmates and release of those inmates arrested for non-heinous crimes, to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Maharashtra prison department spokesperson Shahu Darade said they imposed strict lockdown at each prison with staff not allowed to go home for a month and new prisoners tested for Covid-19. The state created 78 temporary prisons, released 11,000 prisoners in past five months and tested half of 26,000 inmates for Covid-19, he said. So far, around 9 percent of the inmates have tested positive.Also read: US outlines sweeping plan to provide free Covid-19 vaccinesOdisha’s additional director general of police (prisons) Santosh Upadhyay said every new prisoner testing positive for Covid-19 was send to Covid Care Centers. “The inmates are being sent to regular jails only after their recovery,” he said. Odisha released around 17,000 under-trials and moved 1,202 to lesser congested prisons.Like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh director general (prison) Anand Kumar said new prisoners were first lodged in 85 temporary jails for 14-day quarantine before sending them to regular jails where they were put in 14 days quarantine again. In addition, all 1.32 lakh inmates and staff in UP jails have been tested for Covid-19. Till now, 7,295 Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from UP jails of which 6,129 have recovered, he said. Besides following protocol for jails as enumerated above, Rajasthan Director general (DG), prisons, BL Soni said, special Covid Care Centers were set up for inmates and prison staff who tested positive for the infection. “We are also giving special immunity-boosting diet to prisoners,” he said.Chakma said the report shows that the infection was fast spreading in jails and Covid-19 protocols were not being followed. “States are not proactive in providing information on Covid-19 cases in jails and that prevents effective intervention,” he said.(With inputs from bureaus in Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhuvaneshwar and Jaipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-fourth-jails-in-india-report-covid-19-cases-many-highly-congested-report/story-Fb3z8MvZEtHIvXQBOYFtZK.html
16-09-2020||India||Amid border row, Indian army busts myth of PLA’s might||The recent actions by Indian Army amid the border tension demonstrate India’s determination to stand up to China’s bullying and its efforts to use coercion to have its way, experts have said.The armies of the two countries are in close proximity in some areas of eastern Ladakh. The Chinese PLA, which has not fought a war since it got a bloody nose against Vietnam, might have underestimated India’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.For all their famed strategic thinking and planning, they failed to take into account the bravery and courage of Indian soldiers.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has made it clear that India was ready to deal with “any situation”.“I want to assure you that we are ready to deal with any situation. I request this House to pass a resolution that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces who are guarding our borders to safeguard India’s sovereignty and integrity,” Singh said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.“Violent conduct of Chinese troops is a violation of all past agreements. Our troops have done counter deployments in the area to safeguard our borders,” he said.Singh said that China has mobilised a huge number of Army battalions and armaments along LAC and inner areas.“There are many friction points in eastern Ladakh, Gogra, Kongka La, Pangong Lake’s north and south banks. Indian Army has made counter deployments in these areas,” he said.The two countries have been engaged in a standoff position since April-May and the Chinese have refused to vacate areas in the Finger area and other friction points in the Eastern Ladakh area.In many ways, India has shattered the myth of Chinese indomitable military might. Strategic experts acknowledge that the recent developments at the India-China border have changed the so-called ‘asymmetry in power’ argument.India holding on at the border ‘head-on’ for over four months in the face of China’s much-vaunted military and economic might, a fact that the Chinese propaganda machinery never fails to highlight, has proved that the asymmetry of power argument does not hold water any more.Indian force mobilisation has been effective and it has a competitive advantage in mountain warfare owing to the Indian Army’s experience of being deployed at high altitudes.The gallant action by Indian soldiers in Galwan clash in June was acknowledged the world over.India capturing tactically important commanding heights on the top of the five posts to the south of Pangong Tso on August 29-30 tilted the balance in favour of India, experts said.The operations to secure the heights on those features were undertaken by the Special Frontier Force (SFF) comprising Tibetans. Taking those heights could lead to interception of Chinese forces, giving India a tactical advantage.The experts said Indian troops can intercept Chinese moving from Chushul to Demchok through the valleys below.In a bid to showcase its military might, the PLA has deployed 50,000 strong troops with modern weaponry ready to unleash their power against India. The Chinese have also made many diplomatic statements that were coercive.These have come from their Ministry of Foreign Affairs, their Defence Ministry, their Western Theatre Command and from the Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times. The different Chinese statements have appeared interventionist, prescriptive and coercive, the experts said. Consequently, China faced reverses on the Indian front.After the Pentagon’s annual report on China declared the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as “the largest navy in the world” and highlighted its increasing capabilities, the former Director of National Security Council Secretariat of India, Tara Kartha observed that such forecasts and warnings did not affect Indian decision to counter Chinese belligerence in Ladakh.“For India, warnings of Chinese aggressiveness were ‘superfluous’ given the ongoing conflict. Forecasts of superior Chinese power did not affect Delhi’s decision to meet the threat head-on, something that other countries need to acknowledge. China is certainly a power to reckon with, but it is not quite the dragon that the Pentagon or Beijing paints it to be,” Kartha quipped.“There was this argument that India being a $2-trillion economy and China being five times that meant that China had a major advantage. They have a much stronger military force, much bigger economy, bigger military spending etc so India is no match for China - that myth has been busted. Concerted action on the part of India has yielded results,” said Srikanth Kondapalli, Chinese affairs professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.A leading US publication Newsweek reported that the Chinese President Xi Jinping he has risked his future with the high profile incursions into Indian territory that ‘unexpectedly flopped’ in the face of a ferocious fightback by the Indian Army.The Chinese army’s failures on the Indian border will have consequences, it said, adding “you can say the Indians are more aggressive or more aggressively defensive, but they are in fact bolder and better. The setback in the Himalayas poses problems for Xi, which means it poses a problem for everyone else.”Now, the Chinese side seems to have climbed down and changed tack suddenly, the experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-border-row-indian-army-busts-myth-of-pla-s-might/story-Snr1vWgFzzgWrlPFhmkX5I.html

This affected the supply of liquid oxygen to Madya Pradesh by a Maharashtra-based private company. The company used to supply 20 tonnes of medical oxygen daily to Madhya Pradesh. The circular affected and led to a shortage of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients in several districts of Madhya Pradesh. On September 10, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had a talk with Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and urged him to restore the supply of oxygen. The central government too intervened with the secretary of health ministry writing to all chief secretaries to continue the supply. Also read: Russia partners with Dr Reddy’s for trials, distribution of Sputnik vaccineIssuing an interim order on Wednesday on a petition filed by Dr PS Thakur, superintendent of Maharaja Yeshwantrao (MY) Hospital in Indore, the high court’s bench of Justice SC Sharma and Justice Surendra Shukla said, “By way of interim relief M/s Inox Air Products Pvt Ltd is directed to continue uninterrupted supply of liquid medical oxygen to the state of Madhya Pradesh including the petitioner hospital, without being influenced by the circular dated September 7, 2020.” The court said, “It has been argued by the advocate general that a common man cannot afford to avail treatment in the hospitals like Bombay Hospital, Apollo Hospital, Vedanta Hospital and other private super-speciality hospitals and the petitioner hospital is the only ray of hope for the poor people.”Quoting advocate general Purusheaindra Kaurav, the court said, “Madhya Pradesh is importing liquid medical oxygen from Maharastra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. As on date, the total requirement of oxygen in the state is about 100 tonnes per day and keeping in view the increase in number of Covid-19 patients, the hospitals will be requiring 270-280 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen per day as on October 31, 2020... He has drawn the attention of this court towards an agreement executed by the petitioner hospital with respondent Inox Air Products Pvt. Ltd…The agreement between the petitioner and the respondent is very much in force.”“The advocate general has stated that there cannot be discrimination between Covid-19 patients of various states and if a Covid-19 patient of Maharashtra is in need of liquid medical oxygen, the Covid-19 patient of Madhya Pradesh is also in need of liquid medical oxygen. He cannot be given nitrogen in place of liquid medical oxygen… He has argued before this court that it is very unfortunate that even after the intervention of the Government of India, the oxygen supply is being discontinued. He has also informed this court that a large number of patients are dying because of Covid-19 and state cannot close its eyes towards those who are dying on account of non-supply of liquid medical oxygen.”The court directed issuance of notices to five respondents namely secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; principal secretary, Public Health Department, Maharashtra; Inox Air Products Pvt Ltd and Medical Education and Public Health and Family Welfare departments of Madhya Pradesh.

16-09-2020||India||Postal ballot facility for Covid-hit in Kerala local body election||The Kerala government on Wednesday decided to introduce necessary amendments in the state Panchayati Raj Act to extend postal ballot facility to Covid-19 patients during the local body polls. The local body elections in the state are likely to be conducted by mid-October. Trends in the local body polls that precede the assembly elections are usually indicative of voter preferences. Since the assembly is not in session it will be brought as an ordinance, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office. Earlier state election commissioner V Bhaskaran had proposed to the government to bring amendments in the act to facilitate either proxy voting (a voter can delegate his family member or others to cast his vote) or postal ballot for those who are Covid-19 positive and placed under quarantine. But the opposition Congress and BJP have opposed proxy voting and said they were not averse to the postal ballot. The ruling CPI() feels that it is unfair to keep a large number of people out of the poll process due to the pandemic situation. In some areas in the state, reverse quarantine is strictly implemented and in that case people above 65 will also face problems. Reserve quarantine is a practice of separating vulnerable people, aged or people with co- morbidity conditions from the rest and monitoring their health indicators closely. Meanwhile, the state has reported the highest single-day tally with 3830 Covid cases, taking the total number of Covid-19 infected to 1,17,806. Some 84,608 have recovered and the active cases stand at 32,709. With 14 more casualties, the death toll went up to 480. Kerala was the first state in the country to report a coronavirus case in January but half of the total cases in the state have come up in the last one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/postal-ballot-facility-for-covid-hit-in-kerala-local-body-election/story-q9SmtVnw3fgDtyOEZkm8SM.html

The government has also lifted the ban imposed on the export of ventilators.While the export of diagnostic kits, N-95/FFP2 masks is currently restricted, they can be exported in a limited monthly quota, the commerce ministry said in the statement.The ban on the export of medical supplies was put in place earlier this year to ensure domestic availability of the items in the view of the rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in the country. The curbs have been relaxed following a time-to-time assessment of the domestic requirement, production capacity and the availability of surplus products for export, the statement added.The government also hailed the increased domestic production of the items to meet the requirement amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Goyal said that prior to March 20, India was importing PPE coveralls as there was very limited domestic production. However, now the domestic production has gone up to 1.5 crore units per month and hence, the lift of the export ban, he added.The availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers that was at 10 lakh litres per annum earlier has subsequently increased to 38 lakh litres per day, enabling the prohibition on its export to be removed, he said in a statement.The minister also pointed towards the ramped-up production of domestically manufactured ventilators, which he said, was negligible prior to January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-export-of-ppe-coveralls-hydroxychloroquine-sanitizers-lifted/story-mVZtOtPMCD5kdsU3lNLgVK.html
16-09-2020||India||‘2020 could be turning point for climate change’: TERI director-general Ajay Mathur||Two global reports this week have indicated that the world is undergoing a massive transition in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. The BP Energy Outlook 2020 released on Monday indicated that global CO2 emissions may have already peaked in 2019 and are likely to decline hereafter depending on how countries build back after Covid-19. It also said there is a declining role of fossil fuels, offset ‎by an increasing share of renewable energy.The Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), a coalition of energy-producing companies, environmental NGOs, banks, et cetera., has released a report, ‘Making Mission Possible’, on Wednesday which said developed countries could reach a net-zero emissions by 2050 and developing countries like India could do so by 2060 with large scale changes in energy use.Ajay Mathur, co-chair, ETC and Director General, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) said it is possible that the global CO2 emissions have already peaked in 2019. Here are the excerpts from the interview:Q. Where will the money come from for the transition to net-zero emission (overall balance in CO2 emitted and CO2 removed) economy?A. All developing countries are growing. They are going to invest in new capital because of growing demand and also to replace existing capital stock as it finishes its life. We need the money in any case. The question is under what circumstances will that money flow? Money will flow if it is making profits. Whether it is domestic banks or international funds they will invest. Invested in renewable energy in India right now, investments will happen because investors see money coming back with a profit. If you consider the total amount of money that is needed between 2020 and 2050 is 1 to 2 percent of the additional cost to transition to net-zero scenario in this period. We need profit-making investment opportunities. (Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would cost an estimated 1 trillion-2 trillion dollars a year of additional investments according to ETC).Also read: Russia partners with Dr Reddy’s for trials, distribution of Sputnik vaccineQ. The BP energy outlook report indicated that global CO2 emissions may have peaked in 2019? Is that possible?A. Globally, it may be possible. If the US and China have started recording declining CO2 emissions at least between 2019 and 2020 then clearly the world is on a declining path. In India, the question is slightly different. We still haven’t reached our peak electricity consumption. Everyday electricity demand is more than what it was yesterday. Where does that electricity come from? Today solar is the cheapest electricity we have but only when the sun is shining. At night coal electricity is the cheapest. In the short term, we will have a share of coal and renewable energy increase. This will continue till renewables plus storage (battery) produce electricity which costs less than coal. Last month, Solar Energy Corporation of India tenders said that solar plus storage will be provided at a price which is competitive to coal electricity in two years’ time. It will then not make sense in investing in energy generation from coal. It is quite possible that we may have peaked but like they say, ‘one swallow does not a summer make’. We have to see how things change.Q. Did the pandemic contribute to the fact that we may have peaked earlier than expected?A. We saw a peak for energy demand in February or March this year which was less than energy demand last year. How the recovery now occurs is anybody’s guess. It’s too early to say. There are many people who think the way I do who are investing in renewable energy but it’s very difficult to forecast.Q. Your report speaks about achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. What does that mean for the common man?A. For a common person, I will suggest five things. 1) Buy the most energy-efficient air conditioner you can. The largest source for the increase in demand for electricity in India is from air conditioners. We have 50 percent more efficient air conditioners than those available in 2007. 2) Anybody who has the option should set up rooftop solar. It makes economic sense. 3) Use electric two-wheelers, they make sense in urban areas. Even electric cars and taxis make sense but this will depend on the building of charging stations. 4) For industries, it makes sense to consider electricity or hydrogen instead of coal but reliability of supply matters. 5) Steel is looking at tripling capacity in the next 15 years in India. We mix coke and iron ore to make steel. Can we use something else instead? Our report talks about using hydrogen. A company in Sweden is trying hydrogen technology. We need scale to grow and prices to decline. This is the kind of picture we see till 2060 which will help the world to move toward zero carbon.Q. What are the global factors, conditions which have led to this transition in energy?A. It’s difficult to find one or two reasons. One is the regulatory requirement in many parts of the world to move towards renewable energy. Countries like Germany were ready to accept and move at a higher cost. Production promoted economies of scale and led to prices coming down. We started seeing a decline in prices of renewable energy so that they became competitive with fossil fuel energy. Regulatory requirements and decrease in cost are the two main reasons for the shift we are seeing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-could-be-turning-point-for-climate-change-teri-director-general-ajay-mathur/story-7gsf2egEJ84hJ2J09CTomI.html
16-09-2020||India||Minister asked in Parliament if ties with neighbours have slumped. He replies||Amid the dragging border standoff in Ladakh sector and the first use of guns along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 1975, the minister of state for external affairs wrote in response to a question to Parliament that India’s relations with its neighbours, including China, has not deteriorated recently. “No,” was minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan’s written reply to a question from Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy in Lok Sabha on whether bilateral ties with neighbours such as Nepal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Myanmar had deteriorated recently.The government accords highest priority to relations with neighbours and India is an “active political and economic partner of its neighbours and is involved in various projects, including development projects, with these countries”, he said.Responding to another question, also from Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy, on whether China has good relations with any of India’s other neighbours, Muraleedharan said the country’s relations with other countries “stand on their own footing and are independent of the relations of those countries with third countries”. People familiar with the matter said the minister of state’s answer was in response to a question about an overall assessment of India’s relations with all its neighbours collectively and not on a particular bilateral relationship. On the specific issue of India-China relations, defence minister Rajnath Singh had outlined New Delhi’s position in his detailed statement in Parliament on Tuesday, the people said on condition of anonymity. Singh had said in his statement that the current situation in the border areas with China was very different from past standoffs “in terms of the scale of troops involved and the number of friction points”. He also said the Chinese side had engaged in provocative military manoeuvres and violated agreements by amassing troops. The stand taken by the government in Parliament comes days after the external affairs ministry statement on September 11 following external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. According to the statement, the Indian side had made it clear to the Chinese that maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is “essential to the forward development of ties”, and that recent incidents in eastern Ladakh had “inevitably impacted the development of the bilateral relationship”. In a written reply to another question in the Lok Sabha on whether India has started discussions with China regarding the recent tensions on the border, Muraleedharan noted the contacts between the foreign and defence ministers, military commanders and Special Representatives of the two sides and meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border issues since June. He noted that Jaishankar and Wang agreed on a five-point roadmap during their meeting in Moscow on September 10, whereby both sides will take guidance from the consensus reached by the top leadership, work to quickly disengage troops, abide by all agreements and protocols boundary affairs, continue dialogue through various mechanisms, and expedite work on new confidence-building measures for the border areas. “Accordingly, it is expected that the two sides will continue to have meetings of military and diplomatic officials to implement the agreements reached between the two foreign ministers and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” Muraleedharan said. Muraleedharan reiterated India’s position that there had been enhanced deployment of troops and armaments by China in border areas and along the LAC since April-May, and that the Chinese side “attempted to transgress the LAC in several areas of the western sector” since mid-May. These attempts received an “appropriate response” from India, and China departed from the consensus for disengagement reached at a meeting of corps commanders on June 6 and “tried to unilaterally change the status quo”, he said. This resulted in a “violent face-off” in Galwan Valley on June 15, in which both sides “suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the senior commanders level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side”, Muraleedharan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-asked-in-parliament-if-ties-with-china-have-slumped-he-replies/story-AOXNIf0GnexRiJc7E3yZDN.html
16-09-2020||India||Tatas’ bid puts them in front to bag new Parliament building contract||Two Mumbai-based construction companies - Larsen & Toubro Limited and Tata Projects Limited - on Wednesday submitted financial bids after qualifying in the technical round for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex in which Tata Projects has emerged as the lowest bidder.A spokesperson for Tata projects Ltd confirmed that the firm has emerged as the lowest bidder for the project. Tata Projects Ltd has quoted a figure of Rs 861.90 crore and Larsen and Toubro Ltd has quoted its bid of Rs 865 crore for constructing the new Parliament complex. According to the CPWD’s tender, the estimated cost of construction for the new building is Rs 889 crore. In total, three bidders had qualified in the technical round but only two firms ended up submitting their financial bids. The firms were scheduled to submit the financial bids on Wednesday.“Only three parties had technically pre-qualified in the first round and only two have quoted their bids today. The firm that bags the contract will be issued a letter of award within a few days,” a senior government official said requesting anonymity.The contract is likely to be awarded to the lowest bidder, the official added. To be clear, in infrastructure projects the firm is finalised only after getting the letter of award for the project.The government had narrowed the list of choices for building a new Parliament complex to three Mumbai-based construction companies -- Larsen & Toubro Limited, Tata Projects Limited and Shapoorji Pallonji & Company Private Limited -- after disqualifying four other entities that bid for the contract, bringing it a step closer to tendering out the project, Hindustan Times had first reported on August 12.In the technical round Mumbai-based construction and civil engineering company ITD Cementation India Limited, Hyderabad-headquartered NCC Limited , PSP Projects Limited of Ahmedabad, and Uttar Pradesh state government’s UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited were disqualified from the project by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD).Based on an evaluation, CPWD disqualified four companies for reasons including non-fulfilment of the criteria mentioned in the bid document.The tender laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work — such as having constructed an assembly hall with a minimum capacity of 1,000 people and a building with a basement — as well as ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth, among other factors.Bidders had to specify similar work completed in the past seven years, ongoing projects, as well as tentative plans to meet their manpower requirement, source of construction materials, and establishment of facilities such as those meant for fabrication.The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship, the bid document said. The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled for work of stone masonry, carving, fresco, furniture, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.Initially seven firms had evinced interest in the construction of the new Parliament building after pre-qualification bids invited by the Centre for its ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project.Work on the new Parliament, a ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building, is expected to begin after the ongoing monsoon session, HT reported on September 15.India’s national emblem is likely to sit atop the new Parliament building, according to the latest design iteration prepared for the tendering process, replacing a spire that was meant to come up in an earlier version.The new complex, with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures.It will be among the first projects to be finalised and tendered out as part of the Central Vista redevelopment, which includes plans to turn North and South Block, situated opposite each other on Raisina Hill and which house top central government ministries, into a museum and the construction of new administrative offices with an underground metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tatas-bid-puts-them-in-front-to-bag-new-parliament-building-contract/story-mtPueojPUNA2RbL1w3A3ML.html
16-09-2020||India||‘Big experience in winter warfare’: Army officer amid border row||Indian soldiers have a huge experience of winter warfare, said Indian Army officer on Wednesday, adding the troops are psychologically tuned to operate at a short notice. The comment comes on the back of bursts of bullets fired into the air last week on the northern bank of Pangong Tso amid a protracted stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). It may be stated that retired Indian army generals and defence analysts anticipate a long haul and a hot winter in the eastern Ladakh this year. “India is a peace loving country and wishes to have good relations with its neighbours. India always prefers to resolve issues through dialogue. While talks are in progress to resolve the issue of borders with China in Eastern Ladakh, at military level it is well prepared for the prolonged stand-off,” said the officer. Also read: China blames India, claims it’s honouring border pacts“Altitudes in Ladakh range from high to super high and there is a lot of snowfall, after the month of November up to 40 feet of snow is experienced. Coupled with this, temperature dipping down to minus 30 to 40 degrees is a usual phenomenon. Wind chill factor makes matters even worse for the troops. The roads also get closed due to the snow. But despite all this, the most encouraging part for India is that the Indian soldiers have a huge experience of winter warfare and are psychologically tuned to operate at a short notice. While this fact is known to the world, the operational logistics capabilities are hardly known,” he added. It is important to understand that the Army has experience of Siachen where conditions are much more demanding than the frontiers with China. Traditionally, there were two routes for moving into Ladakh, that is through Zojila and Rohtang Passes. Recently, India commissioned the third road from Darcha to Leh which is much shorter distance wise and less prone to closure. Completion of Atal tunnel on the Rohtang route has force multiplied the logistic capacities. Special fuel and lubricants for tanks and armoured personnel carriers have also been stocked adequately, including spares for their maintenance. Water points and tube wells have been established for the troops and animals like mules and yaks. The living barracks have also been prepared which are comfortable and warm. Facilities such as the central heating system are some of the high points of these facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-experience-of-winter-war-army-s-northern-command-amid-border-row/story-bgUfaiF1pVhUNdmne8yAYI.html
16-09-2020||India||Covid grounds Ludhiana’s ‘Hawai Adda’ eatery||Covid-19 pandemic can be fatal not only for humans, it can sound the death knell even for the inanimate things. Amid news of businesses wrapping up due to unviable conditions, Ludhiana lost its iconic restaurant — Hawai Adda — set in an Airbus A320 on Ferozepur Road. After remaining closed for nearly five months, the plane was dismantled late on Monday evening and its parts quietly removed in trucks to a godown on Tuesday morning. The exact reason behind the move couldn’t be established as the owners of the facility were incommunicado. The restaurant that opened in January 2017 had become a landmark of the city. The only one of its kind restaurant in the region, the owners had made great efforts to turn the idea into a reality. They procured an Airbus A320 in scrap and converted it into a vegetarian multi-cuisine restaurant in four months. In the initial months when the restaurant opened, dining there had become a craze as locals would wait in queue for hours for space. It was especially popular among children. Commuters would halt at the spot to take selfies and photographs. A case regarding the leased-out property between the owners of the restaurant and Milkfed, the state-run cooperative, is also sub-judice in the high court. The lease of the property expired in March 2018 and the owners were demanding extension and Milkfed a hike in rent.Damanjit Kaur of Nehru Nagar said, “It was always a joyful experience to have dinner inside the plane, especially for those who have never been inside a plane. We were planning a dinner at the restaurant with our daughter-in-law, who is from Lucknow; sadly we missed.” Ludhiana Verka plant general manager Rajkumar said, “The lease period of the property had expired in March 2018 and new tenders were floated. A bidder quoted ₹5.20 lakh monthly rent for the property against ₹1.21 lakh being paid by the owners of the Hawai Adda. The owners were asked to make a higher bid or vacate the land. But they moved court and the case is pending. We have no idea why the plane has been shifted from the site,” he said. Owner of Hawai Adda Jaswinder Singh did not respond to calls made by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/covid-grounds-ludhiana-s-hawai-adda-eatery/story-IQoCGlfsTTNpFsBjl9FBmM.html

16-09-2020||India||Kedarnath search operation restarts||Ten Uttarakhand police and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams on Wednesday restarted a search operation along the treacherous mountainous routes leading to Kedarnath to trace the remains of hundreds of people, who remain missing since flash floods and landslides ravaged the region 3,553 m above sea level in June 2013. Kedarnath is the site of a revered Hindu temple in Uttarakhand’s Rudraprayag district.Rudraprayag police superintendent Navneet Singh Bhullar said each team comprises two police and SDRF personnel each as well as local guides and medical experts. “Seven teams will undertake the search operation for four days while the three teams for six days.”The fresh search effort comes a month after the Uttarakhand government constituted a high-level multi-institutional expert committee to suggest appropriate technology or methodology for searching the remains of 3,075 missing people. Remains of 699 people have been recovered since tens of thousands of Hindu devotees, who visit the region annually for the pilgrimage to Kedarnath, Gangotri, Badrinath, and Yamunotri, were trapped as record rains triggered landslides and floods. Villages were buried and gushing waters washed away roads and homes. The devastation, which was dubbed as the Himalayan tsunami, led to one of the largest rescue operations involving the Indian Air force. Over 100,000 people were airlifted from the devastated areas. As many as 545 remains were recovered in 2013, 63 in 2014, three in 2015, 60 in 2016, seven in 2017, and 21 in 2018. The state government in May 2017 constituted five special investigation teams to trace and cremate the bodies of the missing people months after the Uttarakhand high court directed it to do so in November 2016.In June, the high court directed the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology to suggest scientific ways that can be adopted to trace the remains of 3,075 people without harming the Himalayan environment.The search operation has been launched even as rains have been lashing parts of the state.Bhullar said the operation had to be restarted before the weather in high attitude Kedarnath area makes it difficult to conduct it.Bhullar said the teams have been provided with body bags, trekking gear, sleeping bags, and other tools to help them trace the remains during their treks along the routes.He added the medical experts will collect samples for DNA testing and keep a record of the remains found. “The remains will be brought back in the body bags so that their last rites could be held as per the Hindu tradition.”Delhi-based activist Ajay Gautam, who moved the Uttarakhand high court in 2014 seeking directions to the authorities to expedite the search for the missing, said he is happy that the search operation has been restarted. “This will help so many families to find closure and perform last rites of their loved ones who died in the tragedy.”The Uttarakhand government provided the first official estimate--5,748--of the missing persons in July 2013, making their families eligible for financial relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-search-operation-restarts/story-Qipv0Y6EtFlAHwuZeTusrK.html

The accused have been named for orchestrating the riots that killed at least 53 people and injured hundreds.Out of the 21 persons arrested so far, police charge-sheeted 15 accused based on scientific, documentary and testimonial evidence gathered during investigation. The remaining 6 persons are expected to be charge sheeted in due course after collecting sufficient evidence and completing statutory and procedural requirements, police said in a statement.The charge sheet filed by Delhi police special cell at Karkardooma Court is over 17,000 pages. Packed in steel boxes, 2,692 pages of the vast charge sheet specifies the charges against the accused whereas the rest pages include the annexure. Among those named in the charge sheet are Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Ishrat Jahan, Meeran Haider, Safoora Zargar and Khalif Saifi.In February, Delhi was shaken up with communal riots, worst in at least three decade, with clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several parts of the city. Houses were burnt and broken into, while vehicles were set on fire. It all started as clashes between pro- and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act groups,but further escalated into communal violence with rioters from both communities, taking to streets armed with swords, stones and guns.The fifteen people named in the charge sheet have been accused under sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, IPC and Arms Act. For the investigation in the case, the police on Wednesday said they are relying on WhatsApp chats and call records. Twenty-five Whatsapp groups were created for each of the protest sites, police said.“There was an impression that it was an anti- CAA protest but conspirators were being guided through the protest sites,” said police.The charge sheet filed by police on Wednesday does not name Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam as accused in Delhi riots case. Umar and Sharjeel were arrested a few days ago and their names will be in the supplementary charge sheet.- Delhi Police registered 751 cases -In connection with the riots that took place in Delhi, police received over 16,000 PCR calls and registered a total of 751 cases.Of 751 cases, 59 cases were assigned to SIT constituted in the Crime Branch, 691 cases were investigated by the district police and one case, which was registered on March 6, 2020 to investigate the larger conspiracy behind these riots, was assigned to the Special Cell, police said in a statement.In order to investigate specific offences committed during these riots, police has seized 12 pistols, 121 empty cartridges, 92 live cartridges, 61 glass bottles filled with noxious chemicals and an assortment of sharp-edged weapons in the matter.- Took 195 days to complete first phase of investigation -Further in the statement, police said that it took 195 days for Delhi police’s special cell to complete the first phase of investigation, during which, 747 witnesses were questioned.Police has seized at least 75 electronic devices as part of the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-files-over-10-000-page-charge-sheet-in-delhi-riots-case-names-15-people/story-rM0CIS1I68oZtYRHiLV3xL.html

While around 20 tonnes arrived on Monday, another 40 tonnes reached on Tuesday. On Wednesday the remaining 40 tonnes have arrived,” said SA Maqsood, secretary of the Fish Importers’ Association in West Bengal. In 2012, Bangladesh had imposed a ban on export of hilsa to India. The Sheikh Hasina government in 2019 decided to allow 500 tonnes of the fish as a puja gift to Bengal. The festive season starts from Thursday with the Vishwakarma Puja and the Mahalaya.“The imported fish weigh between 600 grams to 1.2 kilos and costs around Rs 600 to Rs 1,300 per kilo. The Bangladeshi variety is tastier and more meaty and oily than the Indian counterparts,” said Maqsood. This comes at a time when millions of Bengalis are facing a crippling shortage of their favourite fish. This year many had thought that with cleaner rivers post-lockdown there would be a big hilsa harvest. Experts had said that as pollution in the river Ganga and its tributaries was less this year because of the lockdown, there were chances that schools of hilsa would migrate upstream to breed. “But in reality the hilsa catch has gone down over the past three to four years. In 2016 there was a huge harvest of a few hundred tonnes. Compared to this we have been able to harvest less than 20 tonnes this year,” said Pranab Kumar Kar, chairman of United Fishermen Association, one of the largest associations of fishermen in West Bengal.Monsoon is the main season when these fish are available. Such is the craving for Bangladeshi hilsa that the item is often smuggled through the porous Indo-Bangla border in south Bengal. The BSF have seized a few hundred kilos of Bangaldeshi hilsa this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-tonnes-of-hilsa-from-bangladesh-reaches-bengal-more-on-the-way/story-CRyURBTEbgJoNzPOHKhJnO.html

The seven-day moving average of the recoveries shows a consistent surge, the ministry said in a statement.However, despite the highest number of recoveries in the world, the nation’s Covid-19 tally has surpassed five million.As the infections continue to rise at an alarming rate, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund’s deal with an Indian pharma firm is likely to bring respite.Pharmaceuticals major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has reached an agreement with the Russian body to cooperate on clinical trials and distribution of the Sputnik V vaccine for Covid-19 in India. “Upon regulatory approval in India, the RDIF shall supply to Dr Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine,” the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has said in a statement.Also, as multiple vaccine candidates against Covid-19 are under trials in the country, health minister Harsh Vardhan had last week said that a vaccine may be ready by the first quarter of the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-registers-record-high-daily-covid-19-recoveries-recovery-rate-at-78-53/story-ihqY190Ds3C66TCNYbbhIN.html

The commission’s chairman MA Sayeed was quoted as saying by news agency ANI that it had looked into the matter based on media reports. MSHRC had sent a show-cause notice to the Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital and the Mumbai police on August 25 for allowing Chakraborty and her family members to enter the mortuary when Rajput’s post-mortem was being conducted.Panel’s chief MA Sayeed had told a daily that he had asked the legal wing to look into the matter after he saw videos of Chakraborty visiting the mortuary. “We don’t know how and under what circumstances the permission to visit the mortuary was given. It should not have been so,” he was quoted as saying.Amid uproar on why Chakraborty was allowed access to the morgue, the 28-year-old actor had earlier told the media that she saw Rajput’s body for a few seconds as it was being transferred to the van from the mortuary for his funeral and touched his feet and apologised. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is currently probing Rajput’s death on June 14, while the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are investigating the money laundering and drug-related angle in the case. Rajout’s father KK Singh has filed an FIR against Chakraborty for driving his son to suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-breach-on-hospital-cops-end-mshrc-on-rhea-chakraborty-s-visit-to-morgue-to-see-sushant-singh-rajput/story-YyPFr8VBxN75STfvlQMYYP.html
16-09-2020||India||‘Does not forget Muharram’: BJP leader taunts Bengal CM over no to ritual||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is running a “tees per cent logon ki sarkar (a government that serves only 30 per cent of the state’s population)”, alleged Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday, after the Kolkata Police stopped a religious programme of his party. The BJP leader added that the CM “does not forget Friday rituals and Muharram”.VIjaywargiya did not specify as to which section he was referring to as 30 per cent. “The rights of 70 per cent of the population have been taken away. Yeh tees per cent logon ki sarkar hai (this is a government of 30 per cent people). Can’t we even hold tarpan (a Hindu ritual) in Bengal during Mamata Banerjee’s rule?” said the BJP leader this afternoon after the Kolkata police stopped a religious programme of his party. “Mamata Ji does not forget Friday rituals and Muharram. But she is always against the Hindus. Is it a crime to observe Hindu rituals in West Bengal?” added Vijayvargiya.The BJP state unit had organised traditional Hindu rituals on the banks of the Hooghly river to pay homage to the souls of 32 party workers who the leadership said had died in political clashes in the last 12 months. A pandal was set up on the banks of the river at Baghbazar. BJP president JP Nadda was supposed to attend it virtually from Delhi. Children and widows of the dead BJP workers were brought to the city for the Vedic ritual called tarpan. Earlier in the day, the Kolkata police removed the pandal, saying social distancing norms were being violated and the programme could not be allowed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. This led to chaos. Vijayvargiya and other senior leaders had an argument with the police and left the spot. Around noon, BJP workers held the rituals at another part of the river bank but the leadership stayed away. “The police used the pandemic as an excuse to stop us. This is the first time we are seeing that people need permission from the police to hold tarpan. This government will surely be overthrown in the 2021 elections,” said BJP national executive member Mukul Roy, who was present at the spot. “Our movement will not stop till this government is immersed in the river,” added BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) defended the police action.“A religious programme was being politically used by the BJP. I was told the police did not allow it because social distancing norms were violated. This could not be allowed,” said Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and spokesperson.On Monday, the chief minister’s decision to give monthly stipend and houses to Brahmin priests triggered a debate, with the Congress, Left and BJP calling it a desperate move to secure Hindu votes before the crucial assembly polls next year.Banerjee announced that her government will give a monthly stipend of Rs 1,000 to some 8000 Brahmin priests facing financial crisis and also provide houses to those who need one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-not-forget-muharram-bjp-leader-taunts-bengal-cm-over-no-to-ritual/story-U8ZVyUeZVYQf2bmwRDNwkL.html

Deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020 subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India,” the statement added.Russia’s envoy to India, Nikolay Kudashev, has held discussions with Indian officials in recent weeks on cooperation in the development of a vaccine, including joint development and production of Sputnik V.The Russian side also formally shared modalities for cooperation on the vaccine with Indian authorities which are yet to take a call on the matter, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The vaccine is also believed to have figured in discussions held during external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s visit to Moscow last week for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) states.

Dr Reddy’s has had a very well-established and respected presence in Russia for over 25 years and is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in India”. “India is amongst [the] most severely impacted countries from Covid-19 and we believe our human adenovirus dual vector platform will provide a safe and scientifically validated option to India in the battle against Covid-19,” he added.Dmitriev said the RDIF’s partners will receive an “effective and safe drug” and the platform of human adenoviral vectors, which forms the core of the Russian vaccine, has been “tested in more than 250 clinical studies over decades, and it has been found safe with no potential negative long-term consequences”.GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director of Dr Reddy’s, said the phase I and phase II results “have shown promise, and we will be conducting phase III trials in India to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators”. Russia’s health ministry registered the Sputnik V vaccine developed by Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology on August 11.

The meeting is scheduled to take place at 5 pm.Defence minister Rajnath Singh and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi will represent the government. The Opposition parties have deputed their floor leaders for the meeting.The issues to be taken up during the meeting are yet to be decided, according to people aware of the developments.The government is expected to seek the Opposition’s help for speedy passage of key bills, but the other side is keen on holding debates on the India-China border situation and the state of the economy.On Wednesday, the third day of the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma gave a short duration discussion notice in Rajya Sabha over ‘the incursion of the Chinese army across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and military standoff between the armies of the two countries on the LAC’.The defence minister had given a statement in Lok Sabha over the issue.In his statement, Rajnath Singh said that India has conveyed to China that its attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was unacceptable and noted that the Chinese actions reflect a “disregard” of various bilateral agreements between the two countries. The two countries have been engaged in a standoff since April-May and China has refused to vacate locations in the Finger area and other friction points in the Eastern Ladakh area.Multiple rounds of talks have also failed to yield any significant result in defusing the tensions and now the Indian side has prepared itself for long-term deployment in the high mountainous region.The monsoon session of Parliament began on September 14 amidst Covid-19 pandemic and will continue till October 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-hold-crucial-meet-with-opposition-parties-today-passage-of-key-bills-to-be-discussed/story-Egvf9R1X2Ly2VUoNf7E3yL.html

16-09-2020||India||Congress says PM lied about Chinese transgressions in Ladakh, June 19 ‘black day’ in history||The Congress on Wednesday called June 19 a “black day” in India’s history, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “lied” to the nation about the Chinese transgressions in Ladakh that day. The party also attacked the Modi government for taking loans to the tune of $750 million (Rs 5,521 crore) from the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to provide financial support the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), a scheme launched to help the poor hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, at a time when the armed forces were fighting China’s People’s Liberation Army in eastern Ladakh. Addressing reporters outside the Parliament House complex, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera claimed that the Union ministers are speaking in different languages on the India-China border standoff. Also Read: J-K, Ladakh fully integrated into mainstream India, says Centre“June 19 is a black day in the history of India because that was the first time that any Prime Minister lied to the nation. Not only did he give a clean chit to China that day, but also signed a loan agreement with the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to the tune of $750 million (Rs 5,521 crore),” he said. “By then, 20 of our brave soldiers had sacrificed their lives while protecting our sovereignty in violent clashes with Chinese troops,” added Khera. China is the largest shareholder in AIIB. Earlier, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi too attacked the government on the issue. “Understand the chronology: PM said no one has entered Indian territory, then took loans from China-based bank, then defence minister said China has intruded into our territory and now home minister says no infiltration along India-China border. Is the Modi government with Indian armed forces or with China? Why is there so much of fear?” he tweeted. आप chronology समझिए:🔹PM बोले कि कोई सीमा में नहीं घुसा🔹फिर चीन-स्थित बैंक से भारी क़र्ज़ा लिया🔹फिर रक्षामंत्री ने कहा चीन ने देश में अतिक्रमण किया🔹अब गृह राज्य मंत्री ने कहा अतिक्रमण नहीं हुआमोदी सरकार भारतीय सेना के साथ है या चीन के साथ?इतना डर किस बात का?Khera told reporters that two “shocking revelations expose the lies, double speak, hoodwinking and hypocrisy” of the Modi government on the issue of ongoing border tensions with China on the eastern border in areas such as South Pangong, Razun La and the finger area. He said the government accepted in the House on Tuesday that India took two loans amounting to Rs 9,202 crore from the Beijing-based multilateral development bank. “The bank was formed in 2016 and is headquartered in Beijing. With 26.6% voting share, China is the largest shareholder of the bank. The first loan of $500 million was taken on May 8 amid reports of Chinese incursions at multiple points in eastern Ladakh, including the Pangong lake,” Khera claimed. Also Read: China actions sparked LAC standoff; India ready: Govt“The second loan of $750 million was taken on June 19; four days after the Galwan massacre where we lost 20 of our bravehearts. Incidentally, it was also the same day when Prime Minister Modi lied to the country by saying that no one had entered our territory,” he added. The Congress leader said the stated and much-touted policy of the Modi government of cracking down on Chinese business relationships with India stands exposed. “We would like to ask Mr S Jaishankar (foreign minister) whether he still stands by his statement ‘there cannot be business as usual in the face of Chinese attempts to unilaterally changing the facts on the ground along the border’”. Khera said the nation is “shocked at such brazen duplicity” of the Modi government in handling China’s territorial aggression. He said the “second shocker” came in the form of an answer by the Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai to an unstarred question, in which the minister categorically denied any infiltration by China during the past six months. “This is a shameless insult to the martyrdom of our brave soldiers on the night of June 15 in the Galwan valley. Is the government trying to say that the Galwan clash happened in Chinese territory? By saying so, is the government blaming the Indian army of trespassing into enemy territory?” asked Khera. “Isn’t this just another clean chit to China but also a handle given to China by our government whereby China can now... tell the world that we are not the aggressor but India is? The response of the government dilutes the resolve of India and its mighty army to protect every inch of our valuable territory,” he said. “The defence minister Rajnath Singh talks about differing perceptions of the line of actual control (LAC) and now the MoS Home categorically gives a clean chit to China by saying that no incursions have taken place,” he said. “Is this a public handover of Indian territory to China by the government of the day? The defence minister and the entire government need to give a clear answer to four of our questions.” Khera said. “Are we able to patrol the same areas we were able to before April 2020? What is the pressure under which the Prime Minister gave a clean chit to china? The Ministry of Defence removed the document that acknowledged the Chinese transgression in eastern Ladakh on August 7 under what pressure? Is the entire government now trying to justify that one big lie of the Prime Minister of June 19? What did the defence minister mean when he said that the talks with China might not be fruitful?” asked the Congress. “A clear message should go across the world that India and its government stand with the Indian army and will not legitimise China’s claims over our territory. The LAC is clearly marked in our military maps. There is no differing perception of LAC as far as we are concerned. Every single Indian seeks answers from the government and wants to see the restoration of status quo ante,” Khera added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/june-19-black-day-in-indian-history-congress/story-2hb5eSHCCvBn1CTIJ2KCZM.html

16-09-2020||India||Babri Masjid demolition case verdict on Advani, Joshi, Bharti on September 30||A special CBI court has fixed September 30 for judgment in the decades-old Babri Masjid demolition case, in which former deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, BJP stalwarts Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti are among the 32 accused. The date for judgment in the Ayodhya criminal conspiracy case was set on Wednesday by Surendra Kumar Yadav, judge, special CBI court, Lucknow. Earlier this month, the court completed all proceedings in the case by recording statements of all 32 accused. Lawyer KK Mishra, who is representing 25 out of the 32 accused in the case, including senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, Uma Bharti, confirmed the date set by the court for delivering the verdict. The expected date of judgment is also in line with the one month extension granted by the Supreme Court, instructing the special CBI court to wind up the case by September 30. The earlier deadline for judgment had expired on August 31. The sensitive case involving senior politicians of the BJP has dragged on for a long time despite several deadlines for its completion set by the Supreme Court.Last year in July, the SC had extended the deadline for completion of criminal trial in Ayodhya case by six months and given a total of nine months for delivering the final order. The deadline expired on April 19 this year and another extension till August 31 was granted by the apex court.On April 19, 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered the special judge to conduct a day-to-day trial, concluding it in two years. It also called the demolition of the disputed structure a crime, which shook the “secular fabric of the Constitution”, and allowed the CBI plea for restoration of criminal conspiracy charge against the VIP accused. Also Read: Ayodhya readies for grand Ramleela over 9 days, Bollywood stars to performThe SC had termed the Allahabad high court’s February 12, 2001 verdict dropping conspiracy charge against Advani and others as “erroneous”. Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, there were two sets of cases relating to the demolition, going on in Lucknow and Rae Bareli. The first case allegedly involving unnamed “kar sevaks” proceeded in a Lucknow court and the second set of cases relating to eight VIPs was being heard in a Rae Bareli court. In April 2017, the Supreme Court transferred the Rae Bareli case to the Special CBI court in Lucknow.

16-09-2020||India||Bills for farmers’ benefit but Cong creating hurdles, says Nadda||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday said the three bills --- The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020; The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 --- have been introduced in Parliament with the intent to benefit farmers, but the Congress is creating hurdles in their all-round development by opposing them. BJP president JP Nadda addressed media persons on the three key bills that are to be passed by Parliament during the 18-day uninterrupted monsoon session, which started on Monday, amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic across the country. “These bills are far sighted. They are related to the empowerment of the farmers and are truly revolutionary. Farmers will be free to sell their produce in a competitive market of their choice. But the Congress is opposing them. The party is hampering the farmers’ all-round economic growth and development,” Nadda said.On Tuesday, the Lok Sabha (LS) passed Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020; and it will now be taken up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha (RS). The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; are listed for discussion in the LS on Wednesday.The Congress has opposed the ordinances related to the agri-marketing practices that seek to create new structures on the grounds that it would undermine the existing food security net. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had said last week that revenues of agri-dominant states would be negatively affected by these three ordinances and private companies would benefit because of their corporate farming initiatives.Nadda lashed out at the Congress for what he alleged was the rival party’s doublespeak. He said the bills would ensure that farmers get good prices for their produce and investments in the agriculture sector would also be encouraged.“These are very beneficial from the point of view of agriculture. The Essential Commodities Act has been in force since 1955 when we used to face an acute shortage of food grains. About 10 million tonnes (MT) of wheat was produced in 1955, which has since gone up by 10 times. In 1955, rice production was 25 MT, which now stands at 110 MT. This bill was introduced when there was food grain shortage and there was a need to regulate things to ensure there is no hoarding and commodities can be sold at the right price,” he said.The BJP president, who is also a member of the RS, said that the government is making an attempt to benefit farmers by ensuring they can sell the produce with ease.“At present, farm produce can be sold only through mandis. These bills allow them to sell the produce outside of mandis as well and also determine their own price,” he said referring to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, which seeks to allow intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce beyond the physical premises of agricultural produce market committees (APMCs). State governments are prohibited from levying any market fee, cess or levy outside APMCs.The BJP president said a transparent process, where farmers could take a call on where they would get the best price for their produce would be in place after the bill is passed.“This bill also has the provision of giving information on prices. Farmers can be told which places are offering a fair price,” he said. He also cited The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill. 2020; that seeks to develop a framework for contract farming and trade agreements for the sale and purchase of farm produce.Nadda said it would offer protection to farmers who would understand the details of agreements that would be drawn up in regional languages.“All these three bills are in the favour of the farmers. All the bottlenecks have been removed between a farmer and market. The Congress is opposing these bills because it has a double face. The party always plays politics. In 2013-14, the Congress had told its own state governments to denotify fruits and vegetables from APMC. The Congress in its 2019 parliamentary election manifesto had also promised that it would repeal the APMC Act, 2003,” Nadda alleged.The BJP’s ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), had opposed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the LS. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal described the bill as anti-farmer and said his party was not consulted when the ordinances were framed. The party has also said it would oppose the other two bills as well. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-bills-for-farmers-benefit-but-cong-creating-hurdles-says-nadda/story-mR10SZTUI2vuWvl2fNXkIO.html

Rai said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a high-level Group of Ministers (GoM), the Cabinet Secretary, a Committee of Secretaries and senior officers in the Union Health Ministry continue to monitor public health response to Covid-19 in the country.Public health actions were taken in a preemptive, proactive and graded manner based on the evolving scenario, he said.The minister said a number of travel advisories were issued restricting the inflow of international travelers, and commercial flights were suspended on March 23.

The loans were provided under three classifications – health, social protection and economic stimulus, union minister Anurag Thakur told the Rajya Sabha. Stating that all Indian states and union territories have benefitted from the loan, Thakur told the Rajya Sabha that the first loan was signed on April 3, shortly after India announced a nationwide lockdown to aid the virus related health measures. The first loan was extended by the World Bank to partly finance India’s measures to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by the disease outbreak, in addition to strengthening national machinery for public health preparedness. Out of the total $1 billion, 502.5 million stands disbursed, Thakur’s reply to Rajya Sabha stated.

16-09-2020||India||Covid treatment rates set by Goa govt for private hospitals brews anger||The rates set by Goa government for treatment of Covid-19 infected patients in state’s private hospitals have invited sharp criticism from Opposition parties who have accused the ruling party of profiteering in the times of the pandemic. The chief minister has however, defended the rates, claiming it needed to be sustainable for the private sector. The Goa government recently capped the rent for a bed in a general ward of a private hospital at Rs 12,000 per day for Covid patients. The rates for rooms-- on a twin sharing basis-- was capped at Rs 15,000 per day and Rs 18,000 per day was the upper limit set for a single private room, while Rs 25,000 per day was set for a bed in an ICU with a ventilator.The charges include all regular expenses including bed charges, nursing services, resident doctor fee, nutritional diet, PPE kits for the staff and routinely prescribed medicines, but is exclusive of charges incurred for consulting a specialist, an intensivist, a diagnostic intensivist, or the cost of special drugs or equipment or any other procedures or surgeries carried out during the treatment. “This is loot. The Goa BJP Government is looting the people in the name of Covid. At these rates, people will prefer to die at home than be treated in hospitals,” Congress spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar said. “If affordability is the concern, then the government should take control of all private hospitals as needed under the National Emergency and Epidemic Act... The interest of the citizens is sacrosanct,” Aashish Kamat an activist said. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant however claimed that the rates were decided in consultation with medical professionals while keeping the expenses private hospitals need to bear for caring for their patients. “We have decided these rates in consultation with the medical professionals and with the private hospitals themselves. We have to take them into confidence, too, and keep in mind that it is affordable for them. They have also said that they need to be able to manage the facilities with dedicated staff who end up getting infected and who then need to be rotated with fresh staff,” Sawant said. “Besides, they also ensure that a resident doctor is there to attend to the patient besides nurses,” he added. The Goa government’s decision to cap the rates comes after several weeks of reluctance to do so. Earlier health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that those getting admitted to private hospitals were doing so out of their personal choice since similar treatment was available at government run facilities for free. Since then, however, a bed shortage has begun to choke the government-run facilities and a bed at a private facility is proving to be prohibitive cost-wise. Those treated at private facilities include Union minister Shripad Naik, Goa’s director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa and several MLAs who were infected with severe symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-treatment-rates-set-by-goa-govt-for-private-hospitals-brews-anger/story-tZMTuHeAncewUkzvEAyLQJ.html

16-09-2020||India||UP hospital put Covid patient without diabetes on Insulin for 10 days||Anil Kumar Gupta, 59, a resident of Dharamshala Bazar in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur is not able to forget the nightmare he went through while under treatment at the Covid ward of BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur for 19 days and wants to write to chief minister Yogi Adityanath to draw his attention to the state of affairs at the above mentioned hospital, said Gupta. “For 19 days, it seemed, I was not in a hospital, but in a virtual hell where patients are tormented. But with God’s blessings and my inner strength, I fought the infection to return home,” said Gupta, who is the president of India-Nepal Friendship Association. Recounting his days in the ward, he said: “On August 18, I had symptoms of Covid infection - high fever, dry cough and breathlessness. Family members took me to the medical college. After a sample test, staff told me that I have tested positive for SARS- CoV-2. As I was facing problems in breathing, instead of home isolation, I preferred admission to a designated Covid facility.” “The doctors put me on ventilator support in the ICU, later I was put on an oxygen support system. A nurse came to collect my blood sample. After pricking my finger, she did not even press it with cotton or apply antiseptic lotion and the blood continued to flow on the bed sheet,” he recalled. “After three days, a doctor told me to get an injection from the open market as it was not available in the hospital. The price of the injection was Rs 41,000. The doctor told me that my health condition was not good and I should take assistance from the ward staff to go to the toilet but when I called for assistance in the night, the doctor on duty started shouting at me,” said Gupta. Gupta said there was a complete lack of hygiene at the hospital. He recalled that he was forced to use an extremely dirty and unhygienic toilet since there were only 4 portable urine containers to be used among 40 patients. He added that the bed sheet was not changed for a week despite requests and the quality of food served to patients was substandard at best. Recounting perhaps the most dangerous of the callous act by the medical staff, Gupta said: “The nurse told me that the doctor has prescribed me insulin injections to control diabetes. I told her that I have no history of diabetes and the sugar test was also normal, yet she gave me an insulin injection. For 10 days, I was put on insulin,” added Gupta. Also Read: $1 trillion economy, herculean task’: UP govt tells to-be-consultant in revised RFP On September 4, the medical staff shifted Gupta to another ward, where the medical officer in-charge asked the nurse why Gupta was given insulin injections and pulled up the staff. “I started praying for my well-being,” said Gupta recalling the traumatic experience. Gupta said his family finally managed to get him discharged from the hospital after he tested negative for the disease and didn’t let his stay get extended as was being advised by the hospital.“I wish to write a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, drawing his attention towards the mismanagement in the BRD Medical College,” Gupta said.Also Read: Possibility of partial reopening of schools in UP looks bleak: Deputy CM Dinesh SharmaDuring his visit to Gorakhpur in August and September, the chief minister had directed the medical college and district administration officers to provide quality health services to patients admitted to Covid facilities.

HT tried to contact officers of the BRD Medical College for their version, but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-hospital-put-covid-patient-without-diabetes-on-insulin-for-10-days/story-RLcNjzTkxJM2FvWMkn3FbP.html
16-09-2020||India||Indian, Chinese soldiers fired burst of bullets in air near Finger 4 before Moscow talks||In a major escalation of tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), Indian and Chinese soldiers fired bursts of bullets into the air last week on the northern bank of Pangong Tso when the Indian Army took control of key heights overlooking the People’s Liberation Army’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline, officials familiar with the developments said on Wednesday.This was the third incident of bullets being fired at the LAC since August 29-30 - the current border confrontation with China has seen bullets flying at the LAC for the first time in 45 years.The firing incident took place at heights where Fingers 3 and 4 merge into the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh, the officials said requesting anonymity. The lake’s northern and southern banks are at the heart of the current border standoff between India and China, and among the four friction areas where both armies are holding forward positions. Indian and Chinese soldiers are barely a few hundred metres at friction points on both sides of the lake.Shots were fired on the lake’s southern bank too - the Indian Army last week said that Chinese troops fired their weapons into the air on September 7 to intimidate its soldiers holding dominating heights at Mukhpari peak near Rezang La on the southern bank during a failed attempt to close in on a forward position controlled by India.Defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Tuesday that China has engaged in massive mobilisation of troops at the LAC, aggressive behaviour, and sought to unilaterally change the status quo — all in contravention of existing border agreements and pacts between the two countries. Also Read: Indian Army changes posture at LAC after China’s failed midnight attemptIn the face of this, he said, India’s armed forces have shown both restraint when needed and courage when required, and will defend Indian sovereignty and territorial integrity in any situation. There was no mention of the firing incidents in the minister’s statement. He said the current friction areas in eastern Ladakh included Gogra, Kongka La and the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are eight km apart. The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4. Also Read: India, China reach 5-point consensus on easing border tensions at Jaishankar-Wang meetIndia is making vigorous attempts to provide logistics support to its soldiers deployed in the eastern Ladakh theatre where more than 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed through the winter months to deal any provocation by the Chinese forces, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday. China has deployed sizable military assets in the eastern Ladakh theatre including 50,000 troops, 150 aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems, with India matching every military move made by the neighbour. The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the most significant heights being held by India on Rezang La and Reqin pass where the PLA is making desperate attempts to regain lost ground.In Lok Sabha, Singh suggested on Tuesday that in the past too, there have been long standoffs which were peacefully resolved, but acknowledged that the scale of troop mobilisation and number of friction points made the current situation different. “We are ready to face any situation,” he said.Singh said that India, in its communication with China, had clearly laid out three principles — the need to respect the LAC and adhere to it strictly; the need to not change the status quo; and the need to respect all pacts and agreements. But on August 29 and 30, even as discussions were underway, Singh said that the PLA tried to unilaterally change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, but “timely action” by Indian armed forces repelled the design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-soldiers-fired-burst-of-bullets-in-air-near-finger-4-before-moscow-talks/story-ISRSmKSVpfI7QdDUlE3JhO.html

The Modi government is now considering to prepare for the shortest tunnel at Shinku La on Darcha-Padam axis so that this road this snow free throughout the year.Given that the PLA is showing no signs of abiding with the agreements between the Special Representatives on Boundary Talks (July 5, 2020) and between foreign ministers (September 10, 2020) on total disengagement to restore status quo ante on LAC, the Indian Army is rushing in supplies with the BRO ensuring that 17,580 feet high Chang La pass and 17,582 feet Khardung La on route to contested Pangong Tso is kept snow free throughout the year.With an aim to keep weapon deployment in East Ladakh to match the PLA build-up in occupied Aksai Chin, the BRO is expected to strengthen all bridges and culverts to Class 70 on the DSDBO road by October 15. Class 70 bridge means that it can bear a load of 70 tons, which is more than the weight of a fully loaded tank trailer. In strategic terms this means that in case of worst case scenario, the DSDBO road can be used to deploy T -90 tanks, infantry combat vehicle and surface to air missiles all along the eastern Ladakh Line of Actual Control with Tibet.While the BRO is expected to validate the Darcha-Padam-Nimu-Leh axis for heavy vehicle traffic this month, there is intense discussion within the Ministry of Defence on the length and alignment of the tunnel under 16000 feet Shinku La. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) has been tasked to study the shortest possible alignment for the tunnel so that it can be readied in next four years.Majority of the stake-holders, including ministry of surface transport, are in favour of a shorter 4.5-km tunnel alignment on the current axis rather than a 13-km alignment suggested by Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the Defence Ministry. The longer alignment will not only delay the project with a host of studies and detailed project report to be completed. It has now been left to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to take a final call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-to-daulet-beg-oldi-will-allow-tank-movement-by-oct-15-as-army-prepares-for-ladakh-winter/story-2DMzLy5y1rZCyWvLWAd6tO.html

These trains run by the north eastern railways during the pandemic are being called the Crack trains.These freight trains operate nonstop between the originating point and the destination, resulting in prioritized and swift transportation of goods. In the last three months alone, NER has operated around 1,590 Crack trains transporting grains, sugar, salt and petroleum products to different parts of the country. “Though the concept is not new but yes we are executing it thoroughly and this has made a big difference. In July and August, our division ferried more than 1000 Crack trains. Among these, the longest one was from Chhapra to Roza, covering the distance of 572 km within 10 hours. The entire train was managed by a single crew. Crack trains have not only increased the efficiency or railways but is also the time-effective way of transporting goods,” said Monica Agnihotri, divisional railway manager (DRM), Lucknow Division, NER, who spearheaded mission ‘raftar’ at NER. Also Read: In a first, railways announces 40 ‘clone trains’; will begin service from Sep 21Ensuring non stop movement of freight traffic isn’t as easy as it sounds. “It requires a whole team of officials, who need to keep a continuous track on the train movement and to provide a kind of ‘green corridor’ to the train to ensure non-stop movement,” Agnihotri said, adding several changes had been introduced to make the movement of these crack trains more efficient.“Changing of crew used to take 15 minutes or almost an hour and so it was decided to run the trains with the same crew. To encourage loco pilots and board controllers to increase the average speed of the train, a point based incentive system was introduced. The top performers, who scored maximum points, get ranked and awarded. We have introduced different categories including platinum, gold, silver and bronze categories,” she said.

These officers keep all, from controllers to station masters, informed about the train movement,” she said. NER division, considered a crucial link between agricultural and industrial hubs, now plans to increase the speed of these trains further. “We intend to run goods trains at par with the express trains in order to further expedite the entire goods transportation process,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crack-trains-how-railways-put-goods-movement-on-fast-track-during-covid-19/story-RFjQQ6np6gwoBlIdwpZf0J.html

The results of the sero survey would be made public by the end of September, said Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMR . “The second national sero survey is almost done. We have completed the exercise in 68 out of 70 districts, and the analysis is in progress. We should have the results by the end of September,” said Dr Bhargava. “Sero survey tells us about the prevalence or trend of the Covid-19 pandemic in a particular area. One sero- survey alone will not be enough. If you will look at the Geneva sero survey, they did it for five weeks. The findings were published in Lancet, but they did not show many changes. The National sero survey, which was conducted in April and May, is being repeated after three months,” he added. Also Read: Over 90,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 in last 24 hours, 1,290 deaths in India; active cases near million markThe sero survey also seeks to determine the infection fatality rate (IFR), a key component of the exercise, said Dr Bhargava. “If you look at the results of the National sero survey, which was conducted in April and May, the IFR was between 0.5% and 0.6%. The IFR was much lower than Europe and the United States of America (ISA) that have an IFR ranging between 1.2% and 1.8%,” he said. The findings of the first national population-based sero survey indicated that 0.73% of adults in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. The blood sample is tested to check for the presence of antibodies against the virus.Also Read: Covid-19 led to global disruptions in TB testing, careThe data published on the first sero survey in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) showed that an estimated 6.4 million people had contracted the infection around early May when swab samples were collected for analysis. Based on the overall adjusted sero-prevalence of 0.73% and reported Covid-19 cases, it was estimated that for every Covid-19 case --- determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test -- there were between 82 and 130 cases of contagion in the country. The sero-prevalence ranged between 0.62 and 1.03% across the four strata of districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/results-of-2nd-national-sero-survey-to-be-out-by-september-end-icmr/story-Cvf7VHTStdWruigMJ1YpcO.html

16-09-2020||India||Covid-19 led to global disruptions in TB testing, care||People suffering from tuberculosis (TB) faced significant challenges in getting tested for TB and coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and accessing treatment and care due to disruption of health services because of the pandemic, according to a new report released on Tuesday. The report is called “The impact of Covid-19 on the TB epidemic: A community perspective”.It has warned that the world may not achieve the sustainable development goal (SDG) of ending TB by 2030, if services and TB care remain disrupted due to Covid-19.Over 70% of healthcare workers from various parts of the world reported that there was a decrease in the number of patients, who visited healthcare facilities to get tested for TB. While 36% of TB patients, who participated in the survey, said the health facilities they visited for TB care were closed during the Covid-19-induiced lockdown period. TBAnd, 70% of officers from Global Fund-implementing countries reported a decrease in the number of people with TB receiving treatment. Globally, 50% of workers reported the healthcare facility they worked for have reduced TB care services. But 50% of TB patients surveyed in Kenya and India said they had received additional medicines to continue their treatment at home amid the viral outbreak.There is an urgent need for a recovery plan to get TB responses back on track to achieve SDG commitments to end TB by 2030. “Covid-19 has demonstrated the important role that affected communities play in responding to health crises, reporting barriers to access, supporting peers and filling gaps in services. The pandemic is an opportunity for national TB responses to become more people-centred and to involve communities,” the report said.A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), TB and Covid-19 survivor from India shared his experience of delayed diagnosis during a webinar by TB advocacy and research organisations to launch the report on Tuesday. “I faced a lot of stigma and challenges during the diagnosis of Covid-19. Just before that I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. I have been on antiretroviral therapy. It was a very scary situation. Then, I was put on various steroids for Covid-19 with no idea of what was the right treatment for me, I felt very scared,” said the patient.“After my Covid-19 experience which I had contracted in February, I realised how we need patient- centric care in the US. Because of lack of patient-centric care, TB patients often don’t complete TB treatment. The impact of Covid-19 and TB are compounded due to stigma and delayed diagnosis,” said US-based Aakriti Pandita, a TB and Covid-19 survivor, who is also an expert in infectious diseases (IDs).“This report shows that the Covid-19 pandemic is absolutely devastating for our quest to end TB. If we were climbing a mountain before Covid-19, that mountain has now become Mount Everest. We need to work extra hard to mitigate the damage and stay focused on TB for the long haul. Collaboration and solidarity within the TB community are critical if we are to have any hope of getting back on track to reach the SDG goals,” said Madhukar Pai, an epidemiologist and the director of The McGill International TB Centre in Canada, in the report.TB is the world’s leading ID, killing around 1.5 million people annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-led-to-global-disruptions-intb-testing-care/story-YCZmPE0auyBcQXxNoe1LZJ.html

It was not immediately clear how much time would be allotted for the discussion. The government is expected to defend its handling of the situation and highlight its successes in keeping the Covid-19 death rate lowest among major nations. The Congress has objected to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu’s move to club clarifications on health minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement on the pandemic with a debate on Covid-19.Also Read: J-K, Ladakh fully integrated into mainstream India, says CentreIndia’s Covid-19 tally crossed the five million mark as 91,136 new cases were reported on Tuesday when the toll from the pandemic mounted to 82,091. The cases have continued to rise at an alarming rate.India’s tally is behind only the US, which is the worst-hit country with 6.76 million confirmed infections. India accounts for nearly one-sixth of all Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide since the outbreak originated in China nine months ago. The country also has the worst-ever daily infection rate recorded anywhere in the world. The Congress has demanded a separate, full-fledged discussion on the loss of livelihoods of millions because of the pandemic and Indian economy’s contraction by 23.9% in the June quarter, the steepest in four decades.“If we cannot have a full-fledged discussion on the Covid-19 situation without being circumscribed by the minister’s statement what is the point of having this session of Rajya Sabha in the first place?” Congress chief whip, Jairam Ramesh, said in a letter to Naidu on Tuesday.He said the decision to combine the debate with clarifications on the statement “runs contrary to what V Muraleedharan [junior minister for parliamentary affairs] had assured me this morning that the two will be taken up separately”.Ramesh sought a minimum four-hour debate on Covid-19. “In the BAC [Business Advisory Committee meeting] held on September 13, you yourself had said that it is very important to have a discussion on the prevailing public health situation. Today’s decision of yours goes against the spirit of your own statement.”Also Read: China actions sparked LAC standoff; India ready: GovtThe Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda Bill and the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill have separately been listed for passage in the Upper House on Wednesday.In the Lok Sabha, fireworks are expected as the government has listed three contentious bills for passage: The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.The Congress and other opposition parties have opposed the bills to replace related ordinances even as many experts have hailed them as reformist legislation to unshackle Indian farmers.Congress leaders have maintained the move will only help corporate buyers of crops and weaken the Minimum Support Price, which protects farmers from any fall in prices.Congress government in Punjab and its Haryana state unit have also objected to the legislation amid farmer protests against the proposed new laws.Left parties have staged protests both inside and outside the Parliament and they too would oppose the bills.The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill is another flashpoint. The Congress has raised five major objections related to it. It has said cooperative banks are part of the structure of cooperatives and ought to be regulated by the state governments and not by the Centre. “If the ordinance becomes law, all key financial intermediaries will come under the control of the Central Government, there will be more centralisation.

16-09-2020||India||Pakistan extends Kulbhushan Jadhav’s appeal time||Pakistan’s Parliament has extended by four months an ordinance issued earlier this year to allow death row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal against his conviction and sentencing in court, in line with a ruling from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance was promulgated in May and was set to expire on September 17. The National Assembly or lower house of Parliament extended it through a voice vote on Monday. Earlier, the Pakistan government had approached the Islamabad high court to appoint a defence lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing the appeal. The court heard the case for the second time on September 3 and directed the federal government to give India another opportunity to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The case will now be taken up on October 3. The Pakistan government has said only a lawyer allowed to practice in the country can be appointed as Jadhav’s counsel, but India has been insisting that it should be allowed to select a lawyer of its choice. It has also sought legal documents related to Jadhav’s case that it says Pakistan has so far failed to provide. The Islamabad high court’s direction came after attorney general Khalid Javed Khan informed a larger bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzaib that the federal government hadn’t received a reply from the Indian government on the issue. Khan said Jadhav has maintained he doesn’t want to benefit from the ordinance for a review of his case, and that he had requested his mercy plea, already pending with the Pakistan Army chief, should be considered instead. On August 6, the Islamabad high court had formed a three-judge larger bench at the government’s request to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav so that an appeal could be filed against the death sentence given to him by a military court. At that time, the high court had also directed the Pakistan government to make another offer to India and Jadhav, through the Foreign Office, to hire a lawyer. The court also said it was refraining from appointing a lawyer for Jadhav, who should be informed by the Pakistan government about his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected these allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-extends-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-appeal-time/story-GDeEwHcaskVSjtfhsoKuPP.html

Speaking during a debate at the 45th Session of the Human Rights Council, India’s permanent representative Indra Mani Pandey also expressed regret over the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet ’s reference to the region.  Pandey said that India remains committed to upholding all human rights. He said the human rights agenda and discourse must be pursued in a transparent and impartial manner with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs of States.Referring to the abrogation of the Article 370 in 2019 that revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Pandey said that since the changes, people in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have been enjoying the same fundamental rights as people in other parts of India.  “We have been able to revive grass root democracy and provide a new momentum to social and economic development, despite the challenge posed by Covid-19 pandemic and persistent attempts by one country to infiltrate terrorists to derail this process by all possible means,” he said, in a veiled reference to Pakistan.“Over the past one year, the Government’s efforts aimed at socio-economic development and ensuring better governance have yielded unprecedented results. By extending coverage of positive and affirmative federal legislations and repealing discriminatory or outdated local laws, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering socio-economic justice to disadvantaged people in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, including women, children, minorities and refugees,” he said.“We regret that the High Commissioner in her oral update made a reference to the situation in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” he added.He noted that as the largest and most vibrant democracy, India has been, since independence, an ardent supporter of human rights.“We have encouraged OHCHR to continue engaging States in a constructive manner, while emphasising the need to specifically avoid politicisation of the discourse on human rights, which is not conducive to achieving our collective goal of promoting and protecting human rights,” he said.“We urge the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to recognise the enormity of challenges that we face due to our large and very diverse population of 1.3 billion and act as our partner in a cooperative and constructive spirit in our endeavour to secure for our people all their basic human rights,” he said. He added that India will continue its constructive engagement with the Council and OHCHR for the promotion and protection of human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revived-grass-root-democracy-in-j-k-despite-attempts-by-a-country-to-derail-the-process-india/story-X6K1v0LFnp3NIpHinowzKP.html

16-09-2020||India||Supreme Court halts broadcast of ‘insidious’ show||A television programme relating to the civil services exams gives an impression that it is being aired with the objective of vilifying the Muslim community and bringing it into disrepute, the Supreme Court observed on Tuesday, issuing an injunction barring the channel Sudarshan News from televising the programme for the time being.A three-judge bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud took strong exception to the contents of the show, Bindas Bol, which spoke of “UPSC jihad”, observing that the claims made by the channel appeared to be “insidious” and also cast aspersions on the credibility of the Union Public Service Commission exams.“Prima facie (at first sight), it does appear to the Court that the intent, object and purpose of the episodes which have been telecast is to vilify the Muslim community. An insidious attempt has been made to insinuate that the community is involved in a conspiracy to infiltrate the civil services. The drift, tenor and content of the episodes is to bring the community into public hatred and disrepute…Any attempt to vilify a community must be viewed with disfavour by this court as a custodian of Constitutional values,” said the bench, which also comprised justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph.The court reconsidered its stance of August 28 when it had declined to impose a pre-broadcast ban on the controversial programme, citing freedom of speech and expression. It noted on Tuesday that there has been a change in circumstances because the tone and tenor of the programme emerged only after four episodes were telecast from September 11 to 14.The hearing also saw a lengthy discussion on regulating media, particularly the electronic media. The court suggested the appointment of a committee of five distinguished citizens to frame standards for regulation of the electronic media.The case will be heard again on Thursday. Justice KM Joseph said that freedom granted to the media was not absolute and the manner in which certain television channels conduct news debates left a lot to be desired. “Certain channels mute panelilsts when they express views which go against the anchor’s views. This is unfair. No freedom is absolute, not even journalistic freedom,” justice Joseph said. He asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Central government, to explore options for disclosing the shareholding pattern and revenue model of media houses in the public domain. Mehta said the freedom of a journalist was supreme and any regulation of it would need extensive debate.Tuesday’s order was passed in the face of vehement opposition by Sudarshan News lawyer, senior counsel Shyam Divan, who said such an order would amount to prior restraint on publication of news and would violate free speech.“I reserve my right to fair criticism of the order after the hearing of the matter is over... Arguments were contrary to facts and records. My client has never said anything about Muslim community. We are concerned with the issue of national security,” advocate Vishnu Jain, who also represented Sudarshan News, told HT.The court was hearing a petition by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan, who submitted that the programme contained statements which were derogatory about the entry of Muslims into the civil services. In the programme’s trailer, which was widely shared on social media platforms, the anchor and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan news, Suresh Chavhanke was seen questioning how there had been a sudden increase in the number of Muslims succeeding in Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service exams.Chavhanke went on to ask about what the consequences would be if “Jihadis from Jamia” (Millia Islamia) would hold positions of authority and power like those of collector and secretary.The court, while hearing the matter, on August 28 issued notices to central government, Press Council of India, Sudarshan News and News Broadcasters Association, but had declined a stay on its telecast.In a case related to the same show before the Delhi high court, notices were issued on September 11, but no stay was granted. Sudarshan News then proceeded to telecast four episodes of the show.Chandrachud said every single person who applies to take the UPSC exam goes through the same selection process and the insinuation that one community was trying to infiltrate civil services does great disservice to the nation. “What has been happening does not do credit to our democratic system. We are a melting pot of cultures, civilizations, religions and languages,” said justice Chandrachud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-halts-broadcast-of-insidious-show/story-gSZhiCqAvvPIgxtjfM4n3I.html
16-09-2020||India||J-K, Ladakh fully integrated into mainstream India, says Centre||The Centre said on Tuesday that the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have been fully integrated into the mainstream and the decision to revoke the region’s special status over a year back “brought about socio-economic development”, even as the government continues to face criticism from the Opposition over the August 5 move.Responding to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi’s query, in which he asked about the impact of the decision to revoke the special status and bifurcate the erstwhile state of J-K into two UTs, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy told the Lok Sabha that benefits of all central laws were now available to the region.On August 5 last year, Parliament effectively nullified Article 370, which conferred special status on J-K, removed Article 35A, which empowered the state legislature to define permanent residents for government jobs and property ownership, reorganised the state into two separate administrative units of J-K and Ladakh, and made them both UTs. Regional parties have issued a joint statement, pledging that they will fight the constitutional changes.Speaking in Parliament, convened for the first time amid unprecedented arrangements prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Reddy said: “...The change has brought about socio-economic development in both the new UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. Empowerment of people, removal of unjust laws, bringing in equity and fairness to those discriminated since ages who are now getting their due along with comprehensive development are few of the important changes that are ushering both the new UTs towards the path of peace and progress.” Detailing the funds being infused in the region, the home ministry said that besides regular flow of money under various schemes by different ministries of the Centre, an amount of ₹30,757 crore was allocated in the financial year 2020-21. Replying to another query in the Lok Sabha, the home ministry said that there were 111 successful infiltration incidents into J-K from across the border between August 2019 and July this year. Between March and August this year, 138 terrorists were killed, while 50 security personnel have also laid down their lives, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-ladakh-fully-integrated-into-mainstream-india-says-centre/story-GxbfI7H6uPUXgt22YQoSgP.html
16-09-2020||India||Monsoon veers off forecast||The Southwest monsoon stuck to the theme of 2020 — deviating significantly from the geographical distribution forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD) in June. Peninsular India has recorded 26.3% excess rain this monsoon since June 1 and 78.6% excess rain in September (till September 14). It is expecting more rain due to a well-marked low-pressure area that has developed over the Bay of Bengal. Northwest India has seen 13.5% lower rainfall since June 1 -- this isn’t a deficiency though because rainfall that is between -19% and +19% of the long period average is termed normal. However, there are parts within this region that have done worse -- west Uttar Pradesh has seen 30% lower rains; Himachal Pradesh, 18% lower; Uttarakhand, 15% lower; Jammu and Kashmir 27% lower; and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, 6% lower. Rainfall that is between -20% and -59% of the average is termed deficient. West Rajasthan, also in the same region has seen a 30% surplus. Scientists said the north-western region is unlikely to record heavy rain between now and the end of the monsoon.IMD in its long-range forecast in June predicted above normal monsoon rain over northwest India at 107% of the average, and normal rains over peninsular India at about 102% of long period average (LPA; monsoon average for 50 years), central India (103%), and east and northeast India (96%). Central India has recorded 14.5% excess rain so far (it is still in the normal category, though).This monsoon has been characterised by several unique features , such as no low-pressure areas forming in July, resulting in the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) oscillating to the Himalayan foothills very frequently bringing rains mainly to the peninsular region and northeast India in July while leaving northwest India dry.Five low pressure systems formed in August which brought excess rains to the central and western region but not much to the north-western region again.“Long range forecasts have a 9% error margin. They are only indicative because they are forecast several days in advance,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, explaining the divergence.“In the first half, particularly up to July northwest India had a very large rain deficiency. Low pressure areas didn’t form and a couple that formed did not move up to northwest India. We are not expecting any improvement in rain deficiency over northwest India now because we are heading towards monsoon withdrawal. The long-range forecast doesn’t capture these peculiar patterns that can develop during the monsoon,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune.The divergence highlights the challenge of forecasting weather, one expert said. “The monsoon models usually consider parameters such as La Nina or El Nino (cold and warm currents in the southern Pacific) and other weather parameters which may develop during the course of the monsoon. But there are years when the complete forecast goes wrong. The models also consider the impact of climate change. One of the possible impacts of climate change is the path of the low-pressure systems. They are moving west wards but are not impacting the north-western region. Forecasting geographic distribution is a bit tricky,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private forecaster. Both 2018 and 2019 also saw divergences. The long-range forecast for monsoon 2019 was 96% of LPA with a model error of ± 4% . The actual rainfall recorded was 110% of LPA. The forecasts issued in May for season rainfall over northwest India, Central India, northeast India and South Peninsula were 94%, 100%, 91% and 97% of the LPA respectively all with model errors of ± 8%. But the actual rainfall recorded over these regions were 98%, 129%, 88% and 116% of the LPA respectively. Central India and Peninsular India didn’t meet the forecast. In 2018, the forecast for northeast India was 93% but only 76% rain was recorded.Normally, the withdrawal of monsoon is supposed to begin from September 17 when rains begin to reduce across the country until completely withdrawing on October 15.But this year, IMD’s extended range forecast shows extensive and heavy rains along the west coast between September 11 and 24 and then until October 1 over several parts of central India. “We haven’t got any indication as yet of monsoon withdrawal from northwest India. Another low-pressure area is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal around August 17 but we need to assess the models further to be certain. Monsoon withdrawal can begin only once anti-cyclonic flow is established and moisture reduces significantly over the region,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-veers-off-forecast/story-KrJQKirqqzUourMhX8tdiL.html
16-09-2020||India||2 indigenous Covid vaccine candidates completed phase 1 trials;||The two indigenous vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have completed Phase 1 human trials, and their developers have recruited subjects for Phase 2 trials, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday.Phase 2/3 human trials on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate by the Serum Institute of India (SII) were also underway in the country until last week, when they had to be paused after a trial participant in the UK developed an unexplained adverse reaction. “...Zydus Cadila’s has completed Phase 1 human trials, and Phase 2 recruitments have been completed. For this three doses are to be given 28 days apart. For Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate also, the Phase 1 trial is done, and so is recruitment of trial participants for Phase 2. For this trial, two doses are to be given. Results are being analysed,” Bhargava said at a media briefing. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) asked SII to suspend new recruitments, and submit clearances from the data safety monitoring boards of both the UK and India, and obtain a clearance from the central drugs regulator to restart the trials. Dr Bhargava said: “Serum Institute of India (SII) has completed Phase II trials, for which 100 participants have been given the vaccine dose. There’s a seven-day pause and after that they plan to begin Phase 3 trials with about 1,500 participants across 14 sites.” Another Covid-19 vaccine candidate, for which talks are on for trials to be conducted in India, is the one developed by Russia called Sputnik V. “Russia has just started Phase 3 trials for this vaccine,” said Bhargava, adding that a high-level Indian government committee, the Russian government and diplomats were engaged in talks on conducting the trials in India.“The first study of safety and efficacy of this vaccine candidate in 76 patients was published in The Lancet. For trials to start in India necessary regulatory clearances would be required,” said Dr Bhargava. No Covid-19-specific drug or vaccine is available yet globally. The government’s national task force and joint monitoring group is also reviewing the benefits of plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients. “Plasma therapy is in use for more than 100 years now for different infections, whether it benefits or not needs to be investigated. It requires randomized control trials. Under ICMR, a study was done with 464 patients in 39 hospitals across 25 districts in 14 states, and even though it didn’t show much benefit, the data is still in pre-print stages and will be reviewed further and a considered view will be taken,” said Dr Bhargava.Plasma therapy uses the blood of a recovered patient to create antibodies in infected individuals. The ICMR director general also said India hadn’t attained the peak of the disease of the kind that has been seen in western countries because of the measures that the government took well in advance to contain the outbreak.“In India we have been able to distribute the curve because of the very effective measures, so we did not have a peak in that sense,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indigenous-covid-vaccine-candidates-completed-phase-1-trials/story-cwZXztBcGBsJRLOpCdBFzM.html

16-09-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 5 million-mark as cases continue to surge at an alarming rate||The number of coronavirus infections in India crossed the 5 million mark with 91,136 new cases reported on Tuesday, as infections continued to rise at an alarming rate in the nation with the worst-ever recorded case rate.India’s tally of total cases stands at 5,017,914, behind only the United States, which at 6.76 million confirmed infections, is the worst-hit nation in the world. Also, 1,284 new deaths were reported on Tuesday, taking the nationwide death toll to 82,091. A total of 3,937,066 people who have been infected have so far recovered, according to HT’s dashboard.At 998,757, the number of active cases in the country was a little below the million mark till late Tuesday night.India now accounts for nearly one-sixth of all Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide since the outbreak originated in China nine months ago.The country also has the worst-ever daily infection rate recorded anywhere in the world. The seven-day average of daily cases in India stands at 93,334, much higher than the peak in the US — where the number touched 69,373 for the week ending June 25, according to worldometers.info.Unlike the US, India’s trajectory has shown no indication of a peak so far and has also been growing steady. The seven-day average has increased 50.7% in the last 30 days — it was 61,933 on August 17.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn terms of deaths, though, India has fared much better. The case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of infected people who have died from the disease — is 1.64%, which is not only better than the global average of 3.16%, but has also been improving steadily. The CFR in the US is 2.95%, and in Brazil it is 3.04%.The rapid increase in daily cases has meant that active cases in India have been seeing a near steady increase. Active cases — which is calculated by subtracting the number of deaths and recoveries from the total caseload — is a key metric because it reflects the toll on a region’s health care facilities. In the past 30 days, active cases have increased from 672,269 to 998,757 — a rise of nearly 50%.One of the key characteristics of the outbreak in India so far has been that almost all of the country’s hot spot regions are still seeing a rising curve — daily cases in these regions continue to grow and have shown no significant drop.The seven-day average of daily cases in Maharashtra, the state with the highest cases and deaths, has nearly doubled — from 11,406 to 22,012 in the last 30 days. In Andhra Pradesh, on the second spot in total cases, this number has increased from 8,726 to 9,798 in the same time period, and in Karnataka it has grown from 7,276 to 9,011. In Uttar Pradesh (fifth highest cases) this has grown from 4,499 to 6,509.Tamil Nadu (on the third spot), however, is one of the regions that appear to be experiencing a prolonged plateau — average daily cases in the state dropped marginally from 5,876 to 5,610 in 30 days.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic In Delhi, average daily cases have nearly quadrupled in the same time period — from 1,033 to 4,094. At the start of August, the Capital was one of the only major regions in the country that had managed to successfully contain its outbreak when average daily cases dropped to under 1,000. Cases, however, spiked again and are now at an all-time high. To be sure, Delhi’s increase in cases has come with a record rise in daily tests.Testing, in fact, has been one of the spheres where the country has reported massive improvements and rising daily tests have been a common factor across most regions. Average daily tests across the country have increased from nearly 780,000 to 1,100,000 in the last 30 days.The government said on Tuesday that India has “learnt from the experience of nations” that suffered high mortalities. India was able to “distribute the curve” of coronavirus infections due to the nationwide lockdown enforced at the end of March, government officials said during the Union health ministry’s weekly Covid-19 press briefing on Tuesday.“The US and European nations experienced a peak, then the cases dropped down and now there’s a second wave there. We took our lesson from the first wave there. We distributed the curve in a way that we did not have many deaths. It was because we had an effective lockdown, we did not have a huge peak at all,” said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-5-million-mark-as-cases-continue-to-surge-at-an-alarming-rate/story-yHXfPQxXIhOunNswg0P95K.html
16-09-2020||India||Self-reliant Bihar a must for Atmanirbhar Bharat: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that the NDA government in Bihar was striving to usher in inclusive growth in the state by ensuring basic amenities to its people to set the stage for a self-reliant Bihar.“Bihar suffered a lot in the past due to misplaced priorities, vested interest and scams of past governments. As a result, rural areas were put on backward trend, while urban infrastructure became irrelevant for want of upgrade as per the growing population,” said PM Modi in an apparent swipe at the RJD-led dispensation.The PM was speaking after inaugurating and launching work on the Rs 541 crore infrastructure projects, which included operationalisation of two sewerage treatment plants (STPs) along with network at Beur and Karmalichal in Patna, costing Rs 152 crore, through video conferencing. He also laid the foundation stone of river front development in Muzaffarpur and unveiled water supply schemes at Chapra and Siwan.PM Modi said that the NDA government under Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi had been working hard to revive self-confidence of the people by empowering them through a slew of initiatives like empowering girls through education and significant participation of deprived people in local bodies and panchayati raj system. “Local bodies have been strengthened to plan and execute scheme as per local needs,” he said.He said that the joint efforts of the Centre and the state government had resulted in qualitative change in urban infrastructure to ensure basic amenities to all. “The government is committed to make Bihar self-reliant to achieve the objective of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Enhancement in urban infrastructure will ensure ease of living for the people and create an ambience suitable for ease of doing business,” said Modi, adding that Bihar had been a land of inventions and innovations.The PM said that about 2 crore houses were connected with tap water supply under the Centre’s Jal Jivan mission in last one year. “In Bihar, about 12 lakh households would get supply water once the undergoing schemes are complete. Currently, 6 lakh families have tap water supply in their houses under AMRUT scheme. Unlike the previous government, Nitish Kumar’s government work with commitment and finishes the projects on time,” said Modi, adding that the dolphin conservation project being developed from Patna to Bhagalpur stretch of Ganga would benefit the state in many ways.During his address, Modi sought to connect the people by invoking the most popular Chhath puja saying that the renovated Ghat at Muzaffapur would let women celebrate the festival in its traditional spirit. He also lauded role of migrant workers, who returned to Bihar due to the Covid-19 outbreak, saying that they contributed a lot for timely completion of water supply schemes in Bihar.The PM also paid tribute to M Vishweshwaraya and said that engineers had played a crucial role in the development of Bihar.This is third time in the last one week that the Prime Minister laid foundation stones of or inaugurated various schemes in the state in the run up to the elections. On Sunday, he launched three petroleum projects in Bihar, costing Rs 900 crore. He had on Thursday unveiled projects worth Rs 294.53 crore related to agriculture and animal husbandry in the poll-bound state.Chief minister Nitish Kumar said that the water resources department was devising plans to use treated water from the SPTs for agriculture purposes, instead of releasing it in Punpun River. While welcoming the Centre’s gesture to help the state government achieve a holistic growth, Kumar urged the people to abstain from misusing supply water and put avoidable strain on ecology.Earlier deputy CM Sushil Modi said that the operation of the STPs under Namami Gange project would help the government’s drive to stop discharge of untreated waste in Ganga, which is currently highly polluted. “Efforts are on to check the flow of waste water, chemical and industrial affluent in the river to make it pure,” said the Deputy CM.Governor Fagu Chauhan, Union ministers Gajenda Singh Shekhawat, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Hardeep Singh Puri also participated in the programme through video conferencing.Reacting to the string of launching events lined up for the PM in Bihar, Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra said that Modi had stepped in steer the poll campaign after he realised that Nitish Kumar alone would not be able to counter the burgeoning anti-incumbency against the ruling dispensation. “BJP’s internal survey also hints at serious depletion of the credibility of Nitish Kumar,” said the Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-reliant-bihar-a-must-for-atmanirbhar-bharat-pm-modi/story-mdl5M8XQYhrbIoqVrrWApJ.html
16-09-2020||India||China actions sparked LAC standoff; India ready: Govt||Defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Tuesday that China has engaged in massive mobilisation of troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), engaged in aggressive behaviour, and sought to unilaterally change the status quo — all in contravention of existing border agreements and pacts between the two countries. In the face of this, he said, India’s armed forces have shown both restraint when needed and courage when required, and will defend Indian sovereignty and territorial integrity in any situation.In the first official statement by the government on the floor of the Lok Sabha on the India-China standoff in eastern Ladakh, Singh provided the historical backdrop of the border question; emphasised the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity at the border for bilateral relations to progress; chronologically outlined the series of aggressive moves by China and “violent conduct” since April this year; acknowledged how the current situation is qualitatively different from the past in terms of the number of troops involved and the number of friction points; laid out the Indian position and principles on the need to respect the LAC; and alluded to the recent understanding between the foreign ministers of both countries in Moscow, putting the onus categorically on China to disengage. “The amassing of the troops by China goes against our 1993 and 1996 agreements. Respecting and strictly observing the Line of Actual Control is the basis for peace and tranquillity in the border areas and explicitly recognised in both agreements. While our armed forces abide scrupulously by it, this has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side... In the recent incidents, this year, the violent conduct of Chinese forces has been in complete violation of all mutually agreed norms,” Singh said.“As of now, the Chinese side has mobilised a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in the depth areas. There are several friction areas in eastern Ladakh, including Gogra, Kongka La and north and south banks of the Pangong Lake. In response to China’s actions, our armed forces have also made appropriate counterdeployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected. The House should have full confidence that our armed forces will always rise to the challenge and do us all proud,” he added. Singh suggested that in the past too, there have been long standoffs which were peacefully resolved, but acknowledged that the scale of troop mobilisation and number of friction points made then current situation different. “We are ready to face any situation,” he said.  The defence minister also urged the House to pass a resolution expressing admiration for the bravery of Indian soldiers at the front line and solidarity with the troops — as Parliament has done in times of crisis. The Congress walked out after it was not allowed to speak under House rules after the defence minister ended his address. Adressing reporters outside Parliament, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s absence from Parliament when the defence minister made a statement showed that how the government was afraid of a discussion on the face-off. Also read| ‘Don’t be afraid to name China’: Rahul Gandhi’s jibe after Rajnath Singh’s LAC statement“For the Congress, the country is the most important. We are proud of our armed forces. This government did not allow us to speak in Parliament. They are afraid of Congress asking questions that they will not be able to answer,” he said. Singh began his speech by offering the context to the long-festering border dispute between India and China, and said that customary alignments, geographic principles, historic use and border pacts have not been accepted by Beijing. China is, the defence minister said, in possession of 38,000 square km of Indian territory in Ladakh; 5,180 sq km of Indian territory in Kashmir given to it by Pakistan in 1963; and has claimed Arunachal Pradesh. But since 1988 (when then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China), Singh said that both countries decided that the border issue needed patience and a “fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution”. And while on the LAC itself both countries had differing perceptions, they agreed that peace at the border was essential for the progress of bilateral relations. This, then, led to agreements in 1993 and 1996 — which stipulated minimal troop presence, respect and adherence to the LAC, and an understanding to arrive at a common perception of the LAC, a process China stalled in 2003.Turning to the present crisis, Singh said that in April, China began mobilising both troops and armaments. In May, it interrupted regular patrolling patterns in the Galwan valley where there was a face-off, and it also attempted transgression in the western sector in mid-May, in Kongka La, Gogra and Pangong Tso. Singh said that India conveyed to China, through diplomatic and military channels, that attempts to change the status quo unilaterally won’t be acceptable.Also read| India inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese forces in June: Rajnath SinghOn June 6, there was an understanding on disengagement. But on June 15, in Galwan, Singh said, “China created a violent situation”. Indian troops made sacrifices and secured the border, but, Singh said emphatically, there were also “heavy casualties” on the Chinese side. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the violent brawl in Galwan valley.Singh said that India, in its communication with China, had clearly laid out three principles — the need to respect the LAC and adhere to it strictly; the need to not change the status quo; and the need to respect all pacts and agreements. But on August 29 and 30, even as discussions were underway, Singh said that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) tried to unilaterally change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, but “timely action” by Indian armed forces repelled the design. India, Singh said, engaged in counterdeployment so that Indian security interests were safeguarded no matter what the situation. But he added that there were sensitive operational matters involved, which he, even if he wanted to, could not discuss. The defence minister then turned to the state of negotiations, while emphasising that India wants a resolution of the situation peacefully. He spoke about his meeting with the Chinese counterpart in Moscow, where they had an in-depth discussion. “I made it clear that even as we wanted to peacefully resolve the issue and would like the Chinese side to work with us, there should also be no doubt about our determination to protect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” He then referred to foreign minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart. “The two have reached an agreement that, if implemented sincerely and faithfully by the Chinese side, could lead to complete disengagement and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.”Experts hailed the clarity in the minister’s statement. “I think the defence minister has unequivocally laid the responsibility for the current tensions on the actions of the PLA and the complete disregard for past agreements and protocols. He has also clearly stated that while we would prefer that the matter be resolved through dialogue, there will be no compromise with our territorial integrity. This is a firm and clear statement of our intent,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General (retired) DS Hooda. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said Singh’s statement was a combination of clarity, candour and confidence and reflected the new phase in the standoff following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Moscow and the five-point roadmap for the way forward.“It is a strong statement reflecting India’s national determination. It addressed three constituencies – our own people, who have been taken into confidence on what is happening and India’s strategy to tackle the situation; the international community because a clear-cut message hadn’t been going out to the world that it was China which created this situation by violating all agreements and that India still wants a peaceful resolution and if this doesn’t happen, it could lead to further deterioration; and the Chinese government and elite, to say that it is still India’s preferred option to resolve things through negotiations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-actions-sparked-lac-standoff-india-ready-govt/story-RfOjALQOoPvW9cupFsjYmO.html
16-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand Space Application Centre develops geospatial mechanism to locate Covid-19 patients||The Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) has developed a geospatial application to locate Covid-19 infected people in any given area of Dehradun city, which could help the administration in taking crucial decisions like the declaration of containment zones in quick time, officials said on Monday. A Geospatial application relates to data which is associated with a particular location in a given area. The application developed over a period of one week could also enable any common man to see how many people are infected with the virus in the area he or she is living in, officials said. “The geospatial application developed by us will be very helpful to the administration as it could provide real-time data of the total number of Covid-19 positive people in any specific area of the city. If the authorities want to declare an area as a containment zone by knowing the number of infected people, they could do that just by feeding their query in the application and take a decision accordingly with the results provided,” MPS Bisht, director USAC said. Bisht said that the application is also able to provide the data on the number of infected people on gender and age segregation also. “The application, which is yet to be launched, has been developed with the data provided by the Dehradun district administration and the health department on the people who have tested positive for the disease,” Bisht said. His subordinate and programme system manager in USAC, Hemant Bisht who was involved in developing the application said, “The application is a web-GIS (geographic information system) based application which is similar to the working of the Google search engine.” “Like in Google where one can put his query on the search bar and get results, in this application too he could just put in his query and get results in the form of an interactive map. It will be similar to Arogya Setu app which can alert the user on the infected people around him but on a larger scale,” he said. The application is, however, yet to be launched as it is to be reviewed by the Dehradun district administration. “We would soon present a demonstration on its working before the district administration. If it’s approved then gradually it will include the whole state,” Bisht said. He also added, “Once launched the authorities would only have the right to make an addition to the data on the infected people in the application.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-space-application-centre-develops-geospatial-mechanism-to-locate-covid-19-patients/story-k8LGDnsasvldDhSa5Lq3gI.html
16-09-2020||India||India, US say Afghan peace process must lead to ceasefire and political roadmap||The US and India said on Tuesday the peace process in Afghanistan must lead to a political roadmap and a permanent ceasefire, and the Afghan sides should ensure that the country’s territory isn’t used by any terrorist group against any country. This was among the outcomes of a meeting between the US special representative on Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The meeting was also attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. On Tuesday, Khalilzad travelled to New Delhi from Doha, where representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban have begun the much-delayed intra-Afghan negotiations to hammer out a final political settlement. Khalilzad met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and other senior officials during a visit to Islamabad on Monday, following which he had returned to Doha. “The United States and India share the view that the peace process must continue until there is agreement on a political roadmap and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire. The Afghan sides should ensure their territory must not be used by any terrorist group against any other country,” said a statement issued by the US embassy after Tuesday’s meeting. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Khalilzad briefed the Indian side about the US assessment of the intra-Afghan negotiations and also shared the American perspective on the Afghan peace process. “The two sides discussed future steps and possible cooperation between India and the US in furthering the Afghan peace process,” one of the people cited above said. “They also discussed how to promote regional and international cooperation with regard to Afghanistan,” the person added. The US embassy statement quoted Khalilzad as saying that regional and international support is critical for the success of the intra-Afghan negotiations and the implementation of any agreement. “India and the US will work together in support of this objective,” he said. The US and India “expressed similar views on the importance of long-term assistance, trade and investment for consolidating a peace agreement for the benefit of the people of Afghanistan, the region, and beyond”, the statement added. Khalilzad last travelled to New Delhi to brief the Indian side on developments in the Afghan peace process on May 7, and this was his fifth visit to India since January 2019. He also appreciated India’s participation in the inauguration of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha on September 12, the people said. Tuesday’s discussions reflect the India-US strategic partnership, which provides for close consultations between the two sides on bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interest, the people cited above said. During his visit to Islamabad on Monday, Khalilzad had held talks with GenBajwa and Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, on regional security and the intra-Afghan talks. Bajwa told him that Prime Minister Imran Khan had provided a “clear vision regarding peace and connectivity in the region” and Pakistan is working to make that vision a reality. Jaishankar had laid down India’s expectations from the peace process in his address at the inaugural ceremony for the intra-Afghan negotiations on Sunday. He had said New Delhi expects that Afghan soil will never be used for any “anti-India activities”, and it supports an “immediate, comprehensive ceasefire” since the rising levels of violence cannot continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-say-afghan-peace-process-must-lead-to-ceasefire-and-political-roadmap/story-2P84TQo6Ew8lKQHiGtq9RI.html
16-09-2020||India||Kerala minister KT Jaleel to be interrogated again in gold smuggling probe: ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday denied reports that the central agency has given a clean chit to Kerala higher education minister K T Jaleel in the gold smuggling case and said he will be questioned again. The clarification from ED director SK Mishra came in the wake of social media reports that he was given a clean chit in the case. The ED director said the minister was questioned by the agency twice and he will be summoned again after examining his statements. There was a big campaign on social media, mostly by left–supported cyber activists, saying that he was given a clean chit and there won’t be any further questioning in the case. The state is in the midst of an agitation by opposition activists seeking his resignation and many party workers have been injured in baton-charging earlier.However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday defended the beleaguered minister again. “A probe agency questioning a minister is nothing unusual. Opposition parties are targeting Jaleel due to political reasons. It is sad a smoke screen is being created over holy books. The BJP may have reasons for it, but it is sad that the Muslim League and Congress are also supporting it,” he said. The CM dismissed any possibility of the minister’s resignation and dubbed the ongoing agitation a move to destroy the state’s “spirited fight against the Covid-19 pandemic”. Trouble began for the minister after phone call records of Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently on the list. Soon after the list came out, the minister said he had called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate in the state capital.But the minister’s clarification invited more trouble for him as he is not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs and experts said it was a clear violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the gold smuggling investigation, the Customs also found that a huge consignment came on March 4 in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took these packets to his constituency but said they were religious books.During investigation, the Customs also found that between 2017 and 2018 about 17,000 kg of dry dates was imported by the consular office. A senior officer said customs will examine details of all imports from October 2016, when the consulate was opened in the state. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after seizure of 30 kg gold from a diplomatic consignment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-kt-jaleel-to-be-interrogated-again-in-gold-smuggling-probe-ed/story-atq2GF3XZ8LF4HXAW3QaII.html
16-09-2020||India||Facebook in contempt, warns Delhi Assembly panel||A committee of lawmakers on Tuesday said Facebook was in contempt of the Delhi assembly, and gave the social media company a “final warning” to heed to summons to appear before it, while dismissing a letter sent by the executives of the firm declining to make themselves available.In the letter, Facebook’s director (trust and safety) Vikram Langer told the Peace and Harmony Committee of the Delhi assembly that the company’s India head, Ajit Mohan, could not appear before the panel because it was already deposing before a parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, and contended that the firm‘s content regulation was outside the jurisdiction of the state assembly.The committee’s head, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha, rejected the contention, saying the state legislative functions are independent of the parliamentary functions, and Facebook’s stance went against India’s federal structure. “The Delhi legislative committee is operating in its constitutionally lawful jurisdiction and does not conflict or weaken the jurisdiction of the Central government on similar issues,” he said. He added that if the company does not heed to the next summons, the committee “shall be constrained to invoke its power to initiate breach of privilege proceedings”, including penalties.While the committee is looking into possible inaction by Facebook in screening inflammatory posts before and during the Delhi riots in February, the developments came on a day when reports suggested that the company’s services may have also been misused for possible interference in the Delhi assembly elections around the same time. Also read: Umar Khalid in 10-day custody, police to show him 1.1mn pages of dataThis prompted the assembly committee to club the two issues together.The decision of Facebook India’s Mohan not to appear as a witness “is contempt of the Delhi legislative assembly and disregard of the Assembly’s privilege. The indifference exhibited by the representative of the Facebook India is also a contempt to the people of Delhi who have reposed their faith in the committee to examine the current issue,” Chadha said.The MLA also read out portions of the Facebook letter, which he described as “interesting”, in response to the panel’s September 10 summons. In it, Facebook cited two grounds to state that the Delhi Assembly had no jurisdiction over its content regulation.“As you are well aware, the regulation of intermediaries like Facebook falls within the exclusive authority of the Union of India and in exercise of this power to regulate ‘communications’, the Parliament has enacted the Information Technology Act, 2000. Further, the subject of ‘law and order’ in the National Capital Territory of Delhi also fall within the exclusive domain of the Union of India,” the company said. But, Chadha said, that the “proceedings before Parliament are in no way connected to the role of Facebook in the north-east Delhi riots. The notice of appearance issued to Facebook is directly related to the riots, whereas the proceedings in the Parliament are on the subject of ‘safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms including special emphasis on women security in the digital space”.HT reviewed the September 10 summons by the Assembly committee, which stated: “Pertinently, the committee has received numerous complaints alleging inter alia intentional omission and deliberate inaction on the part of social media platform Facebook to apply hate speech rule and policies which has allegedly led to serious repercussions and disruption of peace and harmony across the NCT of Delhi.”Experts said no rule exempts private companies from the mandatory nature of such summons. “It is true that a Delhi Assembly panel, because of the nature of Delhi’s own limited constitutional rights, does not technically have the power to summon even the Delhi police commissioner because the Delhi Police comes under the Centre’s jurisdiction through the LG. However, when it comes to appearing before the panel, no rule states that representatives of a private firm cannot be summoned,” said SK Sharma, former secretary of the Lok Sabha and Delhi assembly. He added the findings of the inquiries of the committees are “reccomendary in nature”. “They submit it to the Speaker, who in turn submits it to the government, and it is up to the government what it wants to do with it. In this case, even if the government forwards it to the Delhi Police, the recommendations may not be executed, unless it comes from the LG,” he added. Another constitutional expert who did not wish to be named called Facebook’s contention that it won’t appear before the assembly panel because a parliamentary standing committee is already looking into the matter as “frivolous”.“Facebook’s justification is frivolous because there is no bar on two committees of the Parliament and the state legislature examining the same matter. If the subjects are different then the company’s plea does not stand at all,” this person said. A Facebook spokesperson did not respond to emails, text messages and calls for comment.

16-09-2020||India||State emblem may crown new Parliament building||India’s national emblem is likely to sit atop the new Parliament building, according to the latest design iteration prepared for the tendering process, replacing a spire that was meant to come up in an earlier version.A housing and urban affairs ministry official said that the design with the state emblem has been finalised for the construction tender.According to a presentation by HCP Design Planning and Management Private Limited, which has been tasked with redeveloping Delhi’s Central Vista, the current design incorporates the state emblem instead of the spire.“We have narrowed down on the 17th version, and I think that’s the final one,” the company stated in the presentation, reviewed by HT. Work on the new Parliament, a ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building, is expected to begin after the ongoing monsoon session, a spokesperson for the architecture firm said. The design will be finalised once construction is scheduled, they added.In the previous design, a spire would have crowned the triple-heighted central foyer, even as a tricoloured beam in the colours of the Indian flag would have lit up the night sky overhead. Last month, the government narrowed the list of choices for building a new Parliament complex to three Mumbai-based construction companies, Larsen & Toubro, Tata Projects and Shapoorji Pallonji & Company, who have qualified for the submission of financial bids. According to officials aware of the development, submissions must take place before September 16. “The project report has been prepared and construction drawings are in progress,” the HCP spokesperson told HT. The national emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath, a fine sculpture that dates back to around 250 BC at the time of Emperor Ashoka’s reign, and which depicts four lions, each facing the four directions, placed atop the Ashoka pillar. A two-dimensional representation of this sculpture depicting three lions was officially adopted on January 26, 1950, the day the Constitution of India came into effect.The new Parliament building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures. The central foyer has been renamed the Constitution Hall as it is expected to display the Constitution for public viewing. A library will also come up near the central foyer.“It will have sculptures of parliamentarians and images representing the diversity of India. At one side of the Constitution Hall will be the Constitution gallery, where the Constitution will be displayed,” HCP stated in the presentation.The triangular complex is designed to include 120 offices with six separate entrances for member of the public, MPs and VIPs, including the Speaker and the vice president.The new Parliament will house enlarged chambers for the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha; the latter has been designed to accommodate 1,350 MPs in case of joint sessions. The public gallery will seat more than 336 persons. The current Parliament building is over 90 years old. HCP, which won the bid last year, will also construct a separate building to house MP offices where the Transport Bhawan and the Shram Shakti Bhawan currently stand. The new Parliament complex was expected to be completed by 2022, but government officials said the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown has slowed the project’s timeline.The Central Vista redevelopment project has come under criticism from different quarters. While the Opposition has called for suspending the ₹20,000 crore project due to the pandemic, some conservationists have argued that it would change the historic nature of Lutyens’ Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-emblem-may-crown-new-parliament-building/story-QIwJUAzFoIHmYGSWTdzuLJ.html
16-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In Dispatch 156, I wrote about why it did not make sense to use rapid antigen tests all the time, or be overly dependent on them — like Delhi continues to be.To recap, such tests give out too many false negative results (identifying an infected person as uninfected) to be reliable. And the protocol in place (which, to make things worse, isn’t strictly followed by anybody) of ensuring symptomatic individuals who test negative in a rapid antigen test are administered a molecular test such as the RT-PCR one as a follow-up is pointless — at least 40% and as high as 80% of those infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), are asymptomatic.Sure, there is a context in which it makes sense to use rapid antigen tests. After all, they provide results within the hour, as compared to the minimum of 24 hours it takes for an RT-PCR test (and in practice, with logistical delays and backlogs, this goes up to three to four days sometimes). So, in containment zones, in airports and railway stations, and ahead of public events (such as the JEE and NEET entrance examinations; no test was administered the candidates, frittering away a great opportunity to test a large number of people) — wherever time is a constraint — it makes sense to use rapid antigen tests. And sure, it makes sense to ensure that a follow-up RT-PCR test is administered to symptomatic individuals testing negative in an antigen test.I have previously suggested a hack that could make antigen tests more accurate — two tests administered in parallel to two samples from the same patient (if there is a discrepancy between the two results, a molecular test is administered). This reduces the chances of a false negative by half.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicFinally, I have also written about new rapid antigen tests (one was launched by Abbott Laboratories, but only in the US recently), which are fast, inexpensive, and as accurate as molecular tests. We must get those. At the time of writing the column referred to in the first instance — it also mentioned Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two other states overly dependent on rapid antigen tests — I did not expect that an opportunity to use a real-life example to explain why such tests shouldn’t be used indiscriminately would present itself in a few days. The math presented in that column was simple, but because it concerned a hypothetical situation, administrators in Delhi, Lucknow and Patna may have missed its import.And so, with that elaborate prelude, let’s look at Exhibit A: The Delhi assembly.This is what we know: 50 lawmakers attended the Delhi assembly’s special one-day session on Monday. All of them had previously taken RT-PCR tests, but not all the results had come in by Monday morning. A rapid antigen test was administered to these lawmakers. It isn’t immediately clear how many were administered the test. It was also administered to assembly officials and journalists covering the session. One MLA tested positive and was immediately sent into quarantine. The others tested negative, and the session began. The positive RT-PCR results of two MLAs came even as the session was in progress — they left the assembly immediately, but, by then, their colleagues had been exposed to them. While all 47 of them have tested negative, they have shared a closed room (a large one) with the two lawmakers, should ideally go into quarantine, and have themselves tested after five days (if they are infected, it will show up by then).Also read| Battle against Covid-19 far from over: Harsh Vardhan in ParliamentDelhi’s administrators, who continue to rely overly on antigen tests (last week, these accounted for 83% of the total 397,722 tests conducted), couldn’t have asked for a better demonstration of their (the tests’) inaccuracy, and how the erroneous results could, in turn, have cascading implications. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was in the House at the time, although it isn’t clear whether he came in contact with the infected lawmakers. A mere greeting, or passing an infected person in the corridor, is unlikely to be dangerous — the infection comes from prolonged exposure. But, building on several research studies, a bunch of talking heads in a room are more at risk than a bunch of silent ones.I hope those plexiglass partitions in Parliament are tall enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-G7e47i4v2pbEghXyXrWx6J.html
16-09-2020||India||No intel on nexus between bollywood, drug traffickers: MHA||NEW DELHI: The issue of a nexus between the Hindi film industry and drug traffickers came up in Parliament on Tuesday; while the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) informed Lok Sabha that it hasn’t come across any actionable intelligence, which suggests a nexus between Bollywood celebrities and drug traffickers; in the Rajya Sabha several members raised objection that the whole industry was being tarnished because of the actions of a few.In a written reply, the MHA informed the Lok Sabha that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is under the ministry, is investigating a case in this regard. The anti-drugs investigation agency had on August 28 registered a second case, an offshoot of probe against actor Rhea Chakraborty, to investigate link between various persons in Mumbai in the supply of drugs. “During the period of Covid-19 lockdown, no such actionable inputs were received by NCB revealing the nexus between people in the film industry and drug traffickers. However, a case in this regard has been registered by NCB Mumbai Zonal unit on 28.08.2020,” MHA said in reply to a question.It went on to add, “Drugs such as Ganja, Hashish, Tetra Hydro Cannabinol and Lysergic acid De-ethylamide have been seized in the operation.”The ministry was responding to a query from Kumbakudi Sudhakaran, a Congress lawmaker from Kerala, who asked if the government had conducted a detailed enquiry in the nexus between people in the film industry and those involved in drug trade during Covid-19. The agency has already arrested 10 persons in this particular case, mainly drugs suppliers and conduits. Based on a reference from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), NCB had filed a case against Rhea and her family members on August 26. She was arrested on September 8 and is currently in judicial custody. Earlier in the day, Samajwadi Party leader Jaya Bachachan who is also an actor said the industry was being unfairly targeted. The SPMP said the entertainment industry in a country which provides direct employment every day to 5 lakh people and indirect employment to 5 million is being called a “gutter”.“At a time when the financial situation is in a depressing state unemployment is at the worst level, in order to divert the attention of the people, we are being used to be flocked by the social media and the government’s non-support. People who have made their name in this film industry have called it a gutter,” she said.The actor said the government must standby the entertainment industry because it has always stepped forward to help the government in whatever work that it takes up. “If there is a natural calamity, they come forward, they give money and they give their services. I think it is very important that the government must support this industry and not kill it,” Bachchan said.Without naming Lok Sabha MP Ravi Kishan she said she was embarrassed and ashamed that someone who is from the industry had spoken ill about it.On Monday, Ravi Kishen had said drug addiction is in the film industry too. He said the central government should take strict action against the culprits.Actor Kanagana Ranaut however questioned if Bachchan’s stance would change if her children were involved.“Jayaji would you say the same thing if in my place it was your daughter Shweta beaten, drugged and molested as a teenage, would you say the same thing if Abhieshek complained about bullying and harassment constantly and found hanging one day? Show compassion for us also,” Kangana said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intel-on-nexus-between-bollywood-drug-traffickers-mha/story-mdZT8eU0rqL8ON610U6TTM.html
16-09-2020||India||Journalists allegedly beaten by security forces in J-K’s Pulwama district||At least two photojournalists were allegedly beaten by security forces when they were covering a gunfight between militants and security forces in south Kashmir's Pulwama district on Tuesday, prompting protests by members of the fraternity in the Valley.Kamran Yousuf, a multimedia journalist working with a news portal, and Faisal Bashir, a freelancer, were beaten by policemen near the site of the shoot-out in Marwal Kakapora village of Pulwama. Yousuf had to be hospitalized in Srinagar for treatment of injuries to his limbs, and the doctors told him he had suffered a mild fracture in his right leg.The alleged assault triggered outrage among the journalistic fraternity in the Kashmir Valley, where calls were made to the lieutenant governor and the police top brass to “sensitise” members of security forces about how media professionals function. According to Yousuf, many journalists reached the outer security ring near the encounter site in the morning on Tuesday to cover the shoot-out and started taking pictures when they were told by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel present there to move a bit farther.“When we started leaving, suddenly some policemen came rushing towards me. They told me to stop and simply started raining batons [on me] without asking anything,” Yousuf said. “I was surrounded by them and if somehow I had not managed to slip away, I would have been severely injured by their assault. They even chased me.”Bashir also said he was assaulted without any reason. “I was on the bund of the Jhelum when they told me to come down. They rained batons on my back and also hit my camera. After assaulting me, they caught hold of Kamran who was behind me,” he said.Inspector general of police Vijay Kumar did not comment on the incident and urged the media to instead contact Pulwama superintendent of police Ashish Kumar Mishra ,who did not respond to a call from HT.Senior journalist Yusuf Jameel said beating up,harassing and intimidating journalists in Kashmir wasn’t something new. “We’ve lived with & endured it for yrs.What is,however,more disgusting rather despicable is the authorities,after every such incident,assuring ‘it will not happen again.’ I see it also as rubbing salt in the wound, “ he wrote in a tweet. The Kashmir Press Club (KPC) and Kashmir Editors Guild (KEG) slammed the police for the assault.“Going by the account of Kamran, it is clear that the police has targeted the journalists to stop them from carrying out their professional work which is reprehensible,” the KPC said in a statement, and demanded action against the police who took part in the assault.KEG demanded that the police leadership in Kashmir sensitize members of the force on how the media operates and to investigate the assault.“It has emerged as a routine for the police and the security forces to assault the journalists while covering the happenings on the ground…The Guild want the LG Jammu and Kashmir to personally look into the assault,” the editors’ body said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalists-beaten-up-in-valley/story-uzSBRZiGs7lnZVNstlYb3L.html

Opposition leaders cutting across political lines supported the bill to reduce MPs’ salary by 30% but spoke unequivocally against the temporary scrapping of MPLAD funds for two years. Discussing the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which was brought on Monday to replace an ordinance that was promulgated on April 7, Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi defended the move and said “charity should begin from home”. Replying to the debate on the bill, Joshi said that funds are needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and pointed out that Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds have been temporarily stalled for two years.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic Congress floor leader in lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury called for a unanimous resolution in the House to restore the MPLAD fund, arguing that 93% of the funds have been utilised and the bulk of them were used for welfare activities for SCs, STs and villagers. He also said that the government is giving tax relief to corporate but taking away MPLAD fund, dubbing it as “penny-wise and pound-foolish”. Aam Aadmi Party’s Bhagwant Mann, independent member from Maharashtra Navneet Ravi Rana, BSP’s Ritesh Pandey and AIMIM’s S I Jaleel said that government can reduce their salary further but the MPLAD fund should be restored as it belongs to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-nod-to-bill-for-30-salary-cut-of-mps-for-a-year/story-OLSxuRFX0ewNjnew9jLyLP.html
16-09-2020||India||India walks out of SCO meet after Pakistan uses ‘fictitious map’||India on Tuesday walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of member-states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) after the Pakistani representative projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries. “At the meeting of the national security advisers (NSAs) of member-states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), hosted by the chair of the SCO (Russia), the Pakistani NSA deliberately projected a fictitious map that Pakistan has recently been propagating,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. “This was in blatant disregard to the advisory by the host against it and in violation of the norms of the meeting. After consultation with the host, the Indian side left the meeting in protest at that juncture,” he said. Srivastava added, “As was to be expected, Pakistan then went on to present a misleading view of this meeting.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan’s use of a “fictitious map” as a backdrop for its representative, which depicted sovereign Indian territories as parts of Pakistan, was a blatant violation of the SCO charter and went against all established norms of the grouping for safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member-states. “India issued its strong objection to the use of this illegal map by Pakistan. The Russian side, as the chair, tried very hard to persuade Pakistan not to do so,” said one of the people cited above. Russian NSA Nikolai Patrushev conveyed to the Indian side that he was personally very grateful to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval for attending the SCO meeting, the people said. “Russia doesn’t support what Pakistan has done and hopes Pakistan’s provocative act won’t affect India’s participation in SCO and definitely not cast any shadow on Patrushev’s warm personal relationship with the Indian NSA, for whom he has the highest regard,” the person added. Patrushev also said he hoped to see Doval at forthcoming events, according to the people. Pakistan issued a new map on August 4 that laid claim to India’s union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and parts of Gujarat state on the eve of the first anniversary of the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. India had reacted to the move by describing it as an “exercise in political absurdity” with no legal validity. The political map was released by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan during a meeting in Islamabad that was attended by his cabinet and senior officials, including his special assistant on national security affairs, Moeed Yusuf. Khan had said the map was the first step towards a political struggle to achieve the right of self-determination for Kashmiris. Pakistan currently doesn’t have a formally appointed NSA and Yusuf represents the country at meetings such as the one held on Tuesday. Before the external affairs ministry spokesperson’s statement, Yusuf tweeted: “Bizarrely, my Indian counterpart chose to walk out of Pakistan and Russia’s speech. Left a bad taste at a forum whose whole spirit is cooperation.” Yusuf also tweeted he had “highlighted that unilateral & illegal actions in an internationally recognised disputed territory of [Jammu and Kashmir] is a threat to regional peace & prosperity”. SCO currently comprises eight member-states. China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are the other members, alongside India, Pakistan and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-walks-out-of-sco-meet-after-pak-uses-fictitious-map/story-O5ZxKvny3Vblb7A5WT8toO.html
16-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Fake news led to migrants’ exodus, says home ministry||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that the exodus of migrant workers from the cities to the countryside in their home states was triggered by fake news on the duration of the lockdown imposed in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease pandemic (Covid-19). Migrant workers were also concerned about the availability of basic necessities like food, drinking water, access to health services and shelter during the lockdown enforced on March 25, it said.Responding to a query posed in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said the central government had been “fully conscious” of the concerns of migrant workers , and taken measures to ensure that during the “inevitable lockdown” that followed the outbreak of the pandemic, no citizen is deprived of the basic amenities of food, drinking water, medical facilities and so on.Also read: Lok Sabha nod to bill for 30% salary cut of MPs for a year due to Covid crisisSpeculation, including in the media, on how long the lockdown would last and loss of livelihoods after the closure of factories and business establishments to curb the spread of the disease contributed to the reverse migration of workers to their home states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand. The total lockdown lasted 68 days before government started easing the restrictions.An estimated 10.4 million migrants travelled back home during the lockdown, the government informed Parliament on Monday, saying it had no data on job losses among migrant workers since the outbreak.To mitigate the problems faced by migrant workers, the Centre set up control rooms in the home ministry under the supervision of senior officers of the level of joint secretary and comprising representatives of key central ministries, MHA said on Tuesday. “These control rooms, inter alia, attended to the grievances of stranded persons including migrant workers and promptly resolved these grievances relating to food, transport, shelter, etc. States and Union Territories were also advised to set up control rooms with helplines and to appoint nodal officers,” Rai said in his written reply. The minister of state added that the Centre also allowed state governments to tap the state disaster response fund (SDRF) for arranging temporary accommodation and providing food, clothing and medical care to migrant workers as well as the homeless. “To augment the funds with the states, Central government released an advance Rs 11, 092 crores from the SDRF to the states on April 3, 2020,” he added. To a query from Congress MP Manish Tewari on why the nationwide lockdown was imposed with a notice of just four hours, the minister said the decision was taken to forestall any mass movement. “Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease. Any mass movement of people would have spread the disease very fast amongst people in all parts of the country,” said Rai. “By imposing the countrywide lockdown, India successfully blunted the aggressive spread of Covid-19,” he added. The lockdown period also helped the nation reinforce its health infrastructure to tackle Covid-19, according to the minister, who cited efforts to sharply increase the number of dedicated isolation and intensive care unit (ICU) beds for patients of the viral infection, and develop local capabilities to manufacture personal protection equipment, masks and ventilators.According to the government, the lockdown, by slowing the progress of the pandemic, has prevented an estimated 1.4 to 2.9 million Covid-19 cases and 37,000 to 78,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-news-led-to-migrants-exodus-mha/story-AEYej7C7jaLAkuQ2dCIcML.html
16-09-2020||India||Congress corners govt over LAC standoff||The Congress on Tuesday questioned the absence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the Lok Sabha when defence minister Rajnath Singh made a statement on the India-China border standoff, and alleged that the government was shying away from a parliamentary discussion on the subject. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is in the United States accompanying his mother Sonia Gandhi for a health check-up, attacked the Prime Minister for “misleading” the country over Chinese transgressions. “The country has always stood by its armed forces and will continue to do so in future. But Modiji, when will you stand against China? When will we take back the land of our country from China? Don’t be scared of taking China’s name,” he tweeted in Hindi. Congress members staged a walkout from the House soon after the defence minister’s statement, alleging that they hadn’t been allowed to raise certain issues related to the India-China border row. They later protested in front of Mahatma Gandhi’s statute in the Parliament House complex. In his statement in the Lok Sabha, the defence minister said India was committed to a peaceful resolution of the border standoff with China, but wouldn’t accept any attempt by the neighbour to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control. Singh also said Indian troops had inflicted heavy costs, including casualties, on the Chinese side during a violent clash with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Galwan valley on June 15. The clash left 20 Indian soldiers, including Colonel B Santosh Babu, dead. Addressing reporters outside Parliament, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Prime Minister’s absence from Parliament when the defence minister made a statement in the Lower House on the India-China situation showed that the government was afraid of a discussion on the face-off. “For the Congress party, the country is the most important. We are proud of our armed forces. This government did not allow us to speak in Parliament. They are afraid of Congress asking questions that they will not be able to answer,” he said. “It is our entitlement to put forward our views. When the defence minister made a statement on the India-China situation in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister was not present. He is afraid of conducting a discussion on the issue in Parliament,” Chowdhury alleged. In 1962, when the India-China war took place, he said then opposition leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee sought to know what was the situation on the border. Then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to his demand, and a two-day discussion took place in Parliament on the war and the border situation, he added. Chowdhury said Congress members staged the walkout because they weren’t allowed to send a message to the country and the armed forces. Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also said the government should give an answer on whether China had encroached on Indian territory at specific positions across the border. “The entire country is proud of the armed forces and that is why we are talking here. But why is the Prime Minister shying away from a discussion,” he asked. “Our questions are very straightforward. Has China occupied Indian territory? Have the Chinese encroached on Depsang Plains, Gogra, Pangong Tso till Finger 8, Y-junction in Bhutan, Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand and in Arunachal Pradesh?. The government should answer these questions,” said Surjewala. He said the Prime Minister should apologise to the nation if the answers in the affirmative to the questions posed by the Congress because he told an all-party meeting on June 19 that the Chinese had not entered and occupied Indian territory. Congress’s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi told reporters that Chowdhury and his other party colleagues wanted to send a message of solidarity with the armed forces and also issue a stern warning to China that it should not test India’s patience. “Unfortunately, the government feels as if only they can speak in support of the army,” he added. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted: “The Defence Minister excoriated China for transgressing the LAC, could the Govt explain why the Prime Minister had issued an extraordinary statement claiming that China had not entered our territory? Presumably, the Government has changed the PM’s stand?” “Another question: since the defence minister says that both countries have now agreed in talks to respect the LAC, but separately says the two countries have differing perceptions of where LAC lies, isn’t that a recipe for another clash? Shouldn’t we just insist on status quo ante?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-corners-govt-over-lac-standoff/story-y7RZ6RPqb80gMOK8JXot1L.html
16-09-2020||India||Govt hints at closed-door meet with Opposition on LAC||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has dropped hints to some opposition leaders that a closed-door meeting on the India-China border situation may be considered , after expressing its reluctance to engage in a full-fledged public discussion on the sensitive issue in the monsoon session of Parliament. A final decision on any such meeting, where the opposition parties would be briefed on the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), is yet to be taken, functionaries involved in the talks said. To be sure, the government has not contacted all opposition parties so far. According to the proposal, which follows Opposition accusations that the government was shying away from a discussion on the issue in Parliament, the defence ministry brass may brief floor leaders of different parties behind closed doors on efforts to normalise the situation, and reply to queries they may have on the subject.“A senior minister had called me to say that the government is thinking of a briefing meeting for floor leaders of different parties on the Indo-China situation if they agree. The proposal is at a nascent stage and needs further discussion,” said a senior non-NDA leader, requesting anonymity. Also read| China actions sparked LAC standoff; India ready: GovtAdhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress floor leader in the Lok Sabha, questioned the usefulness of such a meeting. He said: “If newspapers can discuss, public can discuss and everyone else can discuss, then why can’t Indian Parliament discuss such a situation?” Defence minister Rajnath Singh read out a statement in Lok Sabha on Tuesday on the Indo-China border situation, but opposition leaders were not allowed any seek any clarifications. Angry Congress leaders, including Chowdhury and Shashi Tharoor, staged a protest in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in the Parliament complex.Government managers maintained that at this stage, when India and China are trying to resolve the situation, an open debate marked by conflicting views and criticisms is best avoided. Chowdhury reminded the government that in 1962, when then Opposition leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had demanded a debate on the Indo-China war, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to hold a debate that went on for two days. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi quickly pointed out that the 1962 debate took place after the war was over and not when the two sides were trying to find a solution.

Minutes before the Parliament session started on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the situation and added that he expects the House to send out a unanimous message of solidarity with the armed forces. “Today the brave soldiers of our army are on the borders. They are defending the borders with great courage and high spirits, in the difficult terrains,” he said.“The entire House stands with the brave soldiers of the country with one voice; I believe that this House and all the honourable members. too, will give out a very strong message,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-hints-at-closed-door-meet-with-oppn-on-lac/story-yDdLJrw6abKGCJlrnCjd1I.html
16-09-2020||India||Troops gear up for long haul in Ladakh||India is making vigorous attempts to provide logistics support to its soldiers deployed in forward areas in the eastern Ladakh sector, where over 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed through the winter months to deal with any possible provocation by the Chinese forces, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.Military planes and helicopters are flying to Ladakh almost every day with their cargo holds filled with crucial supplies and gear — from specialised winter clothing to rations and arctic tents to portable heaters — that soldiers would require in the inhospitable mountain terrain, the officials said, requesting anonymity.Fresh images coming out of Ladakh on Tuesday provided glimpses of the extraordinary effort being made by the military to support its high-altitude deployments in the sensitive sector. Necessary steps have also been taken for equipment sustenance, the officials saidIn a statement made in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “I can assure you that the morale and motivation of our armed forces is very high…They are being provisioned with suitable clothing, habitat and the required defence wherewithal.”Also read: Govt hints at closed-door meet with Opposition on LACArmy chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane visited forward locations in Ladakh on September 3 to review the army’s operational preparedness and the logistics arrangements for sustenance of forces through the winter. China has deployed sizeable military assets in the eastern Ladakh theatre, including 50,000 troops, 150 aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems, with India matching every military move made by the neighbour.“The determination of our troops is praise-worthy. They are capable of serving at forbidding altitudes with scarce oxygen and in extremely cold temperatures, something that they have effortlessly done over the last many years on Siachen and in Kargil,” Singh said in the Lok Sabha.He said the Lower House should pass a resolution in support of the armed forces that have been defending the country at towering heights, braving inclement weather in Ladakh.Top Indian and Chinese military commanders are likely to hold a meeting along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) this week to reduce military tensions in eastern Ladakh, where the situation remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area.Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. They will now be meeting for the first time after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the most significant heights being held by India on Rezang La and Reqin pass, where the PLA made some desperate attempts to regain ground earlier this week.The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The Chinese side has mobilised a large number of troops and weapon systems along the LAC as well as in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where the current friction areas include Gogra, Kongka La and the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-gear-up-for-long-haul-in-ladakh/story-okikvCfll4iZcaI17GyE7K.html
16-09-2020||India||No discrimination in riots probe: Delhi Police commissioner to Julio Ribeiro||Responding to questions raised on the probe into Delhi riots by veteran cop Julio Ribeiro, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava wrote to him Tuesday saying the investigation was being carried out without any discrimination based on caste or religion, and was backed by documentary and scientific evidence. Ribeiro, a Padma Bhushan awardee who has served as Mumbai police commissioner and director general of Punjab and Gujarat and the Central Reserve Police Force, had said that the Delhi Police has “deliberately failed to register cases against those who made hate speeches, which triggered riots in north-east Delhi. “I write to you with a heavy heart. As a true patriot and a former proud member of the Indian Police Service, I appeal to you to ensure a fair probe into the 753 FIRs registered against peaceful protesters who rightly apprehend injustices born from bias and hate against a minority community. The Delhi Police has taken action against peaceful protesters but deliberately failed to register cognizable offences against those who made hate speeches which triggered the riots in Northeast Delhi. It troubles sane and apolitical persons, like me, why Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma have not been arraigned before the courts of law while deeply hurt Muslim women, peacefully protesting against discriminations based on religion, were lodged for months together in jail,” Ribeiro wrote in his letter titled “miscarriage of justice in northeast Delhi”.Responding to Ribeiro on Tuesday, Shrivastava said that it was his duty to put things in the correct perspective. Shrivastava said the Delhi Police have examined a large number of persons who either have a role in north-east Delhi riots or have information that will “help arrive at the truth”.Also read: Facebook in contempt, warns Delhi Assembly panel“It (police) has questioned persons without regard to their religion and party affiliation. It has collected documentary evidence, including scientific evidence, to support its case,” Shrivastava wrote. He said the “specific details, understandably, cannot be shared at this stage”.Dismissing allegations that the police were targeting a particular community, Shrivastava said “the arrestees are almost equally distributed among both communities”. “It (police) has arrested 1,571 persons irrespective of their caste or religion. Almost all the accused persons arrested in heinous offences have been remanded to judicial custody by courts of law and not admitted to bail. Chargesheets in many cases have been filed while investigation is continuing in many others,” the Delhi top cop said.Giving details of the FIRs registered in the riots cases, Shrivastava explained 410 cases were registered on the complaints by the minority community. “Police does not differentiate a complainant on the basis of caste or religion, it may be mentioned solely for the purpose of clearing any doubt in the minds of people questioning our probe, that more than 410 FIRs were registered on the complaints of minority community. The other community accounted for over 190 FIRs. The remaining were registered on the basis of (police’s) Daily Diary entries.”In his letter, Ribeiro, who led the Punjab police during the insurgency in the state, also questioned the police interrogating people like DU professor Apoorvanand. “The not-so-subtle attempt by the Delhi Police to entangle true patriots, like Harsh Mander and Prof Apoorvanand, in criminal cases is another matter for concern... Kindly revisit the actions of the police under your command in Delhi to determine if they have been true to their oaths taken at the time of their induction into service,” he said.Apoorvanand had been summoned by the special cell but has not been named in any charge sheet. In the context of criticism of the riots probe by several quarters, including IPS officers and civil society, Shrivastava said, “Several entities who have their reasons to weave a web of deception and to push a false narrative of bias and insensitivity on the part of the police.”“It is best that the criminal justice system, with its inherent checks and balances may be allowed work, lest lending one’s name inadvertently imparts a false aura of credibility and authenticity to these concocted and motivated stories. Also, anybody aggrieved with the investigation can always seek judicial remedies,” the Delhi Police commissioner said.The Delhi top cop said that he valued the suggestions while mentioning that Ribeiro was at the zenith of his career when he had just joined the police service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-discrimination-in-riots-probe-delhi-police-commissioner-replies-to-julio-ribeiro/story-8YDaZz6IpVrlm1N6JIYx4H.html

16-09-2020||India||Forgotten diseases hit poorest billion||Forgotten diseases have hit the poorest billion the hardest during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new Lancet Commission report. It says that for the first time, non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) caused more deaths and disability at every age among the world’s poorest billion than in wealthy countries.These conditions account for over a third of the burden of disease among the poorest, including almost 800,000 deaths annually among those aged under 40 years, and killing more people than HIV, tuberculosis and maternal deaths combined.Among the poorest billion, people with a diverse set of severe NCDs – such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatic and congenital heart disease, and paediatric cancers – live 20 fewer healthy years than in high-income countries. Yet less than $100 million – or just 0.3% of development assistance for health – is allocated to NCDIs among countries that are home to the poorest.Also read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayProgressive implementation of affordable, cost-effective, and equitable NCDI interventions between 2020 and 2030 could save the lives of over 4.6 million of the world’s poorest.“No disease should be a death sentence in one country but treatable, preventable or curable in another. Universal health coverage is unobtainable unless the global health community broadens geographies and conditions covered by action on non-communicable diseases,” said Lancet NCDI Poverty Commission co-chair Ana Mocumbi, from Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and Instituto Nacional de Saúde in Mozambique.“Even before the pandemic started, low-income countries did not have the resources to deliver a truly comprehensive set of public health services,” said Chelsea Clinton, commissioner, Clinton Foundation.Also read: CM hails Delhi’s Covid-19 model, says it worked due to teamworkThe commission has helped to establish National NCDI Poverty Commissions, groups, and consortia in 16 countries that are doing analyses and identifying pro-poor priorities based on the best locally available data. India is one of the 16 countries that have organized these national commissions as of August 2020, according to the report.It says India spends only 1·1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health, putting it at the low end of countries ranked by public investment in health care. Estimates based on local and central government budgets indicate that slightly more than one-fourth of total health expenditure targets NCDIs, and about four-fifths of this expenditure takes place at the state level.“Managing non-communicable diseases is on top of the government agenda... early detection and putting patients on treatment in time is crucial in reducing the overall economic burden in the long run,” said a health ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forgotten-diseases-hit-poorest-billion/story-KjfdklvLtgIhWXnhOktuTL.html
16-09-2020||Editorials||LAC: India lays out its case||In the first official statement in Parliament on the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh laid out India’s case. He provided a quick backdrop of the border conflict, outlined the post-1988 template where the two sides agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity at the border and deepen bilateral relations without necessarily compromising their positions on the dispute itself, chronicled the series of violations of this broad understanding by China over the last five months, and described the current state of negotiations where the onus fundamentally rests on China to disengage. After months of political ambiguity over the exact situation at the border, Mr Singh’s speech came across as a sharp, comprehensive, and effective intervention from the highest levels in government. Three features of India’s position stand out. One, New Delhi is clear that China has amassed troops, it has not adhered to LAC, it has violated border pacts, it has been violent in its conduct, it has attempted transgressions, and it has attempted to change the status quo unilaterally. Two, India considers this unacceptable, it has conveyed its position to China unambiguously, and New Delhi will pursue dialogue and hope for a peaceful resolution of the issue. Three, while relying on talks, India will continue to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Singh pointedly spoke of counter-deployments, friction points and face-offs, including moves at the end of August when India successfully resisted Chinese attempts and gained tactical advantage.There were gaps in the speech too, some of it understandable given the sensitive nature of the situation. Mr Singh refrained from asserting that China was currently in Indian territory — which has drawn criticism. But while more details would have been good, this is also a time when the government needs to be given the benefit of doubt because of the complex nature of the crisis. One way to, however, provide more information is to have a closed door briefing for leaders of other parties, which, as a report in this newspaper suggested on Wednesday, is under consideration. The defence minister did well. The government should now build a national consensus to deal with the challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/lac-india-lays-out-its-case/story-hD05pvRpmHosoEHpB1d2CJ.html
