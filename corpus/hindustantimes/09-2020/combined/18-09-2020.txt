18-09-2020||News||Here is how the Indian economy can rebound||The Indian economy is shrouded in pessimism. Despite dystopian short-term projections, India is on track to emerge as the world’s third largest economy by the end of this decade. The road ahead is long and hard but the math is incontestable. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year ending March 2021 is expected to fall by 10%. India’s GDP of Rs 203 lakh crore in March 2020 will, therefore, decline to Rs 183 lakh crore on March 31, 2021. At an exchange rate of Rs 75 per dollar, India’s GDP in March 2021 will thus be $2.4 trillion. Real GDP growth could rebound to 5% in the year ending March 2022 on a low base. Add inflation at the current level of around 6% and nominal GDP growth (real plus inflation) would surge by 11%. Thus, by March 2022, India’s GDP is likely to rise from $2.4 trillion in March 2021 to just under $2.7 trillion. Now work the math forward. The world’s fourth and fifth largest economies in 2020, Japan ($5.15 trillion) and Germany ($3.86 trillion), are barely growing. That is unlikely to change materially through this decade. In contrast, India’s real GDP growth between 2022 and 2030 could, with structural reforms, realistically average 6% per year with occasional crests and troughs. Along with average annual inflation at 4%, India’s nominal annual GDP growth would trend at around 10%. That translates into a GDP of $5.8 trillion by 2030 at current exchange rates, well ahead of Germany and slightly in front of Japan, assuming their historical rates of growth. There are several hurdles the economy will encounter. First, a fall in the value for the rupee against the dollar, reducing India’s dollar-denominated GDP. Second, tepid export growth, worsening India’s trade deficit. Third, stalled privatisation of listed Public Sector Units (PSUs), robbing them off greater efficiencies. Fourth, a lingering Covid-19 pandemic, stalling the resumption of full economic activity. Fifth, frequent state assembly election cycles, leading to populist policies, not necessarily sensible, reformist economic policies. Despite these caveats, the Indian economy will move forward haltingly but stubbornly. When Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi took office on May 26, 2014, he inherited a broken economy. GDP growth in 2013-14 had plunged to 4.7%. Non-performing assets (NPAs) for banks had risen alarmingly. Worse, they had been hidden in bank balance sheets by evergreening — rolling over bad old loans with new loans. Modi admitted last year that he regrets not publishing a white paper on the state of the economy in 2014. His reasoning at the time was it would send a wrong signal to foreign investors if they were made aware of the full extent of the economy’s distress in mid-2014.It was to prove a near-fatal mistake. Raghuram Rajan, who had been appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India by then finance minister P Chidambaram in September 2013, ordered a review of bad bank loans in 2015. By then it was too late. Humongous NPAs, long hidden, were belatedly recognised in bank balance sheets in 2016. Over the past four years, major bankruptcies in the corporate, banking and financial sector can be traced back to the bad bank loans given without collateral, sometimes on the basis of forged documents, and occasionally after a friendly phone call to a PSU bank chairman from the ministry of finance. While the Modi government inherited a toxic banking sector, it hasn’t covered itself in glory either. It has erred by suspending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for six months till September 25 on account of the pandemic. Momentum has been lost. Wilful defaulters among promoters, cornered by IBC after it came into force in December 2016, now see an escape route. Any delay in prosecuting defaulters can be an unexpected but welcome gift to rogue promoters.The second error by the Modi government is not rationalising Goods and Service Tax (GST) rates. India needs to move swiftly to a single-rate GST — 17%, as suggested at the outset by former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian, despite his later misgivings about it being feasible in India, is a good median rate. Essentials like food can stay at 0% but the “sin” rate of 28% on luxury goods and alcohol needs to go. The third and most serious error by the Modi government is not providing a credible financial stimulus to the economy. It wants the cash-strapped private sector to invest, but won’t invest itself. The government has adopted the role of credit-guarantor instead of credit-giver. With banks reluctant to lend to corporates and non-banking financial companies, the government finds it has precious little to guarantee. Modi’s entreaty to be “vocal about local” should be amended to “vocal about local and global”. To achieve a $6 trillion GDP by 2030, India needs to be not only self-reliant but make the world India-reliant.

To create lasting water security, the State has to actively engage with empowered local communities and innovative markets to enable the improved flexibility, adaptation and resilience that the sector demands.Water projects can be imagined at any scale, but contextual, local responses remain critical. For example, even if you planned to bring water from a faraway river to a city, you would need to understand how that new water will be used, design for excess flow and for sewage to be carried away.For this, you need trained professionals, local leaders and citizen volunteers who understand how local water behaves, both above and below the ground. They must be able to find granular solutions that accommodate upstream and downstream solutions created by others. Over the decades, successive governments have become more and more ambitious about scaling up water infrastructure. The ministry of jal shakti (MoJS) has budgeted ₹30,000 crore for water-related works in this year alone. And the Jal Jeevan Mission hopes to cover all the 145 million unreached rural households with Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTC) by 2024. The Atal Bhujal Yojana aims to improve groundwater management in 8,353 gram panchayats in five years. Tens of thousands of people across the country have been trained for such programmes. Across the country, they may be called bhujal jankars, dhara sevaks, or jal surakshaks. This excludes all the rojgar sahayaks, krishi mitras and swacchata doots who work in allied areas. Yet, if we had to map where all these trained people are, we would be in a fix. Nobody has a comprehensive idea of how effective the training has been either. What has been the impact on the livelihoods of these trainees? How has the knowledge transferred taken root in communities for ongoing problem-solving? There is no system to understand the latent, dispersed knowledge about water. There is a societal memory loss. These millions of skilled workers are hard to discover, but even if we could find them, there would be little trust in their prior knowledge and experience. So each training effort starts afresh, rarely building on the foundations that exist.How can we change this?What if we could “light up” all the people who have already undergone training in a way that programme leaders and also communities know who and where they are; what they already know; and what they have already done? Everybody would then have the ability to seek out exactly the people they need. Equally, trained practitioners would have the agency to access this information for their own purposes.Such discoverable, certifiable water leaders could be critical to create verifiable impact at scale in any water initiative. If done right, we believe that this can contribute to half a million jobs across the country. As we make skilled people more visible, what if we also digitally map and attest resources that they engage with, use and produce? There could be electronic registries of master trainers, teaching modules, water security plans, and water assets such as wells and farm ponds. Capacity-building budgets could then be redirected to fill only the gaps in training. The money saved could be used to pay for services delivered. This would incentivise people to remain in the sector, and both receive and provide value across time. Arghyam has recently funded the deployment of one simple digital attestation service, to begin with, in a few large programmes being implemented in some states together with non-governmental organisations. The pandemic has forced some physical training to go virtual. Interestingly, people are now experiencing the convenience of any time, anywhere, atomised learning sessions with expert trainers. Through this process, the trainees receive a digital attestation that they can own, access and share to leverage new opportunities. Our efforts are aligned with the tech design and the principles behind capacity-building platforms adopted by the government such as Diksha, ECHO and iGot.The early results are promising. Open data sets and a shared digital infrastructure can be very powerful in restoring the agency of samaaj through community institutions, of sarkaar through local government, and of bazaar through new livelihoods for skilled workers. If we have to effectively tackle the current and future pandemics, and collectively address climate-related emergencies, flexibility, adaptation and resilience are not just words. They are critical skills that communities must build quickly. The water sector is a good place to innovate in service of this imperative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-to-leverage-trained-water-professionals/story-6njUEHG9EcsiyjGlMlfFQP.html

HT had first reported on July 26 about the Covid-19 outbreak at the Mankhurd Children’s Home. Recently, 23 residents of Mankhurd Mentally Deficient Children’s Home (MDCH) had also tested positive for Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Covid care centre.Taking cognisance of the matter on a complaint filed by former Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kirit Somaiya, over the poor Covid-19 management at the children’s homes, the commission passed an order stating, “What is disturbing is the fact that no proper explanation has come on record as to how the inmates of the homes got infected, as a vague explanation has been put forth on record by submitting that they might have come in contact with an outsider and got infected. This is somewhat not acceptable as had the management properly implemented the guidelines of GR (government resolution) of April 21, 2020 and June 29, 2020 such mishap could have been avoided.”MA Sayeed, acting chairperson of State Human Rights Commission, on Thursday in an order under section 18 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, recommended the chief secretary of Maharashtra to constitute a committee under the chairmanship of the minister for Women and Child Welfare and Social Justice, with a team of experts, including “persons of outstanding repute and having work in social area to monitor the functioning and management of shelter homes for such children including mentally affected and disabled children throughout the state of Maharashtra, so as to due and proper implementations of government’s rules and guidelines related to management and control of the Covid-19 situation and maintain a strict vigil over the safety of the children.”Somaiya said, “In the order, the commission has expressed its displeasure over the present situation [at the children’s home].”In July-August, 43 specially-abled children and staff at Mankhurd MDCH were tested positive for Covid-19. Recently, 23 residents, including 10 children who had previously recovered from the virus, were also tested positive later. Authorities are still trying to ascertain if the 10 children are infected again or if they are tested ‘false positive’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-outbreak-at-children-s-homes-in-mumbai-human-rights-body-asks-state-to-form-panel-for-better-implementation-of-steps-to-prevent-spread-of-virus/story-Tpk9w0eUPlEJcEiSEqyAzH.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana: Mobile health teams to increase personal visits to home isolated Covid-19 patients||With more than 90% of Covid-19 patients under home isolation, the state government has decided to increase field visits with mobile health teams visiting these patients every alternate day and collecting their basic vitals, such as temperature and oxygen saturation, among other health parameters. For this, a district monitoring team for home isolated patient will be constituted at the district level, according to a notification issued by the Haryana health department on Friday. In the district, out of the 2,755 active cases, 2,503 patients are under home isolation. At least 37 are isolated in Covid care centres, while 215 are hospitalised. On Friday, the district reported 339 new cases. The total count of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has reached 17,063. The Covid-19 toll stands at 156. The monitoring committee, comprising deputy civil surgeon, senior medical officers, along with two to three doctors or medical students, will keep a record of the home isolated patients. Under the committee, each Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) will have a designated mobile health team. It will comprise an assistant medical officer (AMO), an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and an accredited social health activist (ASHA) worker. The field team will also comprise students of Bachelors of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery (BAMS), who will be assigned with the task to call the patient and inquire about their Influenza Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). They will be visiting patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels using the pulse oximeter. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “The new guidelines emphasise on personal visits by mobile health teams. The field team will check the premises of the patient and prepare a log of their vital parameters, such as oxygen level, blood pressure, etc. Teams will also carry medicines, such as immunity boosters.” As per the order, the team will have to visit the patients on the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth days to check the medical condition of the patient. They will look out for worrying symptoms, such as fever, breathlessness, chest pain, congestion, oxygen saturation less than 95%, fits, loss of taste and smell, weakness in the body, blue colouration of lips or face, sweating, etc. Teams will be providing basic medicines like immunity boosters, AYUSH medicines, paracetamols and vitamins. No steroids, antibiotics or allopathic medicines would be given without the prescription of a doctor. The data of all these parameters will be maintained at the UPHC level, which be submitted to the state on a regular basis. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Based on the notification, a district monitoring team will be constituted. ASHAs and ANMs are already doing the home visits. Calls are being made to the patients, enquiring about their daily health condition. Now, more details will be taken into account to ensure that patients, especially those with co-morbidities, get timely diagnosis and shifted to the tertiary care facility, if required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-mobile-health-teams-to-increase-personal-visits-to-home-isolated-covid-19-patients/story-nT8NiUxfa8fl3JpEtakruI.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||Community centre in Begumpur Khatola to house Covid positive prisoners from Bhondsi Jail||With at least 42 inmates at the Bhondsi district jail testing positive for Covid-19 since September 2, the district administration on Friday issued an order, instructing that an isolation ward for prisoners be set up at a community centre in Begumpur Khatola, about 15 kilometres away from the jail premises.Issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, Friday’s order stated, “Keeping in mind the spreading and upsurge of Covid-19, a necessity has arisen to keep and treat the Corona Virus positive prisoners and a proposal for the establishment of an isolation centre/dedicated ward... was under consideration. The task for identifying the suitable accommodation was entrusted to the SDM Gurugram and Superintendent, District Jail. They have reverted with their recommendation that the community centre in Begumpur Khatola is a suitable site (sic).”On September 2, 33 inmates were found to be positive for Covid-19 at Bhondsi jail. Since then, 67 more suspected cases of Covid-19 have been tested, of whom nine were found to have been infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus, thereby denoting a test-positivity rate of 13%. “Two hundred other inmates, who have travelled outside the jail premises recently for medical checkups or court proceedings, are currently in quarantine within the jail. They will all be tested for Covid-19. If found to be positive, we will move them to the government medical facility in Sector 9 for now. Once the community centre is set up, they will be moved there,” said Sanjay Kumar, assistant jail superintendent, adding that 35 of the 42 confirmed positives in Bhondsi so far have already recovered. It was still unclear, however, how many isolation beds will be available for inmates, how many health staffers will be deployed there, or by when the facility will be up and running. Police commissioner, KK Rao, could not be contacted on Friday despite multiple attempts, while Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), did not share any specific details. “We will comply with the deputy commissioner’s order as directed,” he said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Adequate security shall be provided at the isolation centre for Covid positive prisoners in Begumpur Khatola, especially during transportation from the centre and to the district jail and vice versa.”As per Friday’s order, the health department has been asked to provide “an adequate number of medical officers and other medical staff for treatment and examination of prisoners”, and to ensure that “testing of prisoners and submission of reports is done on a priority basis.” Jail authorities, meanwhile, have been asked to depute staff for internal management and maintaining the records of prisoners admitted to the isolation centre. “Bedding, utensils, food and other necessities for prisoners” will also be provided by jail authorities. The sub-divisional magistrate, Badshahpur, has been tasked with ensuring adequate supply of electricity and potable water to the community centre, and to provide two vehicles for the facility. One will function as an ambulance for emergencies, while another will be used to transport food and other necessities for patient inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/community-centre-in-begumpur-khatola-to-house-covid-positive-prisoners-from-bhondsi-jail/story-l6IlE8VXydbbxR1VIdm7vI.html
18-09-2020||City||Gurugram: 20 more warehouses demolished in Sector 94||Gurugram: Continuing its drive against illegal warehouses in Sector 94, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Friday demolished 20 warehouses that had come up without permission from the government. DTCP officials said that a team of the enforcement wing, supported by the Gurugram police, reached the spot around 10am and carried out the demolitions till late evening.During the drive, a number of warehouse owners and local residents also gathered at the spot and allegedly asked the officials to stop the demolition as it would render many people unemployed. “The demolition drive was carried out throughout the day and the remaining structures were demolished. The owners have been clearly told that this area is earmarked as open space in the master plan and no construction is allowed in the area,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram. On Thursday, the enforcement wing had demolished 25 warehouses that were constructed on plots having areas between 500 to 1,500 square yards. The warehouses were rented to different firms for ₹50,000 to ₹1.5 lakh, said the officials. A complaint against these warehouses was lodged by a city-based RTI activist, Raman Sharma, who alleged that illegal warehouses had come up in Sector 94 due to inaction of government agencies. Sharma also said that this sector was notified as an open space and construction was banned as per Gurugram-Manesar Urban Complex Master Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-20-more-warehouses-demolished-in-sector-94/story-7FGiZ5Z9kirLdxfIAZgBaO.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad: Two held from Manipur for running stolen cars’ racket||Faridabad Police busted a gang that procured documents of scrapped vehicles, then bought stolen cars of the same make, and swapped their chassis numbers. These vehicles were then sold with new identities along with original-looking documents in Kolkata and Meghalaya. They arrested two men from Manipur on Thursday and brought them to Faridabad on a transit remand. The police also allegedly recovered drugs worth ₹70,000 from their possession, which were supposed to be delivered to a peddler in Delhi. The suspects have been identified as Muhammad Aksar and Aribam Gunananda of Thoubal in Manipur. The police said Aksar was arrested from his residence, while Gunananda was arrested from a flight, which he had boarded from Imphal international Airport for Kolkata. Adarsh Deep Singh, assistant commissioner of police and public relation officer, said that both the suspects are part of the gang whose kingpin was arrested on September 10 from Faridabad-Delhi border. “They all have a criminal background and are also involved in drug peddling. We are questioning the suspects to know more about their modus operandi and their operations,” he said. Singh said the suspects used to sell stolen vehicles to car dealers for an amount ranging between ₹1 lakh and ₹1.5 lakh. After changing the chassis number of the stolen car with that of the scrapped vehicle, they used to forge documents. The police said the suspects were wanted by Meghalaya and Manipur police forces and were at large for the past one year. On September 10, the police had arrested two men — including a 24-year-old postgraduate posing as an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer — who were allegedly involved in over 200 vehicle thefts from Delhi-NCR. “We have received crucial leads for another suspect in Manipur but the local police are not in favour of conducting a raid at his hideout as it is a very sensitive area and he has political protection as well. We are trying for some other alternative to arrest him,” said ACP Singh. The two men arrested earlier have been identified as Abang Mehtab, who posed as the assistant commissioner of police(ACP) of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and Kabir Khan. The suspects used to visit Delhi-NCR and returned in stolen cars, said police. The police said all four suspects were produced before the court on Friday and were taken on a four-day police remand. The suspects had also made fake doctors’ identity cards to deal in drugs and used to carry a supply for the same, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-two-held-from-manipur-for-running-stolen-cars-racket/story-dCeFICmUnPqfsyZNYIv6BO.html
18-09-2020||City||Govt colleges in Gurugram yet to start online classes||htreporters@hindustantimes.com Gurugram: First and second-year undergraduate and postgraduate students in Gurugram’s government colleges are yet to start with formal online classes for the past three months. This puts them at a disadvantage when compared with other private and government institutes in the state that have begun classes.While the department of higher education had directed colleges to make efforts to start online classes for students from September 15, most colleges are yet to do that. Neelam, MA English student of Government Girl College, Sector 14, said that while classes had been taking place in private colleges and other state universities, they were mired in delays in the city. “We are asked to fill forms seeking details every now and then, but it doesn’t translate into our registration in the next semester. Our exams take place in December. How are we supposed to give exams if classes have not been initiated?” said Neelam who uses only her first name.Srishti Yadav, a second-year BSc student of Government Girls College in Sector 14, said that while a 40-minute session in a subject had taken place earlier this week, there was no regular timetable. “There is no schedule or structure. It’s like a formality,” said Yadav. Colleges said that they were still conducting the promotion process. Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector, said: “We need to promote the students to the next semester. Prior to the promotion, results need to be declared. This can only be achieved once the practical exams are completed, which is expected to be done by the end of this month.” He said that students were in touch with teachers and approached them for guidance, even if intensive classes were not taking place. Principal of Dronacharya Government College, Pooja Khullar, said that they were in the process of promoting students to the second and third years. “We were asked to submit information pertaining to students earlier this week. We have completed the process at our level. Once all processes are complete, we can start classes,” said Khullar. Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, said that some of the colleges had already started classes and others would do soon. “Most colleges have prepared timetables for the initiation of classes and some of them have even started conducting classes. Other colleges are busy with the admission and promotion process. They will be beginning classes shortly, in a week or so,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-colleges-in-gurugram-yet-to-start-online-classes/story-x8EulSNIMaiKoaIA0XVuyK.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: 125 health workers infected with Covid-19 since March, shows data||At least 125 health workers in the district, including accredited social health activist(ASHA) workers, doctors, lab technicians and sanitation staff, have tested positive for Covid-19 since the outbreak began in March, as per information shared by the district health department. Of these, two medical officers are currently in home isolation after testing positive for the virus earlier this week. While 125 cases may seem like a small fraction of Gurugram’s 17,065 reported infections, officials pointed out that they make up over six percent of the health department’s total staff, comprising approximately 2,000 people (including permanent and contractual staff members and outsourced workers). “This shows how susceptible front-line workers are to infection. For a health care worker, the risk of infection is essentially doubled. It also becomes extremely challenging when someone directly involved in the Covid-19 response is put under isolation, as their immediate peer or next in command will have to make up for his or her absence. Someone or the other in the department is usually doing work for another who has tested positive,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram. A medical officer with the health department who had tested positive for Covid-19 in June, requesting anonymity, said, “The real number may be higher because health workers are not being tested across the board. These 125 cases are those who either had primary contact with a Covid-19 patient, or showed mild symptoms. While contact tracing and testing of family members and colleagues happen when a health care worker tests positive, we would find more asymptomatic cases if we increased testing within the department. That would be the best option, if you want to give more protection to health care workers. However, we can’t use all the test kits for ourselves.” Senior officials added that these 125 cases have been recorded across various positions in the health staff. “I cannot give the category wise data offhand, but a more or less equal number of infections have been reported across nursing orderlies, rapid response team members, clerical and administrative staff and field staff,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. Interestingly, he added, most cases within the department are not people who are directly involved in the Covid-19 response, as they are taking proper precautions and have been adequately trained in use of PPE. “We have 67 dedicated Covid-staff of whom less than 10 have tested positive,” Sharma said. Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh, noted, “Health care workers run the risk of occupational exposure and infection from unknown sources in their work surroundings. While a lab technician collecting samples at a primary health centre may be better protected, a sanitation worker working without PPE in the same vicinity may face a higher chance of infection. And with the spread of the virus picking up within the community, health care workers in OPDs and flu clinics are also at an elevated risk of getting Covid-19.” These 125 cases, however, do not include infected healthworkers in the private sector. Spokespersons of at least five private hospitals on Friday declined to reveal any data in this regard, though two of them confirmed that cases of health care workers being infected have been, and continue to be, reported. A spokesperson of a private hospital in Sector 44, said, requesting anonymity, “I am not at liberty to provide data, but I can confirm that most Covid-19 cases within the staff have been reported not from Covid-19 wards but from other departments. Cases are also high among general housekeeping staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-125-health-workers-infected-with-covid-19-since-march-shows-data/story-twx7NP0KVcuLrxevqvAJeL.html
18-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Banks, financial institutions to be treated as promoters of realty projects in case of takeover, rules H-Rera||Gurugram: In an important decision, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera), Gurugram, on Friday said that banks and other financial institutions that take over real estate projects due to non-payment of loans by developers would be treated as promoters. The authority also held that the interests of the homebuyers who have invested in such projects should not be considered subservient to that of other stakeholders. The decision was taken by the real estate regulator after hearing a petition filed by a homebuyer who had bought an apartment in Supertech Hues project and approached the authority against the takeover and e-auction of the project by PNB Housing Finance Ltd (PNBHFL). “A bank or financial institution, which takes over a real estate project, will be treated as an assignee of a promoter and the institution will have to secure the interest of the homebuyers. In a number of cases, it has emerged that developers mortgage the project land, structure and receivables to get bank loans. But when this money is not paid back, the banks take over these projects and directly auction these properties by invoking the Sarfaesi Act, 2002. The result of these actions is that large investments made by homebuyers are not acknowledged,” said KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, Gurugram.The authority also held that in case a developer fails to repay loans to a financial institution and if this institution intends to auction the mortgaged property, then it would have to seek prior written approval from H-Rera. “If the financial institution/lender subsequently wants to auction or sell the defaulting project to a third party, then they would have to seek permission from H-Rera. These steps are being taken to ensure that hard earned money invested by allottees and their interests are safeguarded in such deals,” said Khandelwal. Subsequently, if the financial institutions/banks/creditors intend to transfer the real estate project to any third party to realize their loan amounts, then in that situation too such financial institutions, who are promoters for the limited purpose of mediating the transfer of property, shall also seek prior written approval of the authority, the H-Rera chairman said. In the case of Supertech Hues project, H-Rera said that Supertech was neither licensee nor collaborator but taken loan from PNBHFL and the developer failed to repay it. The financier put the project on e-auction, but the authority stayed the process on the petition of a homebuyer as it held that interests of 950 homebuyers could be jeopardised by this action. The authority also clarified by this judgement that the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (Sarfaesi) Act, 2002 has to be read harmoniously with the Rera Act, 2016. “If it is found that any lending financial institution engages in auctioning the real estate projects without the approval of the Authority, the same shall be deemed seriously and penal proceedings shall be initiated against the debtor promoter and the lending institutions/individuals,” the authority said.When asked about the matter, Venket Rao, counsel for PNB Housing Finance, said that holding a financial institution as a promoter is not contemplated in H-Rera Act and the authority in this matter has gone beyond its reach. “This decision will impact the flow of credit to the real estate sector, and the banks in any case are not stripping the rights of license holders and buyers. This is definitely an appealable matter,” he said. However, the developer in the case has welcomed the ruling of H-Rera. RK Arora, chairman and managing director of Supertech, said that banks and financial institutions need to support the stressed promoters and in the matter of Supertech Hues, the e-auction was not the right thing to do. “Supertech is committed to complete the project and deliver it to homebuyers. The decision of H-Rera is a step in the right direction and we have already started work on the project,” said Arora.

18-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Residents in DLF Phase-1 complain of frequent power outages, threaten to protest outside DHBVN office||Residents of DLF Phase-1 have complained that they are being forced to live without electricity for more than four hours every day for the past three months. The residents also complain that the voltage remains low for most of the time. Despite multiple calls to the staff of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), no relief has been provided so far, they said. Residents of five Blocks of DLF Phase-1 — A to E — said on Friday that they are gearing up to protest in front of the DHBVN’s office on Monday if the discom fails to come up with a permanent solution. “Since people are working from home, frequent power cuts are causing disruption in zoom meetings and submission of office projects. Online classes for children are also being disrupted. With the midterm examinations being currently underway, teachers are refusing to accept power failure as an excuse for not appearing for online classes,” said Sangeeta Mahajan, a resident of Block E of DLF Phase-1. The residents have been complaining of acute voltage fluctuations for the last one month. They said frequent voltage fluctuations have even damaged home appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners and television sets. Motor pumps for drawing water also do not function properly at a low voltage. Residents said several houses in the area are being used as paying guest accommodations, which increase overall consumption, leading to power fluctuations. They said fluctuations happen due to overload but it is the DHBVN’s responsibility to install additional transformers and fix the problem at the earliest. “We were told that a new project of putting 11kV lines underground, installation of supervisory control and data acquisition system (Scada) with new metres will strengthen the low-tension wire system of the area. We do not know the status of the project and things are only getting worse,” said Mukul Swaroop a resident of Block C. Another resident of Block E said underground wires often gets damaged at the slightest spell of rain, or overhead cables rupture due to falling of trees during heavy rains. “On some occasions, transformers have exploded or the conductor has been damaged. The Wi-Fi does not work without electricity, and this results in serious work-related issues,” said Sunil Goswami of Block E. Residents are alleging that the transformers are old and often get burnt leading to the frequent power outages. The old cables and transformers need to be replaced with new ones. We were told two years ago that we would get round-the-clock electricity but the situation has only worsened over the last one year. RS Rathee, councillor of Ward 34, alleged that it is been three months that electricity has been erratic in the area. “The DHBVN officials do not respond to complaints nor have they fixed the problem. We are setting up a camp on Monday where we have called the sub-divisional officer, junior engineer, and executive engineer of DHBVN to listen to the grievances of the residents. If the demand is not met, we shall protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office,” he said. DHBVN officials, when asked about the matter, refuted the allegations and said that they respond to the complaints when they are made and that their lineman visit the spot when required. DHBVN’s superintending engineer, Joginder Singh Hooda, said that they have not received any complaints on their toll-free number, 1800-180-4334, from DLF Phase-1, nor is he aware of any major power outages in the area. “Residents should contact us at 1912 or 1800-180-4334 numbers to lodge complaints. A lineman will be sent within half an hour to solve the problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-residents-in-dlf-phase-1-complain-of-frequent-power-outages-threaten-to-protest-outside-dhbvn-office/story-JAIsEBNbItgqrl3Xb1eItM.html

The police said the accused men are yet to be identified. According to the police, the incident took place around 8am, when the victim, Deshraj, a native of Bharatpur, Rajasthan, was on his way to the gas agency’s office in Sector 9. In the police complaint, he said, “I had left from a warehouse in Wazirpur around 7.30am in a truck. I was carrying a cylinder and some cash, which I had kept in a sack. At 8am, as I reached near Dwarka Expressway, a car came in front of my truck and blocked the way.” “Before I could react, two men, whose faces were covered, alighted from the car and climbed on to the truck from the co-driver’s side. They pushed me and snatched the sack, which had ₹95,133 cash. They assaulted me and escaped. I could not note down the number of the car as I was in a state of shock,” said Deshraj. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “We are checking CCTVs in the area to trace the suspects. The modus operandi suggests that the suspects were aware that the victim routinely carries cash from the gas agency and had conducted a recce. We are probing if it was an inside job.” A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 379 A (punishment for snatching) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 10 A police station, said the police. In another incident on Thursday, two motorcycle-borne men allegedly snatched a woman’s gold chain near the flyover at Rajiv Chowk. The police said the incident took place around 12.15pm, when the woman, identified as Anita Kumar, a resident of Indira Colony, was on her way to the district court near Rajiv Chowk on her scooter. In the FIR, she said, “As I crossed the chowk, two men, who were on a motorcycle, suddenly snatched my chain. I tried chasing them on my scooter, but could not note down the registration number of the motorcycle.” A case was registered against the accused under sections 379 A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) of Shivaji Nagar police station, said the police. According to the police, till August 31, at least 126 snatchings have been reported in the city this year as compared to 308 in 2019. The period includes 68 days of the lockdown, during which only three such cases were reported.

18-09-2020||Noida||Spl task force arrests four who used forged papers to obtain 32 credit cards||The Noida special task force (Noida STF) on Friday arrested four suspects allegedly involved procuring credit cards using forged documents. Officers said the gang allegedly used the credit cards to their limit and then dumped the cards. The suspects were identified as Jitendra Gulati, Triloki Nath, Kapoor Singh, residents of Rohini; and Kuldeep Singh, a resident of Jahangirpuri in Delhi. Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida STF, said that on September 11, Shailendra Kumar, the manager of a private bank, had filed a complaint at the Sector 20 police station alleging credit card fraud.The manager had informed police that a customer of the bank had informed them that though he had never availed of the credit card facility, a credit amount was reflecting in his account. The bank conducted an internal inquiry and found that the suspects had allegedly got at least 32 such credit cards using forged documents. A complaint was filed to the Uttar Pradesh STF in this regard. Sector 20 police registered a case against unknown suspects under Section 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), Section 468 (forgery), and Section 420 (cheating) of IPC.Mishra said that the STF team on Friday received information about suspects’ movement near Film City on Friday. “The police stopped a Maruti Swift Dzire in which the four suspects were travelling. During checking, police seized ₹6.23 lakh cash, seven gold biscuits weighing 44 grams, 16 swipe machines, six credit cards, nine debit cards, eight PAN cards, eight Aadhar cards, one voter ID, and three mobile phones from their possession,” he said. The police seized the car as well as a Nissan Terrano from their hideout in Delhi. Officers said during interrogation, Gulati allegedly revealed that he worked as a property dealer in Delhi where he came in contact with the three others. “They used to forge documents and get credit cards from different banks. A person named Mukesh Juneja helped them in this racket,” Mishra said. The suspects used to pretend to be employees of a leading IT firm in Noida and easily convince the credit card vendors to issue the cards. The complainant informed STF that the gang had allegedly spent about ₹1.5 crore in the last one year via credit cards.Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida STF, said the gang was allegedly also involved in hawala transactions. He said initially, the gang allegedly used the credit cards for shopping. “However later, they got to know that shopping may land them in trouble as their images would be captured in CCTV cameras. They then roped in the fifth suspect – Juneja – who deals in hawala transactions,” he said. Mishra said Juneja allegedly used to use these cards on his swipe machines and transfer the amount in his own bank account on a commission of 3-5% . “Juneja used to give them cash after the transaction,” Mishra said. Officials said the gang had been active since 2011. Police said Gulati has been arrested twice by the Delhi Police in the past. “We have seized valuables worth ₹40 lakh and also identified two apartments worth₹60 lakh purchased with illegal money. We have also freezed ₹18 lakh in their bank accounts,” Mishra said.The four persons were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.

18-09-2020||Mumbai||26 lakh contacts of Covid-19 patients traced in city so far, says Mumbai civic body||To control the spread of Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has traced over 26 lakh high- and low-risk contacts of positive cases in the past six months, since the first case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on March 11. As of Thursday, the number of cases reported in the city was 178,385 and deaths 8,323. The cases are expected to touch the 2-lakh mark in the coming days. According to BMC, of the total cases detected in six months, 70% are index cases, indicating they came in contact with an infected person. High-risk contacts are immediate family members or people with whom the patient lives. They are also those who have interacted or been together with the patient for over 15 minutes in a closed environment. Low-risk contacts are those who come in contact for less than 15 minutes. This includes neighbours of the patient, shopkeepers or vendors the patient visited before testing positive. As of September 15, BMC had traced 26.27 lakh close contacts, of which 9.85 lakh were high-risk and 16.41 lakh were low-risk. Over 22.92 lakh citizens have been quarantined in the past six months and over 3.32 lakh citizens are currently in home quarantine. BMC says maximum contact-tracing took place in the past three months. By June 9, the civic body had traced around nine lakh close contacts that went up to 15 lakh in the first week of July, followed by 21 lakh in mid-August and crossing 26 lakh mid-September. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of BMC, said, “Our tracing has increased in the past three months owing to several drives and programmes launched to aggressively trace maximum citizens. Due to this, our ratio of close contacts being traced behind every positive case has also increased. Tracing aggressively has helped control the number of cases.” Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner of BMC, said, “Contact tracing has been an important tool that helped us control the spread, and around 70% of the cases are index cases, which means they are close contacts of someone who tested positive earlier. We are constantly tracing close contacts of those testing positive. Citizens should also take all precautions, including maintaining hand and general hygiene, wearing mask and social distancing.” On an average, the ratio of close contacts being quarantined behind every positive case is between 1:2 and 1:12 in different wards. The ratio of close contacts being quarantined is 1:12 at M West ward of BMC covering Chembur. While on the other hand, the ratio of close contacts being quarantined in slums is 1:13, on an average, but in areas like Kurla, Colaba, Churchgate, Worli, the ratio is between 1:16 and 1:20, data reveals. Meanwhile, BMC has also conducted screening of over 10 lakh senior citizens in the past six months. In the next two months, the civic body also plans to cover over 40 lakh households, as part of the state government’s initiative, My Family, My Responsibility, to educate citizens on how to live with Covid-19. Overall, 9.50 lakh tests have been conducted and positivity rate is 18.26%. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant, said, “Contact-tracing becomes very important when it comes to detection of new cases. However, there needs to be an upgrade in the definition of high- or low-risk contacts, with the unlocking. The type of contact will change and vary in unlocked city when compared with the lockdown period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/26-lakh-contacts-of-covid-19-patients-traced-in-city-so-far-says-mumbai-civic-body/story-fxhhbEE4JB0SZMOR5nHXjI.html
18-09-2020||Noida||Sanitation staff seek permanent jobs, protest outside Noida authority office; 6 arrested||A group of sanitation workers on Friday demonstrated outside the Noida Authority’s office demanding regularisation of their jobs. They also allegedly scattered garbage onto the road and created a ruckus, after which the police were called. Six persons were arrested; police used lathis to disperse the crowd.The workers, under the banner of Akhil Bhartiya Safai Mazdoor Congress, gathered outside the authority’s office at 10am. “We have been protesting at the Authority’s office for three days. We have been working as sanitation workers for over 10 years. We get ₹11,000 per month and have no other benefits. We have been demanding that the Authority regularise our jobs and end the practise of contractual work. However, our grievances have not been addressed and hence we are protesting,” said Sunil Chauhan, one of the workers. The sanitation workers have also demanded a hike in salary as well as an annual bonus. R K Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station, confirmed that the sanitation workers had gathered outside the authority’s office and littered the garbage. “They had blocked the road and created problems for the commuters. A group of sanitation workers were also on a hunger strike and their health had started deteriorating. A gathering in the times of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is prohibited in Noida. We arrested six persons and sent them to judicial custody after producing them before a magistrate,” he said. The arrested persons were identified as Bablu Parcha, Ravindra Diwan, Sachin, Vikas, Sonu, and Sanjay. They were arrested under Section 151 (knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse) of IPC. The Authority, on the other hand, said a group of contractual workers were not willing to mark their attendance through the mobile application which was recently introduced.Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida Authority, said the Authority has always been open for discussion with sanitation workers. “They have some demands which can’t be fulfilled at our level. The demand of regularisation will be decided at the government level. Some people have misguided the sanitation workers that their jobs can be directly regularised,” he said. He said that there are about 3,000 contractual workers, out of which 2,400 have joined duties so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sanitation-staff-seek-permanent-jobs-protest-outside-noida-authority-office-6-arrested/story-bHvmR6Wg5fLZjRFDjyebdK.html

The University has made 450 cameras operational for now while the rest will be made operational once the varsity reopens, officials said.P K Gupta, Chancellor, Sharda University, said the high quality cameras will ensure transparency and improve efficiency in work. “The cameras will keep an eye on the movement of people in the hospital and the varsity. We have installed five big screens to monitor the footage on a real-time basis. The command centre will monitor camera footage 24X7. The systems will be headed by a technical team of IT service personnel. We have deployed 12 security officers to monitor the system in three shifts,” he said.The system is equipped with good quality audio and visual recorder, said Ajit Kumar, joint registrar and public relations officer of the varsity, adding that zoom cameras have been installed on the campus, including the activity hall, gallery, hospital building and different entry and exit gates, among others.“Visuals from normal cameras are not good in quality as the images are not clear. We have installed high quality zoom cameras in the hospital building and different departments of the university. Cameras have also been placed to capture the road outside the university and hospital. The visuals will help the administration and the police in case of need,” he said. Kumar said that about 300 cameras have been dotted in the Sharda Hospital, which is also a covid facility for the district. “There was also an incident in the past in which the kin of a Covid-19 patient alleged negligence. We have now placed cameras at different spots to record digital evidence which will be used if needed,” Kumar said.The hospital has handed over a 600-bed facility, with 40-bed ICU beds, to the district administration for treatment of coronavirus patients. The hospital has since March treated 1,400 Covid-19 patients while 175 patients are currently lodged at the hospital.On September 2, the hospital also set up a 20-bed private economic ward for Covid-19 patients. This facility is air-conditioned and equipped with modern equipment and ICU, and trained medical staff. The facility costs ₹5,000 per patient per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sharda-university-equips-its-covid-19-hospital-campus-with-1-200-zoom-cameras/story-92Ge9Fudk3EmVkUVzPzZQO.html
18-09-2020||City||Almost all ICU beds taken, Ghaziabad refers patients to Delhi||Concerned by the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district, the Ghaziabad health department is now scouting for more ICU beds and has also started referring critical patients to Delhi in order to avoid fatalities. The district, according to state control room figures for September 17, has a total of 11,831 Covid-19 cases and 3,542 of them were reported since September 1. Officials said with the rise in number of Covid cases, the occupancy in hospitals has also gone up and almost 80% of ICU beds -- 37 in government hospitals and 98 in private hospitals -- are taken. As a result, officials have now started referring critical patients to Delhi and are also trying to arrange more ICU beds in the city. “We have about 5% patients who come with severe symptoms and need ICU beds. Since these beds are not easily available, we have started referring critical patients to Delhi. This week, we referred 10 patients to Delhi and if patients are able to find ICU beds at private hospitals in Noida, they will be referred to those hospitals as well. On our part, we are trying to arrange more ICU beds. We have two new private hospitals which have 100 beds each and together, they have 60 ICU beds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “We are trying to get clearances for the two hospitals as soon as possible, but we estimate that the two will be ready only in another 20-25 days. Until then, we will refer critical patients to Delhi. We do not prefer that our patients go to Meerut as the number of fatalities there is high,” he said. According to official figures, of the 74 deaths recorded in Ghaziabad, 33 took place in Ghaziabad itself while 37 happened in Meerut, besides two each at Delhi and Noida hospitals. The officials are also concerned as cases which are coming in these days are showing severe symptoms. “The severity of symptoms has gone up in cases reported over the past two weeks or so. So, they need L2 or L3 category ( L2 deals with severe and L3 with critical patients) hospitals for treatment. Since fatalities in the higher age group is already high, we are focussing on immediate referral and treatment of aged patients,” Gupta said. According to the health department, the number of fatalities in the age group of 0-9 years is zero while the highest number of fatalities is in the age group of 60 years and above. They account for 27 deaths or 36.49% of all deaths since March. The second highest number of deaths is in the age group of 50-59 years which account for 22.97% of all Covid deaths in the district so far. The third highest group is of those aged 40-49 years, which accounts for 21.62% of the total fatalities. “The age groups of 20-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-49 years have the most number of cases in Ghaziabad. But the fatalities rates in these groups are low. This is because senior citizens tend to have low immunity and several co-morbid conditions that the young often don’t have,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, nodal officer (Covid), state health department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/almost-all-icu-beds-taken-ghaziabad-refers-patients-to-delhi/story-7jVKh5qNSOyduvsXleRX4I.html
18-09-2020||City||Demanding enhanced land compensation, farmers disrupt work on Delhi-Meerut Expressway||The officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said Friday that farmers have been disrupting work on the Delhi- Meerut Expressway for demanding a hiked compensation for their land that was acquired for the expressway project. NHAI officials said the farmers’ stir partially affected work on Phase 4 -- 23km stretch from Dasna to Meerut -- of the expressway on Thursday while it completely hampered the work on Friday as farmers arrived at the work site in their tractor-trolleys, motorcycles and other vehicles. The DME has been planned in four phases as a high-speed access-controlled expressway to connect Delhi and Meerut. “Work was disrupted in different patches of Phase 4 and primarily at Moradabad village near Bhojpur. Farmers did not allow the movement of our trucks carrying earth for filling and other allied works. The disruptions were partial on Thursday while it was almost complete on Friday,” Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI, said. During their protest at Govindpuram grain market in Ghaziabad on September 16, farmers had demanded more land compensation, at the rate of ₹8,500 per square metre (sqm), the same as the rate paid to farmers of Dasna village. “In our village, different land owners have received compensation ranging from ₹2,500 per sqm to ₹6,500 per sqm. We demand that all farmers be given land compensation at the same rate as it was given to Dasna farmers. The rate of compensation should be the same for all,” Mukesh Pradhan, former chief of Moradabad village, said. “Until that happens, we will continue our protest at the construction site and will not allow the expressway work to proceed,” he said. The farmers have also demanded an increase in the length of service road alongside the expressway for better connectivity to their farmlands and nearby villages. According to NHAI officials, the farmers under the DME project have been paid land compensation of about ₹60 crore per kilometre as opposed to ₹40 crore per kilometre given to farmers whose land was acquired for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The Phase 4 of DME is presently 74% complete and is expected to be ready by the end of 2020. “Farmers are camping at the site but we have deployed a police force to ensure that there is no law and order situation. Their protest has remained peaceful until now. We will ensure that the DME work is not hampered,” Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural), said. The district officials said they are reviewing the demands of farmers and have also referred some cases to the state administration for its consideration. “During the previous meeting with farmers, we assured them of a solution soon. We will speak to farmers again and urge them not to disrupt the DME work as it is a public utility project,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said. The work on Phase 2, a 19.2km stretch from UP Gate to Dasna, is also underway and likely to be over by December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demanding-enhanced-land-compensation-farmers-disrupt-work-on-delhi-meerut-expressway/story-7xkYuVCiBjtqSd5DnrkvJN.html
18-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants pre-arrest bail to 2 Navy officers accused in ₹6.76-crore fraud||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday granted interim protection from arrest to two Indian Navy officers who were booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in July for allegedly generating fraudulent bills of ₹6.76 crore for supplying IT hardware to Western Naval Command. The two officers — Captain Atul Kulkarni and Commander Raj Pal Sharma — informed the HC that as another accused had been granted pre-arrest bail by the special CBI court in August, on grounds of parity they too should be granted the same, which the court accepted. The single judge bench of Justice Sarang Kotwal while hearing the anticipatory bail pleas filed by Kulkarni and Sharma was informed that in July, CBI had booked four Navy officers including Kulkarni, Sharma, Commander Mandar Godbole and Petty Officer Kuldip Singh Baghel along with 14 others for allegedly generating fake bills. In the complaint, it was stated that between January and March 2016, four officers had raised fraudulent and forged bills of IT hardware supplies to the Western Naval Command however, none of the supplies had reached the headquarters. Thereafter another five persons from the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Navy), the department that carries out auditing of bills, and other private individuals and companies were also booked in the case.Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavle for Kulkarni said his client was Command Logistics Officer for entire Western Command, while Sharma was his subordinate. He submitted that Petty Officer Kuldeep Singh Baghel, who was given access to their ID and password in good faith, had misused the same. After the applicants realised the fraud, they were the first to raise an alarm and alerted the authorities of the same. Ganbavle further submitted that as a special CBI court had granted pre-arrest bail to one of the accused, Commander Mandar Godbole, on the grounds of parity, the applicants should also be granted protection from arrest. However, advocate Poornima Kantharia appearing for the anti-Corruption bureau (ACB) of CBI opposed the applications and sought time to take instructions to verify material on record and respond.After hearing the submissions, the bench restrained CBI from taking coercive steps against the applicants until further orders and directed it to file an affidavit in reply to the plea within a week and posted further hearing to October 7. The court also asked applicants to remain present before the investigating agency to cooperate with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-2-navy-officers-accused-in-6-76-crore-fraud/story-WPt49k0lWiHaPHrTLzZZWK.html
18-09-2020||Noida||State pollution watchdog recommends preventive measures ahead of smog season||Ahead of October when the pollution levels see a steep rise in the city, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution control board (UPPCB) has recommended several pre-emptive pollution control measures to the Noida Authority.Officials of the pollution control board held an inspection at multiple areas of Greater Noida earlier this week, during which they found several dust -generating sources. City-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad was also present during the inspection.The Greater Noida wing of UPPCB also pointed out eleven such areas where civil work was being carried on without dust controlling measures and thus recommended the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) to take pre-emptive measures to curb pollution.“Every year, we observe a spike in air pollution levels from October. That’s why it is important to take pre-emptive measures to control some of the major sources of pollution before weather conditions worsen and air pollution spikes. We had inspected a number of areas in Greater Noida and found that there were several points where dust was being generated due to civil construction. From October onwards, temperatures drop and the air quality also deteriorates, while dust from roads and construction works worsens it. We have made a recommendation of eleven such areas for the Greater Noida authority to take dust control measures at,” said Archana Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida.According to Tongad, “There are roads under repair, new constructions being done and pipes being laid, with negligible dust control measures. For now, since the temperatures are higher, the air quality is better. However, once the winter sets in, the entire region of Greater Noida West will become unlivable if proper measures are not taken.”Areas recommended by UPPCB include heavy dust on the road connecting Char Murti in Greater Noida West towards Vijay Nagar road to Ek Murti and Yamaha Road; various sectors in Greater Noida West including sectors 16, 16B, 16C, 4, 2, 1, Tech Zone 4, Gaur City one and two; Sapphire Plaza to Gaur Mall in Gaur City; Ek Murti to Supertech Eco Village 2 (Sector 1), among others.“All inner roads in Gaur City were either broken or unpaved, leading to excessive dust. Please take dust control measures and initiate mechanise sweeping soon,” read the UPPCB letter addressed to the Greater Noida Authority.Going by records, the air quality index (AQI) starts dropping from ‘moderate’ category in September to ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ by October.“The air quality starts to deteriorate from October, mostly due to weather conditions and stubble burning in neighbouring states that starts from September-end. The dust leads to larger suspended particles in the air while smoke leads to smaller particles or pollutants, both of which are harmful,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air quality, centre for science and environment (CSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/state-pollution-watchdog-recommends-preventive-measures-ahead-of-smog-season/story-79AZFb8nB07xUGchYcGE6H.html
18-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to start on-field interaction with farmers to resolve issues||Days after launching an initiative to connect farmers with more than 1,300 value chains, the Maharashtra government on Friday decided to start direct interaction with the agrarian community to identify their issues and resolve them. Under the initiative, the state agriculture minister, department secretary and other officials will have to go on field and interact with farmers. The decision was taken following the directives of agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, officials said.The order issued by the agriculture department states, “The minister and all the concerned officials will go on field, talk about the issues they [farmers] are facing and resolve them. The cabinet minister, minister of state, agriculture secretary, agriculture commissioner and scientists from agriculture universities will be making field visits once in 15 days.”“The director, divisional agriculture joint director will visit once a week, superintendent and agriculture officers will visit twice a week and junior officials will have to go on field three days a week,” it states.Eknath Dawale, agriculture secretary, said he and the agriculture minister have already started field visits and have now directed all officials to follow suit.“These field visits will be in addition to the regular inspection work from the agriculture department. Having dialogue and resolving issues is one part, another part is to understand what exactly is going on in the field. Sometimes, the problem doesn’t reflect on paper. For instance, we will be able to get first-hand information on crop condition. The exercise will help us identify and understand difficulties so that efforts can be made to solve them in due course of time,” Dawale said.Last week, the agriculture secretary visited Nagpur, Wardha, Washim and Buldhana districts.On September 10, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray launched a new initiative ‘Vikel Te Pikel’ (sow that sells) to connect farmers across the state with more than 1,370 value chains. The system will enable farmers to grow crops based on the demand of end-consumers while the established supply chains will guarantee the sale of their produce at competitive rates. This will also help farmers to minimise post-harvest loss of crops as produce can be stored properly and sold without delay, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-start-on-field-interaction-with-farmers-to-resolve-issues/story-UwqEoEfrhlN4d7Ygm49yBJ.html
18-09-2020||City||UP pollution watchdog outlines ‘winter action plan’ for Ghaziabad||With the winter season barely two months away, Ghaziabad authorities are gearing up to tackle air pollution and have prepared a ‘winter action plan’ for it. The district, in past years, has seen alarming levels of pollution and topped the list of most polluted cities across the country several times. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) have outlined a framework in the plan to tackle different sources of pollution which includes dust emission, industrial and vehicular emission, waste burning and dealing with construction and demolition waste, among others.“The plan has been prepared and all probable measures to deal with pollution are being put in place. These include installing anti-smog guns at projects measuring more than 20,000 square metres (sqm), geo-tagging prominent waste and plastic disposal sites, formation of quick response teams to deal with complaints, and installation of PTZ cameras at construction and industrial sites, among others,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB.He said the different agencies operating in Ghaziabad have also been asked to conduct workshops for their contractors about pollution abatement plans and also inform them that they may be blacklisted in case they do not follow norms.“The processes which are to be taken up under the plan have been defined beforehand and all concerned agencies are also required to take up respective measures for pollution abatement,” Sharma added.Due to high pollution levels, Ghaziabad is also identified in a list of 15 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh which have high levels of air pollution.According to UPPCB figures, the city in 2019 recorded 31 days of ‘severe’ category pollution of the air quality index (AQI). It had another 67 days of ‘very poor’ category AQI, and 112 days ‘poor’ category pollution. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. Last year, only the months of August and September saw any let up in high pollution levels when AQI did not exceed 200 or ‘moderate’ category.The data reveals that from January to August this year, the average AQI was 163.68, which is significantly lower when compared to the average AQI of 224.42 for the same period in 2019. “The primary reason for better AQI in recent months is due to heavy rainfall and also that most of the construction work for the Delhi Meerut Expressway project has been completed, due to which there has been no major instances of dust pollution,” Sharma added.The records further indicate that average particulate matter (PM)2.5 levels were 76.34 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) in the first eight months of 2020, while the average was 100.66μg/m3 during the same period in 2019.Likewise, average PM10 levels were 149.75μg/m3 during the first eight months of 2020 as against an average of 236.66μg/m3 during the same period in 2019.The standard limit for PM2.5 is 60μg/m3 and 100μg/m3 for PM10. Environment activists, however, said there have been little efforts on ground despite plans being made year after year. “It is only when winter season approaches that different plans are prepared to tackle pollution, while there is hardly any focus round the year. Dust pollution has been a perpetual problem in Ghaziabad but there is hardly any green paving along the roads to reduce it. Although UPPCB has prepared the plan, their officials must assume responsibility if it fails,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer.Others said that city planners have yet again failed to bring in desired projects.“The project of bringing in e-buses has been pending for a long and has not been implemented this year too, while the number of vehicles is growing at a fast pace. Traffic regulation is a major issue in the city but the integrated traffic management plan is yet to take off. There is an urgent need to develop mini forests but officials are not inclined to develop these,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of apartment owners’ federation.“It is time that anyone who aids polluting activities be severely penalised and heavy environmental compensation costs be levied,” he added.

18-09-2020||Mumbai||Dubai calls off all Air India Express flights, revokes it later||Hours after the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) suspended Air India Express flights between India and Dubai, the biggest city in the United Arab Emirates, from Friday to October 2, the ban was withdrawn in the evening. The flights were suspension notice was issued after a passenger on a recent Jaipur-Dubai flight operated by Air India Express, the low-cost airline of national carrier Air India, was found to be Covid-19 positive by DCAA authorities. This was the second time the airline flew an infected passenger.The suspension notice had stated that the flight IX1135 operated by the airline from Jaipur to Dubai International Airport (DIA) had a passenger who had contracted Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. “You are aware of our previous intimation made to you by our letter dated September 2 for boarding a passenger with a Covid-19 positive test result, who endangered the other passengers on board and also caused a serious health risk. Boarding a passenger with Covid-19 positive test result for the second time is contrary to and is in violation of the laid-down procedures and protocols relating to air travel to and from airports in the Emirate of Dubai during the pandemic,” stated the notice.While Air India Express had submitted an apology to DCAA before getting the notice, the airline and the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) held discussion with Dubai authorities in the matter, following which the suspension order was lifted. Though Air India Express did not issue a fresh statement, its tweet read, “All Air India Express flights from/to Dubai will operate as per original schedule w.e.f tomorrow, September 19, 2020.” Airline officials said the airline is playing a key role in flying repatriation flights between India and Dubai and operates around 15 daily flights between the two countries. The airline has apologised for the erroneous acceptance of Covid-19 positive passenger by the airline’s ground handling agents on Air India Express flights to Dubai on August 28 and September 4.Aviation expert and former defence pilot Vipul Saxena said, “Though MoCA through diplomatic channel managed to revoke the UAE ban on Air India Express to fly to Dubai, at the same time MoCA must also review the recent order which virtually allows every international passenger to board from last foreign destination without having done RT-PCR 96 hours before boarding. After seeing strict actions by other countries, I hope MoCA reviews its recent order and allows passenger to fly without RT-PCR only under unavoidable circumstances and also treat them on board as infected patients, in terms of seating separately and also serve inflight service by exclusive crew, so that other healthy passengers aren’t risked.”With the rules for international arrivals relaxed in India, passengers are allowed to get themselves tested for Covid-19 once they land at Indian entry airport where testing facility is made available in case the passenger did not get tested within 96 hours before departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dubai-calls-off-all-air-india-express-flights-revokes-it-later/story-YyERACeP19kYVMxcvUAbJO.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Horse electrocuted to death in Nizamuddin, locals say overflowing sewage conducted power from transformer nearby||A horse died, possibly of electrocution, in South Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti while accompanying its owner who was in the neighbourhood on Friday afternoon to buy fodder for the animal, the police said. While police said the circumstances of the death remain unclear, locals claimed that overflowing sewage helped conduct electricity from a transformer nearby to the spot where the horse was standing, thereby electrocuting the animal. “We have kept the horse’s body for an autopsy. We are seeking legal opinion on the case and will register a first information report (FIR) if there is evidence of negligence,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). To begin with, the police have requested a team from the power discom BSES to visit the spot and verify if there were any lapses in the supply network, the DCP said. Social media users sharing videos and images of the dead horse alleged that overflowing sewage carried the electricity from a transformer nearby and led to the electrocution of the animal. Videos showed small pools of water around the dead horse. SM Umar, president, Nizamuddin West residents’ welfare association, , said his association has repeatedly complained about the choked sewer line because of which dirty water keeps overflowing into the lanes and acts as a conductor of electricity from all the loose wiring in the area. He said this was perfect recipe for danger, especially for passersby. “This is so unfortunate that a horse was killed because of the sheer apathy of civic agencies. This is also scary because there are several government schools in the same lane and children were at risk. The government agencies must wake up to the problem and address it on an urgent basis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/horse-electrocuted-to-death-in-nizamuddin-locals-say-overflowing-sewage-conducted-power-from-transformer-nearby/story-Vao36KeDog6ikbuEHJrTBL.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s public utility BS-4 diesel vehicles should be registered, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday stated that all Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) compliant diesel vehicles purchased before April 1, 2020 by civic agencies and police in the Capital for carrying out essential public services should be registered by the transport authority.Without passing an order to this effect, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde asked the municipal authorities and Delhi Police to submit a list of all such vehicles pending registration to the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) – the statutory body assisting the Court with Delhi pollution matters. The EPCA will file a report to the Court following which an omnibus order is expected to be passed.The direction came while the Court was hearing separate applications by concessionaires operating on behalf of municipal agencies in Delhi which required Court’s nod to get their vehicles registered with the various regional transport offices in the Capital. These vehicles were meant for collection of garbage. In all, the application sought registration of seven compressed natural gas (CNG)-based vehicles, one BS-IV diesel based vehicle and 13 BS-VI based vehicles.This has been the practice since the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order of April 2015 directing ban on diesel vehicles in Delhi owing to the rising level of air pollution. Taking up the applications, CJI Bobde remarked, “What is this….has the Supreme Court started registering vehicles also?”Senior advocate Aparajita Singh who is assisting the Court in these matters as amicus curiae pointed out that all these vehicles qualify for registration as they were purchased before April 1, 2020. The vehicles even had temporary registration with the E-Vahan portal of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. However, the amicus pointed out that instead of coming in batches, the Court may direct the civic agencies and police to file a consolidated list of such vehicles that can be considered at one go.So far as the application for registration of CNG vehicles and BS-VI diesel vehicles were concerned, the bench clarified that these vehicles can be registered by the transport authorities as they met with the permissible emission standards.With regard to BS-IV diesel vehicles, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “If the purchase had been made on or before March 31, 2020 and these vehicles are BS-IV compliant, such vehicles necessary for the Municipal Corporation to carry essential public utility services should also be registered…. EPCA shall scrutiny the pending cases and submit a report to this Court so that a common order could be passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-public-utility-bs-4-diesel-vehicles-should-be-registered-says-sc/story-TLvAvMphnGuFLXjyHXL0SP.html
18-09-2020||City||Govt takes measures to protect CCTVs from theft, damage||New Delhi: In the light of instances of theft and damage to CCTV camera systems, the Delhi government has directed the public works department to take additional measures such as installing additional lock systems and adding alarm devices in CCTV boxes.The directions were issued on Friday by the office of Delhi’s home and urban development minister Satyendar Jain, after complaints of theft and damage of CCTV cameras at least 75 locations across the city. The names of the locations were not mentioned in the order, said a senior Delhi government official who did not wish to be identified.The Delhi government had started installing 1.4 lakh CCTVs in public places and residential areas in January 2019 but the process has not been completed yet. PWD minister Satyendar Jain attributed the delay to the assembly elections and the Covid-19 pandemic.Apart from the cameras, hard disks containing recorded footage and SIM cards attached with the CCTVs were stolen in some places, said the government official, citing Friday’s order.Jain’s office instructed the CCTV wing of the department and the vendor Bharat Electronics Limited, which is getting the cameras installed, to equip them and the associated devices with an “additional lock system.” Officials have been asked not to grant permission to anyone other than confirmed personnel from BEL to carry out repair work.According to the standard operating procedure, the ownership of the cameras lies with the PWD, a portfolio under Jain’s domain. Their feed is provided to representatives of resident welfare associations (RWA), local police and deputy police commissioners concerned.RWAs have been instructed to ensure no one touches the cameras in the absence of any representative from the associations. Under the new rules, apart from the RWA, the feed will be available to the owner of the household from where the cameras draw power. Such households are reimbursed by the government for the power consumed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-takes-measures-to-protect-cctvs-from-theft-damage/story-jvBul2WNP587sk4zEzfLFI.html
18-09-2020||City||Farm bills dominate Day 1 of PAU’s first virtual Kisan Mela||The passing of three controversial farm bills dominated the inaugural proceedings of first-ever Virtual Kisan Mela at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on Friday. While inaugurating the two-day event virtually, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said, “Farmers of Punjab, with their toil and sweat, and the men of genius at PAU did their best to make the country food secure. Their outstanding contributions during the last 55 years (since Green Revolution) remain unsurpassed. But, the small state, which feeds the nation, has not been treated well. The ongoing river disputes and the two farm bills passed in the Lok Sabha are going to hit Punjab and Haryana the maximum.”“Destiny brought Covid-19, and even during the challenging times, the godowns of Punjab were full,” he said while congratulating Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.“Already there is a shortage of water and landholdings are shrinking in Punjab. Agricultural fields as well as dairy farming need water. Future generations need food to eat. We need to think of the future of Punjab and its coming generations,” the CM stressed. Referring to paddy crop in the current season, he hailed its average yield of 65 quintals per hectare. “Sara Punjab thauda dhanwadi hai (whole Punjab is thankful to you),” the CM said to PAU, while adding, “You have done your best.” Sunil Jakhar, president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, congratulated PAU for being a big gift to the farming community. “Punjabi farmers and research institutes like PAU removed the ‘kalank’ (smear) of being dependent on foreign nations for food grains and transformed the country from food-deficit to food-surplus,” he said. “For the wheat production of 1.28 crore tonnes during Covid-19 times, I salute the farmers,” he said, while calling upon the Punjab CM to ensure financial security of farmers. “With black clouds hovering over Punjab and disruptive mentality forcing the farmers to protest, we need to work on financial security of farmers of Punjab,” he added. “If there is no wheat, no rice, no pulses, what will people eat? Let us not take anything for granted,” he observed. Sharing details of the mela, PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon said this year, the fair’s theme was “Veera saad na parali, mitti-paani vi sambhal, apne Punjab da tu rakh lai khiyaal (Dear brother, don’t burn paddy straw, conserve soil and water, take care of your Punjab).” Addressing the farmers virtually, he advised them to make judicious use of pesticides, adopt subsidiary occupations like mushroom cultivation, beekeeping, poultry and dairy farming, etc.; connect with PAU on WhatsApp groups and through the Facebook programme every Wednesday.He said after excellent response to the PAU Facebook programme, which helped the varsity connect to nearly 50,000 farmers, the university decided to hold the Virtual Kisan Mela via www.kisanmela.pau.edu.Via technology, farmers will be educated about recommended varieties of wheat, pulses, vegetables, etc., and their production and protection technologies. Urging farmers to shun paddy straw burning and adopt straw management practices, he said, “Sanu apna ghar aap hi sambhalana pau (Setting our house in order is our responsibility).”While welcoming the farmers and farm women, Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, PAU, said the mela was designed keeping in view farmers’ interests. “Even amid the pandemic, we hope to make this mela a big success,” he said, while sharing that more than 5,000 queries had been received from the farmers on Day 1.GADVASU vice-chancelllor Dr Inderjeet Singh said, “Animal husbandry was intensive. Farmers should form farmer-producer organisations to reduce cost of production and get good returns for their produce.” He also highlighted the new diploma courses and other facilities being provided by GADVASU for the benefit of youth as well as farmers. WEBSITE GLITCHES CONTINUE Meanwhile, PAU officials kept receiving complaints about glitches in connecting to the website www.kisanmela.pau.edu early in the day. “We faced glitches in the morning due to heavy traffic, but fixed the problem by afternoon. We received an overwhelming response on Day 1. More than 1 lakh farmers and farm women of Punjab and adjoining states participated in the mela through social media (Facebook, YouTube) as well. Farmers interacted with experts regarding paddy straw management and direct seeded rice technology,” said TS Riar, additional director communication, PAU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-bills-dominate-day-1-of-pau-s-first-virtual-kisan-mela/story-zHlML1OI8YQKyFh5RuJoXL.html

The project has been hanging fire for over four years and residents have been complaining of foul smell and broken boundaries for a long time. Calling it his dream project, Dawar said the 1.4-km long nullah would be covered at a cost of Rs 17.85 crore within 18 months (by March 2022).“I had promised residents of wards 55 and 57 in the 2017 legislative assembly elections that I will get the nullah covered and I have fulfilled my promise now,” the MLA said.He added that a central verge would also be established at the roads and all electricity poles, street lights and transformers would be installed there only.The project has been prepared by experts from IIT Roorkee and will come as a major relief to residents of Shivaji nagar and New Shivaji Nagar as the nullah moves through these areas.Amanpal Singh, a resident of Shivaji Nagar, said, “We are irked by the foul smell which emanates from the nullah, which was once a drain. Also, the boundary walls are broken and many accidents have taken place because of this. During the monsoons, the nullah overflows and sewer water accumulates on streets.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “A board regarding specifications of the project and contact numbers of the contractor and MC officials concerned have been put up at the site so that residents can complain about any anomalies in the project. The deadline has also been specified.”Cong, BJP get into war for creditWhile MLA Dawar inaugurated the project in the morning, BJP leaders distributed sweets in the afternoon and felicitated former cabinet minister Satpal Gosain for initially taking up the project in 2016. Former councillor Inder Aggarwal said, “It was Gosain who had got the project approved in 2016 and Rs 6 crore was also approved by the state government. Tenders were floated twice but the process could not be completed due to technical reasons.” The BJP leaders also slammed Congress for not inviting area BJP councillor Manju Aggarwal for the inauguration ceremony. Social distancing went for a tossDespite restrictions imposed on political gatherings, a large number of Congress leaders and supporters participated in the inauguration ceremony.

18-09-2020||City||Ludhiana’s Jagraon Bridge project expected to finish by Oct 2||Expected to be completed by September 15 after missing five deadlines, the project to reconstruct the historical Jagraon Bridge has been delayed further by two weeks.Setting its seventh deadline, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu has now announced that the project will be completed by Gandhi Jayanti on October 2.After discovering that the girders of the 132-year-old bridge were badly corroded, the damaged side of the bridge (which leads to Bharat Nagar Chowk) was closed for heavy vehicles in May 2016. Two months later, in July, it was closed for all vehicles except two-wheelers.A major traffic lifeline of the city, the bridge has now been closed for over four years, hitting the movement of traffic on the Railway Station Road, Jagraon bridge, Lakkar bridge and nearby areas.Conceived in 2016, the project to repair this damaged portion of the bridge stayed in limbo for two years as the railways refused to pool in money for it. It was only after the municipal corporation (MC) handed over Rs 24.3 crore to the railways that construction finally began in 2018, with a deadline of June 30, 2019. This was extended to December 2019, when MC took over the project and announced it will be completed by March 2020. However, roadblocks caused by the Covid-19 lockdown pushed the completion to June. The fourth deadline was revised to August 15 and then again extended to September 15. Now, the railways is expected to take another week to complete the construction of the damaged bridge, which has been serving the city since 1888, following which MC will complete work on the approach road.Mayor Balkar Sandhu and councillor Rakesh Prashar visited the construction site on Thursday.“The railways will complete its end of the job by September 22, following which MC will construct the approach road. The project is expected to be completed by September 30 and opened for traffic by October 2,” the mayor said.Prashar said, “Trees will be planted on both sides of the bridge for its beautification.”A railways official said the project was delayed due to the closure of bitumen plants amid the Covid-19 lockdown, besides other hiccups.Amid the project missing multiple deadlines, residents have written to government authorities several times and also observed four ‘death anniversaries’ of the bridge as a symbolic protest against the delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-jagraon-bridge-project-expected-to-finish-by-oct-2/story-Cncv5cgCnPPICCG5SroSaJ.html

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Covid tally to double in a month, predicts Centre||Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh will be around 14,500 by mid-October, leading to a requirement of more intensive care unit beds and ventilators, projections made by the central government have suggested. The projections have been made for October 13 using mathematical modelling based on trends on September 13. The exercise has been carried out by the ministry of health and family welfare to assist states and Union Territories in augmenting the available infrastructure.There were 7,480 Covid cases in Chandigarh on September 13, which are projected to reach 14,376 on October 13, with 4,160 being active. The UT administration had earlier predicted that around 1% of the total population will be infected, and at the pandemic’s peak, 3,600 people will have active infection. The projected numbers are way beyond this figure. 30% shortfall in ICU beds, 10% in ventilatorsThe model suggests 15% (624) of the active patients will require oxygen support and 5% (208) will be admitted in ICUs, of which 50% (104) will require ventilator support on October 13.Though oxygen beds are in surplus with 820 available on September 13, there are only 160 ICU beds and 95 ventilators, with the shortfall in ICU beds being as high as 30% and in ventilators 10%, according to the projections.A patient who is having mild respiratory symptoms requires low-level oxygen supply that can be provided in general wards with beds having oxygen supply, said Prof Pankaj Malhotra of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, while explaining three different levels of clinical management for Covid-19 patients depending upon there oxygen saturation levels. ICU beds are for patients requiring high-flow oxygen supply through advanced modes. Patients with pre-existing disease, such as renal failure, are also admitted to ICUs, where a few patients may also require ventilator support, he said. ‘Requirement will be lesser than that projected’Questioned about the shortfall in infrastructure for critical cases, UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that taking into account the present trend, the requirement will be less than that shown in mathematical projections made by the ministry. Of the present 3,200 active cases, just around 5% need oxygen support and only 2% are in ICU, he said.The Centre in its report has said that states may appropriately modify the estimates by factoring in variables, such as local surveillance, positivity rate, the extent of testing and hospitalisation data. It has added that comprehensive plans should be made and steps may be taken for augmentation of facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-covid-tally-to-double-in-a-month-predicts-centre/story-43VwZZz3xpdECHN9VfDp7M.html

The complete report would be available after the viscera examination. “The victim was hit on the head and the post-mortem report suggests that the injury was caused by a blunt object and led to her death,” said SSP Vineet Kumar.The police are yet to trace the accused and his 9-year-old son, who was in the car when Mandeep had pushed his 13-year-old son on September 14 night in Neelon canal.Meanwhile, five different teams continued raids at possible hideouts of the accused in Punjab as the vehicle in which he had left the city with his two sons was spotted in the neighbouring state.The couple’s teenager son, who was saved from drowning, is with his paternal grandfather Surmukh Singh, who came down from Fatehgarh Sahib after Jyoti’s murder was reported. Anxious about his younger brother’s well-being, the teenager is praying for his safe return.On September 13, Mandeep had asked the two boys not to go to their mother’s room on the first floor as she had tested positive for Covid-19 and was in isolation. The next day, he took them in a car to Ludhiana. After paying obeisance at a gurdwara, Mandeep gave them a medicine, claiming it would protect them from coronavirus infection, but it made them vomit.A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) have been registered against Mandeep after Jyoti’s body was found wrapped up in a blanket on a blood-stained bed at their government accommodation. The body was found on Tuesday when a police team from Ludhiana had come knocking at their door to drop their elder son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-teacher-s-murder-victim-died-due-to-head-injury-inflicted-by-blunt-object-says-autopsy-report/story-LbrXi0c9uy5o6L6MsyVIUJ.html

18-09-2020||Election:||Election officials in Bihar told to fact check, call out fake news||Tackling the menace of fake news has emerged one of the top concerns of the state election department in Bihar, which has introduced a fact check concept where district magistrates and district election officers have been directed to post correct updates on the official websites immediately after detection of any fake news or rumours on various media platforms, especially social media.A template has also been attached with the letter sent by the election department to DMs for fact checking.“The idea of ‘fact check’ is to provide correct information about any development in case there is false news circulating in the social media. This is the first time such a system will be implemented during assembly polls in Bihar,” said an election officer.State’s additional chief electoral officer Ranjita said, “Checking fake news is one of the priority areas. Immediate action would be taken against those indulging in such activities.”The state election department has also started the process of shadow zone area mapping of booths to assess whether booths, especially located in rural and remote areas, have good mobile connectivity or not.Sources said telecom service providers would be asked to make necessary arrangements in areas of poor connectivity or provision would be made for satellite phones. Officials said the increased focus on checking the mobile connectivity near booths this time is because of the stress on digital mode of communication with polling personnel in view of the Covid-related safeguards.The vulnerability mapping of booths to identity polling stations where there is possibility of rigging or any other law and order problem has also begun.The two-member Election Commission team that visited Bihar a few days back has laid stress on encouraging voters turnout through SWEEP (Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Programme) and on ensuring minimum facilities at all the new auxillary booths set up to maintain Covid-19 related safeguards at the polling stations.“We have asked district officials to intensify campaign through SWEEP. We are also striving to ensure minimum facilities at booths for voters’ convenience,” said the additional CEO, Bihar.The EC team also laid stress on ensuring proper availability of vehicles and usage of various I-T applications, including e-nomination facility, for filing nomination papers by candidates with the option of making payments of necessary fees online, the first such initiative in this polls.In another first, the state election department has already issued directives to the DMs to ensure that voters come to booths wearing masks as a precaution against Covid infection and those flouting rules would be fined Rs 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/election-officials-in-bihar-told-to-fact-check-call-out-fake-news/story-s3mfJhMrwaC7Jr9M0Qyy9O.html
18-09-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Promote city as a great business destination||Promote Chandigarh as a business destinationI believe that Chandigarh has everything that a business hub requires, but it needs to be promoted in the right way. In the business world it is said that no matter how good your product or service you make, unless and until your customers are not aware of it, it will not sell. So our city authorities need to consistently promote the best features of the city. This could include marketing the UT’s strategic location among neighbouring states, established accessibility of railways, road transport and international airport. The cleanliness and standards of basic infrastructure should also be highlighted. Regular B2B trade events should be done in the city to promote business infrastructure and opportunities and for networking. Aishwarya Sharma Time for businesses to gear up tooThe administration should set up cells to guide and consult with local businesses/industries about Inter-state/international business options. Exhibitions and trade-fairs should be organised regularly. Hard work and success are two sides of the same coin. Businesses too should gear up in the post pandemic scenario to expand, push for exports and create more jobs.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliUrgently formulate of business-friendly action plans The city needs a full time administrator for taking quick decisions on policies to create an environment conducive to business/industry with a liberal policy to attract FDI/ investors and also improve employment rates. Collector rates of property should be fixed on the basis of sanctioned covered area of plot and building by-laws and lease conversion rates fixed after factoring in the needs of industries. Pending cases involving violations or misuse of building by-laws should be decided quickly to enable industries to work unfettered and allow others to set up business here. The need of the hour is to formulate action plans that are business-friendly with the involvement of traders and industrialists.Sukhpal Singh  Don’t expect changes in bureaucratic set-upChandigarh’s poor ranking in ease of doing business is shameful. The problem is that this is a bureaucratic set-up and bureaucrats come for a fixed tenure. No one takes the pains to compete with other states/UTs. To improve rankings the administration needs to consult all stakeholders to frame a new industrial policy resolving issues related to land, labour, investment, banking, taxation, and marketing to help industries.SK Khosla, Chandigarh. Convert land to freeholdLand rates need to be cheaper to encourage industries to flourish. Single window systems should be streamlined to provide all possible help to businesspersons. Lack of basic and civic amenities is also a hurdle. Demand of industrialists to convert leasehold land to freehold should be looked into on priority basis. An improved business environment will help generate employment and stop brain drain. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, Kurali Revive post of chief commissionerAffairs of the union territory (UT) are handled by the bureaucracy, a majority of them on deputation from Punjab and Haryana. Even the administrator of Chandigarh is the governor Punjab. Their main interests lie with their parent states, so any radical changes in the business environment cannot be expected. That said, the post of chief commissioner of Chandigarh should be revived with a bureaucrat cadre created especially for Chandigarh as officials will then keep the long-term interests of the city in mind. AK Sharma, Chandigarh Set up a body with city representativesBlame for all the ills of the city should be pinned on the political structure of our city. It has no representation. Our MP has to follow the party whip and we have no MLAs. The bureaucrats report to the home minister, who to be fair has a lot on his plate to deal with now instead of discussing the civic issues of Chandigarh. The UT needs a legislative body where representatives take decisions, not bureaucrats. Pondicherry with a population of only 2.5 lakh has its own governing body. Bureaucrats are here on fixed tenures, so there are no incentives for those who perform well. The IT Park still remains underutilised because companies need incentives to set up their base here. The environment isn’t good for business because of red tape. Kamal Passi City not planned for industriesWhen the city was planned there was no provision to attract big industries. Moreover, it would have affected the very character of the city, especially the green cover, the world-class infrastructure for education, health, art and sculpture. It is advisable to consult local industrialists and seek their suggestions to attract investors. The two Industrial Areas lack basic facilities and discourage investors, whose demands include conversion of industrial plots to freehold basis, easy availability of land, easy environment clearances, 24-hour power and water, relief from tax/duties, and single window facility to get approvals/guidelines. Usha Verma, Chandigarh Discuss benefits offered by Punjab, HaryanaAfter the trifurcation of Punjab states on November 1966, Punjab and Haryana developed their own Industrial Area at Panchkula , Mohali , Derabassi, Baddi, Parwanoo etc, where many units were set up or moved because of the attractive benefits on offer and less government interference. Meanwhile, UT’s second phase along with Industrial Area Phase 2 developed in the ’80s. Entrepreneurs did not get any benefits compared to neighbouring states and instead faced strict enforcement of building by-laws. Meanwhile, the neighbouring states allowed multistoried construction and use of part of building as residence. Demands for leasehold to freehold, additional FAR and permissions to carry out need based internal changes are pending. I suggest the matter be looked into. Open darbar should be held to look into problems of entrepreneurs and benefits and advantages offered by neighbouring states be debated. Joginder Singh Bhogal, Chandigarh No ‘will’ to improve thingsBusinesses and industries in the Smart City of Chandigarh need many changes in existing rules which our bureaucrats don’t permit due to reasons best known to them. Government jobs are limited - almost equal to nil. Many sectors are being privatised by our present government. The need of the hour is to create a conducive business environment for which our administration must offer some concessions to all players. This in turn will increase the earnings of the administration as well. Rules should be easy to follow and there should be no red-tapism, which slows down business and stresses out investors.Gurpreet S Malhotra, Kansal Develop city as a medical hubChandigarh is in imminent danger of losing its status of a planned, modern city. Given the pandemic and its outcome, it should be developed as a medical hub. The amalgamation policy announced recently can give a big boost to the city’s dwindling health facilities and yet save every inch of precious land for future industrial growth. Nursing homes in the city are governed as per residential bye-laws. Unless their amalgamation is facilitated with the adjoining residence on priority, even existing nursing homes may close and shift to neighbouring cities. About 28 nursing homes were regularised in 1999, half have closed down. Similar number should be allowed to function. In one step, amalgamation will boost health services for Chandigarh residents, increase the revenue from health industry, and save the city’s limited land for other industrial activities. Dr Ramneek Bedi, Chandigarh Administration has to act nowThose at the helm in the administration ought to accept the gospel truth that business is no charity and those in business are here for profits. Onus of promoting business lies with the administration as it has to boost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for better employment, drive development and generate revenues/income for the government/civic administration to shape ease of living. Closing down business establishments to curb the spread of coronavirus is akin to stopping factories and vehicles to check industrial and road accidents. Healthy business orientation breeds progress and prosperity and intermittent jerks paralyse business. Implementation of business-friendly Chandigarh Industrial Policy of 2015 is overdue. Lalit Bharadwaj, Panchkula Develop industrial zonesChandigarh was good place for services and businesses, but with the development of the adjoining cites, some industries and services moved there because of low rental costs and developed business market. The Chandigarh administration should develop existing properties or encourage other private players to help develop industrial zones. Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Focus on city’s design, not industriesWhen Chandigarh was planned by Le Corbusier it was not meant to be an industrial town and the focus was on its design. However, business and industry both are the soul of a city, without which a body cannot survive. Chandigarh’s industrial areas need to be converted to freehold properties, with tax relief for businesses running at a loss. Unnecessary harassment of industrialists by way of red-tapism should stop. Dr Devinder Garg, Chandigarh More incentives for new businessesThe Covid-19 pandemic has affected industries, but quick action will bring them back on track. As regards ease of setting up small scale industrial units in Chandigarh, people are not too keen to invest here because they don’t get any incentives. Even if a suitable plot somehow is available to start with, clearances and approvals take time. This has to changeSC Luthra, Chandigarh City requires better connectivityIndustries require incentives such as reduction in GST, subsidised power supply, reduced commercial property tax and increased FSI to get more space by going vertical as Chandigarh has limited space. Better connectivity to national and international destinations by increased number of flights is a must. Single window clearance, and liberal loans in view of Covid -19 epidemic should be accorded top priority. Col TBS BediRigid rules hinder growth Rules related to commercial properties in Chandigarh are too rigid as compared to other states. Non-conversion of leasehold industrial plots to freehold is the biggest hindrance in the development of old established industries and setting up of new ones. Collector rates are high as compared to Mohali and Panchkula. FAR is also less as compared to Mohali. Online single window system should be launched by the administration. There should be a redressal forum to listen to their grievances. More land should be allotted for new establishments. Fresh guidelines regarding pollution control, disposal of waste material, safety of workers, and fire safety norms should be issued. Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali Don’t have to make it a business hubChandigarh is business-friendly, but not for industrial development, and it should not be. It was never visualised like that. Why does a clean and green city require industry and ease of doing business? Only for polluting the environment through smoke emitting industrial establishments? It needs to be noted that the UT was basically established as a city-state and an administrative headquarter, not a business hub. The city does not require any business reform action plan. Its financial needs are taken care of by the Central government through grants-in-aid. There is no need to change the age-old rules and regulations, else the ‘clean and green’ character of the city will be destroyed. Let Chandigarh survive with its Anglo-French model of construction and operation. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurREADER OF THE WEEKSimplify licencing, tax systemThe local government should incorporate a licensing and tax system which is simple, comprehensible and can be easily complied with. Training and network programmes are imperative to get businesses up and running. The UT administration should create a culture of opportunity for all by creating low cost workspaces or incubators for innovation, eliminating red tape and proactively engaging small businesses for fostering economic vitality by attracting inward investment and creating new jobs. A committee to represent small business owners must be developed to voice demands and serve as a counsel to the administrators, municipal corporations and other local leaders on issues that count. Investor facilitation centres , a single window system, a one-stop centralised web portal and “Jump teams” must be initiated to provide streamlined and coordinated support to small businesses to understand the rules of the road.

18-09-2020||City||Two arrested for murder of Delhi cab driver, two still on the run||The Ghaziabad police late Thursday arrested two suspects in connection with the murder of a Delhi cab driver whose body was found in a car, left abandoned at the Mohan Nagar intersection on September 12. The police were searching for four suspects who had last booked the cab, and whom they believe had murdered the driver. The police had identified the body as that of driver Sikandar Paswan, 30, who hailed from Jharkhand and lived with his family in Sriniwaspuri, Delhi. Post-mortem reports indicated that Paswan had died of a severe head injury. Police since then have been on the lookout for the four men who had booked the cab and they arrested two of them from Naagdwar area of Sahibabad late Thursday. Police said they signalled the two men on a motorcycle to stop but they tried speeding away; however, their motorcycle skidded and they fell on the road. In the meantime, their two accomplices, who were on another motorcycle, fled the spot. Those arrested were identified as Ashu Sharma, a resident of Loni, and Sohan Pal, a resident of Karawal Nagar in Delhi. The other two who fled were identified as Ranjeet Kumar and Anshul Kumar. “The four men had planned to rob the cab driver. They met Paswan at Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and offered him ₹200 per person for a drop to Anand Vihar ISBT. They were planning to rob him of his car and valuables. Near Barapullah flyover, they made Paswan stop the car and overpowered him. One of them hit him on his head with a weapon,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). The police said the suspects later drove the cab, a Swift Dzire, to Mohan Nagar in Ghaziabad. Paswan had died by then. “At Mohan Nagar, the four heard a police van approaching and they fled, leaving the car behind. Paswan’s family lodged a case of murder and our teams tracked the four men using CCTV footage and also through electronic surveillance,” Verma said. The police said the two men on the run will be arrested soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-arrested-for-murder-of-delhi-cab-driver-two-still-on-the-run/story-akjKuZ3nSp3tAee9DfKvHL.html
18-09-2020||Chandigarh||In Harsimrat’s resignation, SAD sees opportunity to regain lost ground||The Shiromani Akali Dal decision to make Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit the Narendra Modi cabinet is seen as a political course correction to retain its base among Punjab’s farmers, the SAD’s core constituency. Thursday’s decision was in protest against the passage of the three farm bills in the Lok Sabha. The bills are construed as anti-farmer by its opponents who fear it will end the minimum support price (MSP), the assured and open-ended procurement system for foodgrains in practice for 60 years. Many see the last-minute move by the SAD as “full of wisdom” because any further delay and the political game may have slipped out of the party’s hands. But the decision was not easy for the Akalis because it had been supporting the bills since their promulgation in June. It found itself pushed to the wall as the farmers’ protest gathered momentum across the state. The SAD’s credentials as a party of peasants was at stake. CONGRESS ON OFFENSIVE, SAD ON DEFENSIVE The Congress-ruled government in the state has upped the ante by announcing a legal recourse against the farm bills, terming them “a precursor to dismantling of the MSP system”. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh went a step further, saying all cases against farmers for violating prohibitory orders during the protests in Covid times will be withdrawn. On the contrary, SAD president and Harsimrat’s husband, Sukhbir Singh Badal, had been reiterating the Centre’s assurances that the reforms will have no bearing on the MSP. He did so at press conferences on June 25 and August 27 and even made public a letter by Union agriculture minister NS Tomar. The Panthic party panicked when efforts to touch base with farmers failed and party cadres conveyed feedback from the ground that it would be the end of the game for the Akali Dal if it continued toeing the BJP-led Centre’s line. Already on the backfoot since the sacrilege incidents of 2015 when it was in power, the Akalis can’t afford to lose more ground. U-TURN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? Party leaders such as Prem Singh Chandumajra and Sikandar Singh Maluka had been asking Badal to pull out its lone member from the Union cabinet. “I think now we are headed in the right direction,” Chandumajra said after Harsimrat’s resignation. It was as recently as on September 12 that the party’s core committee took a U-turn and for the first time announced opposing the farm bills in Parliament. On the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament, the SAD made a last-ditch effort to avert a flashpoint when it urged the Centre to refer the bills to a select parliamentary committee and take farmer organisations on board. The SAD subsequently issued a whip to its MPs in both Houses of Parliament to vote against the farm bills, a move that queered the pitch for Harsimrat’s resignation. “The SAD can’t be party to anything that is anti-farmer” she said, adding she was hurt that despite her and her party’s pleas, farmers were not taken on board. NOT WRECKERS OF THE ALLIANCE YET Harsimrat’s exit is a setback for the long-standing SAD-BJP alliance though she reiterated the continuation of the alliance. “We don’t want to be seen as wreckers of the alliance. We will wait for the BJP’s response,” a senior Akali leader said. Being an agrarian state, political stakes for all parties over this issue are high in Punjab. Farmers form a decisive group of the electorate. All parties have come out in their support. The Congress, the SAD and the AAP are convinced that farmers can turn the tide in their favour with the state going to the polls in 2022. The state BJP, however, sticks to its party’s central unit stand that in the long run, the bills will benefit farmers by eliminating middlemen and its alliance partner, the SAD, should have stayed on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-harsimrat-s-resignation-sad-sees-opportunity-to-regain-lost-ground/story-pI0sCy3xqM8DVyZkDuonhN.html
18-09-2020||Pune||Life-saving surgery on newborn at AICTS||Doctors of the Army Institute of Cardio Thoracic Sciences (AICTS), a super specialisation institute dealing with Cardio Thoracic Sciences based in Pune, carried out critical life-saving surgery on a newborn. A 14-day-old boy of a serving soldier after birth was detected with slow heart rate and diagnosed with complete heart block recently. The baby was referred to the team of specialists at AICTS for further medical and surgical management. It was found to be a rare case of complete heart block which occurs in one in 22,000 births and requires immediate surgical management, if medical intervention fails. “Since medical intervention could not increase the heart rate it was decided to provide mechanical stimulation to the heart by inserting a permanent pacemaker. “The child was operated by the doctors at AICTS and a permanent pacemaker was implanted in the upper abdominal wall of the child which is connected to the heart through a lead positioned surgically on the surface of the heart by opening the chest wall,” stated a note from AICTS. The child has been successfully operated and has been discharged from the hospital and is stable at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/life-saving-surgery-on-newborn-at-aicts/story-cuV30XfR0wB2b1R3imyajN.html
18-09-2020||Pune||Restaurants allow dine-in, locals complain||Even though the state government has not taken decision about reopening of restaurants for dine-in in light of growing Covid-19 cases, many eateries in the city are allowing customers to eat inside the premises. Some of the restaurant owners were found running their establishments throughout the day till late night violating Covid-19 guidelines, rules and regulations for safety measures. Residents of Rasta peth and Sarasbaug area claimed that despite repeated complaints, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and police department have not taken any action against such restaurants. When contacted, Pune city police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “The restaurant owners are not allowed to restart their operations for dine-in. Only parcel services are allowed in view of the Covid pandemic. I will check these spots and action will be taken against the violators.” According to locals, customers regularly come and dine inside restaurants without wearing masks and violate social distancing norms. One such hotspot is ‘Khau Galli’ in Rasta peth, which is located in front of KEM hospital which has Covid patients. Some of the snack centres and restaurants in this Khau Galli lane are illegally serving customers inside their restaurants. Daily food hawkers are also operating their business on the footpaths leading to a lot of rush and in violating social distancing norms. “Daily hundreds of people come here to eat food from the stalls set up by the hawkers and also inside the restaurants. Most of them even don’t wear masks and still no action has been taken against them. Some of us residents tried to tell the restaurants to keep the customer service closed as it is not yet allowed officially, but they didn’t respond to us. This is leading to the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection and police should take strict action against them,” said Ganpat Bhalerao, a resident of Rasta peth. A similar scene is witnessed at Sarasbaug Chaupati, where there are at least 50 hotels. It is located close to the Sanas Ground Covid testing centre and the quarantine centre for Covid positive patients. Restaurants here openly run their premises with customers coming in, sitting inside and food is being served to them. Sagar Abnawe, a resident of Sarasbaug area, said, “The number of Covid-19 positive cases are increasing in the city, and this is due to the careless attitude of the people. At Sarasbaug Chaupati, we daily see people coming here for lunch and dinner. Restaurants are running their business illegally and no action is taken against them. Sarasbaug Garden is closed, inside the temple is closed, but outside restaurants are open.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/restaurants-allow-dine-in-locals-complain/story-KdF7HIPYBQJnLPgKynsWqM.html
18-09-2020||Pune||CSIR-NCL conducts serological test for its employees||The CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, conducted a serological survey for its employees and their family members, under which 400 blood samples have been being collected. The serological survey started on September 12 at NCL Medical Centre and concluded on September 17. The blood samples along with the health data will be sent to CSIR-IGIB for serological analysis. Serological test is conducted to see if a person has developed antibodies to coronavirus. Presence of antibodies can indicate that the person has been exposed to the virus. The initiative is a part of the pan-India project named ‘Phenome India initiated by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and led by Delhi-based CSIR- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and Dr Shantanu Sengupta from CSIR-IGIB is coordinating the study. The CSIR-NCL team comprises scientists from the biochemical sciences division and doctors from the medical centre. “The research study involves testing of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in the people working in the CSIR labs and their family members. The CSIR-NCL and CSIR-URDIP represent the western region. Blood samples are being collected from those who are willing to participate. The test is voluntary and open to all CSIR staff, including pensioners up to the age of 70, students, contractual staff and their families,” said Prabhakar Ingle, media advisor at CSIR-NCL, Pune. “About 400 blood samples have been collected from CSIR-NCL and CSIR-URDIP employees and family members for a serological test. The health parameters such as temperature, height, weight, oxygen level and blood pressure are noted in addition to collecting the blood sample,” he added. According to Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, a separate survey is being undertaken by Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital and Sassoon General Hospital with larger sample size in order to assess sero prevalence in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. “The sample size of the first sero survey done by IISER was small, hence, another bigger and wider survey is being undertaken by YCM and Sassoon in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune. In this survey the sample size will be increased so that we can know more about both the cities’ sero prevalence,” said Rao during press conference last week. Pune’s first sero surveillance report was carried out in July and its findings were released on August 17. The survey revealed that 1.5 per cent people of total 1,664 persons from five highly-affected areas in Pune city have seroprevalence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/csir-ncl-conducts-serological-test-for-its-employees/story-azUPdZeYIpBDkojOPhHdHO.html

The accused made good their escape as the shopkeeper raised the alarm, but took an empty box while fleeing.Deepak Saida, 32, said his family ran a jewellery shop in the main market of Gujjarwal. On Thursday afternoon, his father, Durga Das, went home, leaving the shop in his care. Meanwhile, four men visited his shop looking for gold bracelets, but one of them stood outside.As he turned to make a call to his father to ask for the sample pieces, one of three men inside brandished a double-barrel rifle at him, when the man waiting outside also stepped in.Alarmed, he screamed for help, prompting the robbers to flee, but not without a small, empty box from the shop. He alerted the police soon after, following which a team reached the spot and initiated investigation.ASI Gurmeet Singh, the investigating officer in the case, said on Sharma’s complaint, they had lodged an FIR under Sections 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft) and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act at the Jodhan police station.

18-09-2020||Mumbai||After being sent on leave over Wadhawans’ Mahabaleshwar trip, Amitabh Gupta is Pune Police chief||Amitabh Gupta has been named as Pune police chief months after he was sent on compulsory leave for facilitating the visit of scam accused businessmen Kapil, Dheeraj Wadhawan, and their 23 family members to Mahabaleshwar even as non-essential travel was barred as part of measures to check the Covid-19 spread in April. The elevation came as part of a shuffle in the Maharashtra police with the transfer of 40 Indian Police Service (IPS) officers on Thursday. Gupta will replace K Venkateshan, who has been named additional director general (special operations), as the Pune police commissioner.A fact-finding committee, which was formed to look into the permission granted to the Wadhawans to travel from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar, found Gupta exceeded his jurisdiction and had no authority to issue a letter to them for it. Gupta then maintained he issued the letter on humanitarian grounds. He was reinstated as principal secretary (special) home department over a month later.Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, the Diwan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters, are accused of money laundering in the multi-crore Yes Bank fraud case. Yes Bank is alleged to have invested Rs3,700 crore in short term non-convertible debenture of DHFL between April and June 2018. Its promoter, Rana Kapoor, allegedly received Rs600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL in terms of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited.

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Akal Takht acting jathedar publicly punishes SGPC chief over missing Guru Granth Sahib saroops||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh publicly punished Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal and executive committee members on Friday for failing to check the misappropriation in its publication department that led to 328 Guru Granth Sahib saroops going missing. The SGPC chief and executive members appeared before the highest Sikh temporal seat with folded hands to apologise for their negligence. It was a rare occasion when the jathedar has pulled up incumbent office-bearers, who appointed him, in the presence of devotees. As Longowal sought forgiveness, the jathedar said, “How shameful it is that employees used to give the saroops illegally to the sangat (community), as has been found in the inquiry, and pocket the money at the place where the saroops are published. The SGPC is not aware of this misappropriation? Is it not a blunder? The SGPC office-bearers never checked the records. Is it not negligence?” “Yes, it was our mistake,” Longowal replied. Pronouncing the punishment on the spot, the jathedar said, “Do parkarma of Darbar Sahib sarovar (Circumambulate the holy tank) right now, chanting Satnam-Waheguru and then be present here again. Don’t talk to each other and fold your hands while doing so.” RELIGIOUS PUNISHMENT, NO PUBLIC GATHERING FOR A MONTH On their return, the jathedar awarded the remaining religious punishment. “You are directed to hold one Akhand Path (non-stop recitation of Guru Granth Sahib) at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib for pashchatap (regret and remorse) for the 2016 fire incident that led to saroops getting burnt. Hold another Akhand Path at Akal Takht. When that Akhand Path would be going on at the Takht, the SGPC office-bearers and executive members will sweep the street leading to Darbar Sahib from Saragarhi Serai to Ghantaghar Chowk,” he said. Without mentioning the SGPC’s U-turn by revoking its resolution to file criminal cases against staffers indicted in the inquiry, the jathedar said, “Reversing decisions is not fair and it has hurt the reputation of the SGPC. The Akal Takht Sahib directs it to take decisions after consulting Sikh intellectuals and scholars.” Accompanied by four other Sikh clergymen, including Takht Kesgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh and Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh, Giani Harpreet Singh banned the office-bearers and executive panel from addressing any public gathering for a month except on September 28 when the budget session is scheduled. SGPC OFFICE-BEARERS IN 2016 REMOVED FROM POSTS FOR YEAR Taking note of the SGPC task force’s act of using force against agitating Sikh activists to disperse them and tossing the turban of a nihang, the jathedar termed the incident a “sacrilege of the turban” and summoned the employees involved. Giani Harpreet Singh ordered the SGPC to remove senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta from all the posts for a year. The Akal Takht issued this direction for all those who were office-bearers and members of the executive committee in 2016 for not organising pashchatapsamagam (function to express regret and remorse) after the sacrilege of the saroops in a fire at the SGPC’s publishing house in May that year. On being summoned, all former office-bearers and executive members appeared before the Takht. Mehta was an executive member at that time. They were also directed to do sehaj path of Guru Granth Sahib. THREE GET TANKHAH FOR PARDON TO LANGAH Earlier, the jathedar asked them to face the sangat (Sikh community) and admit that they had committed a mistake. For playing a role in granting pardon to former Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah, who was excommunicated for an immoral act by Takht, the Sikh clergy awarded tankhah (religious punishment) to SGPC member Gurinderpal Singh Gora, Rattan Singh Zaffarwal, the husband of an SGPC member, and Damdami Taksal media adviser Sarchand Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-acting-jathedar-publicly-punishes-sgpc-chief-over-missing-guru-granth-sahib-saroops/story-LPhn1lIm8VqF9UGOGbOZMO.html
18-09-2020||Mumbai||Ambedkar memorial: Thackeray postpones event after controversy over invites||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government in Maharashtra, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has postponed the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the 450-foot (ft) statue of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar after a row was sparked off over not inviting opposition party leaders and the family members of the social reformer. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was to preside over the ceremony at Indu Mills in Dadar on Friday. As per the invite accessed by HT, the dignitaries invited included deputy CM Ajit Pawar, urban development minister Eknath Shinde, tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and other cabinet ministers of the Thackeray government. Also read: Monsoon withdrawal delayed by one week according to IMDDr Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash did not receive any invitation for the event. While his other grandson Anandraj got a last-minute invite. Former Maharashtra CM and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, also of the BJP, were not invited for the event. Anandraj Ambedkar, who has raised several objections in the past over the quality of construction work of the project, has accused the state government for the alleged snub.“I have been raising objections about the quality of the construction work. I got an invite at the last moment on Friday,” he said. He also questioned the timing of the event because the state is facing several challenges, including the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Prakash took on the state government and asked whether it has the authority to decide who all should attend the event. Darekar, the leader of opposition in the Maharashtra legislative council, accused the state government of arrogance. “It seems the MVA has become arrogant and does not take cognisance of others,” he alleged. In a statement released on Friday afternoon, CM Thackeray said that the event would be held soon and all the leaders would be invited. “There is no need to politicise the issue. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has made all preparations to revise the design of the statue following the Cabinet approval,” the statement read. “An important ceremony like this needs everyone’s participation and I have instructed MMRDA to do the needful,” he added. In January, the Maharashtra Cabinet had given its nod to raise the height of the statue to 350 ft from 250 ft, along with a 100 ft pedestal. The total height of the structure, to be made in bronze, will be 450 ft. The project cost has also escalated owing to delayed implementation and changes in the initial plan. At present, the total cost of the project is at Rs 1,089.95 crore, as compared to the earlier estimate of Rs 763.05 crore. Though the groundbreaking ceremony for the project was done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2015, the construction work is yet to gather momentum. The project is expected to be completed by April 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ambedkar-memorial-thackeray-postpones-event-after-controversy-over-invites/story-ELESsh5KyUhnpHZfjVpHaK.html

Residents in the area say locals and even outsiders are dumping garbage on the roadside leading to health hazards.Similarly, residents have complained about garbage accumulation at important internal road junctions across the old and new areas of the suburb.Sanjeev Kumar Patil, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association, said, “Garbage management seems to be miracle or illusion in Wagholi. Despite continuous requests and so many protests, the situation on the ground is the same and garbage litter continues to be a major issue for the area and its residents.”“It is ironic that real estate developers get building completion certificates without the garbage management system at the society level. Residents are ready to cooperate for the segregated waste system has to show willingness. We hope that the garbage disposal plant will get operational, but still, nothing concrete can be said until the plant gets functional,” he said.Vasundhara Ubale, Wagholi Gram Panchayat Sarpanch, said that the garbage problem was due to indiscriminate dumping by outsiders in the area. “The district collector is yet to sanction land for garbage processing unit of the gram panchayat and the decision is expected in the next few days. Once, the new facility comes into force, garbage will be effectively managed and processed in Wagholi itself. It will make Wagholi clean and green,” she said.Anita Rege, a resident of Wagholi, said, “It is the biggest and richest gram panchayat in Haveli, but it is disheartening to see such a basic issue of garbage dumping could not be resolved so many years, even after having a good mix of experienced and young enthusiastic representation in the governing body.”“As per the latest update the ZP CEO and district collector were very positive about allocating the land and setting up a processing plant but the issue created by the elected ward representatives of not allowing the garbage processing plant in their respective wards has created a deadlock lock situation leaving Wagholi in a pathetic condition. All the ward representatives should come together and solve the issue mutually,” she said.Citizen activist Santosh Lokhande said, “Garbage dumping and burning is a common sight in Wagholi which is done openly without any fear. There is no collection of garbage done from homes neither any provision for disposal and recycle.”“The garbage plant has been a distant dream for residents here for so many years due to bad administration and poor town planning,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/garbage-menace-continues-in-wagholi-amid-absence-of-processing-plant/story-CeC8ojcHVikgyGEX7ZaXfL.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi man held for creating fake FB profile to harass friend’s employer||Enraged because his friend was “reprimanded and humiliated” by her employer for stealing clothes from her boutique, a 25-year-old man created a fake social media profile of the boutique owner, “projecting her as a sex worker” and uploaded the woman and her mother’s cellphone number, police said on Friday after arresting the man. Senior police officers said that the boutique owner and her mother were flooded by inappropriate calls. As the frequency of such calls increased, the boutique owner approached the police and filed a complaint. A case of sexual harassment was registered at the Greater Kailash police station and its investigation led to the arrest of the friend of a 24-year-old woman employed in the boutique. The arrested man has been identified only his by first name as Suraj alias Shivam, a resident of Jahangirpuri who is working in a private firm, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. “During the interrogation, Suraj told us (police) that he wanted to settle a score with the boutique owner for scolding his friend for stealing dresses from the boutique and frequently reprimanding her thereafter,” said DCP Thakur. According to the police, Suraj had met and befriended the 24-year-old woman on social media around two years ago. Before the lockdown, the woman’s employer (the boutique owner) caught her stealing in the shop. “The owner scolded her but did not report the theft to the police. The matter was settled amicably,” said DCP Thakur, adding that when the woman’s friend learnt about it, he decided to harass her employer. “He created a fake social media account (on Facebook) and uploaded some obscene pictures along with mobile numbers of the owner and her mother,” he added. DCP Thakur said they are probing the role of Suraj’s friend to ascertain if she was aware the fake social media profile he had created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-held-for-creating-fake-fb-profile-to-harass-friend-s-employer/story-AFK20tfAFetx0pDyEgFZEI.html
18-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to catch stray monkeys, house them in open forest enclosures||Uttarakhand government will create four open forest enclosures spread over 70 hectares (ha) with a capacity to house over 25,000 monkeys to check the growing simian menace in the Himalayan state. The initiative is touted to be the country’s largest project to catch monkeys and shift them to open forest enclosures.Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat made the announcement during a press conference on Friday on the completion of three and a half years of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. He said that many wild animals such as monkeys, wild boars and elephants have been raiding agricultural fields and damaging crops and vegetable gardens, much to the dismay of the aggrieved farmers. Rawat said the state government has decided to take some concrete steps to check the menace. “We are setting up four rescue centres, or open forest enclosures, where around 25,000 monkeys will be kept. These enclosures will be ready for inauguration on the occasion of the state formation day on November 9 (Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh on this day in 2000),” the CM said. Rawat said in a bid to check wild boars, the state government would erect around 25-kilometre (km)-long fencing in various parts of the state. “Elephants will be prevented from raiding farms and damaging crops by digging a 250-km-long trench. There will be a 13-km-long wall to block the invading pachyderms. A 15-km-long solar fencing will also be erected to contain the stray elephants,” he said. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand, said four open forest enclosures for monkeys would be constructed spread over 70 ha in Haridwar, Nainital, Almora and Pithoragarh districts. “This is the largest project in the country to catch and shift monkeys to such open enclosures. The enclosures in Haridwar and Nainital districts will be spread over 25 ha each. These facilities will have a capacity to keep around 10,000 monkeys each. The enclosures in Almora and Pithoragarh districts will be spread over 10 ha each. The enclosures will have the capacity to house 2,500 monkeys each. Altogether, the four enclosures will have a cumulative capacity to accommodate 25,000 monkeys,” he said. Suhag said the state government had written to the Centre earlier this year, seeking permission to declare monkeys as vermin in the hill state but the approval is still pending. “This is the third time that Uttarakhand is seeking permission to declare monkeys as vermin. However, the Centre has asked the state government for the details of the simians killed in the past when the permission was given. As no monkeys were killed, the Centre is questioning the state government the reason behind declaring the simian as vermin,” he added. Qamar Qureshi, a scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun, who is working on developing an immuno-contraceptive for monkeys, said the proposed enclosures are a good move as killing monkeys by declaring them vermin would not work in the long run. “In these open forest enclosures, monkeys can at least live the way they do in their natural habitat. This move will help check the menace in areas, where it has become a major problem. In areas, where the menace is still relatively less, the authorities should use sterilisation for birth control of monkeys,” he said. The man-monkey conflict is increasing in the Himalayan state because the authorities have failed to come up with an effective long-term solution to curb the menace. Monkeys often stray near human habitations, roads and tourist spots in search of food, leftovers. They also raid kitchen gardens and small hill farms, as a large percentage of the hill state is under forest cover.Farmers consider monkeys as an evil force because there is limited scope for agriculture in the hill state. In the past, farmers in some areas of the Kumaon division had started agitations against the growing monkey menace. The state government has been conducting sporadic campaigns to catch monkeys and sterilise them. Each sterilisation procedure costs the state exchequer around Rs 700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-catch-stray-monkeys-house-them-in-open-forest-enclosures/story-KGgKcpVFDYIQq2PbbgZGJK.html
18-09-2020||Lucknow||Covid-19: UP returnees take to mushroom farming||Mushroom farming, one of the most profitable agri-business, is turning out to be an alternative means of livelihood for many migrants, who came back to Uttar Pradesh (UP) after being rendered jobless during the 68-day-long coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced nation-wide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25.Officials of the state horticulture department and Krishi Vigyan Kendra, which is a part of National Agricultural Research System (NARS), said they were flooded with queries and applications related to mushroom farming.The trendPerhaps, Lucknow is the first place in UP to witness the “unusual” trend, according to agricultural experts. “We are flooded with queries related to mushroom farming. Though it has always been a profitable venture but never before have we witnessed such enthusiasm among people. And what is common among the query seekers is that a majority of them are youths and many of them are migrants,” said Meena Maurya, district horticulture officer.State horticulture department officials said around 140 among the query-seekers have got themselves registered for the mushroom farming training programme, which would start from Monday (September 21).“Mushroom season lasts between September and March. By the time we will be starting our training session, I am sure many more will apply for the training programme that aims to impart correct technique to the mushroom farmers in a bid to help increase their yield to the maximum,” said Dr SK Chauhan, an official of the state horticulture department. Besides Lucknow, mushroom farming is done in almost all its neighbouring districts, including Sitapur, Hardoi, Sultanpur, Faizabad, Barabanki etc.Only ray of hopeSankalp Kumar, a migrant worker, who belongs to a remote village in UP’s Bareilly district and had returned to his native place from Gujarat in May because of the viral outbreak, said: “It’s been over four months since I returned to my village after I had left by job in Ahmedabad. In such a situation when there is no job, mushroom farming, which is quite common in my village, seems to be the only option to explore. I have heard that profit in this farming activity is quite high, while the investment is very low.”Other migrants, who live in rural parts of Lucknow and in the adjoining districts, also said that the mushroom farming was the only ray of hope for them to earn their livelihood amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Cab owners, traders also among applicants Others who suffered losses in the contagion such as cab, travel agency owners and garment traders have also applied for mushroom farming training programme, said state horticulture department officials.The authorities at Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Lucknow, confirmed the discernible trend. “The enthusiasm is going to take mushroom farming to another level. We have received around 250 applications and expect more by the time the training programme starts on Monday,” said Deepak Rai, a subject matter expert (SME) at KVK, Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR)-Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR), Lucknow.Why mushroom farming?“When compared to other crops, mushroom farming is not only cost effective but it also gives much more profit,” said Rai. In UP, farmers largely deal in three variants of mushrooms — button, oyster and milky. Of them, oyster mushrooms are the cheapest .“Any person, who has a 10 feet (ft) by 10 ft room can start oyster mushroom farming with zero investment. A crop can yield mushrooms for up to 25 days. A kilogram (kg) of oyster mushroom is sold for Rs 300 or more depending on its demand in the market,” Rai added.Milky mushroom is also in great demand but the investment in the trade is a little higher, as compared to oyster mushroom. While the button mushroom farming is the costliest affair as it entails an initial investment of up to Rs 2 lakh.“But at the same time, it is sold at a much higher price. One kg of button mushroom costs between Rs 400 and Rs 500,” he added.Health benefits of mushroom*Checks Cholesterol Levels: Mushrooms are full of lean proteins and have negligible fat or cholesterol. They are a great source of chitin and beta-glucan that are fibres which keep a check on a person’s cholesterol levels*Maintains Bone Health: Mushrooms contain abundant calcium, an essential nutrient to maintain strong bones*Boosts Immune System: Out of the many antioxidants present in mushrooms, ergothioneine is an antioxidant that is effective in protecting a human body from any free radicals. Mushrooms also contain natural antibiotic and anti-fungal properties that help get rid of various infections *Good for Diabetics: “Mushroom is a superfood for those suffering from blood sugar. Mushroom is a good source for chromium, which helps maintain blood sugar levels, and keeps a check on insulin,” said Dr Simran Saini. Besides, mushroom is low on both carbohydrate and fat*Helps in Weight Loss: Mushrooms contain a lot of fibre that helps in improving digestion and keeps metabolism in check. *Button mushrooms are very low in calories: They offer essential protein and amino acids, sufficient levels of mineral, vitamins and fibre. They carry vitamin D in the form of ergocalciferol. Vitamin D is an essential fat-soluble vitamin required for bone growth and calcium metabolism. It contains excellent levels of selenium, copper, phosphorus, zinc, and potassium||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-19-up-returnees-take-to-mushroom-farming/story-APNhcKTW5z0Xa3DtXF8H5O.html
18-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to bring bill to make wearing face masks in public compulsory||The Uttarakhand government will table a bill in the upcoming state assembly session to make wearing facemasks in public compulsory and impose penalty on violators. A decision to this effect was taken during a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in Dehradun on Thursday.The assembly session starts from September 23. The decision was taken amid the soaring Covid-19 cases that have crossed 37,000-mark in the state on Thursday.However, no media briefing on the cabinet decision was held by the government citing the upcoming assembly session, because as per tradition, important policy-related decisions taken by government days before any assembly session have to be revealed in the House only.According to a senior government official privy to the developments, 32 proposals were discussed in the cabinet meeting out of which 30 were approved.“The government will bring a bill before the House to make the wearing of masks in public a law amid the ongoing pandemic. Under the bill, a violator of the same will have to pay a fine,” said the official.Also Read: Covid-19: 73 prisoners test positive in Uttarakhand’s Sitarganj jail The government had earlier passed an ordinance on the same during the lockdown.

Also read: ‘No quarantine for those who leave state and return within 96 hours,’ says Assam govtFrom Monday, classes will resume for students between Grade IX and XII for the next 15 days following which the situation will be reviewed. While all government schools will start functioning, private school authorities have been asked to take a call on their own. “Our SOP is meant for all categories of schools. It is for the private school authorities to decide when they want to resume their classes,” said Phanindra Jidung, director, secondary education department, Assam. “Students’ attendance in schools is not mandatory. Parents and guardians need to give their consent in writing following which students will be allowed to attend classes. The situation will be reviewed after 15 days taking into account all issues,” he added. The SOP stated that while students from Grade IX to XII would attend schools, all other classes would remain suspended. Classes for Grade IX and XII students would be held on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while Grade X and XI students would attend on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, it added. Students’ strength in each classroom should not be more than 20 at any time. If any class has more than 20 students, they should be divided into two batches. The first batch of students will attend school from 9 am to 12 noon, while students from the second batch will have their classes between 1 pm and 4 pm. The SOP stated that the total number of teaching and non-teaching staff should not exceed 50% and students with co-morbid conditions have been exempted from attending their classes. Schools will be in constant touch with district authorities for regular monitoring, random testing of teachers and students on a weekly basis. “The government has assured that all necessary precautions, including Covid-19 tests of teachers, have been taken. Our teachers will be resuming classes from Monday,” said Syed Anisur Rahman, general secretary, Assam higher secondary teachers and employees’ association. Prior to reopening of schools, government teachers underwent Covid-19 tests across the state and only those found negative and not having any other health complications will be allowed to take classes. Classrooms are also being sanitised. “We have planned online tests between September 25 and October 19. There won’t be any classes in our school until the Durga Puja, which starts on October 22. Any decision on resumption of classes will be taken after that,” said Geeta Dutta Barua, the principal of Guwahati-based Srimanta Sankar Academy, a private school. Jonali Das, the principal of Modern English School, another Guwahati-based private school, said they would start holding regular classes for Grade IX to XII students from September 25. But online classes would simultaneously be held. “I am not comfortable with the idea of sending students to school at this time. We will wait for a few more weeks before taking a decision on whether to send my son for his regular classes,” said the father of a Grade X student of a private school in Guwahati. Assam has recorded 1,50,349 Covid-19 positive cases to date, including 1,21,610 recoveries and 528 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-schools-in-assam-to-reopen-from-september-21/story-aiOQoazI8AaFW05gvvQG3M.html

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s farmers fear new regime will end assured procurement under MSP||Ever since two farm bills and an amendment in the Essential Commodities Act promulgated by the Narendra Modi-led cabinet in June, there has been simmering discontent among farmers in Punjab. Much to the anger of the farmers, the three bills were debated and passed in the Lok Sabha this week. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), a party with a predominantly rural base in Punjab and one of the oldest allies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), withdrew its sole representative in the Union cabinet, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who held the charge of food processing industries. Know more about the issue that threatens to snowball into a political agitation. WHAT ARE FARMERS OPPOSING?Farmers see the three bills, namely the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Protection and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020; as detrimental to their interest. Farmers fear the amendments will destroy the farm produce procurement system in agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana. WHY ARE FARMERS UPSET? With the passage of the bills, mandis or grain markets will become redundant, which means market forces will take over. Farmers fear exploitation, says agriculture expert Devinder Sharma. 70% of the mandis in Punjab are dependent on income from the sale of agricultural produce. The impact is visible as basmati exporters are demanding cut in taxes such as mandi fee and rural development fund. Next in the line would be cotton ginning mills that would seek waiver from taxes. The new regime will bring an end to assured and open-ended procurement that means the system of minimum support price (MSP) will see a burial. WHAT IS THEIR LINE OF ACTION NOW? Farmer outfits in Punjab are united and have planned long-drawn protests to mount pressure on the government to revoke the bills. They plan protests till October. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, farmers are coming out in large numbers to protest. Political parties have joined the agitation with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh even ordering the cancellation of cases against farm activists for violating prohibitory orders by protesting against the bills. After Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal quitting the Union cabinet, the Akalis are expected to launch protests, too. WHY ARE THE POLITICAL STAKES HIGH?  Being an agrarian state, political stakes for all parties over this issue are high in Punjab. Farmers form a decisive group of the electorate. All parties have come out in their support. The Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party are convinced that farmers can turn the tide in their favour with the state going to the polls in 2022. The state BJP is sticking to its party’s central unit stand that in the long run, the bills will benefit of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-farmers-fear-new-regime-will-end-assured-procurement-under-msp/story-HHyTadlLupGU4QdnQ6kXbJ.html
18-09-2020||Dehradun||CM Rawat says Haridwar Kumbh will be numerically restricted, entry passes to be issued||The 2021 Haridwar Kumbh will be held with a restriction on the number of people congregating for the event, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Friday. “Passes will be issued to devotees as the congregation will be numerically restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic,” Rawat told reporters here at a virtual interaction. Rawat said he had discussed the matter with saints and seers and they were in agreement with the idea of reducing the scale of the event numerically owing to the coronavirus pandemic.It will be for the first time in the history of Kumbh Mela that passes will be issued to devotees for entry to the religious congregation, arguably the largest of its kind in the world. “A numerically restricted Kumbh makes it necessary that devotees are allowed entry into the Kumbh fair on the basis of passes,” Rawat said.   The chief minister who was interacting with the media on completing three and a half years in office also said the limit of 5.5 metres imposed recently by the Supreme Court on the width of the Chardham all weather road was not enough from the strategic point of view.  “From the strategic or national security point of view we can’t make do with a 5.5 metre wide all weather road which passes through several border districts located in the hills. The smooth movement of troops by a road with this kind of limit is not possible,” Rawat said. The chief minister said he had drawn the attention of the Centre to this aspect of the apex court’s order and emphasised on the indispensability of a wider all weather road. Rawat described the constitution of the Chardham Devasthanam Management Board as the biggest reformative step taken during the last 3.5 years. “The board has been constituted after a lot of thinking and everyone including tourists, visitors and teerth-purohits are bound to benefit from the decision,” he said. Rawat also highlighted the declaration of Gairsain as the summer capital of the state as a major achievement of his government as it fulfils a long cherished aspiration of the people who fought for statehood.  “By declaring Gairsain the summer capital we have proved that we are a decisive government capable of resolving issues hanging fire for long,” Rawat said.  “In the last three and a half years we have accelerated development by delivering a blow to corruption and giving a clean and transparent government to people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/cm-rawat-says-haridwar-kumbh-will-be-numerically-restricted-entry-passes-to-be-issued/story-Qrti7wDz4ZIA4Rp4VTYthL.html

18-09-2020||Mumbai||How many farmers benefitted from loan waiver: HC asks Maharashtra||The Bombay high court, while directing Maharashtra to inform it how many farmers have benefitted from the Mahatma Phule Loan Waiver Scheme which was implemented in 2019, has also sought an explanation as to why the scheme has not been implemented in its entirety for the 3.5 million beneficiary farmers, as alleged by BJP leader and MLA Ashish Shelar in a public interest litigation. Though the state opposed the PIL stating that the BJP leader had recourse to the Right to Information (RTI) Act to know the exact number of farmers who had benefitted from the scheme, the court directed it to file an affidavit enumerating the same and posted the PIL for hearing on October 15. A division bench of justice J K Tated and justice N R Borkar, while hearing the PIL, was informed by senior counsel Rajendra Pai representing Shelar that though there were more than 15 million farmers in the state, the scheme was to benefit around 3.5 million lakh farmers who had a loan amount of up to Rs 2 lakh. Pai informed the court that after it came to light through media reports that only around 1.5 million farmers had benefitted from the scheme since its implementation, Shelar had sought to know why all the beneficiary farmers had not got the benefit and hence raised the question in the state assembly on numerous occasions. However, as he did not get a satisfactory answer on the number of farmers benefitting from the scheme, he was left with no other option but to approach the court. Additional government pleader Geeta Shastri however submitted that being an MLA Shelar, could easily have got the information by applying before the concerned department under the RTI Act and there was no need for him to approach the HC. She further added that the PIL was based on media reports and not actual figures which were available with the concerned department. After hearing the submissions the court said that even though the figures quoted in the PIL were based on media reports, the state could inform the court and the petitioner as to the actual number of farmers who benefitted from the scheme since its implementation. It also directed the state to submit the same in an affidavit and allowed Shelar to file a rejoinder to the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-many-farmers-benefitted-from-loan-waiver-hc-asks-maharashtra/story-khRRljH36nUPD7GaENlszO.html

The hostel was constructed in 2010-11 when Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)-led government was in power. The hostel is located adjacent to Raj Nagar Extension Master Plan road and is a part of the Nandgram locality. On Thursday, BSP chief and former UP chief minister Mayawati tweeted that it was unfortunate that the multi-storeyed Dr Ambedkar SC/ST Hostel would be converted into UP’s first detention centre for illegal foreigners. She described the decision as painful and condemned the Yogi Adityanath-led government’s move.Also Read: No ‘exclusive’ detention centres, government tells Parliament Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate (DM), Ghaziabad, announced late at night on Thursday that he has scrapped the bid to convert the hostel into a detention centre for illegal foreigners. “The building will continue to be used as a hostel for SC/ST students. It was proposed to convert the building into a detention centre for foreigners, who are living illegally in the state without valid visas etc. We will find a new suitable place for the proposed centre,” the DM said. Initially, students from western UP and other districts in the state were staying at the hostel, but of late it has been lying vacant. Officials said the decision to convert the facility into a detention centre was taken by the Ghaziabad district authorities in 2017. Later, the state social welfare department had issued a notification to this effect following which the police’s housing development unit started the preparations to turn it into a detention centre. Earlier in June, the hostel students had also submitted representations to the district administration when the facility was proposed to be converted into a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) care centre (CCC) because of a spike in the viral outbreak cases in Ghaziabad.However, the bid to convert the hostel into a CCC was rolled back later. The hostel has 250 beds and SC/ST students, who are pursuing college education in the district, are allowed to stay at the facility for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-sc-st-hostel-to-stay-up-s-first-detention-centre-to-come-up-in-another-location/story-WYEvbB6nQYC99AKuWPnxKK.html

His counsel, advocate Prashant Pandey, claimed that the medicines were available only with six suppliers in Mumbai.Besides, people are forced to pay exorbitant amounts for these medicines, Pandey said. For example, he said, Remdesivir 100 injection has the maximum retail price of Rs 3,000, but is being sold in black market for over Rs 30,000, and therefore it was necessary that the injections and the tablet is made available directly at the Covid care centres.Government pleader Purnima Kantharia said one of the prayers of the petitioner was to also make the medicines available over the counter at medical stores and it will have to be seen if it was permissible and feasible.The bench posted the PIL for further hearing on October 6.Mirani has said in his PIL that Maharashtra is the worst affected state in India, both in terms of Covid-19 infections and the number of deaths caused by corona virus. But, the state authorities did not place orders for these drugs approved for sale in India on June 22, 2020, and bulk of the doses have gone to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Assam and private hospitals which had placed advance orders for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-hc-asks-maharashtra-if-it-was-willing-to-make-medicines-available-for-critical-patients/story-Y3bLf11edESGQYBBSAstFO.html

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||High court dismisses plea seeking direction to Punjab Police to book Kangana for social media post||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed a plea seeking direction to Punjab Police for the registration of a criminal case against actor Kangana Ranaut for her alleged social media post on the promotion of beef consumption. The plea was filed by a Ludhiana resident, Navneet Gopi, who had told the court that he had submitted a complaint to probe her social media posts. But Ludhiana police had not acted on the same. He claimed that he was being threatened by her supporters. He said that she had outraged the religious feelings of a section of society by intentionally putting a post on social media to promote beef consumption. He demanded the registration of an FIR against her under the Punjab Prohibition of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955, Sections 66 and 67 of Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 295-A Indian Penal Code, 1860 (deliberate act to hurt religious feelings). The court on Thursday observed that her post does not prima facie suggest that it amounts to commission of an offence punishable under Section 295-A of the IPC, in any manner. “On the contrary, the post describes the person as vegetarian, therefore, it cannot be construed at all, that it promotes consumption of beef much less by way of an advice,” the bench added. As of threats to the petitioner, the court observed that it has not at all been described as to how and in what manner the alleged threat was extended to him. “The petition is vague and misconceived,” the bench said, dismissing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-direction-to-punjab-police-to-book-kangana-for-social-media-post/story-XPmPDX4PKzx3ZvG1JnLTxN.html

18-09-2020||Lucknow||Biennial security audit planned for UP jails after 2 prisoners escape||The UP prisons administration and reform services department is preparing a proposal for a security audit of each jail in the state after every two years. This, they hope, will plug security lapses that creep in with time, said senior prison officials.The proposal follows the daring escape of two under-trials from the Rae Bareli district jail. Prison officials said that the security audit proposal will soon be sent to the state government for clearance.Director general (prisons) Anand Kumar said that prison officials are carrying out a survey across 72 jails in the state before finalising the security audit proposal.“Although no changes could be done in the design and layout of old jails, some constraints, which develop with time, can be removed by making small changes,” he said.Kumar added that most jails in the state are housed in old buildings, making it likely for any weakness to appear. He said a regular biennial audit may help strengthen security in jails.Another prison official privy to the development said the security audit mainly comprises checking the drain passages to see if it can be used to escape, checking the strength and height of boundary walls and availability of any instrument that could be used to dig a tunnel.Also Read: Hindu Yuva Vahini leader found stabbed to death in UP’s BareillyHe explained that the drain passage often widens due to the flow of water or plaster and bricks of drain walls get removed, making it susceptible to further weakening to plan an escape.“18 to 22 feet high boundary walls are a routine feature in jails but the height decreases with the rising ground level inside and outside the premises. We have to measure the ground level after a certain time period to ensure the height remains the same,” the official emphasised.He added that the security audit also inspects if dust or mud is collecting alongside the boundary walls or if there is any possibility of collecting bricks inside the premises. Other mandatory features like the security drill, deployment of jail guards, video surveillance and erecting of watch towers and no-man’s zone alongside the jail walls will also be checked during the audit, the official said.

After he and other leaders had to leave the banks of the Hooghly river on Wednesday, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said, “Mamata Banerjee does not forget Friday rituals and Muharram. But she is always against the Hindus. Is it a crime to observe Hindu rituals in West Bengal?” The picture changed on the occasion of Mahalaya on Thursday when millions of people across the state assembled at riverbanks to take part in Tarpan, a Vedic ritual Hindus hold to pay homage to their forefathers. Politicians followed them in the poll-bound state without any hindrance.BJP state women’s wing president Agnimitra Paul led members of the Mahila Morcha in a ritual held on the banks of the Mahananda river in Siliguri. “I paid tribute to 112 party workers who have been killed by the TMC since 2011,” she said.

BJP state vice-president Raju Banerjee offered prayers in waist-deep water in another part of the district. “We paid homage to all TMC workers killed over the decades,” said Santra. “They are killing our workers and offering Tarpan at the same time.

Following the development, jail administration went into a tizzy with these fresh cases as they had restricted the entry and exit in jail premises. Jail administration is now searching for a safe place for isolating these infected jail inmates, officials said. Earlier on September 9, 51 jail inmates and one jail staffer of Nainital district jail had tested positive in the RT-PCR test for the Covid-19 virus. “73 inmates and a jail guard have tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday. Infected inmates have been isolated in jail premises till they are shifted to isolation centres,” said Dadhi Ram Maurya, superintendent, Central Jail Sitarganj. He said samples of 112 inmates were collected on Sunday from the jail. “The inmates were suffering from viral fever and cold. Around 700 inmates are housed here,” he said. He said when they observed some inmates were suffering from viral fever, cold and cough. , they were isolated from the rest of the inmates and health officials were called for collecting samples as a precautionary measure. Maurya said, “It is a matter of probe that when the entry and exit from jail premises is absolutely banned how the infection spread in the inmates. The health department must look into the matter.” He informed that despite the inspector general (IG) jail’s instructions that those inmates who are Covid-19 negative, should be permitted two meetings in a month with their relatives, jail administration is not permitting inmates due to fear of the Covid-19 outbreak. DS Panchpal, chief `medical officer, US Nagar said, “Since these are jail inmates they will be isolated in a secure place. We have informed the administration about it and wherever administration suggests we will shift them,” Notably, 5 inmates in Sitarganj jail had tested positive in May and June.

18-09-2020||Mumbai||After no response from Gujarat, Maharashtra approaches Telangana for two pairs of lions||Maharashtra forest department, which has been rebuffed by Gujarat for the past three years for the transfer of Asiatic Lions from its Gir National Park, has decided to turn to other states such as Telangana to increase the lion population at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Borivli, Mumbai. The department will send a proposal to the Telangana forest department next week requesting the authorities concerned for two pairs of lions to be sent to SGNP from Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad.The Hyderabad-based park has 15 lions, including two African cubs born in April. Also Read: Centre to launch projects for lion, dolphin conservationForest officials said Telangana authorities have given a positive response and asked for a proposal. “I have spoken to the Telangana principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF). Lions can be brought from Hyderabad. They have asked for a proposal. SGNP authorities were asked to submit their requirements. We will be sending our proposal to the Telangana officials by next week,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra.G Mallikarjuna, conservator of forests, SGNP, said they sent the proposal to the PCCF’s office in Nagpur on Wednesday.“The public can enjoy the lion safari more if the animal’s population in the park can be increased. Perhaps, an in-house breeding programme will help increase the lion’s population,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF) (wildlife-west).Also Read: Indian Navy develops Mumbai’s largest Miyawaki urban forestAt present, SGNP is home to three lions — a male, Ravindra (17); its brother and sister Jespa and Gopa, who are both nine years old. Forest officers said all three hybrid lions -- a cross between Asiatic and African -- and their parents were brought to the park from abandoned circuses. The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) does not allow inbreeding of wild cats and has also directed states to ensure that breeding of hybrid lions was phased out. “In such circumstances, the park needs at least two pairs of lions to have a healthy population,” said Mallikarjuna.In August, Maharashtra minister for forest Sanjay Rathod had submitted a proposal to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to request Gujarat and the Centre to expedite the process of transferring at least one lion to SGNP, preferably a female. “We are still pursuing the case with the Gujarat authorities, but they have not responded positively so far,” said Kakodkar.Though transfer of lions from other states was planned earlier, it proved to be a non-starter, In July 2018, then Karnataka forest minister R Shankar had visited SGNP to view facilities and also discussed the possible exchange of lions and rusty spotted cats from Bannerghatta National Park and Mysore Zoo. Shankar had then told HT they had agreed for the transfer but subsequently when a final proposal was sent, Karnataka rejected it as SGNP did not have required animals to offer in an exchange programme.Limaye said SGNP authorities had also requested Kakodkar that sub-adult tigers from Chandrapur district, which is prone to human-animal conflict and accounts for 56% of Maharashtra’s tiger population, be sent to the national park in Mumbai.“This could help us improve our tiger population. Nagpur’s Gorewada Rescue Centre has reached its capacity and releasing these big cats at other sanctuaries may not be a safe option. They can be rehabilitated at SGNP. The PCCF has agreed to our proposal,” he said. SGNP is home to five Royal Bengal tigers, including four females, who are aged between eight and 10 years and are called Mastani, Bijlee and Laxmi. The other tigress Basanti is 20 years old. Sultan (4) is the lone male tiger. “The tigresses are dominant and steer clear of Sultan or don’t allow it to come close to them. As a result, translocation of sub-adult big cats is essential for the park and the future of safaris,” said a forest official requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-no-response-from-gujarat-maharashtra-approaches-telangana-for-two-pairs-of-lions/story-2Y0xYoH9YnMvytpvpgwNxI.html

18-09-2020||Kolkata||TMC to challenge ban on Chhath puja at Kolkata lake, BJP supports move||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday ruled that Chhath puja will not be allowed under any circumstance at Kolkata’s famous Rabindra Sarobar lakes which are considered to be the lungs of south Kolkata. Amid Opposition allegations that Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee was eyeing the votes of Hindi-speaking people, the Kolkata Municipal Development Authority (KMDA) recently appealed to the NGT to relax its order banning Chhath puja rituals at Rabindra Sarobar in south Kolkata. The KMDA appealed for relaxation in the ban for only a day in view of people’s sentiments. The KMDA also told the court that it would take measures to control pollution at the lakes. The puja will be held on November 19 and 20. Despite the ban, hundreds of devotees broke open the gates of Rabindra Sarobar in November 2019 to perform the rituals. They even busted crackers and played drums at the Sarobar although the government had earmarked alternative water bodies in the city for conduct of the rituals. The incident made headlines and triggered a huge controversy. The word Chhath means six. The festival is dedicated to Lord Surya (Sun God) and Chhathi Maiya, who is known to be the sister of Lord Surya. This festival is celebrated mostly in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi. Devotees express their gratitude towards Lord Surya and perform important rituals over a span of four days. “We will move the Supreme Court,” said West Bengal’s urban development minister Firhad Hakim on Thursday afternoon, drawing strong reaction from political parties and environment experts. Interestingly, TMC got support on this issue from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has a substantial vote bank in areas dominated by Hindi-speaking people. “Performing the puja is a fundamental right of the people. There can be restrictions on dropping flowers etc in the water but nobody can ban the ritual entirely,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. The Congress attacked the chief minister saying she has politicized religious festivals to get votes. “Mamata Banerjee has politicized the festivals of Bengal. Did the Bihari people ever tell her that they would not vote for TMC unless they were allowed to pollute the waters of Rabindra Sarobar? They never did that. Similarly, Muslims never asked her to stop immersion of Durga idols to allow Muharram processions. Banerjee is doing these proactively. She thinks this will help her secure Muslim and Bihari votes,” said West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Coronavirus pandemic: Forests in West Bengal to open for tourists for festive season, guidelines to be issuedCovering 192 acres of artificial lakes and with 7,000 trees, some of which were badly damaged by cyclone Amphan in May, Rabindra Sarobar is a birders’ paradise. At least 200 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted here by the city’s birders. It is also home to numerous types of fish and animals. The NGT passed an order in 2018 banning Chhath puja at Rabindra Sarobar after environment activists and wildlife lovers started a movement. The petition was moved by noted environment activist Subhas Dutta. Also Read: Will ensure fair polls in Bengal, says governor Dhankhar.

On Monday, the TMC launched an all-new three-tier Hindi cell while India observed Hindi Diwas. The cell will have separate committees at state, district and community block levels.

Government employees in their respective countries, both were part of a scholarship programme organised by the Italian government in the mid-80s, in which 50 participants from 30 countries stayed together in a hotel in Naples. Six months later, all went back to their places. Decades rolled along and the Italian sojourn became a distant memory. Mr Padhy retired as a senior bureaucrat in the central government in 2013, and settled down with wife, Usha, at their 12th floor apartment in Noida’s Sector 121. He did mention the Naples friendship to his family, once or twice, but never extensively. “It had become a dead chapter of my life.”Mr Padhy, 67, is chatting on WhatsApp video.And then the coronavirus pandemic arrived, forcing the couple to stay cooped at home. “I started writing about stories from my life,” says Mr Padhy. And one of the stories that surfaced was about… you guessed it!The first reader of ‘Down the memory lane: An Unforgettable Encounter’ was his wife, who convinced Mr Padhy to share the account with their daughter, Priyanka, who lives in Sarita Vihar. She, in her turn, convinced her father to share it within the extended family’s WhatsApp group. The story is moving. Two people from traditionally hostile nations strike a friendship in a foreign land. Mr Padhy was in his early 30s then, and his friend in his early 50s. Often missing their home while in Italy, they would find consolation in each other by talking of their families. The ghazals of Chitra Singh and Jagjit Singh were a common passion. A scene from the story’s finale is particularly poignant: “As the moment to part finally arrived, Mr Moghul gave me a tight embrace and wished customary ‘Khuda Hafeez’ in a voice choking with emotion. Then he said something in a whispering tone which is still reverberating in my mind after all these years. Said he and I quote ‘Pramod, I am a Muslim and do not believe in rebirth. But you are a Hindu and you believe in rebirth. If there is something like rebirth, I would like to have you as my younger brother in my next life.’”Mr Padhy says he never got in touch with his friend after returning from Italy. “Somewhere, the friendship lives inside me. Maybe it is too late now to think of meeting him again. He must be in his 90s. But if we happen to meet, I’m sure he will instantly recognise me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/remembrance-of-friendship-past/story-UbE2rhWG62S2gp1tvBiWSL.html

The three suspects were arrested on Wednesday morning after the police identified them through CCTV footage, said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (eastern range). Police said the girl’s brother-in-law suffered cuts in his palm while trying to fight off the alleged rapists, but the injury was not serious.The crime took place around 10pm on Tuesday. “They got off a bus near Mandoli Jail and were walking through a deserted street when the three suspects accosted them and harassed the girl,” said another senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified.“When the girl admonished them, they pulled out knives and forcibly led the duo to an under-construction building nearby where the three raped the teenager,” said the officer.Her brother-in-law tried to put up a fight by reaching out for the knife of one of the suspects, but he suffered a cut to his hand. “While leaving the crime scene, the suspects also took away the girl’s purse,” the officer added.As soon as the suspects fled on a motorcycle, the victims raised an alarm, drawing the attention of a police team patrolling nearby.“Based on the description provided by the survivor, the police team immediately began hunting for the suspects and soon spotted them not far from the crime spot. The police launched a chase that lasted three kilometres before the suspects found themselves cornered. They abandoned their motorcycle and ran into the streets and disappeared,” said JCP Kumar.The police recovered the survivor’s robbed purse from the spot where the motorcycle was left abandoned. Tracking registration of the bike, the police got to know that it had been stolen. “We then checked CCTV footage from the crime spot to the point they left their motorcycle. One camera had captured the suspects. We showed the images to local residents and people with criminal records. That helped us identify them,” said JCP Kumar.The officer identified the suspects as Rajeev, Shehzad and Ikram – all aged between 25 and 30 and residents of north-east Delhi and Ghaziabad.While Rajeev had once been arrested under the Arms Act by the south-east Delhi district police, the other two men had no criminal antecedents.The police have registered a case of gang rape, robbery and assault at Harsh Vihar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/17-year-old-girl-gang-raped-in-north-east-delhi-three-suspects-arrested/story-UvQxSkpwaoOhC1HV3Ye1yH.html

Police are scanning her bank lockers and wardrobes.Meanwhile, there is no trace of her husband, the prime suspect, and their 9-year-old son, even as three police teams were sent to Punjab.The statement of the 13-year-old boy was recorded before the magistrate, in which he reiterated that he was pushed into Neelon canal by his father. The teen, who is now with his paternal grandfather at Fatehgarh Sahib, told the police he was worried about the well-being of his brother. “My nine-year-old brother was sleeping on the back seat of the car when I last saw him,” he told the police and has been enquiring about his sibling time and again. PUSHED INTO CANAL, LEFT FOR DEADIt was his birthday on September 15 and his father Mandeep Singh, 42, had told him that they will be celebrating his birthday at the gurdwara when they left the city a day prior. Mandeep had driven the two brothers to Ludhiana after telling them their mother had contracted Covid-19 and had to be isolated. He had then drugged the boys and pushed his elder son into the Neelon canal late that night. “I shouted for help but there was no one around. After flowing along the stream for some distance, I managed to catch hold of a tree branch,” he told the police. The child was rescued on September 15 on his birthday by some people at Gurdwara Katana Sahib and police were informed.The murder of 40-year-old Jyoti Rani came to light on September 16 when the Ludhiana police came knocking at her Chandigarh house to drop her son. Ranis decomposed body was found wrapped in a blanket on a blood-stained bed at her government accommodation.WELL-BEING OF CHILD PRIORITY: POLICE “The well-being of the nine-year-old is our priority.

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Sexual harassment at CLTA: UT Police put on notice on complaint of minor girl’s father||A local court has put the Chandigarh Police on notice, seeking the status report on a complaint by the father of a minor girl, who was allegedly sexually harassed by five trainees at the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) complex in August 2019. The father has sought an FIR against 17 persons, including officers of the CLTA, Sector 10, Chandigarh Academy of Rural Tennis (CHART), All-India Tennis Association, the then Sector-3 SHO and the UT SSP, alleging that they failed to act as per the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. In August 2019, five CHART trainees at CLTA were booked for allegedly outraging modesty, sexually harassing and stalking three minor tennis players. In a fresh complaint filed on September 15, a 48-year-old Mohali resident, complained that his minor daughter was among the three girls sexually harassed and stalked by at least five trainees. The complainant said the issue was brought to the notice of CLTA officers, but they gave “false assurances” and acts of sexual harassment did not stop. “On July 22, 2019, the aggressors molested my daughter,” he said. He said that several complaints were given to these persons, who are seniors IAS officers of Punjab and Haryana cadre, but they “failed to act and discharge their duties” as per law. “These persons have gone to the extent to shield the aggressors, who violated self-respect of my minor daughter, entailing molestation, sexual assault and harassment,” the complainant said. Seeking a fair investigation, the complainant said these “highly influential” persons were “responsible for criminal conspiracy to commit the offence of cheating and forgery apart from their failure to report and act as per the provisions of section 19 and 21 of the POCSO Act.” He said he had filed a police complaint in February and July, but received no response, hence he moved the court. The complainant has sought an FIR under Sections 17 (abetment), 18 (attempt to commit an offence) and 19 (reporting of offences) and 21 (failure to report or record a case) of the POCSO Act, and Sections 415 (cheating), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 463 (forgery), 465 (forgery) and 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The case will next come up for hearing on October 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sexual-harassment-at-clta-ut-police-put-on-notice-on-complaint-of-minor-girl-s-father/story-2FoU9KkfaX6r1eQGn7HmBN.html

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Upstaged by Covid: Ramlila troupes await word from Chandigarh administration on shows this year||By this time of the year, Ramlila troupes in the city get ready with the warpaint and glittering costumes to stage episodes from the epic Ramayana for 10 days prior to Dussehra, which falls on October 25 in 2020. This time, however, with the Covid-19 outbreak, no rehearsals are taking place as the city’s regular Ramlila organisations await word from the UT administration on plans for the festive season. “Around 25 Ramlila organisations from the city have already applied for permissions to the Chandigarh administration to stage shows, but we are yet to hear from the officials. We are waiting for relaxations to be announced on September 21, which will bring more clarity on Ramlilas this year,” says Bhagwati Prashad Gaur, president of the Chandigarh Kendriya Ramleela Mahasabha, the umbrella organisation of the city’s Ramlila troupes.Gaur feels festivities should be allowed for a welcome distraction from the suffering caused by Covid-19. “We are ready to follow all safety related instructions by the government. It won’t be fair to cancel the shows because many people in the city are not following basic precautions.” However, even if the shows are cancelled, aarti will be done every day at the spots where performances take place. “The annual function to adjudge the best Ramlila of the year can be held online,” suggests Gaur.Banking on online performancesAshok Chaudhry, advisor to the Joint Ram Leela Sangh, well known in the city for the role of Ravana he performs every year for the Azad Dramatics Club in Sector 20, says in case the shows are not allowed, most troupes are open to live stream their performances online during the Navratras. “Although we have applied for license, we are already thinking of hosting 30- to 45-minute Ramlila web episodes. We will cover some of the main events with a few old actors who already know all the lines so rehearsals won’t be necessary,” he adds.Shorter showsJyoti Bardwaj, chief organiser of the Sector 29 Ramlila, says show timings can be cut short or allowed for one day before Dussehra. “A two- to three-hour function with social distancing rules imposed strictly can be held and main episodes from Ramayana staged then.” Some troupes, however, have chosen to sit this one out. “Even if permission is granted it will be tough to maintain social distancing. We don’t want to be responsible for a breakout of Covid. There have been no rehearsals till now and it is very likely we won’t organise a Ramlila this year,” says Deepak Kaushik, general secretary of the Panjab University Ramlila.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/upstaged-by-covid-ramlila-troupes-await-word-from-chandigarh-administration-on-shows-this-year/story-baBNzpxOccaviZexDe3kFJ.html

The MLA also looked into the work of bio-mining, segregation, and disposal that will take place at the site.He said that Panchkula generates 150 tonnes of garbage daily and due to no disposal system in place, trash piled up. “With this plant, waste disposal will never be discontinued and manure will be made by segregating waste. Within one year, waste will be disposed of and beautification of the area will be done,” Gupta added. With the help of the bio-mining plant, organic fertilisers will be prepared.

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||2017 Maur blasts: HC orders Punjab Police’s SIT to arrest main accused in 2 weeks||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday gave two weeks to the Punjab Police’s special investigating team (SIT) to arrest the main accused in the 2017 Maur blasts, saying the probe into the case so far has been unsatisfactory. The twin blasts that occurred on January 31, 2017, ahead of the Punjab assembly elections had left seven persons dead. The high court was hearing a petition by Gurjeet Singh Patran who is demanding that probe be handed over to the National Investigating Agency (NIA) or the Central Bureau of Investigation. Since the names of some Dera Sacha Sauda followers have cropped up, the probe has slowed down, he alleged. The case, which was filed in May 2018, was disposed of by the high court in September 2018 with the court expressing satisfaction over the probe. But in the fresh application, the petitioner demanded revival of the plea alleging that main accused have still not been arrested. “All-out efforts should be made to arrest the accused within two weeks,” the bench of justices Rajiv Sharma and Arun Palli said giving liberty to the petitioner to approach a trial court. The court, however, refused to revive the petition. As per the petitioner, the vehicle used in the blasts was assembled in a workshop of the dera in Haryana’s Sirsa and two of those identified as accused were close associates of sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is undergoing a jail term in the neighbouring state in two rape cases. The petitioner has also questioned the role of SIT as it failed to interrogate Ram Rahim in the case. He has alleged that the blasts were part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to get sympathy votes in the assembly polls. The SIT has concluded the probe and challan was filed in the trial court on January 29 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/maur-blasts-hc-orders-sit-to-arrest-main-accused-in-2-weeks/story-zpyEspTTvrSY4IgVQg3F1M.html

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Government schools in Chandigarh begin preparations to partially reopen from September 21 onwards||After receiving fresh guidelines from the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), city schools are set to partially open from September 21 onwards for the first time since mid-March, and have already begun preparations to ensure that order can be maintained come Monday.The MHA guidelines state that all states/Union Territories have been permitted to call 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff for online teaching, tele-counselling and related work from September 21. The students of Classes 9 to 12 may be permitted to visit the schools on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from teachers, subject to a written consent from parents/guardians.Principal of St John’s High School, Sector 26, Kavita C Das said, “Along with facemasks, we have made face shields to cover the eyes mandatory as well.”Around 40% of the students had their parents’ consent for coming to school from Monday: “Along with sanitising the students and checking their temperatures, we will also check their blood oxygen levels using oximeters to screen for asymptomaticity. An isolation room will also be allotted within the school in case any student or faculty member feels unwell,” added Das.Admn yet to release detailed SOPThe local administration is yet to release a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for schools to follow even though the reopening is right around the corner. President of the Independent School Association and chairman of Vivek High School, Sector 38B, HS Mamik said, “We have given the administration our suggestions, but we are still waiting for the official directions.”Mamik added the administration will need to ensure their directions are applied to all schools. “In some schools, there may be only 20-30 students in a class while the number may go up to 50 in others. Instead of saying only 50% of students will be allowed in a class, a numerical limit should be set to ensure the rules can be uniformly followed,” he said.They will wait for parents’ consent before resuming school bus service, he added.Meanwhile, it is still not clear what the timings for schools will be on Monday. Speaking about this, director of Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, Atul Khanna said, “We plan to only allow students in the afternoon as classes are already going on in the mornings. We don’t want students not coming to school to suffer any disadvantage. In the afternoon, we will have two batches of students for about an hour each with half an hour of gap in between for sanitising the classes.”Khanna added that different days will be kept for different subjects like mathematics on Mondays and Hindi on Tuesdays, and students will have to seek an appointment before they are allowed to visit and ask the teachers their doubts. He added that around 25% students had volunteered to follow this norm.UT Education department holds meeting over preparations1. The UT education department held a meeting regarding the preparations on Thursday under deputy director school education Alka Mehta in which all principals and heads of all government schools participated.2. The schools have been instructed to provide for thermal screening along with preventing overcrowding and maintaining social distancing. Students and teachers residing in micro-containment zones will not be allowed to visit the schools.3. Mehta who is also acting as district education officer (DEO) said, “Canteens will remain closed and students will come in two batches of two hours each with a two-hour gap in between. Although drinking water facilities will be functional in the school, students will be asked to get their own drinking bottles to avoid touching the taps too much.”4. Director school education (DSE) Rubinderjit Singh Brar added that the department will submit a detailed proposal to the competent authority soon and a decision regarding the date and plan of reopening schools will be taken by them.5. The government schools had been asked to collect consent from parents through Google forms and WhatsApp/text messages by September 15. Around 25,000 students from 90 government schools (around 50% of the total) have submitted the consent forms.

18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid impact: PEC postpones its academic audit to 2021||Punjab Engineering College (deemed to be university) has postponed its academic audit by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The institute had planned to go for an academic audit to apply for National Assessment and Accreditation Council’s (NAAC’s) re-accreditation after it was graded B+ in 2019 for the next five years. An institute can apply for its review even earlier. Punjab Engineering College (PEC) had performed poorly during the NAAC team’s visit.It had last year applied for accreditation for the first time and got a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.71. PEC’s board of governors (BOG) in a meeting in October 2019 had decided that the institution should apply for re-accreditation after one year.According to NAAC, academic audit is a method of reviewing the quality of educational process in an institution. It is related to quality assurance and enhancing the standard of academic activities in higher education institutions (HEIs).PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi said, “The academic audit that we had planned cannot be done virtually. It needs to be done on the ground, but it has been postponed now due to Covid pandemic.”PEC, which offers eight BTech courses and 14 MTech courses to over 3,000 students, has been graded lower than Panjab University and its 10 affiliated colleges in the city, which were ranked in the past.The pandemic has also slammed brakes on the preparations for PEC’s centenary celebrations scheduled for next year.NAAC is an autonomous body funded by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to assess and accredit HEIs in India. The grades are given on the basis of seven categories, including curricular aspects, teaching, learning and evaluation, research-innovations and extension, infrastructure and learning resources, student support and progression, governance leadership and management, and institutional values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-impact-pec-postpones-its-academic-audit-for-1-year/story-MRLX3GJjFQkyA7nSJwDnhN.html

The high court bench of Chief Justice RS Jha acted on the plea of Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, a professor of the same department. The court, while issuing notice, has posted the matter for hearing on December 9. Goyal was appointed as the head of UBS upon the expiry of term of Deepak Kapur on June 30. Sharma had argued that PU violated high court order passed in 2016 in this appointment and that Goyal was not to be considered for the headship on rotation basis. He had told the court that a representation was submitted to the varsity, but his claims were not considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-stays-appointment-of-bb-goyal-as-ubs-head/story-60td7iSzBaecXwhDhomdrN.html
18-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGI employees’ body, administration at odds over ‘poor’ risk management||The employees’ union and administration of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) are at loggerheads after a number of staffers contracted Covid-19, blame of which the former pinned on ‘poor’ risk assessment. “The steep rise in Covid-19 positive cases and PGI administration are directly responsible for creating a mess that has endangered lives of institute’s staffers,” the union said in a release. The administration has refuted the allegations, stating that it is fully aware of its responsibility towards the health, safety and security of its workforce. There have been instances, the union said, where heads of department ‘forced’ those who came in contact with infected patients to continue with their duties, instead of sending them for timely risk assessment and testing. “There is no care or follow-up of patients under home quarantine. No call is made and no treatment is prescribed, no status is taken and no sanitisation is done at areas where staffers are tested positive. Similarly, 50% staff strength policy is not being followed and employees are performing duties in small and poorly ventilated rooms, despite the fact that workload is less,” the union mentioned. The employees’ body alleged that staffers and their family members were being harassed while undergoing Covid-19 test. “There is no separate screening facility for more than 15,000 employees, students and their family members,” it added. However, the institute has said that in view of some of the issues flagged by PGI Employees Union (Non Faculty) president Ashwani Kumar Munjal, it is extremely vital to share the correct information in this context and put things in perspective to allay the fears and misconceptions being spread due to these false claims. “The institute has formed a risk assessment committee comprising a senior professor from the School of Public Health. She is 24×7 available for the service and it is the result of her tireless efforts that the incidence of Covid-19 is comparatively low. Very few PGI staffers have been home quarantined and most of them have been treated in NHE and other wards designated for the staff. The requisite treatment has been provided on a case-to-case basis,” the institute spokesperson said.The areas are sanitised periodically and on demand from time to time as per the guidelines, the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgi-employees-body-administration-at-odds-over-poor-risk-management/story-gVCQfbtvf1q0Y96SevsQdJ.html

Even on Thursday, the branch was fully opened and public dealing was going on in full swing.The staff members have now lodged a complaint with the Bank of Baroda regional officer. “We got to know that our manager has been tested positive for Covid-19 and he was present at the branch on September 11 and interacted with few staff members. Two employees were also with him when he went for an inspection, so they need to be tested and other staff members and customers need to be protected in such cases. However, no action has been taken by the regional office and branch operated with full staff on Thursday also,” their complaint read. As per the Union health ministry’s directions, the entire office building needs not to be closed if one or two cases of Covid-19 are reported there and work can resume after it is disinfected as per the protocol. The guidelines state that any staffer reportedly suffering from flu like illness should not attend office and seek medical advice from local health authorities. Such persons, if diagnosed as a suspect or confirmed case of Covid-19, should immediately inform office authorities.As per the norms of Disaster Management Act, samples of all employees should be taken, limited staff should be called to the office and the premises should be completely sanitised, which, in this case, were not followed.When contacted, the branch manager said, “I tested positive on September 15, but standard operating procedures are yet to be followed by the regional office.”Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “It is against the Disaster Management Act. We will get it verified and action will be taken accordingly against the authorities concerned.Zonal head of Bank of Baroda, Mohan Lal, said, “I am not aware of the issue, but will definitely look into it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/public-dealing-in-full-swing-at-mohali-bank-despite-manager-tests-ve/story-GOzlWLc0ApIu66brREVyhO.html

18-09-2020||Mumbai||Can Mumbai’s landfills be a thing of the past, NGO Praja asks||Landfills have been the go-to answer for garbage disposal of cities in India. However, these can be source of diseases, cause frequent fires and overall an archaic way of disposal of solid waste. The pandemic has brought to forefront the importance of sanitation and hygiene as a key determinant of health. It is therefore an opportune time now, for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to streamline its solid waste management (SWM) practices and change directions to look at alternatives. Current status of SWM in Mumbai In spite of a huge budget allocated to solid waste management over the years (₹2,906 crore in 2020-21), BMC has been lagging in the nation-wide rankings under Swachh Sarvekshan. Mumbai’s 2019 rank was 49 among 100 cities (with more than 1 lakh population) fallen from 18 in 2018. The fall can be attributed to the change in methodology, which added weightage for certifications such as Star Rating. Under the Star Rating for Garbage Free Cities, Mumbai had a two-star rating in 2019, and in response to its application for five-star rating for 2020, lost all its stars, after not meeting the criteria of 100% sweeping of public areas in the third-party survey. In terms of meeting targets under the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016 (MSW rules) as well, Mumbai has been lagging behind. While the MSW rules provide for 100% segregation of waste at source it is noticed that only 83% segregation was done in 2018-19 (includes waste not segregated at source). BMC claims that 100% door-to-door collection was done in 2018-19. However, data shows that in 2019, of 17,116 SWM complaints, 36% were related to garbage not being collected. Apart from that, waste recovery and timely solving of complaints also requires attention. 73% of solid waste is food biodegradable BMC’s Environment Status Reports show that 73% of solid waste composition in Mumbai is food biodegradable waste. What is evident from a four-year trend is reduction in this food biodegradable waste through various policies that incentivise composting, have reduced the overall waste generation of the city from around 9400MTD in 2016-17 to 7450MTD in 2018-19. For example, the policy of not collecting biodegradable waste from bulk generators (units generating more than 100kg per day) started in January 2018, saw almost half (49%) of such units compost their waste by March 2019. BMC therefore needs to focus on further reducing biodegradable waste being collected and going to the landfill by incentivising and strictly implementing such measures for all waste generating units. BMC should set a 1-year target of reducing waste generation from around 7500MTD to 2000MTD by adopting a zero food biodegradable waste policy that mandates decentralised composting. This will not only enable the city government to meet its MSW rules’ target of 80% recovery of waste, but also increase the waste to compost tonnage under Swachh Bharat Mission. First, it needs to involve people in the waste management process through a mix of awareness, incentives as well as punitive measures. The need for segregation of waste, not just into food waste and dry non-biodegradable waste, but the latter into toxic waste, medical waste and recyclable waste is important, even more now with households generating medical waste due to the pandemic. Second, it needs to set up the required infrastructure and networks within six months for enabling decentralised composting. Ward 189 in F/South, Mumbai is a successful example of decentralised composting within the ward, with door-to-door collection and segregation through community involvement. BMC can look to develop constituency-wise SWM plans spearheaded by the local elected representatives and prepared with public involvement taking into consideration the demography, land-use and other constituency specific issues. Third, BMC should stop collecting food biodegradable waste from residential and commercial units in a phased manner from the eighth month, while promoting recovery of food waste. Fourth, strict monitoring of its implementation and regular reviews of the performance of individual units, non-government partners and of the constituency plans.What remains to be seen is whether BMC is able to implement radical changes in the coming years that send landfills the way of the tram – for people to remember of it as a thing of the past.

They’ve registered a complaint with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) on the exorbitant bill.Complainant Gajanan Chaudhary, 67, and his wife Gouri, said, “I receive an average bill of ₹4,000 every month. The September bill is for ₹1.47 lakh. I checked with MSEDCL. They said that the bill was correct and I could pay them in three instalments. It is not that we have not paid anything in the last six months. We’ve been paying as per the average reading.”Chaudhary said his meter was replaced in December. However, MSEDCL did not carry out any reading since January. “All my bills were cleared till December last year. After the replacement of the meter, they did not note any reading and used to charge us for average usage. Even during lockdown, there was no reading done.”MSEDCL officials, however, claimed that the bill provided to the consumer was accurate.“The electricity bill provided was accurate according to their electricity usage and meter readings. Three officers, on Wednesday, inspected the electricity meters of the consumer and found it to be accurate,” said Vijay Dudhbhate, public relations officer, MSEDCL.Dudhbhate added, “Furthermore, their meter readings were not taken until August after lockdown. The meter readings were taken on August 4. At that time, they had used 10,260 units of electricity. The unit was divided into 7 months and 5 days and they were given an accurate bill.

The construction works for the high-speed railway corridor project will include 12 stations, a 460-km long viaduct, a 7-km undersea tunnel, 26-km-long tunnels and 27 steel bridges.NHSRCL said 64% of land needed for the construction of the project has been acquired, most of which is from Gujarat and few from Maharashtra. However, the authorities have stated that the deadline for the project, which was earlier set for December 2023, would have to be reassessed, as the land acquisition process has met several roadblocks owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. “The timeline for land acquisition for the project will be rechecked due to the spread of Covid-19 in the country.

However, this will drop the maximum temperatures only by one or two degrees. The rise in humidity will make the weather further uncomfortable,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that there are, however, chances of light rainfall on September 22 and 23, which may bring some respite from the heat.Noida, along with its neighbouring areas, has been experiencing maximum temperatures higher than the season’s average since the past week due to drop in monsoon activity.The last time heavy rains were recorded in the city was on August 28, which was measured to be around 70mm. The maximum temperatures started rising after September began, from 33.2 degrees Celsius in On September 1 and 37 degrees Celsius on September 17.So far, Noida has seen an average rainfall of 68.3 mm against the expected 524.4mm, which is 87% deficit.Thursday’s maximum temperature was three notches above the season’s average against 37.9 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.1 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier.The humidity oscillated between 75% and 48%, with the day getting drier by noon.“Due to extra moisture that is set to enter the region, the humidity may increase from 75% at present to around 85 to 90% by Friday and Saturday.

A senior official said the department would focus on online systems and “perception building” measures will be adopted to project Maharashtra as a suitable investment destination. Thackeray, who held a review meeting with officials at his official residence Varsha on Thursday, said that ease of doing business was key to attract investments. In the press release issued by the CM’s office, the CM said, “Maharashtra has been the preferred investment destination in the country and ease of doing business (EoDB) plays an important role in helping the state maintain this. Our state should remain a step ahead in EoDB. For this, the department should prepare an action plan.” The statement went on to say that Maharashtra has been “the first choice for foreign investment” in the past and this should continue to be the case in the future. “For the state to flourish, more and more investors should be attracted to come to Maharashtra. The state needs to work on making ‘ease of doing business’ effective,” said the CM in the statement. With a nationwide economic slowdown and the challenges posed by the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, large-scale investment is necessary to turn the wheels of Maharashtra’s economy, said officials from the industries department. An official said, on condition of anonymity, that the state needed to be ready for tough competition once the economy opened up. “We have to strengthen the online systems and make it much more effective. Our aim is to make the physical touch points almost negligible. We have to work on the reforms for the current year. Another important aspect that we will work on is perception building,” said the official from the industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/make-action-plan-to-attract-more-investment-into-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-tells-state-s-industries-department/story-DPRcInKPY1VHoXLX6AQ18K.html

One such plot is the Cidco plot in Sector 20, Airoli, where over 200 hutments have come up under the high tension cables.Cidco anti-encroachment department had taken action in the area around two years back. However, the shanties have again come up in the area spread over around 800sqm. While the MIDC areas of Navi Mumbai have several slum colonies, this area in Airoli too has been witnessing increased encroachments. There is a huge demand for the shanties here due to its location. Apart from residences, there are also shops and markets in the area and even a nursery that has come up.Krishna Suryavanshi, 38, a social worker, said: “The shanties on this plot have a lucrative sales value and, thus, are set up regularly despite action. Several residents have proof of residing in the area for the past several years. There could soon be demand to regularise this colony. Following the demolition action in 2018, Cidco had enclosed the area with a wired fence. However, the slumlords soon took over and started constructing hutments. The slums have increased further in pandemic.”Cidco PRO, Priya Ratambe, said, “We will look into the issue and if there is encroachment, Cidco will act in the matter soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/activists-complain-of-encroachments-in-airoli/story-z7rIYiCEjoUsG9vE2BraJM.html

These two officials were earlier posted at the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), where the charges of alleged irregularities first came up.Alok Kumar, additional chief secretary of the Uttar Pradesh government, on Thursday issued two separate orders for a probe into the matter. One of the officials is a general manager while another one is a senior manager.Kumar’s letter, issued for a probe into the general manager’s role, states, “The government has ordered a probe after indicting them in primary investigation. The general manager is accused of not taking interest in departmental works, and not executing the works on decisions taken in the Authority’s meetings. The official had also proposed the wrong proposal of some projects to higher officials. The government had also received some complaints from allottees against the official.”Meanwhile, as per the second letter, the senior manager is also accused of allegedly not taking an interest in official works, and allegedly taking a lot of unplanned leaves. “The official is held accountable for not taking an interest in official works, doing no contribution in work,” the letter says.The actions have been initiated under Section 7 of the UP Government Servant (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999.

The suspect, identified as 28-year-old Mahesh Kumar from Rewari was employed as a ‘multi tasking staff’ (MTS) and his duties included cleaning and carrying the office post. Police officers familiar with the investigation said that Kumar had established contact with the woman over Facebook in 2018 who allegedly introduced herself as a government employee in the Indian state of Punjab. Investigators claim this woman was an operative of the Pakistani intelligence. “The two had been regularly in touch over texts, chats and audio/video calls. He had also received two payments of ₹5000 each from the handler’s local intermediary in the past year. In preliminary probe, he confessed to be in touch with the woman over WhatsApp,” said a senior STF official, requesting anonymity. In June, the military intelligence based in Lucknow received inputs that information was being passed from a mobile number in Jaipur to an operative in Pakistan. Over the next couple of months, an investigation revealed that he was staying in Dharuhera, Rewari. These inputs were shared with STF Haryana and a joint team was formed for the raid. Officials said that Kumar had access to certain files and routine documents, whose copies he may have shared with the intelligence operative over WhatsApp. Police said he was booked under Official Secrets Act and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code in Dharuhera. His phone has been sent for forensic examination. “Our probe has revealed that the woman had asked him for details of serving Army personnel in Jaipur. He had passed on information related to some senior officers, posting orders of civilian MES staffers, pictures of documents meant to be posted and a diagram of a field formation,” said the official cited above.B Satheesh Balan, Deputy Inspector General, STF, Haryana, said, “Kumar was arrested for passing classified information to a Pakistan-based intelligence operative, whom he claimed to have befriended on social media two years ago. After the initial lead from Lucknow, we worked on the case and it was a joint operation. As per initial questioning, he was in contact with one woman, who was using two WhatsApp numbers. We have handed him over to the local police for further questioning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mes-employee-held-in-honey-trap-case/story-9Qtzzgdg1Sb5rMbcUVgGHN.html

No one was injured in the fire, but the owners of the warehouses said they suffered losses to the tune of ₹8-10 lakh.The owners – Irfan Saifi, Zakir and Sohail (both identified by single names), who were running the shops on rented premises, alleged foul play and have lodged a complaint against unknown persons for setting the warehouses on fire.According to the complaint lodged by them, the incident occurred at around 1am on Thursday. “I received a call from soome neighbours who said that the three warehouses had caught fire in a row. I reached the spot and informed police and fire department officials. The warehouses were already up in flames,” Saifi said in the complaint. He said he suspected the role of some miscreants behind the incident.Arun Kumar, chief fire safety officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that six fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the blaze. “The firefighters doused the fire in one hour. There was no injury to anybody. As far as what led to the incident, the police will investigate it, while our primary work to respond to the call and douse the fire,” he said.Meanwhile, the scrap dealers said that the warehouses were set on fire on purpose. “Some people are trying to disturb the communal harmony in the area. We suspect that someone deliberately set the warehouse on fire,” he said.Zakir, one of the scrap dealers, said that the situation in the village has been tense since a man was murder on September 8. 25-year-old Sheru Bhati was stabbed to death allegedly by three persons—Jamshed, Shoeb, and Wasim— over a personal rivalry in Chhitehra village in Dadri. Jamshed and one of the alleged accomplices were arrested on September 10 while the third was arrested a day later.“The situation became tense after a group of people had held a meeting on September 13 and vowed to take ‘revenge’.

18-09-2020||City||Fight between actors Kangana Ranaut and Urmila Matondkar takes political turn||Controversial Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut’s objectionable remarks against another actor Urmila Matondkar took a political turn, as state Congress unit criticised Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders for supporting Ranaut, which according to them, has led to the latter’s relentless remarks against Mumbai and now Matondkar. The party has demanded an apology from the actor as well as the BJP. On the other hand, the BJP said Ranaut was responding to verbal attacks on her and there was no reason for the party to support her. Ranaut called Matondkar a “soft porn actor” on a news channel, which led to another controversy. Many on the social media slammed her remarks. She was responding to Matondkar’s criticism where she called her “Rudaali”, a professional mourner hired in certain areas of Rajasthan after the death of a relative. Earlier, Ranaut had compared Mumbai with Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said BJP’s support has emboldened Ranaut to go to an extent of using such detestable words for Urmila. He also alleged that BJP has been revengeful against the state since they lost power last year. “Strongly condemn reprehensible remarks of @kanganateam against urmilamatondkar ji. BJP has been revengeful to Maharashtra since they lost power. Urmila ji has given us award winning masterpieces. We are proud of Urmila ji who truly represents culture of Maharashtra. A woman from a Marathi middle-class background & a complete outsider in film industry, Urmila ji became a successful star solely by her talent and hard work,” Sawant said in a series of tweets. “BJP called Kangana Jhansi ki Rani, gave her Y category security, facilitated meeting with governor and extended full support even though she kept abusing Mumbai, insulted 13 crore Maharashtrians, 106 martyrs on the BJP’S script. She boasts of BJP support & a guarantee of BJP ticket,” he added. State BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, “Ranaut is being attacked physically and verbally and she is responding to it. Whatever she said about Matondkar is her response to what the former has said about her.” “Ranaut was given security considering the threat she was getting over coming to Mumbai and she has also made a demand. People call her “Jhansi ki Rani” because she has played her character in a movie just like Amitabh Bachchan played a character named “Shahenshah”. There is no reason for the BJP to support her. It also doesn’t suit the Congress to support the people who are attacking her [Ranaut],” said the BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fight-between-actors-kangana-ranaut-and-urmila-matondkar-takes-political-turn/story-zp62bdjx1lFRX0gexW78CJ.html
18-09-2020||City||Vikram Tyagi abduction case: NHRC notices issued to UP Police, seeks action-taken report||The National Human Rights’ Commission (NHRC) has sought an action taken report from the Uttar Pradesh police chief within four weeks in connection with the ongoing investigation into the alleged abduction of 36-year-old Raj Nagar Extension resident Vikram Tyagi in June. Tyagi, a project director with a realty firm, went missing on the night of June 26 under mysterious circumstance. A day later, his car was found in Muzaffarnagar district, about 100kms from Ghaziabad, with blood stains inside. After the Ghaziabad police began investigation, the case was transferred to the UP special task force (STF) in July following protests from the family.The petition with the NHRC was filed by lawyer Vishnu Kumar Gupta. “Since I also live in the same locality, I saw his family deeply disturbed by the incident. As there has been no progress, I decided to move the NHRC. In my petition I have sought monitoring of the case by additional director general (Meerut zone) and if there is no result within a time frame, the case should be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” said Gupta. “Vikram has small children and his family still has no clue about his whereabouts.” Tyagi’s family suspects that he may have been a victim of a robbery. However, all attempts to trace Tyagi or any suspected gang behind the incident has not yielded any results. The NHRC on Thursday directed: “Transmit a copy of the complaint to the concerned authority calling for a report within four weeks. In case, the report is not received within the stipulated time, the Commission shall be constrained to invoke coercive process u/s 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 for personal appearance of the concerned authority.” Tyagi’s abduction case was lodged at Sihani Gate police station and officials said that apart from UP STF, teams from Ghaziabad police were also aiding investigation. “We have no leads on his whereabouts," said Sanjay Tyagi, Vikram Tyagi’s uncle. “It seems that he could have been a victim of some carjacking or a robbery. He may have given chase to the robbers after which they held him captive and took him away. The front portion of his car was damaged which suggests that he probably crashed his car onto the vehicle of the robbers. Such incidents have often been reported from Raj Nagar Extension area. We still feel that the district police are capable to handle the case but all investigation has drawn a naught so far. In between we also moved Allahabad high court in a petition.”The high court in its order on September 1 directed that senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad should supervise the case. “Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties, we direct the investigating officer of the present case to conclude the investigation of the present case and submit a police report before the magistrate concerned expeditiously preferably within a period of six months from the date of production of a copy of this order. Investigating officer is also directed to make all the efforts to recover the victim within the aforesaid period,” the court in its order, said. Kalanidhi Naithani, SSP Ghaziabad, said that apart from the STF, they are also aiding investigation. “We are working on some leads in the case and all efforts are being taken up in investigation. The blood that was found in victim’s car was his. A DNA test was conducted and it matched with his parents,” SSP added. The investigation also found that a policeman had stopped Tyagi’s car at a check point in Khatauli (Muzaffarnagar district). There were allegedly two men inside who told him that they were from the police. When the policeman saw blood inside the car, he tried to stop the vehicle, but the men drove away, said a police officer. The car was discovered 50 km from this check point. Tyagi’s family said that they have not received any ransom calls. RK Mishra, deputy superintendent of police (UP STF), said that STF teams from Noida and Meerut are involved in the investigation of the case. “We are scanning all active gangs in western UP but we have not found their involvement so far. Police from Ghaziabad and other districts are also helping in case investigation,” he added. During investigation, the cops had also suspected to the role of Ashu Jaat who is allegedly involved in the abduction and murder of Greater Noida-based executive, Gaurav Chandel. Chandel was a victim of a carjacking incident and was murdered on January 7 while he was on his way home to Gaur City in Greater Noida West. On September 5, Ashu Jaat who was absconding since the incident was traced by police in Mumbai and brought to Hapur on remand. “We also questioned Ashu when he was brought to Hapur but his role in Vikram Tyagi’s case was not established. Tyagi’s case if one off case where things are taking time but the police is working actively to crack it,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vikram-tyagi-abduction-case-nhrc-notices-issued-to-up-police-seeks-action-taken-report/story-zhW69dnMEu7Ih6aOYZjy2L.html

This led to panic and confusion among the residents.Suryavanshi said that messages circulating on social media about complete lockdown were not true.He said: “As of now, we have no plans to implement a lockdown in KDMC. We have seen several shops not following the social distancing norms. There is a request from the civic body to not violate norms or else strict action will be taken.” KDMC recorded 560 new positive Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 40,220, which is the highest in entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Savita Das, 45, a resident of Khadakpada, Kalyan (W), said, “I’ve got a message on my social media account that there will be complete lockdown in Kalyan-Dombivli on Saturday and Sunday. This actually caused worry as my mother needs to be taken to hospital for her dialysis treatment. I kept asking my relatives if the message was true.”On an average, the KDMC is recording 400-500 new Covid-19 cases daily, higher than any other municipal corporations in MMR. The civic body claimed that the relaxations on lockdown and also the increased number of tests have led to the rise in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-plans-for-complete-lockdown-in-kalyan-dombivli-civic-chief/story-paRstkk2IJ2nuUteF2BRlK.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||Six-acre pond in Subash Nagar to be revived by next monsoon||A six-acre water body in Subhash Nagar, sector 16, is next on the Gurujal initiative’s list of reviving it as a pond for the public.Both administrative and financial approval for the project have been granted, and work tenders are expected to be floated soon by the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG).A Gurugram administraion initiative launched last year, Gurujal aims to address the city’s water scarcity issue through measures, including restoration of ponds and nearby areas as parks. This will be the second body that the initiative will restore.The Subhash Nagar water body is located behind Guru Dronacharya College in Bheem Nagar, close to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority water boosting station.There are currently multiple outlets carrying wastewater into the pond from around 110 households, and also a major sewage line. Locals said is almost always filled with sewage, and non-native, invasive species of vegetation.“The area of the water body itself is about 2.7 acres, and it has been encroached on mainly by informal housing. The encroaching tenements will be removed and recycled sewage water will be fed to a catchment area of about six acres, which we have identified,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, programme manager, Gurujal. “In the Mahabharat, it is believed that Bheem once stopped at this pond for a drink, which gives the place a religious significance as well.” The water body has a depth of about four meters, according to an ecological assessment of the area by a Gurujal team. The assessment also states that “various animals, especially wild boars are seen in the periphery of the pond.”Sayani Halder, a wastewater treatment consultant with Gurujal, explained, “The pond has mainly three sources of water, including rain, runoff, and wastewater. The underlying water table is quite low, at 30 metres below the ground. By diverting untreated sewage away from the pond, and pumping in recycled water, we will also be able to replenish the groundwater. The water body is fairly large and has the ability to support biodiversity and influence micro-climate in the immediate vicinity.”The revival will include not just restoring the water body, but also landscaping the area with a tree garden, seating areas, shaded pathways, a sports arena, an open-air library, and even an amphitheatre space, according to a layout plan shared by the Gurujal team. The project will be the second such project to be facilitated by the MCG, after work on restoring a smaller water body in Sukhrali was completed earlier this year.Jasleen Kaur, MCG nodal officer in charge of pond revival, did not respond to request for comment.Gurujal has also completed drafting detailed project reports (DPRs) for six other water bodies lying within Gurugram city limits, including two in Dhanwapur, two in Badshahpur and another two in Ghata village.While specific details pertaining to the remaining projects were not provided, Kesarwani said, “The restoration of Ghata’s water bodies will be the most challenging task, given how the area’s hydrogeology has changed in recent years. Just in terms of their sheer size and the scope of work involved, it will be a more challenging project than Subash Nagar, or any of the other ponds we are in the process of reviving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-acre-pond-in-subash-nagar-to-be-revived-by-next-monsoon/story-Xtf2Wg22uwKa7f3gi7VY0I.html

Being a regular in the residential areas, no one questioned his movement which gave him a good cover. The three would then break into these houses and decamp with valuables in an Alto car which was registered on Akash’s name,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.The police said that the three suspects were involved in multiple theft, robbery, burglary, and arms act cases, while more cases in which they could be involved are being identified.“Their gang leader, Sonu, is wanted in a murder case lodged in Surajpur and has a bounty of ₹25,000 on him. The gang had also burgled a house in Sector 52 on July 25, and on July 27 strike at another house from where they had decamped with jewellery, laptops, and other valuable items. Another burglary had occurred in the same sector on September 3 as well,” said the DCP.Police officers said that following an investigation into the burglaries, the car’s license plate was caught in a CCTV camera footage which led them to trace the suspects. The gang leader, Sonu, had been in Assam for a while and the three had gathered on Tuesday to sell off some of the stolen goods, said police. They were nabbed by the Sector 24 police near the Morna bus stand following a tip from an informant. The police said that the suspects tried to escape and were arrested after the police personnel gave them a chase during which Sonu was also injured.The suspects had been active for months and were responsible for at least a dozen burglaries in the city, the police said.The police recovered a country-made pistol from them, tools used to break into houses, luxury wristwatches, gold chains, anklets, multiple rings among other jewellery, ₹11,500 cash, 18 silver coins, and a stolen Santro car.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/milkman-among-three-arrested-in-noida-for-a-dozen-burglaries/story-yrSDvUrfcA1hjX76MkrI9N.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||25 illegally constructed warehouses demolished in Sector 94||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Thursday carried out a demolition drive, in which around 25 illegally constructed warehouses in Sector 94 were demolished. DTCP officials said that these warehouses were allegedly constructed on a land, which was marked as an open space in the master plan of the city. These warehouses — built on plots ranging between 500 to 1,500 square yard — had no permission for construction and change of land use, said DTCP officials. RS Bhath, district town planner, who heads the enforcement wing, said that the demolition started around 11am and continued till late in the evening. “There are around 45 such illegal warehouses that have come up in Sector 94 near Hayatpur village in violation of rules. Around 25 such structures were demolished as these are under ‘open spaces’ as per the final development plan of Gurugram. The structures were demolished by the enforcement team with the support of around 200 police staff. This drive will continue till action is completed,” he said. DTCP officials said that warehouses were rented out to different firms for anywhere between ₹50,000 to ₹1.5 lakh per month. The team also razed a road network that was constructed illegally in the area. The action against the illegal warehouses in Sector 94 comes following a complaint by a city-based RTI activist, Raman Sharma, who had alleged that due to inaction by DTCP officials, various land grabbers had built warehouses, factories and other structures in Sector 94 in violation of rules. Sharma had alleged that Sector 94 had been notified by the DTCP as an ‘open space’ and all kinds of construction was banned by the department without its permission. He had alleged that all constructions were in contravention of law and even sale deeds were registered in violation of rules. Following his petition, a lower court in Gurugram had also issued directions for registration of a criminal case but the Punjab and Haryana High Court had given a stay in the matter after the order was challenged. “The violations should be probed properly and relevant action should be taken as per the law,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/25-illegally-constructed-warehouses-demolished-in-sector-94/story-LFc1yQc5KlJ6D67ld7qTvK.html

18-09-2020||City||Man thrashes woman in public: Attempt to murder charge added to FIR; local post in-charge shunted||The police on Thursday said they have added additional, stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code to the ongoing investigation in the case of a 47-year-old woman being brutally thrashed allegedly by her neighbour in publicly view on a road in Razapur locality of Ghaziabad on Saturday evening. Officers also said that the local police post in-charge has been sent to police lines in connection with the incident.The police action came after a video of the CCTV footage of the incident went viral over social media, in which the man was purportedly seen thrashing the woman, including hitting her with a chair. Later, the suspect, 45-year-old Sunil Chaudhary, a resident of the same locality as the woman, had been arrested following a first information report (FIR) under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).According to police, the suspect is a storekeeper at a private engineering college on the Delhi-Meeru Road. He lives in own house with his wife and two children in the locality.“We have now added IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 307 (attempt to murder) to the investigation. Apart from this, we have also sent the local post in-charge to police lines for delay in action in the case. A departmental inquiry will be undertaken against him,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city).According to the FIR, the incident took place around 5.15pm Saturday when the woman was on her way to the local market and the suspect allegedly made some offensive comments about her. When she objected to this, videos on social media purportedly showed Chaudhary landing multiple punches and kicks on the woman and beating her up mercilessly even as the public remained mute spectators.The videos purportedly also show him picking up a metal chair and hitting the woman with it till she fell unconscious. Chaudhary then purportedly leaves the spot and another man helps the woman up, who helps her sit at a nearby shop before leaving.The victim’s family had been alleging laxity on part of the police in making arrests and said she had suffered severe injuries to her body, and that more stringent sections should be levied against the suspects.“Section 354 of the IPC is added to the investigation after the suspect misbehaved with the victim. In case the family gives any further complaint, it will be made part of the investigation,” the SP added.In his complaint, the woman’s husband alleged that the suspect would often abuse his wife and their 26-year-old daughter. He alleged that this has been going on for one-and-a-half-years. The family, meanwhile, also alleged that they had earlier complained twice to the local police in-charge and once to officials at the Kavi Nagar police station but then withdrew the complaint. “It was due to intervention of elderly persons and requests from the suspect’s family that we took back our complaints. The man is of an aggressive nature and often misbehaves with women in the locality. It was only after I came across the footage that I came to know of the severity of injuries to my mother. The chair weighed about 12-15kgs and he banged it to her head and chest. The injury to the chest is severe and she is taking up daily treatment at a hospital,” alleged the son of the victim.“After the incident, when we approached the police post in-charge, he did not take the matter seriously and told us that it was a simple case of altercation,” he added.Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (SSP), said the post in-charge has been sent to police lines and the suspect will face more action.“We will recommend levying the Goonda Act against him once the chargesheet is filed in the case,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-thrashes-woman-in-public-attempt-to-murder-charge-added-to-fir-local-post-in-charge-shunted/story-89fIn98gKdOsU8yHzozVOJ.html

Moreover, under the state government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ guidelines, the corporation will also have to carry out a fresh survey for which the TMC has increased its manpower.Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “As part of our extensive testing and tracing practice, we had a team of 150 people who went door-to-door and checked temperature, oxygen levels as well as residents with co-morbidities or symptoms, and updated them real time. As per the state government guidelines, Thursday onwards we started the survey for a second time.”For the new survey, 450 teams have been formed across the city with each team consisting of two or three people that include a medical representative. “Unlike earlier, we have only 20 days to complete this survey; hence we have included many teams and additional equipment. The state government has asked us to complete 50 households in a single day, so we need additional manpower,” said Sharma. Currently, TMC has around 12,000 people in institutional quarantine, some of them are those found with symptoms during the door-to-door survey.The door-to-door screening survey includes staff from Thane Municipal Transport, various government departments, contractual staff from TMC and teachers, volunteers from social organisations and members of political parties as well. This team focusses on containment screening and surveillance; all of which are updated in real time.A senior TMC official said, “Around nine per cent of the people, surveyed in the last two months, had influenza-like mild symptoms. RT-PCR were conducted on them and those with symptoms were isolated immediately. Our strategy remains the same of testing and tracing, as per the State guidelines,” added a senior TMC officer.The activists are, however, sceptical about the survey. “With the kind of population that Thane city has, it would be difficult to complete the survey in 20 days. The civic body will require a lot of manpower, especially in slum areas. Despite working for two months, they have not been able to complete screening the entire city. This is going to be a humongous task even for those on the field conducting the survey,” said Sanjiv Datta, activist, Thane||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-body-begins-door-to-door-survey-to-find-covid-patients/story-bfJLCPsi5T1LaEA1i0bznL.html
18-09-2020||Noida||With rising number of Covid-19 cases, demand for oxygen goes up in Gautam Budh Nagar||With the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases surging in the district, oxygen demand in the hospitals of Gautam Budh Nagar has more than tripled. Currently, the total number of oxygen cylinders needed per day in the district’s hospitals is 300, compared with 100 cylinders in pre-Covid times, the officials said.District magistrate Suhas LY admitted that demand for oxygen cylinders has gone up after coronavirus cases came up in the district. “However, it is not a matter of concern for us as the only factory that supplies oxygen to the entire national capital region, including Delhi, as well as western Uttar Pradesh – Inox Air Products Limited – is located in Gautam Budh Nagar itself. The state government has already ordered the factory to ensure uninterrupted and ample oxygen cylinder supply to Gautam Budh Nagar and other districts on top priority. The manufacturer has been asked to allow two working shifts in the unit, so that around 1,200 cylinders daily can be filled up, instead of 700 cylinders being readied currently in a single shift,” he said.The DM further said that the factory ships oxygen in liquid form to some hospitals such as the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and Sharda Hospital in tankers, which is then converted into gas and piped directly to beds. “Other Covid-dedicated hospitals use steel and aluminium cylinders which store oxygen in gas form. They change the cylinders for each bed as per need,” he said. District chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that to fulfil the rising demand of oxygen cylinders, the district drug department has been asked to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen to hospitals. “Despite rising demand, we have never witnessed any paucity of oxygen cylinders in any hospitals,” he said.According to Dr Saurav Srivastava, the head of Covid-19 ward at GIMS, “If doctors working in different Covid-dedicated hospitals are to be believed, about a fifth of coronavirus patients require help with breathing, while a few of them appear in no apparent respiratory distress, but are found to have alarmingly low oxygen levels - a condition called silent hypoxia. The demand for oxygen has gone up three times after the outbreak of Covid-19, as oxygen is a must for these critically ill patients.”Echoing similar views, Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, the medical superintendent of Sharda Hospital, said: “The average daily demand for oxygen in Sharda Hospital, which was 10,800 cubic metres from November 2019 to April 2020, went up to 17,000 cubic metres after June 2020. In September as well, the average daily demand stands at 17,000 cubic metres so far,” he said. Gautam Budh Nagar reported its first coronavirus case on March 8. By September 17, the total number of cases reported so far in the district were 10,908, including 48 deaths and 2004 active cases. So far, 8,856 patients have been cured.District drug inspector Vaibhav Babbar confirmed the exponential rise in demand for oxygen after the Covid-19 outbreak. “We have asked oxygen manufacturers to cut supply of industrial oxygen to factories to a minimum in the district. The overall production capacity of this factory is 34 tonnes per day, of which around 30 tonnes per day is being produced at present. Since life is more important than livelihood, the manufacturer has been told to make ample supply of medical oxygen to hospitals in the state,” he said.When contacted, the head of medical supply in Inox Air Products Limited, Akash Kumar, refused to divulge the details of oxygen supply in the district. “We are very much busy in ensuring critical supply of oxygen to our clients, so it is impossible to give the break-up of the figures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-rising-number-of-covid-19-cases-demand-for-oxygen-goes-up-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-ReXduOlJu2jCdDMfMyBa6O.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||MCG uses GIS technology to map dengue and malaria hot spots across Gurugram||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has for the first time mapped the prevalence of dengue and malaria in the city, using geographic information system (GIS) technology in order to undertake targeted anti-larvae and fogging measures for the prevention of vector-borne diseases, said officials on Thursday.The civic body has mapped 69 hot spots for dengue and four areas for malaria on the basis of this year’s data available till September 15. MCG officials said that mapping these hot spots will help them analyse the geographical pattern of vector-borne diseases and identify target areas.As per officials, the exact locations from where the vector-borne cases and large concentration of mosquito-breeding spots have been reported have been marked on the map on a sector-wise basis.As per MCG’s map, five dengue hot spots were found in Sector 46, which is the highest for any sector, followed by four in Sector 49, and three each in sectors 12, 28, 43, 106. In Sector 52, there were two dengue hot spots and one malaria hot spot.“MCG is using GIS technology to map every case of dengue and malaria reported in all health facilities in the district, including government and private hospitals, as well as spots where mosquito breeding has been reported. This information will be used to analyse the geographical pattern and identify areas for anti-larvae activities and fogging. We will be allocating our resources accordingly,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG. Geographic information system (GIS) is a type of software that uses satellite images to relate data with an exact geographic location.At least 22 cases of dengue and 15 cases of malaria were reported in the city in 2019 — the lowest in five years. As per Dr Ram Prakash Rai, district epidemiologist, 28 cases of dengue and three cases of malaria have already been reported this year so far. Dengue and malaria cases are usually reported during the monsoon season between June and September.MCG officials said that due to the rise in the number of vector-borne cases in the last two months, the MCG has decided to use GIS mapping and accordingly allocate its anti-larvae operations.“Now that we have a clearer picture of the hot spots, MCG officials will be accordingly sent to these locations to carry out fumigation and anti-larvae operations so that these areas are given more importance than the rest of the city,” said a senior MCG official, deputed in its health wing. “The diseases are still at a stage where they can be contained. With the outbreak of Covid-19, we don’t want to put any additional pressure on the already heavily burdened health sector. All steps are being taken to reduce vector-borne diseases to a minimum,” he said.The district health department and the MCG have together formed teams comprising 171 officials, who have 49 fogging machines at their disposal.The commissioner said that the GIS map has also been shared with the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city. RWA representatives have been asked to check the locations near the hot spots and alert the MCG if pools of stagnant water are found near them.In his message to the RWAs, Singh has also listed two MCG helpline numbers, 7988735682 and 9467469994, on which RWAs can alert the civic body or place requests for fogging and anti-larvae measures.“We received the order from the MCG commissioner earlier this morning, following which directions were issued to the society staff members to check all apartments for stagnated water as well as drains and parks across the society. We have asked them to give us a report on the matter on Sunday, on the basis of which we will take a call on the next course of action,” said Puneet Goyal, president of Tulip Violet RWA, on Thursday.Further health department officials said that between June 1 and September 17, 8.24 lakh houses were checked for mosquito breeding across the city, leading to 2,517 challans being issued against owners whose houses were found to have stagnant water for the third time.Health department officials said that if they find stagnant water at a person’s house, a notice is issued against them for the first two offences. A third-time offence leads to fine, ranging from ₹500 to ₹2,500, depending on the extent of water stagnation and mosquito breeding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-uses-gis-technology-to-map-dengue-and-malaria-hot-spots-across-gurugram/story-4uq7RW6nJFLFm0GvqGxp0O.html
18-09-2020||City||In 16 days of September, Ghaziabad’s Covid-19 containment zones rise by over 80%||With a rise in the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Ghaziabad, the number of containment zones has also gone up substantially in the district, with the district admin reporting 615 zones on September 16, as compared to 336 on September 1 – an increase of 83%. According to experts, the rise in the number of containment zones also means that cases are spreading to newer areas and need better management.According to figures of the district admin on its official website, a sharp increase in containment zones can be seen in several areas marked by police station jurisdictions. For example, the Kavi Nagar station saw an increase of 57 zones in 16 days of September, while Sihani Gate and Sahibabad saw an increase of 46 and 49 containment zones, respectively, during the same period.Police station areas of Kotwali in Old City and Vijay Nagar have also seen an increase in containment zone numbers by 30 and 21, respectively. On the other hand, the Indirapuram police station area saw a decline of 22 containment zones from September 1 to September 16.“A substantial increase in the number of containment zones indicates that the cases have risen and there is a spread to new areas. It also indicates that zones are not properly contained and need better enforcement as the local population has started mixing with each other due to opening up of markets, offices, means of transport, etc., after the unlock mode came into effect,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “There are areas where slow growth in the number of containment zones has been seen, which indicates that containment rules are properly being enforced and the local admin has been able to contain the spread of the infection,” he added.In Uttar Pradesh, category 1 zones, which have a single Covid-19 case, are formed in a radius of 100 metres or a Mohalla, whichever is less, while Category 2 zones, which have more than one case, are created in a radius of 200 metres. They also have an additional buffer zone on their outskirts which is defined as per local assessment. Experts said enforcement and management of containment zones is a must to check the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “In case there is a rise in the number of cases, proper attention should be given to better management of containment zones as well as allied activities like contact tracing, surveillance etc. As per the recent guidelines of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) there has to be 100% testing which needs to be taken up,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the ICMR.In contrast to the steep rise in containment zones in Ghaziabad in September, containment zones in the adjoining Gautam Budh Nagar did not rise drastically in numbers, even though its case tally rose significantly. The overall containment zones in Gautam Budh Bagar stood at 316 on September 1 and increased to 399 on September 16 – an increase of 83 zones, or roughly 20%. Officials of districts have been uploading the daily list of containment zones on their official websites. “We are taking up all activities in containment zones in our district which also include 100% testing. With better management, our testing per lakh of population is much better than other districts in the National Capital Region. Our case fatality ratio is also lower. In our containment zones, we are ensuring strict perimeter control,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.According to state control room figures, Gautam Budh Nagar had 8,058 overall cases on September 1 while the total tally stood at 10,705 cases on September 16.In contrast, Ghaziabad on September 1 had overall 8,465 cases while its tally stood at 11,532 cases on September 16, so far.When approached for comments over the issue, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that CP Tiwari, who earlier held the charge of additional district magistrate (city) and nodal officer for containment zones, will respond over the issue.However, there was no response thereafter till late Thursday night. Yashwardhan Srivastava, additional district magistrate (finance) said that containment zones are not under his jurisdiction.“We are ensuring better management of containment zones and also trying that 100% testing of people in such areas is taken up as per ICMR guidelines. We need more resources for which we have sent a proposal for hiring more lab technicians. The rise in containment zones is due to a sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in September,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-16-days-of-september-ghaziabad-s-covid-19-containment-zones-rise-by-over-80/story-etINCNNAgXRZXvi5YxiaYK.html
18-09-2020||Gurugram||29 oustees who lost their land for Dwarka Expressway to get relief after four years||Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has decided to give alternative plots to 29 families in the villages of Kherki Daula and Bajghera, whose land was acquired by the authority for building the Dwarka Expressway. Although these families were given alternative plots earlier, they were unable to build their homes, as most of these plots were either under a high-tension power cable or found to be smaller in size. These plot owners, who have been waiting for relief for the last four years, will now get alternative plots. Proposal for the same will be sent to the headquarters for approval, said HSVP officials on Thursday.Most of these plots are located in Sector 37C and Sector 110A, said HSVP officials. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram, said that after assessing the claims of the allottees and a site visit, the authority has decided to give alternative plots to the oustees. “We have sought permission from the headquarters to allot them plots elsewhere. Once the permission is granted, a draw of lots will be held and possession will be given,” he said. HSVP officials said that the lands of these ousteees were acquired for the construction of Dwarka Expressway, which connects the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from Kherki Daula to Dwarka. In 2016, land was acquired in the villages of Bajghera and Kherki Daula for the construction of the expressway and, in the same year, the oustees were allotted plots in Sector 37C and Sector 110A as compensation. However, 29 families had raised objections and refused to accept the allocated plots, after these were found to be under a high-tension power line. A few had issues with the size of the plots allocated. Dilip Yadav, whose wife was allotted a plot in Sector 37C, said that the plot was under a high-tension power line and, as such, a house could not be constructed there. “I had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court and all the officials in HSVP in the last four years, seeking relief. After a long delay, our problems have been heard properly and steps have been taken to resolve the issue” he said. HSVP officials added that resolution of pending claims by oustees, land owners and allottees was also being taken up on a priority basis. Jitender Yadav said that possession of plots to oustees, whose land was acquired in Sector 49, would soon be given possession of alternative plots near Rosewood City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/29-oustees-who-lost-their-land-for-dwarka-expressway-to-get-relief-after-four-years/story-xCHivYKLJLDqEDkwLs1pJK.html
18-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbaiites may be able to go for overnight camps at Erangal beach in Malad||As part of its initiative to boost tourism along the city’s coastline, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) is planning to organise overnight camps at Erangal beach in Malad. MTDC owns an 18-acre plot at Erangal beach, which it plans to develop for tourism. Ashutosh Salil, managing director, MTDC, said, “There are plans to have an option for citizens to explore the beach with overnight camps organised at the Erangal beach. Along with the overnight camp, we also plan to have scooters [sand bikes] for tourists.” State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray visited Erangal beach last week, along with officials from the tourism department and MTDC. Later, Thackeray said, “The pristine place will soon have a place for Mumbaikars and tourists alike to enjoy eco-friendly outings.” The scenic Erangal beach is named after Erangal village, near Madh island, and is home to mostly Koli, East Indian and Roman Catholic communities. Among its existing attractions is the 16th-century St Bonaventure Church, which was built by the Portuguese. The real estate in the area around Erangal beach is expected to witness a boom as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned bridges to connect Madh island to Versova and Marve to Manori island. Salil said MTDC had not yet decided if Erangal beach would be developed using a public-private partnership model. “If we are planning to have overnight camps, we will require other supporting infrastructure. This all will be planned on the plot owned by MTDC. Now, whether we give our plot on lease or we adopt a public-private partnership model for such facilities is something that we will have to study, and we will also be seeking permission from the state cabinet for the same,” he said. On the other side of the coast, at Manori beach, MTDC plans to develop a resort on a 25-acre plot that the corporation owns. In 2018, Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT), which owns Kanhoji Angre island, had initiated plans similar to those proposed by MTDC for Erangal beach. These included constructing a semi-paved pathway, a trekking pathway, construction of bio-toilets and several other amenities along with camps to boost tourism. However, the plan has not materialised yet. Kanhoji Angre island is approximately 23km south of Gateway of India and is as an entry point to Mumbai’s harbour. Previously, also in 2018, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) had planned to develop water tourism at Aksa beach, near Erangal, but the proposal was shelved because the coastline was deemed unsuitable for water sports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbaiites-can-go-for-overnight-camps-at-erangal-beach-in-malad/story-M0a8XV8ZppLt7BTQIIosSK.html
18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Rain deficient September to be boon for paddy, maize growers: Ludhiana agri varsity||After two years of surplus rainfall in the month of September, the city has received merely 13.6mm rain this time (until September 17). As per the meteorological department, the normal rainfall for this month is around 102mm and the city usually records 50mm during this period. But this year, the city is set to see deficient rainfall in September.This, however, is good news for farmers of paddy and maize crop as it will ensure better yield. “Less rainfall is better for crops, especially for paddy as the moisture content will be less,” said Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of the department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, Punjab Agricultural University.She added that last year’s surplus rainfall (264mm) had led to delay in the harvesting of crops. “The incessant rainfall last year had damaged the crops and at places, rice seed was also broken,” said Dr Sidhu. Residents, meanwhile, are fuming due to the rising temperature and humidity. Gurmeet Singh, a banker, said, “This hot and humid weather gives us the impression that we are in the month of June. It’s getting more and more difficult to step out in morning hours. Even at home, one cannot sit without an air conditioner.” Dr Sidhu, however, said that light rain is expected on Friday which will provide respite from the rising temperature in parts of Malwa region. “We are expecting some rain in Ludhiana as well,” said Dr Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rain-deficient-september-to-be-boon-for-paddy-maize-growers-ludhiana-agri-varsity/story-TxYNgGuicyLISk2LbS6C7H.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||PoK missing from India map sent to class 4 students of North MCD schools, inquiry ordered||Several teachers and principals of schools run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (North DMC) raised objections after an India map, excluding Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), appeared in worksheets sent online to class 4 students on Tuesday. The civic body has now ordered an inquiry in the matter.India has always maintained that Kashmir is an integral part of the Indian Union and that Pakistan’s occupation of its land is illegal. The Survey of India – the Central government agency in charge of mapping and surveying -- only approves maps that show the entire Kashmir as Indian territory.Schools across the national capital continue to remain shut since March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and classes are being conducted online. Besides online classes, all schools run by the government, civic bodies and private establishments are also sending children worksheets, links to videos and audios of lessons on WhatsApp and as text messages. In a worksheet on environmental studies, sent to class 4 students of north DMC schools on Tuesday, students were asked to point out the differences between two India maps -- before Independence and after Independence. “The map of independent India excluded Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Some teachers pointed out the error and circulated the worksheet on WhatsApp groups. Some also posted the image of the worksheet on social media, pointing out the gaff. It’s shocking that the department did not carefully check the worksheet before sending it to schools which later forwarded that to students,” said a teacher of a north DMC school, requesting anonymity. Another teacher, who wished not to be named, said, “A special team consisting of mentor teachers are preparing worksheets on all subjects. Then the core mentors check these worksheets and send them to the education department for approval. Only then are these worksheets sent to the zonal WhatsApp groups and through them to the schools. How is it even possible that none checked the worksheet before it finally reached students?”Jai Prakash, mayor North DMC, said the error was brought to his notice. “It appears to be a fault on the part of the worksheet and map creator. We are looking into the matter and I have ordered an inquiry. Any kind of laxity will not be tolerated in this case,” he said.North DMC education committee chairperson Garima Gupta termed it an “inadvertent mistake”. “It’s a big mistake but not intentional. We are looking into it and strict action will be taken if anyone is found to be lax,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pok-missing-from-india-map-sent-to-class-4-students-of-north-mcd-schools-inquiry-ordered/story-7l4tSTTZObEuKbym7KXxgL.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Assess before you plan, residents caution DDA||Residents have questioned the way the next master plan for Delhi is being created, citing problems in the current blueprint which had to guide the city’s development till 2021. Residents Welfare Associations (RWAs) have pointed out several issues with MPD-2021 such as rampant commercialisation due to mixed land-use policy, frequent amendments to the plan regularise “illegal” developments and lack of implementation of the provisions under the plan. They said the next master plan should take into account “ground realities” and provide real solutions to local problems.During a consultation session organised by the DDA with RWAs of plotted areas on Thursday, a majority of RWAs cited the problem of rampant commercialisation due to mixed land-use, which was allowed in MPD-2021. In the last 13 years, after the mixed land-use policy was implemented, residential areas have been commercialised leading to several problems such as congestion, parking and lack of security besides burdening the civic infrastructure. Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-I, said, “It has destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods. Today, safety and security has become our foremost concern due to rampant commercialisation of residential areas. We don’t know who is entering our areas. It has destroyed the social fabric.” A senior DDA official said, “A common concern expressed by most participants was regarding conflicts between commercial and residential uses and issues arising out of mixed land-use. The next MPD-2041 will look into these aspects.”The Save Our City campaign, a collective of over 70 RWAs and civil society members, has sought reply from the DDA on 17 key issues related to transportation, health, city planning, poor implementation of MPD-2021, etc. They have also questioned the expertise of the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been tasked by the DDA to prepare the MPD-2041. “What is their expertise in preparing the MPD-2021? So many provisions of the MPD-2021 have been challenged in the court. Will those cases become infructuous?” said Kakria.RWAs say that the DDA should first do an assessment of the impact of the current MPD-2021 on the city. “Over 250 amendments were made to MPD-2021. Instead of the city being developed according to it, the master plan was fixed as per ground realities. What’s the point of having yet another plan which is cut off from the ground realities? DDA should first do an assessment of the current plan,” said Pankaj Aggarwal, general secretary of Delhi RWA joint front.Dwarka, a master plan subcity, is a case in point. Residents of Dwarka say that they had to face harrowing time in the initial years and struggle for everything from road infrastructure to water. “This is the condition of a master plan sub-city, which today has a population of nearly one million. Till date, we don’t have a vegetable and fruit market. We had to struggle to get regular water connection. Development of new areas should be linked to availability of essential resources such as water,” said Rejimon CK, founder of Dwarka Forum.With waterlogging becoming an annual feature during monsoon season, RWAs also want the new master plan to focus on the sewer and drainage plan. While urban planners push for redevelopment, RWAs say, little attention is being paid to upgrade the age-old drainage and sewerage infrastructure. Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs in the city, said, “We have demanded an audit of the ‘Infrastructure available for sewer and drainage system in developed colonies and underdeveloped colonies’. It is essential, but a neglected part of overall planning.”While several RWAs participated in the public consultation, they said that DDA should have issue-based discussion with residents. They said that issues of mixed land-use, transportation, redevelopment, development of unauthorised colonies, etc impact plotted colonies. They said that DDA should share their plan with RWAs and then ask for suggestions.A senior DDA official said, “The main concerns highlighted by participants were about disconnected sewerage and road network, encroachment in unused land parcels, air pollution and parking management….Representatives of some colonies also highlighted issues of lack of footpaths, under-utilisation of tot lots, parks and other open spaces, dumping of garbage and construction waste, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assess-before-you-plan-residents-caution-dda/story-zXRCbs0LIMhBBc9B43wrBK.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||NASA to set up community response forum to assess impact of stubble burning in northern India||A month before harvest season begins in Northern India —which also means the onset of an increased pollution load in Delhi on account of large scale crop residue burning in the region — the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is rushing to set up a ‘community response forum’ to conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of stubble burning on the national capital and its neighbouring areas, while looking at possible solutions. NASA’s Universities Space Research Association (USRA) will work towards developing this community forum to cover multiple aspects of biomass burning and its impact on regional air quality in the Indian sub-continent during the winter months. Through the forum, NASA will also invite a panel of experts to share this knowledge with the public. Pawan Gupta, research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), USRA, said, “Air pollution season in India, usually associated with crop burning, will be starting soon. This year, we will be supporting satellite AQ (air quality) data analysis and forecasting through a community forum.” The first meeting of the forum will be conducted on September 24, after which the expert panel will meet twice every week starting October 1, till the end of the fire season.In addition, the forum will also be used to provide training sessions on how to use various earth observations and tools available to analyse fire, smoke, and air quality data. This is also being developed as a platform for researchers to share their data and solutions providing alternatives to farmers in the agrarian belt so that the problem of mass-burning can be dealt with. Every year NASA tracks fires in the agrarian states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in real time with the help of satellite data. Because of a change in the wind patterns and lowered wind speeds at the onset of winters — when stubble burning activity is at its peak — the capital witnesses a drastic dip in its air quality as plumes of smoke blow into the city from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Delhi government data shows that last year, stubble burning accounted for 44% of Delhi’s air pollution. It added that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes, out of 7 million tonnes, was burnt in 2019. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the government was willing to explore all possible solutions to reduce crop residue burning in the neighbouring states. “We are conducting regular meetings with the state governments of Punjab and Haryana, which are the two main states from where pollutants enter Delhi. We are also encouraging experts and researchers to develop technology interventions that can help farmers find alternatives to burning,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nasa-to-set-up-community-response-forum-to-assess-impact-of-stubble-burning-in-northern-india/story-HNB3FhGxk0gwoOMdxAS73H.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Govt uses data, better training to ramp up ambulance service in Delhi||As the number of Covid-19 cases in the city continues to surge, the Delhi government is working on a three-pronged approach to ensure that the performance of its ambulance fleet is optimal.The fresh approach — which includes a full-time control room for data analysis, weekly rearrangement of deployment locations and training of staff — will also look at ways to augment the fleet size, a senior government official said. The official said nine ambulances were added earlier this month, taking the total strength to 603 compared to 164 around four months ago. Of these, 286 are reserved for Covid-19 duty, the official said.Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, an advisory body to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, said: “We have a strategy in place for best performance of the ambulance fleet in the light of the spike in Covid-19 cases. And the whole programme is being closely monitored by the chief minister himself. First, we have set up a war room that analyses real-time data in multiple aspects of the ambulance service – from fleet size to response time – and a daily report is provided to the CM.”“Second, we have adopted a scientific approach towards the deployment of the ambulances. All Covid-19 related calls are analysed in terms of location and other aspects and the deployment of ambulances is re-arranged every week on the basis of the findings. Third, we have invested in thorough training of all ambulance drivers, paramedics and officials who attend distress calls,” Shah said.A think-tank named SaveLIFE Foundation will help the government.“Over the past five months, SaveLIFE Foundation has worked closely with the Delhi Government to manage the surge in demand for ambulances. By combining data science with the aggregation of private ambulances, staff training and smart deployment tactics, we have been able to bring response times of ambulances to an average of under 20 minutes. This, combined with several direct relief measures, has helped us serve the people of Delhi during the Covid crisis,” said Piyush Tewari, Founder and CEO, SaveLIFE FoundationGovernment records said the fleet size of the centralised emergency trauma services (CATS) – a free service under the government’s domain – was 164 on May 15. It was increased to 337 on June 1, to 569 on July 1 and 594 on August 15. On September 15, the fleet size had increased to 603, the records said.At any point, around 40% to 50% of the CATS ambulances were on Covid-19 duty.Covid cases in Delhi had dipped for around a month between mid-July and mid-August – a period in which the city recorded less than 1,000 new cases in a day on several occasions. The numbers, according to the chief minister’s office, started witnessing a spike from mid-August, prompting the state government to scale up testing.On Thursday, according to the state health bulletin, 4,432 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in 24 hours, as against 60,014 tests conducted, taking the total number of active cases to 31,721.Also read: Delhi reports 38 Covid deaths and 4,432 new cases; RT-PCR tests slip below 10,000The government, in order to increase its existing ambulance fleet, has in the past signed contracts with numerous small and medium-scale service providers and hired private ambulances from Delhi and also from neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Apart from the 603 ambulances in the government, there are around 800 ambulances that are run by private hospitals and service providers.The sharp increase in active cases over the last one month — from 11,068 recorded on August 18 to 31,721 on Thursday — has also led to increase in occupancy of hospital beds and institutional quarantine. As on Thursday, 9,251 patients were admitted in hospitals and quarantine centres, against 4,343 on August 18, government data showed.“With that, the load on the ambulance fleet has increased,” said an official in CATS .The government ambulances primarily ferry Covid-19 patients between hospitals and also from their residences to hospitals and quarantine centres. On Thursday, data said, they attended 1,535 Covid-related calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-uses-data-better-training-to-ramp-up-ambulance-service-in-delhi/story-hedyUhzHzvzXguRMReGz5H.html
18-09-2020||Delhi||Two-week exercise to identify locations for EV charging infra in Delhi||Government agencies will conduct a ‘comprehensive planning exercise’ for two weeks to identify locations suitable for setting up charging infrastructure for electronic vehicles (EV), the Delhi government said in a statement on Thursday.The public works department (PWD), Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), municipal corporations of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and other local agencies will take part in the exercise.On Thursday, the government had its first meeting of the ‘charging infrastructure working group’ that was set up under the capital’s EV policy, which was rolled out by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month.“All government agencies in Delhi, including the three MCDs, NDMC, DDA, PWD, transport department, DTC, DMRC, DSIIDC, etc., will carry out a comprehensive planning exercise in the next two weeks to identify concessional locations within their jurisdictions for the purpose of setting up public charging stations. Through this exercise, the Delhi government will roll out a coordinated strategy to set up 200 public charging and battery swapping stations at prominent locations in the city within a year,” the statement said.It said, “It was agreed at the meeting that given the emphasis of Delhi EV Policy on mass adoption of EVs in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicle segments, the charging infrastructure should focus primarily on setting up a large number of slow-charging stations consisting of AC-001 charging points (3.3 kW each) and limited number of DC-001 fast chargers (15 kW each), instead of setting up a few expensive fast-charging stations that cater primarily for premium four-wheelers. Additionally, developing a wide network of battery swapping stations was also identified as a key priority.”“In addition to public charging stations, establishing charging facilities in restricted public spaces such as malls, office complexes, group housing societies, hotels, education institutions, hospitals, etc., was also identified as a priority at the meeting,” the statement said.The Delhi government had notified the policy on August 7 with CM Arvind Kejriwal saying, “The policy has two objectives. First, to boost Delhi’s economy after the coronavirus pandemic. Second, to significantly reduce the pollution level and contribute to sustainable development.”The Delhi government, he said, would introduce financial incentives for people buying e-vehicles. A scrapping incentive, first in the country, for replacing the fuel-based vehicle with e-vehicles is one of the highlights. Interest on loans for the purchase of e-vehicles for commercial activities will be waived off and e-vehicles will be exempted from registration fees and road tax, the policy read.The Delhi cabinet had approved the Delhi Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, 2019, last year with an aim to reduce air pollution by offering subsidies and waiving road tax and registration fee for electric vehicles bought in the capital. Delhi has around 83,700 electric vehicles out of over 11 million vehicles registered in the city. Of the total registered EVs, 75,567 are e-rickshaws. There are only 908 private electric cars and 3,703 e-two-wheelers in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-week-exercise-to-identify-locations-for-ev-charging-infra-in-delhi/story-H3AUJJMXVjopfbTJHRX1rO.html

18-09-2020||Pune||Government order on oxygen supply for medical use affects industrial units in Pune||The state government’s decision to reserve 80 per cent oxygen supply to hospitals while keeping only 20 per cent for industrial purpose has adversely affected industries in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Chakan areas. According to industry representatives, the drop in oxygen supply has brought down production output by 25 per cent. Industrial oxygen is used in fabrication, plasma cutting, rubber and plastic cutting factories. To address the rising demand of oxygen for medical purposes in Covid situation, the government issued a notification on September 7 stating that priority shall be given to supply of hospital vis-à-vis industries in case need arises even if the proportion of medical oxygen goes beyond 20 per cent. The circular will remain in operation till December 2020. The circular by the government has also pushed oxygen prices. Industrial oxygen, earlier available at Rs 20 per cubic metre, now comes for Rs 60 per cubic metre. The Pimpri and Chinchwad small scale industries which have several such units where oxygen is used daily have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on September 8 seeking help for the industry. Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad small-scale industries association, said, “Around 25 per cent of work has been impacted in small scale industries and those who only run workshops of cutting different materials via oxygen are not able to process any work. “We completely agree that oxygen facility is needed for coronavirus patients, but many industries are not even getting the 20 per cent allocated oxygen quota.”. The letter sent to the chief minister by industry association requests administration to check black marketing of oxygen cylinders, increase oxygen production and reduce its cost. “We are diverting our stock to hospitals. We are unable to meet the demand of industry clients who need oxygen cylinders daily. We are obeying what the government has told us,” said Bhushan Sahani, Sahani Gas Industries, MIDC, Bhosari. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We have told manufacturers to increase the production of oxygen to continue the distribution smoothly in a ratio of 80% to hospitals and 20% to industries. Since Raigad district has an oxygen manufacturing plant we are also taking oxygen supply from them.” Aatmaram Bajaj, who runs an oxygen refilling centre at Bhosari that only deals in commercial supply, is facing difficulty in running the business. “I don’t have a licence to supply oxygen to hospitals. Hence, I am unable to do business since the last ten days as manufacturers are not supplying me oxygen citing the state circular as the reason,” said Bajaj, who has applied for licence for supplying oxygen to hospitals. Chakan-based oxygen manufacturers Inox and Taiyo Nippon were unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts to contact him on phone. SV Pratapwar, assistant commissioner Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pune, said, “The 80:20 ratio is given by the government, but prior to that the district collector had given an order of distributing oxygen in the ratio of 80:20 in Pune district one week before and it was implemented on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/government-order-on-oxygen-supply-for-medical-use-affects-industrial-units-in-pune/story-0DuPgfBVSIfn0CkTn8GDPL.html
18-09-2020||Chandigarh||Trio on the run after stabbing 19-year-old man to death in Dadumajra Colony||Police are on the lookout for three men who allegedly stabbed a 19-year-old man to death due to old rivalry in Dadumajra Colony (DMC) on Wednesday night. The three accused have been identified as Gaurav, alias Goru, Harsh, alias Nati, and Raman Chadda, all residents of DMC. Gaurav is a relative of a former BJP mayor.Police said the deceased, Karan, and the accused belonged to rival groups that often picked fights to prove their supremacy. The accused were identified by the friends of the deceased, who used to do menial jobs on daily wages. Police said Karan was arrested in an assault case in 2018, and the two groups had been at loggerheads since then. The complainant, Sanju Kumar, 20, a resident of DMC, told the police he and his friend, Ravi, were sitting below a tree when Karan approached them on his scooter and asked them to come along for a stroll. Their two other friends, Vishal and Ashu, also joined them and the five left on Vishal’s motorcycle and Karan’s scooter to the park near the community centre in DMC. “At the park, Karan saw someone approaching him, so he frantically jumped over the wall and went to other side. Soon after, we all heard his cries for help,” Sanju said. When they rushed to his aid, they saw Gaurav, Harsh and Raman assaulting Karan. “Gaurav was holding a sharp-edged weapon, while the other two restrained Karan by his arms. On spotting us, the trio fled and Karan collapsed on the ground,” Sanju added. The friends rushed an injured Karan on their two-wheelers to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, where he was declared brought dead. Karan sustained a deep slash on the neck, which caused his death, the police said. Sanju said the accused had slapped Karan around two weeks ago and also threatened to kill him. A case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Maloya police station. Police have secured CCTV footage that has captured the accused running. Efforts are on to nab them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trio-on-the-run-after-stabbing-19-year-old-man-to-death-in-dadumajra-colony/story-Y8p1uWD4BIlx04i4aBhlSP.html
18-09-2020||City||Protecting Rafale: Ambala admn bans pigeon, kite flying near IAF station||District magistrate Ashok Kumar Sharma on Thursday imposed a ban on pigeon flying and kite flying in the areas near the boundary wall of the Indian Air Force (IAF) station in Ambala Cantonment to protect Rafale aircraft from birds.The order will be valid within the range of 5 to 10 kilometres from the boundary wall of the station in Dhankour, Dhulkot and Baldev Nagar. Violators will face legal action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. As many as five Rafale aircraft that were formally inducted in the IAF last week are stationed at the airbase.Earlier this month, a senior official of the IAF had written to the Haryana government, highlighting the bird menace due to accumulation of garbage near the IAF station and pigeon flying. Thereafter, the state urban local bodies (ULB) department had asked the Ambala administration to clear litter near the airbase. Garbage leads to “high concentration of birds” in the 10-km zone, which has the potential to cause “very serious damage to the aircraft”, the department’s letter had said.Later, Haryana home minister Anil Vij, who is also an MLA from Ambala Cantonment and the ULB minister, also asked the officials concerned to take measures to check the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambala-dm-bans-pigeon-kite-flying-near-iaf-station/story-Yae2T7o9ZHCRQybJLp6VWM.html

18-09-2020||Delhi||Unlock 4.0: Young Delhiites throng nurseries to indulge their green thumb||“I had been stuck at home for months. So now when I got to head out in Unlock 4.0, I chose to go to a nursery because just the sight of greenery is a welcome change from the mundane walls that have engulfed my spirit during the pandemic,” says Prasoon Awasthi, a Delhi-based MBA student. Awasthi, whose parents also accompanied him to the recently reopened Sunder Nursery, adds, “There is so much open space, so social distancing isn’t something that was difficult to follow; it happened on its own. And we came back with flowering plants and seeds that we have planted in our house, which has finally become vibrant since the lockdown.” Many millennials in Delhi-NCR, who had nurtured their gardening skills while homebound during the pandemic, are heading to nearby nurseries now to indulge in their newly acquired hobby. Take for instance Nishtha Rathore, a Greater Noida resident, who shares that she recently visited a few nurseries in Delhi including Masjid Nursery at Pandara Road, and Royal Nursery, to look for certain plants of her choice. “The months of September and October are the best for planting flowering saplings. Petunia and Marigold were on top of my list of plants that I had to buy. I’ve even planted a few chilis in a pot near my window, and it’s such a joy to see them thrive. We also asked our landlord to put a few creepers in the balcony, so that it adds to the greenery,” says Rathore. Ajay Kaushik, assistant director (horticulture) at Delhi Tourism that maintains Garden of Five Senses, says the upkeep of gardens and nurseries in the Capital assumed a bigger role amid the pandemic. “Watering plants came under essential services and we rallied our workers to ensure it was done. We need plants for more oxygen levels in the city at this time.” He adds the flowering bushes in nurseries attract visitors at a time when stepping out is a luxury. “Plants like Champa, Hibiscus, Crossandra, Lantana, Verbena are in full bloom these days. Even seasonal ones like rainy season Lilies, Portulaca, Marigold and Cosmos have made public gardens and nurseries come alive and youngsters love to be in the company of this vibrancy,” explains Kaushik.Millennials don’t just view plants as plants anymore. Small shrubs can be the perfect home decor, or even an ideal eco-friendly gift. “Being surrounded by plants, trees was a refreshing experience,” says Ridhi Solanki, who works in Gurugram. She too made a trip to a local nursery recently, to purchase a succulent for her work station. “I roamed around the place for an hour, before I bought a small Jade Terrarium. It gives more colour to my desk,” she adds. Nursery owners and gardeners say the demand for small succulents, cactus, and flower plants has increased, even though business remains dull as compared to pre-Covid times. Vikram Saina, who runs the popular Masjid Nursery at Delhi’s Pandara Road, says, “There is a demand for seasonal plants, since flowering season is here. People have been coming to buy indoor plants, fertilisers and manure since many have taken to gardening at this time. Plants like Petunia, Chrysanthemums are top of the list because they are vibrant and add colour.”Vijay Pal, gardener at Sangeet Nursery in Shivaji Enclave, agrees with Saini. “Youngsters have been coming in for ceramic pots and small succulents which are hassle free. We have also been selling a lot of vegetable seeds since Delhiites have taken to organic farming and edible gardens,” he says. The owner of the nursery, Arun Singh Rajput, adds that oxygen producing indoor plants are also in great demand. “People have been buying Areca Palm, Snake plant, Aloe Vera and Tulsi to keep in their gardens.” However, he adds that since people did not step out earlier, the business has suffered losses. “Hum ₹100 ka plant ₹70 mein bech rahe hain. We are not even bargaining. So much of our produce decayed because we had no buyers. So as of now, we are just happy that people are stepping out to buy plants,” adds Rajput.

18-09-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election: LJP to take call on alliance in key meeting today||A partner in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is expected to take a call on whether it will remain on board as an ally for the upcoming Bihar assembly election or part ways at its state parliamentary board meeting on Monday. Elections in the state are expected to take place in October-November to elect a new assembly. Despite being a part of the NDA at the Centre and in the state, the LJP has trained its guns at the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, alleging that the government failed to meet promises. On Sunday, LJP president Chirag Paswan, who has not shied away from criticizing the JD(U) leadership, shot off another letter to chief minister Nitish Kumar reminding him that the promises made to people from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have not been met.The criticism has sparked speculation that the LJP is negotiating for more seats and other post-election agreements, failing which it could exit the alliance. If the LJP breaks ties with the NDA in Bihar, it will not be the first time that the party will be leaving a coalition. In 2005, it was part of the UPA-I but parted ways with the coalition ahead of the state assembly election, it however faced an electoral setback.“There are some issues that will come up for discussion. Leaders will be given a chance to put forth their concerns,” said an LJP functionary. Also read: Bihar Assembly Election - Half a dozen members of women commission in race for ticketsChirag, who earlier told HT in an interview that he was against the idea of having an election in the state amid the Covid-19 pandemic, could not be reached for a comment. He also said that during a meeting with the national president of the BJP, JP Nadda, he had raised the issue of deferring polls till the pandemic is controlled.BJP’s national media co-in charge and Bihar MLC Sanjay Mayukh said the NDA will “jointly” contest the 243 seat assembly poll and “win with a clear majority”. “The opposition has no vision and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda is moving ahead with full steam,” he said.While the BJP has maintained a diplomatic stance on the issue, the JD(U) sees it as a ploy to wrangle more seats for the upcoming contest. “There is little doubt that the statements are posturing for more seats. However, the party should remember that seats will be decided on the merit of the candidate and also its performance in the last assembly election,” said a senior JD(U) leader.In the last assembly election, the LJP contested 42 seats but won only 2. It made for the electoral loss in 2019 by winning six Lok Sabha seats and is hoping to get 36 seats to contest in the assembly election.The LJP is also trying to woo the voters by presenting a “younger face” as against Nitish Kumar who is battling anti-incumbency. There is also speculation that the LJP could emerge as a third front in the state with Chirag as the CM candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-ljp-to-take-call-on-alliance-in-key-meeting-tomorrow/story-ROb7xWjHpdXer2olZoulJI.html
18-09-2020||World||UN rights body fears descending of another ‘Iron Curtain’ in Belarus||Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya demanded on Friday an international mission to document what she called “atrocities” during crackdowns on anti-government protests but said she was ready to talk to end weeks of violence.She addressed a highly charged debate on the Belarus crisis at the UN Human Rights Council, where envoys from Minsk and its backer Moscow faced off against EU delegations who are pushing for sanctions and investigations.UN rights investigator Anaïs Marin told the session member states needed to act to prevent a major geopolitical rift. “Let’s not allow another Iron curtain to descend on the European continent,” she said.Marin said more than 10,000 people have been “abusively arrested”, with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands “savagely beaten”, since President Alexander Lukashenko retained power after a disputed presidential election on Aug. 9.Protesters say the vote was fraudulent. Lukashenko says he won the vote fairly by a landslide, and dismisses accusations of abuses which he says are part of a Western smear campaign.Marin’s speech was interrupted several times by objections from other UN members including Russian, Belarusian and other delegations who called a halt to her participation.The UN Human Rights Council session will consider an EU draft resolution for UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to monitor the crisis and report back by year-end.Tsikhanouskaya, in a video message to the 47-member state forum, called for the monitoring mission and said the government should hold another election.“I once again emphasize our willingness to talk with the authorities and look for peaceful solution to the crisis that has affected our nation,” added Tskihanouskaya, who fled her homeland for Lithuania during the protests.“We demand to immediately cease violence against peaceful citizens. We demand immediate release of all political prisoners,” she said. President Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko’s main ally, agreed to loan Belarus $1.5 billion at a summit on Monday, and the two countries are conducting joint military training exercises in Belarus.Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that special forces from Russia and Belarus had rehearsed a counter-terrorism scenario involving freeing hostages from a building in their “Slavic Brotherhood 2020” drills.It said more than 800 military personnel from the two countries were taking part in the training near the Belarusian city of Brest.During the UN debate, Ukraine’s foreign minister warned Russia against taking steps that may undermine the sovereignty of Belarus and destabilise the region.“It is heartbreaking to watch the footage of our close neighbours viciously beaten down and arbitrarily detained on the streets of their native cities,” Dmytro Kuleba told the debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-body-fears-descending-of-another-iron-curtain-in-belarus/story-8h9Qausbde0tSHrJwLQXqO.html

18-09-2020||World||US bans WeChat, TikTok from app stores citing security risk||The US will ban TikTok and WeChat from Sunday over concerns that they pose a national security threat, and put technical restrictions on the Chinese-owned apps that would effectively shut them down in the country. The move comes close on the heels of India’s ban of the two apps along with 57 others following border clashes with China; 118 more have since been added to India’s ban list.The commerce department said US businesses will be prohibited in a staggered manner from conducting financial transactions relating to the companies.TikTok, a widely popular video sharing platform owned by ByteDance; and WeChat, a messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by Tencent, will not be available for downloads or upgrades from Google and Apple stores from Sunday night.The bans affect only new downloads and updates and are less sweeping than expected, particularly for TikTok, giving ByteDance some breathing space to clinch an agreement over the fate of its US operations. Oracle Corporation is in talks to buy a 20% minority stake in TikTok. WeChat faces more severe restrictions from Sunday. Existing TikTok users, on the other hand, will see little change until November 12 when a ban on some technical transactions will kick in, affecting its functionality.“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of US laws and regulations,” said commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, announcing the new orders in a statement on Friday.The order prohibits “any provision of service to distribute or maintain” these apps in the US from Sunday. It also bans financial transactions on WeChat from Sunday in the US. The app is widely used by American companies for marketing in China, which does not allow outside social media companies there such as Facebook. US companies will also not be allowed to provide internet hosting and cloud services for the app.The US targeted these Chinese apps in August through two presidential executive orders, saying they posed a threat to its national security. It had earlier welcomed the ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps by India.President Donald Trump’s executive order had given TikTok 45 days to find an American buyer for its US operation or face closure. Microsoft had emerged as a top bidder but it has since backed out, leaving the field to Oracle, in partnership with Walmart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-wechat-tiktok-from-app-stores-citing-security-risk/story-kDS7oWwoM0dQ4KII6s4uNM.html

At the time, the White House called the assertion that Trump had tried to reach a deal with Assange “a complete fabrication and a total lie”.Rohrabacher said he had never spoken with the president about Assange, denied being sent on Trump’s behalf and said he was acting on his own when he offered to ask Trump for a pardon for Assange.Robinson said Rohrabacher’s offer was presented to Assange as a “win-win” solution that would allow Assange “to get on with his life” and in return would also politically benefit Trump.During the 2016 US presidential campaign, WikiLeaks published a series of Democratic National Committee emails damaging to candidate Hillary Clinton. US investigators have concluded that the emails were hacked by Russia as part of an effort to influence the election.The 2016 election leaks are not directly a part of the US criminal case against Assange, which covers secret military and diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks several years earlier.Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Moscow.Assange is fighting the US extradition request, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped. After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy by British police in 2019.

18-09-2020||World||EU regulator backs dexamethasone as Covid-19 treatment||Europe’s healthcare regulator has endorsed using dexamethasone to treat Covid-19 patients with breathing difficulties, paving the way for the steroid to become the region’s second approved treatment for the respiratory illness.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday the drug could be an option to treat adults and adolescents needing oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, after concluding its review of results from a trial by British scientists.The study, dubbed RECOVERY, by researchers at the University of Oxford, showed in June that dexamethasone reduced death rates by about a third in severely ill, hospitalised Covid-19 patients. The drug has since been approved in Japan as a Covid-19 treatment.The decades old drug is cheap and widely available, commonly used against a range of inflammatory conditions. Companies can now apply for a licence to their national regulators or the EMA for an expanded use of the drug, the watchdog said.It said the recommended dose in adults and adolescents, from the age of 12 years and weighing at least 40 kilograms, was 6 milligrams once a day for up to 10 days.The EMA was already evaluating Taw Pharma’s branded steroidal version of the medicine for the illness caused by the novel coronavirus after it received an application from the drug developer earlier this month.Britain’s Hikma Pharmaceuticals said in June it had seen demand increase and was prepared to scale up production following the recovery results. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the EMA endorsement.While approvals are up to the European Commission, it typically follows the EMA’s recommendations for its decisions.Gilead’s antiviral drug, remdesivir, was the first to be approved for Covid-19 by Europe in July, about a month after the EMA endorsed the drug. It is branded as Veklury in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-backs-dexamethasone-as-covid-19-treatment/story-Uoc3GNd2tqTR9SNp1osMGP.html
18-09-2020||World||Demographics to help India overcome coronavirus woes, says Todd Buchholz||A large population and continuing reforms will help India overcome its recent economic downturn, a former White House economic adviser said in an interview.“Unlike China which has hit a giant brick wall on demographics, India is not facing that,” Todd Buchholz, former White House director of economic policy and author, said in an interview Friday. “Those investors who were lining up to invest in India in January 2020 will do so in 2021 also, and deregulation has to continue.”Besides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is viewed more favorably by global investors and as a result, investments should gather pace once the pandemic eases, he said, adding that the virus is a temporary phenomenon.India’s 1.3 billion population -- set to overtake China’s in 2027 -- spells huge opportunities for countries like the U.S. and other western nations seeking to diversify their dependence away from Asia’s biggest economy amid rising trade tensions. On its part, India is trying to lure more global companies to set up shop by offering incentives.India is also of “great importance” for the U.S. especially to act as a counter-weight to the growing influence of China, Buchholz said.The U.S. views China’s Belt and Road Initiative to build ports and other strategic infrastructure in places such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Myanmar as paving the way for Beijing’s military influence overseas. At the same time, India’s own relations with China have deteriorated over a conflict along their disputed Himalayan border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/demographics-to-help-india-overcome-coronavirus-woes-says-todd-buchholz/story-CBvWlpQ8B9zDIfyA6DN3KO.html
18-09-2020||World||Trump blocks TikTok, WeChat operations in US from Sunday||The US Commerce Department issued an order on Friday that will bar people in the United States from downloading Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok starting on September 20.Commerce officials said the ban on new US downloads of TikTok could be still rescinded by President Donald Trump before it takes effect late Sunday as TikTok owner ByteDance races to clinch an agreement over the fate of its US operations.ByteDance has been talks with Oracle Corp and others to create a new company, TikTok Global, that aims to address US concerns about the security of its users’ data. ByteDance still needs Trump’s approval to stave off a US ban.Watch | TikTok, WeChat use to be banned in US from September 20: All you need to know Commerce officials said they will not bar additional technical transactions for TikTok until Nov. 12, which gives the company additional time to see if ByteDance can reach a deal for its US operations. “The basic TikTok will stay intact until Nov. 12,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network.The department said the actions will “protect users in the US by eliminating access to these applications and significantly reducing their functionality.”Oracle shares fell 1.6% after the news in pre-market tradingThe Commerce Department order will “deplatform” the two apps in the United States and bar Apple Inc’s app store, Alphabet Inc’s Google Play and others from offering the apps on any platform “that can be reached from within the United States,” a senior Commerce official told Reuters.The order will not ban US companies from doing businesses on WeChat outside the United States, which will be welcome news to US firms like Walmart and Starbucks that use WeChat’s embedded ‘mini-app’ programs to facilitate transactions and engage consumers in China, officials said.The order will not bar transactions with WeChat-owner Tencent Holdings’ other businesses, including its online gaming operations, and will not prohibit Apple, Google or others from offering TikTok or WeChat apps anywhere outside the United States.The bans are in response to a pair of executive orders issued by Trump on August 6 that gave the Commerce Department 45 days to determine what transactions to block from the apps he deemed pose a national security threat. That deadline expires on Sunday.Commerce Department officials said they were taking the extraordinary step because of the risks the apps’ data collection poses. China and the companies have denied US user data is collected for spying.Ross said in a written statement “we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of US laws and regulations.”The order is set to be published at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT) on Friday, Commerce said.Popular appsThe Trump administration has ramped up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from US digital networks and has called TikTok and WeChat “significant threats.”TikTok has 100 million users in the United States and is especially popular among younger Americans.WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, ex-pats and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.The Commerce Department will not seek to compel people in the United States to remove the apps or stop using them but will not allow updates or new downloads. “We are aiming at a top corporate level. We’re not going to go out after the individual users,” one Commerce official said.Over time, officials said, the lack of updates will degrade the apps usability.“The expectation is that people will find alternative ways to do these actions,” a senior official said. “We expect the market to act and there will be more secure apps that will fill in these gaps that Americans can trust and that the United States government won’t have to take similar actions against.”Commerce is also barring additional technical transactions with WeChat starting Sunday that will significantly reduce the usability and functionality of the app in the United States.The order bars data hosting within the United States for WeChat, content delivery services and networks that can increase functionality and internet transit or peering services.“What immediately is going to happen is users are going to experience a lag or lack of functionality,” a senior Commerce official said of WeChat users. “It may still be usable but it is not going to be as functional as it was.” There may be sporadic outages as well, the official said.Commerce will bar the same set of technical transactions for TikTok, but that will not take effect until Nov. 12 to give the company additional time to see if ByteDance can reach a deal for its US operations. The official said TikTok US users would not see “a major difference” in the app’s performance until Nov. 12.Commerce will not penalize people who use TikTok or WeChat in the United States.The order does not bar data storage within the United States for WeChat or TikTok.Some Americans may find workarounds. There is nothing that would bar an American from traveling to a foreign country and downloading either app, or potentially using a virtual private network and a desktop client, officials conceded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-blocks-tiktok-wechat-operations-in-us-from-sunday/story-uuDUZwlFokmShI1jB0P8nL.html

The suspects broke in by cutting holes in the roof and then abseiling down, avoiding many sensors. The books were stolen in 16 large bags, with the suspects leaving the same way they entered. Detective inspector Andy Durham said: “These books are extremely valuable, but more importantly they are irreplaceable and are of great importance to international cultural heritage”.“If it wasn’t for the hard work of Detective Constable David Ward and others in this Joint Investigation Team, these books would have been sadly lost to the world forever.”Scotland Yard’s investigation identified that the suspects involved were part of the Romanian gang that was responsible for high-value warehouse burglaries across the UK. The police said the gang flies members into the UK to commit specific offences and then fly them out of the country shortly afterwards, with the stolen property taken out of the country by other gang members using different transport methods.The gang, the police added, is linked to a number of prominent Romanian crime families who form part of the Clamparu crime group, based in the Iași region in Eastern Romania and has a history of complex and large-scale high value thefts, yet avoided prosecution by offending outside Romania.A joint operation with the Romanian National Police and Italian Carabinieri, supported by Europol and Eurojust culminated in coordinated arrests and searches of 45 addresses across the UK, Romania and Italy in June 2019.Thirteen individuals were charged in the UK with conspiring to commit burglaries between December 2016 and April 2019, and to acquire criminal property. Court proceedings continue, with 12 individuals already pleading guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/200-stolen-books-including-by-newton-and-galileo-recovered-in-romania/story-YX94TcKO3FmYvJBDGSLnTN.html
18-09-2020||World||STOPCovid: Researchers develop new Covid-19 test that can be done in less than an hour||Researchers have developed a new rapid test for the detection of the novel coronavirus that can be performed in less than an hour, and with minimal equipment, and “can detect nearly as many cases as the standard Covid-19 diagnostic.” With further research, the scientists, including those from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, said the new test, known as STOPCovid, could be made cheaply enough so that people could test themselves every day. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers showed that the new test detected 93% of the positive cases as determined by conventionally used Covid-19 diagnostic. “We need rapid testing to become part of the fabric of this situation so that people can test themselves every day, which will slow down outbreak,” said study co-author Omar Abudayyeh from MIT. The researchers hope the test could be further developed for use in point-of-care settings, such as doctors’ offices, pharmacies, nursing homes, and schools. While other tests based on CRISPR technology provide a method for the the detection of viral pathogens, the scientists said these are more complex than the ones used in point-of-care testing. They explained that such tests depend on an RNA extraction process and multiple liquid-handling steps that increase the risk of cross-contamination of samples. “We developed STOPCovid so that everything could be done in a single step,” said Julia Joung, another co-author of the study from MIT. “A single step means the test can be potentially performed by nonexperts outside of laboratory settings,” Joung said. In the latest version of STOPCovid, reported in the study, the researchers incorporated a process to concentrate the viral genetic material in a patient sample by adding magnetic beads that attract RNA. They said this step eliminates the need for expensive purification kits that are time-intensive and can be in short supply due to high demand. According to the researchers, this concentration step boosts the test’s sensitivity so that it now approaches that of the conventionally used PCR diagnostic method. “Once we got the viral genomes onto the beads, we found that that could get us to very high levels of sensitivity,” said Jonathan Gootenberg, another co-author of the study. The researchers tested STOPCovid on 402 patient samples -- 202 positive and 200 negative -- and found that it detected 93 percent of the positive cases as determined by the standard US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) PCR test. They said the STOPCovid test works on samples taken using the less invasive anterior nasal swab. The scientists are currently testing it with saliva samples, which they said may make at-home tests even easier to perform. “The goal is to make this test easy to use and sensitive, so that we can tell whether or not someone is carrying the virus as early as possible,” said Feng Zhang, a co-author of the study from MIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stopcovid-researchers-develop-new-covid-19-test-that-can-be-done-in-less-than-an-hour/story-IXTXayCa08D4HTuchOeOjP.html
18-09-2020||World||UK to launch new Covid curbs, not ruling out national lockdown||Another national lockdown in the UK is not being ruled out on Friday, as the number of new cases shows an ‘acceleration’ in recent days.The number of those hospitalised is doubling every eight days, after the pandemic appeared well in control in July and August.New curbs called ‘circuit break’ are expected to be announced next week, aimed at restaurants, pubs and other hospitality areas. They could be shut or asked to close early for some weeks. Parts of north England have been placed under new curbs.This week, the number of patients in mechanical ventilator beds has risen above 100 for the first time since July. After daily new cases fell below 100 in July and August, they rose above 2,000 from early September. Thursday saw 3,395 new cases.Facing intense pressure due to inability of many to get tests, health secretary Matt Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Friday: “This is a big moment for the country. We are seeing an acceleration in the number of cases”. “And we are also seeing that the number of people hospitalised with coronavirus is doubling every eight days. We are now starting to see the effects in hospital”.Asked if he was considering a new national lockdown, he said: “I have learned over the last nine months not ever to rule anything out. However, it is not the proposal that’s on the table”, stressing that it is “critical” that people follow social distancing guidelines.“If we do all these things, we can avoid having to take serious further measures,” he added.Government medical and science advisers have reportedly recommended another national lockdown, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson is against the severe measure that could further affect the economy.There is growing concern about the new rise in cases in view of the onset of winter, when flu, cold and other seasonal ailments occupy the National Health Service. The diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus in such a context adds a new challenge to the beleaguered health system grappling with severe staff shortage and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-launch-new-covid-curbs-not-ruling-out-national-lockdown/story-GePXMuvjAWu6pT3KEvERrO.html

18-09-2020||World||‘This is a big moment:’ UK government cautions on coronavirus||Fresh restrictions on social gatherings in England, potentially involving limiting pub opening hours, appear to be on the cards soon as the British government seeks to suppress a sharp spike in new coronavirus infections.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Friday that the country has to “come together” over the coming weeks to get on top of the spike, which he noted is leading to a doubling in the number of people being hospitalized with the virus every seven to eight days.“We want to avoid a national lockdown altogether, that is the last line of defense,” he told BBC radio. “It is not the proposal that’s on the table.”Following days of criticism over its testing strategy, there is mounting speculation that the government will announce fresh curbs on the hospitality sector, such as pubs and restaurants, potentially involving curfews — something that has already been put in place in areas that are already under lockdown restrictions.According to the BBC, the British government’s chief scientific adviser and medical officer warned of another serious coronavirus outbreak and many more deaths by the end of October if there were no further interventions. Possible measures are said to include asking some hospitality businesses to close, or limiting opening hours.The testing that is being conducted has already seen a sharp increase in cases over the past couple of weeks that have raised fears that the country with Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak may be in for a second wave during the winter. Critics say it has lost control of the virus and that’s why new measures are being introduced.Already this week, a ban on social gatherings of more than six people, including children, has come into effect for England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — have announced similar clampdowns on meetings.Tougher restrictions on people and businesses in parts of northeastern England have also been announced, and there is speculation that an area in northwest England will see fresh curbs on Friday.The latest daily figures show that another 3,395 new confirmed cases were reported. That down on the previous day’s 3,991, the seven-day average is around double the level a couple of weeks back.As the experience of the pandemic has shown, there’s usually a lag of a week or two between a rise in cases and hospitalizations and then a subsequent lag for deaths.It’s clear that the increase in cases is leading to a higher number of people requiring acute care. The number of patients being treated for the disease in hospitals in England increased to 894 on Wednesday, up from 472 on Sept. 1, according to the latest government statistics. The number of hospitalized patients on ventilators rose to 107 from 59 in the same period.The worry is that deaths will start to increase markedly in the days and weeks ahead. Though the U.K. is recording far fewer deaths on a daily basis than it did earlier this year, it still registered another 21 on Thursday, taking the total of those having died 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,705.“This is a big moment for the country,” Hancock said. “We are seeing an acceleration in the number of cases and we are also seeing that the number of people hospitalized with coronavirus is doubling every eight days.”The government’s strategy over the coming weeks, he said, is to contain the virus down as much as is possible whilst ensuring schools and workplaces remain open.“And doing everything we possibly can for the cavalry that’s on the horizon of the vaccine and mass testing, and the treatments that, frankly, this country has done more than any other around the world to develop,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-a-big-moment-uk-government-cautions-on-coronavirus/story-bjDjKw2Yt6qvipsLHhe7bN.html

The candidate has been approved for use in the Chinese military.Scientists outside the company have expressed concern that the effectiveness of Ad5-nCoV, which uses a common cold virus many people have contracted to carry genetic traces of the coronavirus, could be limited. In response, CanSino said earlier this month there was no evidence that existing immunity against the common cold virus could severely hurt Ad5-nCoV’s ability to trigger antibodies against the new coronavirus, citing data gathered from a single dose-based Phase 2 trial. In July, researchers working on Ad5-nCoV said a flexible additional dose might be able to provide enhanced immune response, based on their previous experience using this method to develop a common cold virus-based Ebola vaccine.The new two-dose Phase 1 trial will test the safety of two doses and their ability to generate an immune response, showed a registration record published on Thursday.Researchers expect to recruit 168 healthy adults to take two doses of Ad5-nCoV for the trial estimated to begin on Sept. 20 in China’s Wuhan.A CanSino representative declined to comment on the new trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-researchers-to-test-double-doses-of-cansino-s-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate/story-qAFwhmUKxHneDGQxRFtrzL.html

Both are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used there as the basis for viral treatments.R-Pharm’s announcement is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race against the virus. It is already exporting its Covid-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine. R-Pharm said it received approval for Coronavir after Phase III clinical trials involving 168 patients with Covid-19. The drug was first approved for in-hospital use to treat Covid-19 in July, a government register showed. Coronavir’s trial was comparatively small. The European health regulator on Friday endorsed the use of the steroid dexamethasone in the treatment of Covid-19 patients after a study by UK researchers on several thousand patients.R-Pharm has started talks with pharmacies about orders, the company’s spokeswoman said, with Coronavir supplies expected to be rolled out in the near future, possibly as soon as next week. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicCoronavir is made at R-Pharm’s facility in Yaroslavl, about 300 km (186 miles) northeast of Moscow. Avifavir has been available in hospitals since June but has yet to be supplied to pharmacies. Both are based on the active ingredient favipiravir, which is also the key component in Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s antiviral drug Avigan, approved in Japan as an emergency influenza treatment in 2014.Trials to test it against Covid-19 are ongoing around the world. Results of a Japanese study in July were inconclusive.It is produced by various Indian generic drugmakers including Lupin, Cipla and Dr Reddy’s for use against Covid-19 in India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-r-pharm-secures-approval-of-coronavir-for-outpatients/story-GoERJwz7ocJ5CsHzmTD5GI.html

18-09-2020||World||Donald Trump and Joe Biden hit unlikely battleground state of Minnesota||Minnesota has backed Democratic presidential candidates for nearly half a century and rarely receives much attention during the final stages of the race, when campaigns typically focus their resources on more traditional swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania.But Minnesota will feel like a genuine battleground on Friday when President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, campaign here to mark the beginning of early voting.They’re expected to avoid the urban core of Minneapolis to focus on rural and working class voters, some of whom shifted to Republicans for the first time in 2016. Trump will be in Bemidiji, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, while Biden will swing through Duluth, on the banks of Lake Superior and close to the Wisconsin border.Also read: Joe Biden says will campaign in person in US battleground statesSince narrowly losing Minnesota in 2016, Trump has focused relentlessly on the state in hopes that a victory this year could offset losses in other states. He has visited regularly and kept a close eye on issues of particular importance to rural corners of the state, reversing an Obama administration policy prohibiting the development of copper-nickel mining and bailing out soybean, corn and other farmers who have been hurt by trade clashes with China.More recently, he’s embraced a “law and order” message aimed at white suburban and rural voters who may be concerned by protests that have sometimes become violent. That’s especially true in Minnesota, where the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer sparked a national reckoning on systemic racism.But for all the work Trump has put into the state, it may elude him again in November.A series of polls over the past week show Biden has built a consistent lead over Trump. And in the 2018 midterms, Democratic turnout surged in suburbs, small cities and even on the Iron Range, across the blue-collar mining towns that were once labor strongholds but had been trending Republican.David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has produced anti-Biden ads, said Minnesota may help the Trump campaign build momentum.Also read: Authorities probe radio, website disruptions during Black Lives Matter protests“They’re looking beyond the poll numbers and seeing the potential there,” said McIntosh, a former congressman from Indiana. “It’s always smart strategy to go on offense somewhere.”In 2018, Democrats flipped two suburban congressional districts, took back control of the state House by winning suburban Trump-voting areas and came within one seat of winning control of the state Senate. Democrats won every statewide race that year, even as they lost a rural congressional district.Trump’s path to Minnesota success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas –- running up the score beyond his 2016 tally. It’s a strategy he’s trying to pull off elsewhere and depends on a robust field operation with the money and time to track down infrequent or first-time voters. That could be a tall order since Minnesota already sports one of the nation’s highest voter turnout rates.“I don’t think they’re there,” said Joe Radinovich, a Democrat who lost a bid for a northern Minnesota congressional district in 2018. Radinovich noted the major organizational challenge and expense in tracking new voters, making sure they’re registered and getting them to vote – especially during a pandemic. “We have relatively high turnout already. Most people vote. I just don’t think it’s there. I think those people showed up in 2016,” he said.In 2016, Trump won that district that includes the Democratic city of Duluth by 15 percentage points. But in the midterms two years later, Radinovich lost by just under 6 percentage points.Still, Trump has spent more than a year building a sizable Minnesota ground game. Republicans are out knocking on doors and interacting personally with voters in ways that Democrats mostly have not, preferring online operations amid the coronavirus.The president’s reelection campaign announced this week a $10 million ad buy in a series of states, including Minnesota. It has spent nearly $17 million on advertising in the state since last October, compared to almost $6.3 million for Biden over the same period, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.Democrats warn that Biden still may have his work cut out for him. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said the Trump campaign has far outpaced Biden in local yard signs — which indicates enthusiasm but may not ultimately affect the outcome.“One of the things the Trump campaign has been very good about is visibility in Duluth, but also in areas around Duluth,” Larson said.Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that while Biden isn’t likely to carry the congressional district that includes Duluth, he might be able to pick up enough support there to deny Trump the votes he needs to win statewide.“If your opponent is on the ropes or on the ground, you don’t get up,” Martin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-hit-unlikely-battleground-state-of-minnesota/story-Ml1Rw09EPDllvJEb7jLO9H.html

Know more||China’s Sinovac Biotech plans to start a clinical trial of its experimental vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with children and adolescents later this month.According to a registration record published on Wednesday, 552 healthy participants aged between three and 17 will take two doses of US-listed Sinovac’s CoronaVac or a placebo in a combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial estimated to begin on September 28 in the northern Chinese province of Hebei.The World Health Organization (WHO) said that data so far suggests the virus generally causes milder disease in children compared with adults, but some cases of children requiring intensive care have been also reported.Also read | China to make decision on WHO vaccine program snubbed by Donald TrumpSeveral hundred children were admitted to US hospitals with a rare but severe inflammatory syndrome, which could include symptoms such as fever, rashes and swollen glands, associated with the coronavirus disease.The trial has already approved by the Chinese regulator, a Sinovac spokesperson said, according to Reuters. The Chinese vaccine maker’s shot is already in the final stage of study with adults.CoronaVac, being tested in final-stage large-scale trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, has already been given to about 90% of the company’s employees and their families.Also read | Rich countries snap up half of Covid-19 vaccine supplyChina has inoculated at least tens of thousands of its citizens rolling out experimental coronavirus vaccines despite expert concerns over the safety of drugs that have not completed standard testing.Sinovac said earlier this month CoronaVac appeared to be safe and able to induce antibodies for older people, while the vaccine-generated antibody levels were slightly lower than seen in younger adults, citing preliminary results from an early to mid-stage trial.CanSino Biologics and China National Biotec Group have also kicked off testing in countries including Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Chile and Morocco.According to Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 data, there are more than 30 million coronavirus disease cases worldwide and 944,887 people have succumbed to the viral disease.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-to-test-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-in-kids-teens-know-more/story-eWv2D1SvEkGvOJiUqlvygJ.html
18-09-2020||World||China to make decision on WHO vaccine program snubbed by Donald Trump||China faces a major test in its vaccine diplomacy, with a deadline fast approaching on whether it will officially join a World Health Organization-backed effort to ensure everyone across the globe is inoculated against Covid-19.Friday is the final day for governments to decide whether to take part in Covax, an $18 billion initiative that aspires to give lower-income countries the same access to vaccines as wealthier nations. Beijing has said it “supports” Covax without clearly saying if it’s putting any money into the project. The confirmed list of participants will be published on Monday, Sept. 21, according to the WHO.Signing up would help to repair China’s image around the world over how it handled the initial outbreak in Wuhan, particularly since the Trump administration has refused to join Covax. So far, Beijing has focused on cutting one-on-one deals for vaccine doses with friendly governments as the US urges nations to shun Chinese companies for 5G networks, computer chips and big infrastructure projects.“Beijing is battling criticism from the West over the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan and China’s transparency around the early days of the virus spread,” said Kelsey Broderick, an analyst at Eurasia Group. “Joining a popular initiative like Covax would certainly help shift the perception that China is a bad actor.”President Xi Jinping in May promised that vaccines developed by China will be a global “public good” that can be shared by all. Still, China hasn’t clarified if it will sign up, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying only saying this month that China’s actions are “in essence the same with Covax.”Covax, which is also led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the vaccine alliance Gavi, is designed to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful vaccine candidates and give less developed countries access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable. It currently has nine vaccines in development and nine under evaluation in its portfolio. The goal is to secure 2 billion doses by 2021.China Expects Virus Vaccine to Be Ready in November, Expert SaysSelf-financing countries can pay up front for vaccine doses that would cover as much as 50% of their populations, though shots would be proportionally distributed among poor and rich countries alike as they become available. Governments that sign up are free to reach bilateral deals to secure supplies separately. Having China on board would be a big deal for Covax, which had some 172 countries in discussion to participate as of Aug. 24. The possibility of providing doses to even a fraction of China’s 1.4 billion people would boost critical mass, enhancing the alliance’s negotiating power.For China, Covax could act as a kind of insurance policy that allows it access to any successfully developed vaccine. While being a member doesn’t necessarily mean Chinese vaccines will be included in Covax’s portfolio, it’s probable that’ll be the case. China could also provide manufacturing support for a successful vaccine, regardless of which country develops it.Participation could mean that Chinese vaccine manufacturers play a significant role in the global roll-out. And if a Chinese-developed vaccine were selected their brands would benefit from WHO certification, according to Xiaoqing Lu Boynton, a consultant at Albright Stonebridge Group who focuses on health care and life sciences.China Made an Epic Dash for PPE That Left World Short on Masks“It would be a big boost for Beijing both from the industry perspective as well as politically,” she said.Diplomatic AngleChina doesn’t have much experience in manufacturing and distributing a vaccine for global consumption. The industry’s reputation took a hit in 2018 when two Chinese vaccine-makers were found to have cut corners in production, undermining confidence both at home and abroad.Still, China has been a front-runner in developing vaccines against the coronavirus. Nine of China’s vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials, and four of them got approval for final stage Phase III clinical trials in foreign countries.Biden Embraces Vaccines, Science: ‘I Don’t Trust Donald Trump’Tianjin-based CanSino was the first in the world to reach the crucial final stage of human testing for a vaccine it co-developed with the Chinese military. CanSino Biologics, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and China National Biotec Group have kicked off testing in countries including Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Chile and Morocco.The vaccine could help Beijing make up lost diplomatic ground as China comes under fire for threats to Taiwan as well as human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. China has promised to prioritize providing doses for at least 62 countries, including governments that have received infrastructure loans under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative. Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Morocco have formal agreements with China’s major vaccine manufacturers, and Egypt is close to signing one.“Both the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises would much like to protect their own infrastructure projects as well as personnel on the ground,” said Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at think tank Chatham House. “If the epidemiological situation improves across those countries, it would help China too.”Latin American and Caribbean countries have been promised a $1 billion loan to purchase a Chinese designed vaccine. Currently, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina have all made commitments to testing a Chinese vaccine. The region remains the hardest hit, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the world’s top 10 countries by total Covid-related deaths.Trusting ChinaSill, a global lack of trust in China due to Xi’s more aggressive foreign policy makes the international community doubtful of China’s behavior and intentions, said Yoshikazu Kato, an adjunct professor at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese diplomacy.“Under these circumstances, how can countries trust China?” he said.Trump-Xi Rift Plays Out With Some 100 Canceled Exchanges, TalksAn incident involving CanSino and Canada underscored concerns that China could use its vaccine for political purposes. The Chinese company was supposed to send its vaccine candidate so that clinical trials could begin in Canada, but Chinese customs hasn’t approved the shipments, according to the National Research Council Canada.Malaysia is in talks with many parties, including China. “We have more questions than answers at the moment,” said Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Southeast Asian nation’s Director General of Health. Vietnam, which has sparred with Beijing over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, last month agreed to purchase millions of doses of Russia’s vaccine, and it’s developing a national one expected to be ready late next year.Not everyone is concerned. The Philippines, which has expressed a willingness to accept a vaccine from the U.S., Russia, and China, rejected any notion that China may be using the vaccine to curry diplomatic favors. “No such concern about China’s vaccine at all,” said Teodoro Locsin, the Philippine foreign affairs secretary.“I think that it’s in China’s interest to join,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, referring to Covax. “If the world is still in the pandemic, China will not be in good shape either.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-make-decision-on-who-vaccine-program-snubbed-by-donald-trump/story-E2PvuWOOrYX3l2Dt4S7FKL.html
18-09-2020||World||North Korea might test ballistic missile during upcoming holiday||Analysts and security officials say they are watching for signs that North Korea may use an upcoming holiday to unveil new weapons or test fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), after a flurry of activity was detected at a key base.Formations of troops have been seen practicing for what is expected to be a major military parade on Oct. 10, the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Some observers say North Korea may showcase its largest missiles for the first time since 2018.Imagery analysts and security officials caution that so far there is no conclusive evidence of an impending launch. But after several typhoons lashed North Korea in early September, satellite photos have shown a flurry of activity at the Sinpo South Shipyard, including in a secure basin where a barge used in previous underwater missile launches is docked.“We’re monitoring developments, as there is a possibility that a submarine-launched ballistic missile test will be conducted there using ejection equipment shortly after the repair is done,” Won In-choul, the nominee for chairman of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers this week. Other South Korean officials have sounded more cautious notes, including incoming South Korean defence minister Gen. Suh Wook, who said on Monday that he considered an SLBM test unlikely because there is too little time to prepare ahead of the anniversary.On Thursday, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited a single unnamed source near the shipyard as saying the site “is bustling with activity to prepare for the ballistic missile launch,” with officials and researchers arriving since late August.38 North, a U.S.-based think tank, said in a report on Wednesday that imagery showed “heavy activity” at the shipyard, but that “no other indicators of launch preparations were observed.”Although the activity does suggest some kind of work is being done on the missile barge, which has either been moved from the basin or repositioned under a protective awning, it would also be consistent with basic repair work after the storm, said Dave Schmerler, a senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. On Sept. 4, the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said satellite imagery showed activity at Sinpo that was “suggestive, but not conclusive, of preparations for an upcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine launched ballistic missile from the submersible test stand barge.”Last October, North Korea said it had successfully test-fired a Pukguksong-3, which elicited no major reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by that country since 2017 as a diplomatic success and played down shorter-range launches.Although North Korea could roll out a new weapons system, there are no indications that the country is looking at “lashing out” ahead of the expected military parade, the commander of U.S. military forces in South Korea said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-might-test-ballistic-missile-during-upcoming-holiday/story-QBYeb78CuLssvNayAxdH8N.html
18-09-2020||World||US Embassy in Kabul warns of extremist attacks against women||The US Embassy in Afghanistan is warning that extremists groups are planning attacks against a “variety of targets” but are taking particular aim at women.The warning issued late Thursday doesn’t specify the organizations plotting the attacks, but it comes as the Taliban and government-appointed negotiators are sitting together for the first time to try to find a peaceful end to decades of relentless war.The “Taliban don’t have any plans to carry out any such attacks,” spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed told The Associated Press on Friday.Peace negotiations underway in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office, are in the initial stages with participants still hammering out what items on the agenda will be negotiated and when.Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said at the start of negotiations last weekend that spoilers existed on both sides. He said that some among Afghanistan’s many leaders would be content to continue with the status quo rather than find a peaceful end to the war that might involve power sharing.According to the embassy warning, “extremist organizations continue to plan attacks against a variety of targets in Afghanistan, including a heightened risk of attacks targeting female government and civilian workers, including teachers, human rights activists, office workers, and government employees.”The embassy did not provide specifics, including how imminent is the threat.The Taliban have been harshly criticized for their treatment of women and girls during their five-year rule when the insurgent group denied girls access to school and women to work outside their home. The Taliban rule ended in 2001 when a U.S.-led coalition ousted the hard-line regime for its part in sheltering al-Qaida, which was responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.One of the government-appointed peace negotiators, Fawzia Koofi, a strong, outspoken proponent of women’s rights, was shot last month in Afghanistan, but escaped serious injuries and attended the opening of negotiations last weekend. The Taliban quickly denied responsibility and Khalilzad again warned of the dangers to the process.The United States has said that perhaps one of the most dangerous extremist groups operating in Afghanistan is the Islamic State affiliate, headquartered in the country’s east and held responsible for some of the most recent attacks. The IS affiliate has declared war on minority Shiite Muslims and has claimed credit for horrific attacks targeting them.The United Nations as well as Afghanistan’s many international allies have stressed the need for any peace deal to protect the rights of women and minorities. Negotiations are expected to be difficult and protracted and will also include constitutional changes, disarming the tens of thousands of the Taliban as well as militias loyal to warlords, some of whom are allied with the government.The advances for women made since 2001 have been important. Women are now members of parliament, girls have the right to education, women are in the workforce and their rights are enshrined in the constitution. Women are also seen on television, playing sports and winning science fairs.But the gains are fragile, and their implementation has been erratic, largely unseen in rural areas where most Afghans still live.The 2018 Women, Peace and Security Index rated Afghanistan as the second worst place in the world to be a woman, after Syria. Only 16% of the labor force are women, one of the lowest rates in the world, and half of Afghanistan’s women have had four years or less of education, according to the report, which was compiled by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and the Peace Research Institute of Oslo. Only around half of school-aged girls go to school, and only 19% of girls under 15 are literate, according to the U.N. children’s agency.Nearly 60% of girls are married before they are 19, on average between 15 and 16 years old, to spouses selected by their parents, according to UNICEF.Until now, parliament has been unable to ratify a bill on the protection of women.There are also Islamic hard-liners among the politically powerful in Kabul, including Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who is the inspiration behind the Philippine terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a U.S.-designated militant who made peace with President Ashraf Ghani’s government in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-kabul-warns-of-extremist-attacks-against-women/story-8MA9GhaLO1GD2NhgWp5qUI.html
18-09-2020||World||Bangladesh economy shows early signs of pandemic recovery||A rebound in garment orders after demand crashed during spring shutdowns is helping to revive the Bangladesh economy.Apparel makers, the country’s main export industry, say they are looking ahead to Christmas orders from the U.S. and other major markets.Remittances from Bangladeshi workers employed overseas have also recovered, helping to relieve pressures from a pandemic quasi-shutdown during the spring.The Asian Development Bank reported this week that the economic comeback was encouraging. It is forecasting the economy will grow at a robust 6.8% annual pace in the fiscal year that ends in June if current conditions persist.That’s a much brighter outlook than in April-May, when global clothing brands suspended or cancelled orders worth more than $3 billion, affecting about 4 million workers and thousands of factories.“At the moment we can say that the ready-made garment industry has been able to regain its growth trajectory upward compared to March-May,” Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, or BGMEA, told The Associated Press.“As economies in the West were turning around we were successfully able to get the buyers back to the negotiating table, which is why 80% to 90% of the $3.18 billion in cancelled orders have been reinstated,” she said.Bangladesh earns about $35 billion annually from garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe. The industry is the world’s second largest after China’s.Bangladesh’s exports rose 0.6% to $3.9 billion in July, after plummeting 83% to $520 million in April. Imports, which are reported on a quarterly basis, began recovering earlier, rising 36% in May-June.In August, exports rose 4.3% from a year earlier, to $2.96 billion, mostly driven by apparel shipments, according to the government’s Export Promotion Bureau. Garment shipments totaled $5.7 billion in July and August.“The garment sector is making a good comeback. Our agriculture is doing well. Remittances are coming. These all are good signs for the economy,” said Ahsan H. Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, a think tank in Dhaka.“The pace of the recovery is clearly visible. But challenges have been there too. The pace of the recovery will depend on how the pandemic behaves in the West over the next few months,” Mansur said.That’s the inestimable question facing everyone.As of Thursday, Bangladesh had reported more than 342,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and 4,823 deaths. The country confirmed its first positive case on March 8.Some experts say the actual number of infections is higher than the official count. The garment industry says few workers in its factories have fallen ill thanks to precautions such as employing fewer people on the production lines and imposing safety guidelines. The government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 26, and the garments sector was closed for nearly three months, reopening only gradually.The country director for the ADB, Manmohan Parkash, said the government has managed the crisis well, “with appropriate economic stimulus and social protection measures.”“We are encouraged by the increase in exports and remittances, and hope the recovery will be sustained, which will help in achieving the projected growth rate,” Parkash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-economy-shows-early-signs-of-pandemic-recovery/story-MS7VRSg82BKOuxPUh1tv0H.html

18-09-2020||World||Moderna shares Covid-19 vaccine trial blueprints, Pfizer follows||US biotech firm Moderna, one of nine companies in the late stages of clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine, became the first to publish the complete blueprints of its study following calls for greater transparency. Pfizer, the other American company currently carrying out Phase 3 trials in the US, followed suit a short time later and there is now added pressure for the remainder to do the same.Phase 3 is the final stage before approval, in which a vaccine and a placebo are tested on thousands of participants to verify the medicine is safe and effective.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe vaccine race has become deeply politicized in the US in the run-up to the presidential election in November, as President Donald Trump touts a quick vaccine in response to criticism of his handling of the pandemic.Trump repeated on Wednesday that the first vaccine would be approved by October, increasing concerns that the White House will place pressure on the approval body, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“I don’t trust Donald Trump,” his rival from the Democratic party Joe Biden said Wednesday.Experts and officials in the Republican president’s administration agree that it’s not possible to predict the results of the trials that are underway, and it’s highly unlikely to have strong data before the end of 2020.Vaccine doses will be initially very limited, according to health authorities.Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel said on Thursday his company would know whether their vaccine works by November. October is possible but unlikely, he told CNBC.The trial protocol published Thursday, which runs to 135 pages and is marked “confidential,” fixes the parameters of the experiment.The most important of these is how it will judge whether results are conclusive. Wait for itThe reality of an immunization trial is that it’s necessary to wait until a certain number of volunteers become naturally infected, in order to compare outcomes in the placebo group against the group given the vaccine.So the decline in the rate of infection in the US could theoretically delay the results -- possibly until December, said Bancel.As of Thursday, Moderna had recruited 25,296 volunteers. Among them, 10,025 had received their second dose, 28 days after the first.It’ll take a few more weeks to recruit the full quotient of 30,000 participants and for them to receive their second doses.Only Covid-19 infections recorded two weeks or more after the second dose are counted, to give the vaccine sufficient time to take effect.Interim analyses by a committee of independent experts are planned over the course of the trial to verify whether a high statistical threshold of effectiveness has been reached, and to monitor for serious side effects.The FDA has stated its bar for approval is a vaccine that reduces the risk of falling sick with Covid-19 by 50 percent.The Moderna trial protocol “has the key information (for) stopping rules, interim analyses and efficacy assumptions. Applaud their transparency,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute and one of the critics leading the charge against possible political interference, told AFP. Pressure onModerna also said that 28 percent of its participants were from racial minority groups. Having sufficient participants among black and Hispanic people in particular is crucial in obtaining statistically representative results for these communities that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic.The decision by Moderna, which has received $2.5 billion in US government money, left a spotlight on Pfizer, whose CEO has repeatedly said the company will have its results by the end of October, which is in line with Trump’s wishes.A spokeswoman told AFP Pfizer has traditionally not shared the full in-depth study protocol, but “the Covid-19 pandemic is a unique circumstance and the need for transparency is clear.” “As a result, the company is making the full protocol for its self-funded Covid-19 vaccine pivotal study available to reinforce Pfizer’s longstanding commitment to scientific and regulatory rigor that benefits patients.” The other frontrunner is AstraZeneca, which has co-developed a vaccine with the University of Oxford. The medicine’s global trials were suspended last week after a participant had an unexplained illness, but were later restarted in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. The US remains the exception for reasons that aren’t yet known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-shares-covid-19-vaccine-trial-blueprints-pfizer-follows/story-KrS0KKwQVnCop2BEx1tCOP.html
18-09-2020||World||Trump campaign denies sexual assault claims by the president in 1997||US President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign on Thursday denied a Guardian newspaper report in which a former model accused the New York real estate developer of sexually assaulting and groping her at the US Open tennis tournament in 1997.The Guardian reported that Amy Dorris told the paper in an interview that Trump assaulted her outside a bathroom in his VIP box at the tournament that year. She was 24 at the time, the newspaper said.“He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off. And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything,” the newspaper quoted Dorris as saying.The president’s re-election campaign on Thursday said the allegations were not true.“The allegations are totally false. We will consider every legal means available to hold The Guardian accountable for its malicious publication of this unsubstantiated story,” said Jenna Ellis, a legal advisor to Trump’s campaign.Efforts to reach Dorris by phone for comment were unsuccessful.The Guardian said in an email it stood by its reporting.The newspaper published photos that it said were provided by Dorris showing her with Trump and said that it interviewed several people who Dorris confided in at the time of the incident. It said that in total she provided six photos showing the two together as well as her ticket to the tournament on the day she said the incident occurred.Trump has faced a number of allegations of sexual misconduct prior to his time in office. Shortly before the November 2016 election an “Access Hollywood” recording from 2005 revealed him boasting about groping women. Trump dismissed the comments as “locker room banter” and apologized.Dorris, a mother of twins, told the newspaper she considered coming forward in 2016 but decided against doing so partly out of fears for her family.“Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let anybody do anything to you that you don’t want,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-denies-sexual-assault-claims-by-the-president-in-1997/story-mZqIqIt2FdTIB3hdwFWnnI.html

Indian officials said approvals will be given only after a thorough review.Sputnik V did not lead to side effects and triggered an adequate immune response in 76 volunteers according to phase 1/2 trial data published in The Lancet journal earlier this month. But the results have been disputed by some scientists, who have sought a review of the data, citing what they said were striking similarities between patients.RDIF reiterated on Wednesday that the vaccine is safe. “The Sputnik V vaccine, which is based on well-studied human adenoviral vector platform with proven safety, is undergoing clinical trials for the Coronavirus pandemic. Deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020 subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India,” a statement said.The Sputnik V is among several vaccine candidates being considered by Indian authorities for the country. Dr Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), earlier said that a high-level government committee was looking into the data coming from Russia on its Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-in-7-volunteers-for-sputnik-v-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-report-side-effects-russian-minister/story-0skeCHrE1ys9gKroFbXiIP.html
18-09-2020||World||Thousands of firefighters battle US West Coast blazes amid ‘overwhelming’ ruin||With resources stretched to the limit, weary crews on Thursday fought from the air and on the ground against deadly wildfires sweeping the western United States, with a US senator saying parts of Oregon now resemble the aftermath of World War Two firebombings.Scores of fires have burned some 3.2 million acres (1.3 million hectares) in California since mid-August and another 1.6 million acres (647,500 hectares) in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day on Sept. 7, laying waste to several small towns, destroying thousands of homes and claiming at least 34 lives.The Oregon Department of Forestry said 6,500 firefighters from the state and elsewhere in the United States and Canada were working to stop the blazes, along with other government agency emergency responders and community members. Twenty-six fires were still active in Oregon on Thursday, according to the state’s Office of Emergency Management.California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said more than 17,400 firefighters were deployed against 26 fires in the most populous US state.US Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon described driving 600 miles (965 km) in his state to get a firsthand look at the devastation, visiting refugee centers, fire control centers and towns burned by the blazes.“That 600 miles, I never got out of the smoke. I remember fires in the past where I was driving and I would be in the smoke for 20 or 30 minutes - that’s a big fire. This is apocalyptic,” Merkley told CNN. “To see ... these towns burnt to the ground, it looks like a World War Two town hit by firebombing - thousands of homes destroyed, residences destroyed.”Merkley said a lot of affordable housing was lost, including apartment buildings and mobile home parks, while some commercial districts were burned to the ground.“It’s overwhelming,” the Democratic senator added.The West Coast wildfires have filled the region’s skies with smoke and soot, but some areas on Thursday were the clearest they have been in days.Kyle Sullivan, a spokesman for the US Bureau of Land Management in Medford, Oregon, said a clearing of the smoke has allowed more firefighting to take place in the air with helicopters and planes dropping retardant.“We haven’t seen a lot of significant fire growth (this week). It hasn’t been super windy or super hot,” Sullivan said.Eight deaths have been confirmed in Oregon. One fire-related fatality has been confirmed in Washington state. California’s death toll stood at 25.‘Dreaming of fire’Drew Hansen, a 31-year-old logger raised on a tree farm near Molalla, Oregon, about an hour south of Portland, was part of a volunteer firefighting force battling the Riverside and Beachie Creek fires since Sept. 8.“This is my backyard, we’re fighting for our homes and families up here,” Hansen said as he and a crew rested outside his parents’ farmhouse, about five miles (8 km) southeast of Molalla. “It feels like we’ve not slept in a week. Even when I have slept, I’m dreaming of fire.”Just down the mountain road from Hansen, the fire’s toll was clear. One side of the road was lush and green. The other side looked like a moonscape of white and black ash, with giant tree stumps still smoldering.All along the mountain roads in and around Molalla, farm families put out handmade signs, thanking those who risked their lives to battle the flames.“This little town was surrounded by fire not long ago, and it was the civilians who stepped in when we needed help the most,” said Ashley Bentley, owner of a local feed store whose husband was among those in the woods fighting fires. “We had to act or the fire was going to take our town.”With the potential for some rain beginning on Friday in affected areas of Oregon, weather conditions may help the fight.“We are anticipating a small amount of moisture coming in this weekend, but it’s not going to be enough to end the fire season. It’ll help with firefighting efforts, but we’re still anxious about the potential for new starts,” the Bureau of Land Management’s Sullivan said.With improved weather finally enabling fire crews to take the offensive, crews have worked to beat back Oregon’s largest blaze this season: the 190,000-acre (76,900-hectare) Beachie Creek fire. It was 20% contained as of Thursday afternoon.Cooler weather and increasing humidity on Thursday was expected to help firefighting efforts in California, but authorities said warmer and drier weather over the weekend would bring more fire danger. Some 5,400 structures have been destroyed since mid-August in California.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-firefighters-battle-us-west-coast-blazes-amid-overwhelming-ruin/story-7LDfPqSnsLhiD7PpceMvfK.html
18-09-2020||World||Former Pence aide who helped organise White House Covid-19 response backs Biden||A former White House aide who helped coordinate the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic sharply criticized President Donald Trump in a video released on Thursday and said she planned to vote for Democrat Joe Biden.Olivia Troye, who was an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, served as a top organizer for the White House Coronavirus Task Force that Pence leads.Also read: Most Indian Americans back Biden but Trump gains ground, says pollA lifelong Republican, Troye, who left the White House in July, said in a video released by the group Republican Voters Against Trump that the administration knew around mid-February that Covid-19 would become a big pandemic in the United States.“But the president didn’t want to hear that because his biggest concern was that we were in an election year and how was this going to affect what he considered to be his record of success,” she said.Troye said it was shocking to see Trump, who downplayed the virus in its early stages, referring to it as a hoax and saying everything would be OK.“The truth is he doesn’t actually care about anyone else but himself,” she said in the video. “If the president had taken this virus seriously .... he would have slowed the virus spread, he would have saved lives.”Trump told reporters he never met Troye. He said she was let go but wrote a “beautiful letter” praising the administration on her way out.In that letter, released by the White House, Troye said it has been an “absolute honor” to work on the coronavirus task force but did not offer praise for Trump or Pence.Also read: ‘Fired up’ Joe Biden discusses strategy with Senate DemocratsPence, in comments to reporters, described Troye’s words as sounding like those of a disgruntled employee who was playing politics during an election year.White House spokesman Judd Deere said Troye was not directly involved in the coronavirus task force and did not meet with Trump privately. He called her statements “flat out inaccurate.”Biden, a former vice president, has sharply criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has caused more than 195,000 U.S. deaths, and promised to institute a national plan to fight it if elected on Nov. 3.Troye said it was an honor to serve in the White House but she wrestled during her time there with whether she made a difference because the president’s actions were detrimental to the administration’s efforts on the virus.“It was awful,” she said. “It was terrifying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pence-aide-who-helped-organize-white-house-coronavirus-response-backs-biden/story-DpIzxp3XpOKTJTog7u1g4L.html
18-09-2020||World||Navalny’s team ‘found Novichok’ in his hotel room||The nerve agent allegedly used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting that he was poisoned there and not at the airport as first thought, his team said on Thursday.Navalny fell ill on a flight in Russia last month and was airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Laboratories in Germany, France and Sweden have said he was poisoned by Novichok nerve agent, a poison developed by the Soviet military. Russia denies this and says it has seen no such evidence.A video posted on Navalny’s Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on August 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances.“It was decided to gather up everything that could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany,” the post said.The video of the hotel room shows two water bottles on a desk, and another on a bedside table. Navalny’s team members are seen placing items into plastic bags. “Two weeks later, a German lab found traces of Novichok on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room,” the post said. Previously, Navalny’s aides had said they suspected he had been poisoned with a cup of tea he drank at Tomsk airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-s-team-found-novichok-in-his-hotel-room/story-2SnG3nsnkeJggtpLknXZkK.html
18-09-2020||World||Don’t ‘throw away’ stimulus money on fossil fuels: UN chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Thursday on governments not to “throw away” economic stimulus funds by supporting fossil fuel industries that contribute to global warming.Speaking at a virtual conference on climate change, Guterres noted that countries have “a choice of two paths” as they mobilise trillions of dollars of taxpayers’ money for economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Also read: India at UN cautions against linking environmental degradation to peace and security“We can either throw away money on the fossil fuels of the past. That is the road to more pollution,” he said. “Or we can invest in the technologies of the future, renewable energy, nature-based solutions, sustainable transport and green technologies.” “Only one of these paths is rational,” he said.The UN chief noted that large investors are already pulling their money out of heavily polluting industries, especially coal.“Without taxpayer subsidies they are bankrupt enterprises,” he said, claiming that building new renewable energy plants is already cheaper than continuing to operate almost two-fifths of the world’s existing coal-fired plants.Several countries, including coal-reliant Germany, have recently agreed to phase out the use of coal for electricity because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide produced from burning it.In the United States, numerous coal-fired power plants have been shut down in recent years since 2010 and none of the nation’s energy companies are building a new one, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s stated support for the coal industry.Guterres’ appeal to governments to stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies was echoed by actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who helped organise the Austrian World Summit in Vienna.Also read: Environmental degradation a global concern, says commerce minister Goyal“When you hear that government plans to spend stimulus money bailing out fossil fuels, we must ask ourselves: if investors aren’t supporting those declining companies, why should taxpayers?,” Schwarzenegger said by video link from Los Angeles. “Governments must realize what the smart money knows instinctively: don’t invest in the past.” Efficient uses of money would include making buildings more energy-efficient and weatherproof, installing energy-efficiency appliances, cars using alternative fuels, and planting trees, he said.Since leaving political office in 2011, the Austrian-American actor has devoted time to environmental causes. A Republican, he has sparred with President Trump over climate issues.The meeting also heard a video appeal from Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate, who called for the need to preserve the Congo rainforest from destruction.“Use your voice to speak about the Congo rainforest, because millions of people heavily depend on its existence,” she said.Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist, cited the pandemic as a warning for what can happen when humans treat the environment with disregard.“To a large extent we brought this (pandemic) on ourselves, by our disrespecting nature and disrespecting animals,” she said. “We’ve created conditions which make it easy for pathogens to jump from an animal to a person.” “We need to rethink our relationship with the natural world,” Goodall added. “We need to get together to somehow develop a new green economy and perhaps we need to think of a new definition of what it means to be successful in this life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-throw-away-stimulus-money-on-fossil-fuels-un-chief/story-p8UFtudruYfgRWSfIdL0KL.html
18-09-2020||World||India at UN cautions against linking environmental degradation to peace and security||India at the UN on Thursday cautioned against “securitisation” of environmental issues, saying linking up everything related to environmental degradation to peace and security does nothing to address climate concerns meaningfully nor does it ensure that real perpetrators adhere to their commitments on environmental issues. Environmental degradation can have humanitarian impact or effect just as many other aspects of human activity have humanitarian dimensions, India said in a statement to the UN Security Council’s high-level open debate on maintenance of international peace and security: Humanitarian Effects of Environmental Degradation and Peace and Security. “However, merely to link up everything related to environmental issues with peace and security does nothing to enhance our understanding of the problem; nothing to help us address these issues in a meaningful way and does nothing to call out the real perpetrators and make them adhere to their commitments on environmental issues or help change behaviour of people at subsistence level,” it said. India said that in many cases, perpetrators of environmental degradation may well be “outside national boundaries” while the people suffering are inside. “Is peace and security then the right paradigm to address this issue or is strengthening implementation of agreements, an appropriate and probably a more effective way to do it?” it said. India said there has been an increasing tendency both in the Security Council and outside to start discussing environmental issues with a certain “disregard” for the various important principles which govern environmental discussions, including climate change and biological diversity. Principles such as common but differentiated responsibilities are sacrosanct in this matter, it said. India cautioned that “steering away from these principles and other commitments and attempting to discuss such issues by obfuscating those responsible for addressing them will only do a disservice to the real issue rather than making it more meaningful to address them. “Consequently, linking up environmental degradation to humanitarian effect and then to peace and security does not enhance our collective effort to address environmental degradation in any meaningful way,” India said. It also said that there is need for a collective will to address such important issues multi-dimensionally without shirking commitments under important conventions such as the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on Biological Diversity, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement. “What we need therefore is greater resolve to implement the commitments and contributions undertaken under environmental agreements instead of ‘securitisation’ of environmental issues,” India said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has consistently said that big emitters such as the US, China, the European Union, Japan, Russia and India must commit to carbon neutrality in 2050. He had also called on India and other G20 countries to invest in a clean, sustainable transition, particularly as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opened India’s coal sector for private players, and had termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. Guterres has voiced concern over countries doubling down on domestic coal and opening up coal auctions, saying this strategy will only lead to further economic contraction and damaging health consequences. At the UNSC debate, India noted that there is need for a greater sensitivity in connection with the energy mix of various countries many of which are not of their choosing. “One should resist the temptation of painting all countries with varied energy mix with the same brush. The touchstone should be whether respective commitments are being adhered to and not demonising one particular energy source and calling for action without allowing for organic energy transitions which require huge financial commitments,” India said. India stressed that environmental degradation is a multi-dimensional issue and it affects not just the ecosystem but also the people who depend and live on it. New Delhi noted that environmental degradation can be caused by those who live on it due to a range of inter-related factors, which may be poverty and not necessarily greed. “In many developing countries, such problems arise from issues related to people living at subsistence levels. The question then is: Do we want to treat poverty and subsistence agriculture as peace and security issues?” India asked. India asserted that even the best science available does not indicate that environmental degradation is a threat to peace and security. Highlighting its role as the leading contributor to ‘climate action’, India said over the past few years, the country has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually. In the course of the last decade, around three million hectares of forest and tree cover has been added, which has enhanced the combined forest and tree cover to 24.56 per cent of the total geographical area of the country, it said. Going forward, India aims to restore 26 million hectares of degraded and deforested land and achieve land-degradation neutrality by 2030. The country has also set additional targets of eliminating single-use plastic by 2022 and installing 450GW of renewable energy by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-at-un-cautions-against-linking-environmental-degradation-to-peace-and-security/story-Tj3uR7Kvxv5pnp4KN1sXsN.html
18-09-2020||World||Miami Herald apologizes for ‘racist’ insert column||The Miami Herald is investigating how it published a paid insert with what it called “racist and anti-Semitic commentary” and distributed to readers of its Spanish-language sister paper.The Florida daily’s publisher Aminda Marqués González earlier this week said it will no longer publish or distribute the content of the weekly supplement LIBRE.Marqués González and the managing editor of El Nuevo Herald Nancy San Martín apologized to readers in a letter saying they had not previously read the advertising insert until a column was widely shared on social media with commentary berating Jews for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement while comparing violent demonstrators to Nazis.“The fact that no one in leadership, beginning with us, had previously read this advertising insert until this issue was surfaced by a reader is distressing,” Marqués González said, adding that the paper did not have a process in place to review the content for that and other similar supplements.LIBRE accused the newspaper of censorship in an online statement posted on its website Wednesday while saying it provided advance copies and right to revoke content.The column that was flagged was written by Cuban exile Roberto Luque Escalona, who arrived in the U.S. in 1992. While still in Havana, he was once profiled in The New York Times and said to be “Cuba’s only declared leader of an opposition party active in the country.”In his column, Luque Escalona was reacting to a full-page ad published by The New York Times in late August signed by hundreds of Jewish groups backing the Black Lives Matter movement.Also read: Teenager in Wisconsin shootings charged with six criminal counts“What kind of people are these Jews? They’re always talking about the Holocaust, but have they already forgotten about Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish businesses across Germany? So do the BLM and Antifa, only the Nazis didn’t steal; they only destroyed,” he wrote in the column published last Friday.An Associated Press account of the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 said Jewish stores were looted.The Miami Herald has not said how long it has been publishing and distributing LIBRE to subscribers of El Nuevo Herald. Marques said the company was investigating the business relationship with LIBRE.After reviewing past issues of LIBRE, Marqués González wrote the company was “appalled to discover multiple instances of anti-Semitic and racist commentary since January,” the letter to readers said.Luque Escalona wrote in June about speculations that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was President Donald Trump’s first U.N. ambassador, could replace Mike Pence as Vice President.“Daughter of immigrants from India, a country that has nothing to do with ours, her original name is Nimrata Randawa. Just hearing it puts me off,” he wrote in Spanish.LIBRE was founded in 1966. The owner is Demetrio Perez Jr., a Cuban-born owner of a private school chain who has served as city commissioner and school board member. In 2001, he pleaded guilty to fraud for overbilling tenants while pocketing rent-subsidy money.In response to the Miami Herald pulling the weekly supplement, LIBRE said it disagreed with the columnist but defended his right to express his views. It also said Luque Escalona was a columnist for El Nuevo Herald for more than a decade.“At a moment in our nation’s history when every journalist should be demanding a free and unfettered exchange of ideas and full expression of them, El Nuevo Herald’s leadership has chosen to try to silence a vital community newspaper,” said the statement posted on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miami-herald-apologizes-for-racist-insert-column/story-pUCibWbm2XYy1xT4xj1thL.html

AstraZeneca and Oxford have continued to face questions about the event, and their vaccine study remains on hold in the US pending a regulatory review, federal officials said. It’s the first indication from Oxford as to the nature of the illness, which sparked concerns about vaccine safety.Also read: Rich countries snap up half of Covid-19 vaccine supplyAstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot had said earlier that it wasn’t clear whether the participant had a condition called transverse myelitis, after news reports cited it as a suspected diagnosis.

Some 51% of those jabs have been snapped up by the wealthy world, including the US, Britain, the EU, Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel.The remaining 2.6bn have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico.Trump on Wednesday said he would begin rolling out a vaccine in America as soon as next month. “We’re very close to that vaccine... We think we can start sometime in October” or shortly thereafter, Trump said.Over 170 nations join global vaccine planThe World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 170 countries have joined its global plan to distribute vaccines fairly around the world, but cautioned that a race to develop shots could lead to fears about safety.“We already face challenges with vaccine acceptance for many proven vaccines,” WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “We cannot risk having an effective vaccine for Covid-19 that people refuse because of the perception that it is unsafe.”Also read: Safety first, cautions WHO as 172 nations join Covid-19 vaccine distribution planThe European head of the WHO has warned of “alarming rates of transmission” of the virus in the continent.

18-09-2020||World||United States accuses Hezbollah of storing explosive chemical in Europe||Militant group Hezbollah has stored chemicals that can be used to make explosives in several European countries, a senior State Department official said as he appealed to countries in Europe and elsewhere to impose bans on the organization.Hezbollah operatives have moved ammonium nitrate from Belgium to France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland in recent years and are suspected to still be storing the material throughout Europe, said Nathan Sales, the State Department coordinator for counter-terrorism, on Thursday.Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound commonly used as a fertilizer, but it can be used to make explosives. It can also be dangerous in storage, as demonstrated by the huge explosion last month in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.Sales, without offering evidence, said the US believes that Iran-backed Hezbollah has since 2012 transported ammonium nitrate around Europe in first aid kits with cold packs that contain the compound. The United States believes these supplies are still in place throughout Europe, possibly in Greece, Italy and Spain.“Why would Hezbollah stockpile ammonium nitrate on European soil?” he said. “The answer is clear: Hezbollah put these weapons in place so it could conduct major terrorist attacks whenever it or its masters in Tehran deemed necessary.” Sales made the remarks in an online forum hosted by the American Jewish Committee, which has called upon more countries to ban Hezbollah and its operations.The US has designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization since 1997, but some countries distinguish between the organization’s military wing and the political wing.The EU lists Iran-backed Hezbollah’s military wing as a banned terrorist group, but not its political wing, which has been part of Lebanese governments in recent years. Some individual countries, including Germany and the UK, have outlawed the group in its entirety. Sales called on more countries to do the same.Hezbollah is a “unitary organization that cannot be subdivided into a military and so-called political wing,” he said. Without a full ban, the group can still raise money and recruit operatives. “Hezbollah is one organization,” he said. “It is a terrorist organization.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-accuses-hezbollah-of-storing-explosive-chemical-in-europe/story-KYXx6qQaYAiXSwIAGS01NN.html

Yet it took place at a grave moment, with the Covid-19 crisis and economic distress hanging over an election like no other. Biden fielded questions, particularly from senators facing re-election, about his strategy win back the chamber and defeat President Donald Trump.“You could tell he’s really fired up and he’s working hard and is going to be out there and be much as he possibly can,” said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who is seeking for a new term.Biden is on offense this week over the president’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. He planned to be near Scranton, Pennsylvania, his boyhood hometown, later Thursday for a CNN town hall, following Trump’s on ABC this week. The appearances have been considered tuneups before the three presidential debates; the first is Sept. 29.As Trump prepared for an evening rally in Wisconsin, Biden seized on the president openly contradicting the nation’s top health officials to claim a vaccine would be ready as early as next month, just before the Nov. 3 election.“Mark my words — if I’m president, I’ll always level with the American people, and I’ll always tell the truth,” Biden said in a statement.On the private call, Biden did not take on Trump directly, but outlined what’s at stake.“He just said, ‘You know what we’re up against. You know why this is so important,’” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., a party leader who organized the event.Biden’s message, said, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., was clear: “They’re ready.”Also read: Twitter places warning label on Trump’s tweet about voting by mailBiden’s campaign team has come under scrutiny in recent days over its outreach efforts, particularly for what some see as short shrift with Latino voters.

Joe Manchin said he encouraged Biden to remind workers how much he has been on their side during his many years in government.“I’ve said Joe, people need to know that you recognize the dignity of the work, the people have built this country,” Manchin told reporters. “They need to know that you fought for their pensions, you fought for their health care... and you’re not gonna leave them behind.”Concerns run high among senators over Russian election interference, stalled funding to shore up state election systems and Trump’s attempts to starve the US Postal Service of needed money just as many Americans will be mailing in their ballots to avoid crowds at polling stations during the virus crisis.At first senators were told there would be no questions, Manchin said, but Biden intervened. “Truly the Joe Biden we know,” Manchin said.Biden told senators he is making a play for “every state.” On a conference call later with Colorado leaders, he said his campaign will focus on mobilizing people to vote early, especially in places where such ballots are counted quickly, to keep Trump from declaring an Election Night victory before all the results are in.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden confidant, said the former vice president generally has been careful not to talk too explicitly about a new administration. There was no discussion of changes to the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule.“He must have said this three times, ‘I take nothing for granted,’” Coons told reporters afterward.Yet looking ahead, senators were eager to discuss a potential Biden White House — especially if Democrats control the Senate. Republicans have a narrow three-seat hold on the chamber, putting Democrats within reach of a flip.Biden’s longest-serving adviser, Ted Kaufman, who succeeded him in the Senate when he became vice president in 2009, is leading that process. Dana Remus, the campaign’s general counsel, and lawyer Bob Bauer, a White House counsel to President Barack Obama, also are playing key roles.Tops on any 2021 agenda would surely be a Covid-19 plan and economic rescue package. Whoever is president will also likely confront a battle over funding for the government, with Congress now compiling legislation to avert a shutdown for the coming months.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the Capitol as Democrats highlighted their proposed national Covid-19 strategy to test and trace caseloads to try to “crush” the pandemic crisis.The Democratic approach is outlined with $75 billion in the House-passed Heroes Act, which was a nonstarter in the Senate. Senate Republicans countered with $16 billion for testing in their bill as the two sides reached an impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fired-up-joe-biden-discusses-strategy-with-senate-democrats/story-OwyFEyrKlYWLfQPxL4jvPJ.html
18-09-2020||World||France tightening curbs in several cities to curtail surge in Covid cases||French authorities are preparing tighter restrictions in several cities to curtail a surge in Covid-19 cases that could again overwhelm hospitals, Health Minister Olivier Veran said Thursday.Veran, who will now hold weekly press conferences to chart the outbreak’s progression, said measures would be announced for Lyon and Nice by Saturday, after curbs on public gatherings were imposed this week in Bordeaux and Marseille.Marseille could see even more restrictions, such as bar closings or a ban on public gatherings, “if the situation doesn’t improve,” he said.Already the so-called incidence rate, the number of cases for every 100,000 inhabitants, stands at 200 in Lyon and Nice, which Veran said was four times the virus alert threshold.And a growing number of patients require intensive care, he said, heightening fears of a surge that would strain hospitals and health workers after the pandemic flared in March.“Our battle is to implement the measures that will avoid an influx at hospitals -- it’s a race against the clock,” Veran warned.“We have to take these decisions at the right time; not too early because they are restrictions, but not too late either.”Veran also urged patience over Covid-19 tests following widespread complaints of long waits for appointments and results, especially in Paris and other large cities.Only people showing symptoms or with a doctor’s prescription should seek tests, he said, to avoid a deluge of requests at labs already struggling to keep up.He said the health ministry had ordered five million antigen test kits, which can give preliminary readings on Covid-19 contagion in just 30 minutes, for delivery in early October.And regulatory approval for saliva tests is expected “imminently”, he said.France has reported nearly 10,000 new cases per day over the past week, prompting officials to urge people to limit social gatherings and maintain handwashing and other protective measures.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told a Senate panel Thursday that nearly 45,000 fines of 135 euros ($160) each had been issued for not wearing a face mask since the nationwide virus lockdown was lifted in mid-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-tightening-curbs-in-several-cities-to-curtail-surge-in-covid-cases/story-G6R1GQmHNVNgk2zYSpY8kM.html
18-09-2020||World||Twitter places warning label on Trump’s tweet about voting by mail||Twitter Inc on Thursday placed a warning label on a tweet by US President Donald Trump, saying his post included potentially misleading information about the mail-in voting process.“Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to “voters”, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want. Another election disaster yesterday. Stop Ballot Madness!,” Trump tweeted.The president has in recent months assailed the voting process without evidence, saying it could result in widespread fraud, although millions of Americans, including much of the military, have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without such problems.Also read: Former model accuses Donald Trump of sexual assaultThe process is seen as a way to limit exposure to the coronavirus, though the system to do so will vary from state to state. Twitter’s warning label redirected users to a curated page, “Voting by mail is legal and safe, experts and data confirm”, which contained more information on mail-in voting.The social network has previously attached labels to tweets posted and shared by the president, including adding fact-checking notices on his tweets.Twitter had faced fierce scrutiny from the Trump administration in May, when for the first time it prompted readers to check the facts in Trump’s tweets about unsubstantiated claims of mail-in voting fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-places-warning-label-on-trump-s-tweet-about-voting-by-mail/story-iY3uhnWMnvJ2wEb8PZ7jYM.html
18-09-2020||World||Fall in Heathrow airport traffic due to Covid-19 crisis may create ‘ghost towns’||West London suburbs such as Southall, Hounslow, Slough and Hillingdon with large population of Indian origin people face the prospect of becoming ‘ghost towns’ due to the coronavirus pandemic severely impacting the Heathrow airport and the aviation industry, MPs and industry leaders say.Senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma (Ealing Southall) agreed on Thursday with Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye that areas around the airport risk the fate of mining towns in north England that saw much poverty and deprivation when the coal industry was largely shut down by the Margaret Thatcher government amidst strikes in the 1980s.He said: “Areas around Heathrow will become ghost towns if no urgent measures are taken. Tens of thousands of people, many of Indian and Asian origin who have worked in Heathrow-linked roles directly or indirectly for at least three generations, have lost jobs”.“This is not scare-mongering. This government does not have a seriously thought-out plan to deal with the crisis not only in Heathrow but also other airports such as Gatwick. I and over 25 MPs wrote to chancellor Rishi Sunak about this in July,” he added.Sharma said he was already seeing the impact of Heathrow-linked job losses in his constituency. In Hounslow alone, the council estimates that at least 11,000 residents are employed at Heathrow, while up to 27,000 jobs in the borough are said to be linked to the airport.According to Holland-Kaye, the collapse of air traffic has put at risk tens of thousands of jobs. He wants the Boris Johnson government to allow testing at airports so that traffic could begin to return to 2019 levels and enable the crippled aviation industry to slowly recover.Heathrow estimates that it has suffered a loss of £1.1 billion in the first half of 2020 due to the pandemic.The Hounslow council said: “Independent research carried out by Oxford Economics forecasts the borough will be the second hardest hit in London, with a possible 40 per cent decline in output and thousands of jobs likely to be lost”. “A major factor is its proximity to Heathrow Airport and strong links to the aviation industry”, it added.Tens of thousands of people living in neighbouring boroughs are employed in four types of economic activity supported by HeathrowDirect on-airport: Located at Heathrow and includes roles such as management of airport, pilots, air traffic control, retail, catering, cleaning, securityDirect off-airport: Located mainly in close proximity to Heathrow, these jobs are reliant on the airport and include hotels, distribution and logistics activitiesIndirect and induced: Activity generated through supply chain spending and consumer spending.Catalytic: Companies are located in Heathrow because of the presence of the airport, typically to access international markets that the hub airport services.Economic forecasting and analysis organisation Oxford Economics said in a recent report titled ‘The economic impact of reduced activity at Heathrow’ that the airport is a key source of employment for people in neighbouring boroughs.It said: “The airport supports employment through four main channels of activity. However, the dramatic fall in passenger numbers and cargo at the airport threatens the security of many of the direct jobs located at Heathrow and surrounding it, as well as those in supply chains and subsequently those supported through the spending of wages”. “It could also impact on businesses that have located around the airport because of the international destinations it serves”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fall-in-heathrow-airport-traffic-due-to-covid-19-crisis-may-create-ghost-towns/story-jnt4gFbmeC93iEi4yayQgK.html

18-09-2020||India||‘Not a criminal act to distribute Quran copies’: CPI(M) defends minister||Facing political heat in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling racket, CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, in a write-up in the party mouthpiece ‘Desabhimani’, said the ongoing agitation seeking resignation of Kerala minister KT Jaleel was essentially against the holy books. He further said that opposition Congress and Muslim League fell easily in the trap set by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the article, he defended higher education minister Jaleel, who was questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Enforcement Directorate, in connection with import of Quran and his alleged liaison with main accused, Swapna Suresh, in the gold smuggling case. “It is not a criminal act to distribute a few copies of the holy book as requested by the UAE consulate in the state capital. The minister is in charge of the Waqf Board also. The Muslim League is adding fuel to the fire ignited by the Sangh Parivar,” he said.The party, he said, will support Jaleel and there is no need for him to resign.“The NIA has summoned the minister only as a witness. But the League and BJP are in a hurry to dub him as a smuggler. This will not succeed and the party will back him to the hilt,” Balakrishnan said, adding a section of the media is also playing a “dirty game to discredit the government which is doing a good job in containing the pandemic and rolling out people-friendly welfare measures.”The Muslim League and BJP have criticised the ruling party for playing a “blatant communal card.” “The issue is gold smuggling, not Quran. The party is resorting to a dirty game to get out of it,” said League leader PK Kunhalikutty. “The party is dragging the holy book to justify its criminal acts but believers will see through its game plan,” said BJP state president K Surendran.Meanwhile the customs said it will question the minister soon in connection with distribution of religious texts imported from the United Arab Emirates. It said it will register a case under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Since the minister had held a press conference and admitted that he took copies of the holy book from the consulate has made the task easy for the customs, a senior official said, adding the offence attracts a minimum jail term of five years. During the 30-kg gold smuggling investigation, the customs also found that a heavy consignment, weighing more than 4,000 kg, had arrived in 31 bags on March 4 and was taken to Malappuram. The minister claimed that the packets contained only religious books that he took to his constituency for distribution. But the opposition alleged that some consignments also carried gold and Jaleel was using holy books to cover up his illegal acts. A multi-agency probe led by the NIA is probing the case. The ED had submitted a statement in a court in Kochi two days ago saying Bengaluru drug haul and gold smuggling cases were closely linked. Key accused in the drug case Anoop Mohammad had taken the name of Bineesh Kodiyeri during grilling and claimed he was his “business partner.” Kodiyeri was grilled by the ED and the Narcotics Control Bureau is set to question him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-criminal-act-to-distribute-quran-copies-cpi-m-defends-minister/story-iVvJNQcaDkS18i3nHtuyDK.html

18-09-2020||India||India allows export of onions lying in transit to all countries including Bangladesh||Indian authorities on Friday allowed the movement of onion supplies already contracted for by Bangladeshi importers after Dhaka formally complained about the impact of New Delhi’s ban on exports of the commodity. Scores of trucks carrying onions destined for Bangladesh had been stopped at border crossings in West Bengal after the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) banned all exports of the item on Monday following a shortage and sudden increase in prices in the domestic market. As prices spiked in Bangladesh after the ban, the foreign ministry in Dhaka formally complained to the Indian high commission through a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence on Tuesday, people familiar with developments said. The matter was also raised by the Bangladeshi mission in New Delhi, the people said on condition of anonymity. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, who made a previously unannounced visit to Bangladesh on August 18 to put bilateral ties back on track after they were hit by a string of irritants, took personal interest in the issue and was involved in efforts to find a solution, the people said. This had also been the first visit abroad amid the Covid-9 pandemic by Shringla, who was India’s envoy to Dhaka during 2016-19. Following a meeting on Friday between officials of the commerce and external affairs ministries, the DGFT gave the go ahead for export of eligible consignments of onions “with the approval of competent authority”, the people said. “The shipment of all onion supplies that were contracted for by Bangladeshi importers before the ban came into effect will be allowed,” one of the people cited above said, adding the decision was due to the special relations with Bangladesh. However, a decision is yet to be made on whether to allow more onion exports in future. This is the second time in less than a year that an Indian ban on onion exports has had an impact on Bangladesh and triggered a formal reaction from Dhaka. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina formally raised the earlier ban during a visit to New Delhi last October and had jokingly told a public gathering that she had asked her cook to prepare her food without onions. She had also said the Indian side should give advance notice of such bans. The note verbale from Bangladesh’s foreign ministry expressed “deep concern” at the Indian ban as it “directly impacts the supply of essential food items in the Bangladesh market”. It noted that at a meeting of the commerce secretaries of the two sides during January 15-16, the “Bangladesh side requested the Indian side to consider not imposing export restriction on essential food items required by Bangladesh, and in case of any event necessitating such a restriction, it was requested that Bangladesh side be informed ahead of time”. The latest ban, the note verbale said, “undermines the discussions that took place in 2019 and 2020 between the two friendly countries on the matter and understanding shared”. Bangladesh called on India to resume onion exports in view of the “excellent ties of friendship and understanding enjoyed by the two countries”. The Bangladeshi side is concerned as the sudden ban triggered panic buying by the public and hoarding by unscrupulous traders, who bought available onion stocks and then artificially drove up prices, the people said. They pointed out the matter had caused embarrassment for the Sheikh Hasina government, with its opponents raising questions about the benefits derived from better ties with India. Bangladesh is largely able to meet its annual requirement of about 2.5 million tonnes of onions from domestic production but imports from India make up almost 90% of the shortfall. As it did last year, Bangladesh may turn to Turkey and Egypt to make up for the deficit in supplies. Foreign policy commentator Maya Mirchandani, who closely tracks the neighbourhood, said there could be domestic compulsions such as a shortage for the ban on onion exports but such moves need to done in a more calibrated manner. “While restricting exports, we should at least meet existing export commitments and then take care of future exports on a need-based approach. If we pride ourselves on a neighbourhood first policy, we should ensure there are no ruffled feathers with crucial neighbours such as Bangladesh,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allows-export-of-onions-lying-in-transit-to-all-countries-including-bangladesh/story-USLa7mttDoQoDpvH0vTbjM.html
18-09-2020||India||China Study Group reviews LAC situation ahead of military level talks||The government on Friday carried out a comprehensive review of the overall situation in eastern Ladakh including India’s operational preparedness in view of the continued belligerence by the Chinese army and its fresh attempts to “intimidate” Indian troops in the region, government sources said. At a nearly 90-minute meeting of the high-power China Study Group, defence minister Rajnath Singh, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs also looked at further enhancing the vigil along the nearly 3,500-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC), including in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim sectors, they said. Army Chief Gen. M M Naravane briefed the meeting about the fresh face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops at both the north and south bank of the Pangong lake and elaborated on steps taken to effectively deal with such attempts, the sources said. “The meeting of the China Study Group reviewed all aspects of the situation,” said a source. The meeting also deliberated on arrangements being made to maintain the current level of troops and weapons in all forward areas in eastern Ladakh and other sensitive high-altitude sectors in the harsh winter months when the temperature drops up to minus 25 degree Celsius. The sources said the meeting also briefly touched upon the main talking points to be raised by the Indian side at the next Corps commander-level talks which is expected to focus on the implementation of an agreement reached between foreign ministers of India and China at a meeting in Moscow on September 10. “We will insist on early and complete disengagement of Chinese troops from all friction points. That is the first step for restoration of peace and tranquillity along the border,” said a source. The sources said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army(PLA) is yet to respond to the Indian Army’s communication to it on holding the next round of the Corps commander-level talks. “There is no date as of now as the Chinese military is yet to respond to it. The talks could take place sometime next week,” a source said. The two sides have so far held five rounds of talks at the level of Corps commanders. The sources said the situation remained tense at both the north and south bank of the Pangong lake area as well as at other friction points in eastern Ladakh. There have been at least three attempts by the PLA to “intimidate” Indian troops along the north and south bank of Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said China should take forward the process for complete disengagement of troops from all friction points including at the Pangong lake area, and asked it not to make unilateral attempts to change the status quo. He said both sides should focus on easing tensions in the friction areas by refraining from any actions that may lead to an escalation in the situation. The assertion by Srivastava came in the backdrop of remarks by Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday that it was for India to initiate the process to disengage and restore peace along the LAC. Both sides reached a five-point agreement to resolve the border standoff at a meeting between External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) meet in Moscow. The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC. The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30. India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions. China has been occupying the areas between Finger 4 and Finger 8. The mountain spurs in the area is called Fingers. China has strongly objected to India’s move. However, India has maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC. India has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following China’s transgression attempts. Following China’s fresh attempts to change the status quo in the southern bank of Pangong lake, India has further bolstered its military presence in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-carries-out-comprehensive-review-of-situation-in-eastern-ladakh/story-IiUpptpgCXyI8z5KlMdNUJ.html

Reports say over 1,000 died. When we ask questions on jobs, the government says it doesn’t have data. This is a ‘no data govt’”The fifth day of the monsoon session saw huge ruckus as debate continued over the effects of lockdown, economic impact of Covid-19 on migrant workers, salaried professionals and job losses due to the pandemic’s economic impact. Earlier on Monday, the first day of this monsoon session, the labour ministry in response to a question on how the lockdown affected migrant workers said that it does not have any data regarding the number of deaths among the migrant workers as they tried to reach their native places at the onset of the lockdown. “In order to mitigate the financial crisis of the migrant workers and protect them against the economic disruptions due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown, the Central Government has taken numerous measures to provide them financial assistance, food packages ration and other benefits,” the labour ministry said.Chowdhury further continued his attack on the Centre when he raised the issue of job losses. He said, “More than 2 crores salaried employees have lost their job. 14 lakh workers have no work now. How can we expect growth in such a scenario.”DMK MP and former union minister Dayanidhi Maran also urged the government to take into consideration suggestions from opposition leaders and industry representatives regarding the economic recovery post Covid-19. Maran urged the finance minister to release information about the current economic crisis. He said, “I urge the government and especially the Finance Minister to release a white paper on existing economic crisis & to adopt a consultative approach with the opposition parties, state govts & industry representatives to boost confidence in the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-data-govt-congress-adhir-dmk-s-maran-ask-centre-to-address-economic-woes/story-iqKZKUZA9DWd45gdimtBTL.html
18-09-2020||India||Onion prices fall in Bengal as exporters divert Bangladesh-bound trucks to local markets||With the Centre imposing a ban on the export of onions in the wake of a steep price rise across states, especially that of the Nasik variety, many exporters have started diverting trucks headed for the Bangladesh border to the wholesale markets of West Bengal. As a result, retail prices on Friday came down from Rs 40 to 35 in Kolkata and from Rs 35 to 28 in Siliguri, north Bengal’s biggest town. Uzzal Saha, general secretary, West Bengal Exporters’ Coordination Committee, said, “Hundreds of trucks, loaded with onions meant for Bangladesh, are stranded for five days at the state’s six land ports in Malda, North Dinajpur, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and North 24 Parganas districts. On an average a truck carries 25 metric tonnes of onion. The sacks lying at the bottom of the piles have started to rot. We fear that 10 per cent of the total consignment might be lost.” On September 14, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Union ministry of commerce and industry issued a notification, stopping export of onion to foreign countries. “On September 15 we wrote a letter to the DGFT, saying exporters are having difficulty executing the order since many consignments are sent against letters of credit issued by banks of the importing countries. It is difficult to divert these consignments to local markets as that would be breach of commitment,” said Saha. “We have requested the government to at least allow those trucks that reached the border before September 14 to leave the country,” said Saha. Rabindranath Koley, member of the West Bengal government’s task force on essential commodities, which is monitoring the price rise, said, “Consignments not issued against a letter of credit are being diverted to local wholesale markets by the exporters. This has brought down the prices. I went to a Kolkata market today and bought onions for Rs 35 a kilo. The price was Rs 40 earlier this week.” “Wholesale price used to be Rs 1200 a sack. That has come down to Rs 1100,” added Koley. In Siliguri, the town’s regulated market is the biggest in the region. Ram Avtar Prasad, an onion wholesaler, said, “Retail prices ranged between Rs 33 and 35 a week ago. Now it is varying between Rs 28 and 30.” “This has happened because after the ban on export was announced, several exports in Nasik, Indore and other big markets diverted their truck that had already reached Bengal to the local markets,” added Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-prices-fall-in-bengal-as-exporters-divert-bangladesh-bound-trucks-to-local-markets/story-gSedr0zZcmh9LFRWQqd56I.html

In a letter to the chief secretaries of all the states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that it has come to the notice of the ministry that some states are trying to curb inter-state movement of oxygen supplies from manufacturing units situated in their respective areas by exercising provisions of The Epidemic Disease Act, The Disaster Management Act, The Essential Commodities Act or any state/Union Territory specific Essential Services Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He added that some states are also mandating the manufacturers/suppliers located in the state to restrict their oxygen supplies to the hospitals of the state, he said. “As you are aware, availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid- 19. With increasing number of active cases, the consumption of oxygen is also expected to increase,” Bhalla said in his letter, adding – “It is emphasised that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in the supply of medical oxygen in the country may critically impact the management of patients suffering from Covid-19 in other parts of the country.” The home secretary said that states/UTs should make sure there are “no such restrictions imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between states and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state movement of oxygen carrying vehicles”. “No restrictions shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to the hospitals of the state in which they are located and there shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into the cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without restriction,” the letter added. The MHA also asked the state governments that they may constitute multi-disciplinary teams, comprising representatives of the health, industry, transport and other related departments, to continuously monitor the availability of medical oxygen in their respective jurisdictions. “Any shortfalls or related problems that are encountered in this regard, should be immediately brought to the notice of the Central Control Room that has been established in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW),” he said. The home secretary also referred to the Unlock-4 guidelines where it was clearly mentioned that the lockdown is limited to the Covid-19 containment zones and all activities are permitted outside the containment zone except a few prohibited activities. “Further, there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-supply-of-oxygen-is-not-restricted-home-ministry-to-states/story-GBIxkffdYwQZtSAtfHMHJL.html
18-09-2020||India||Why western UP farmers are silent on Centre’s new farm bills||Western Uttar Pradesh, from where several farm protests originated, is relatively silent on the three controversial farm bills that have angered farmers in Punjab and Haryana.The reason farm leaders gave was that unlike Punjab and Haryana, the network of fruit and vegetable markets is not so strong in western Uttar Pradesh and impact of the farm reform laws would be much less in a primarily sugarcane growing region of the country.“Most of the crops in western UP are bought by mills and therefore, the role of markets is limited. Therefore, farmers here, unlike Punjab and Haryana, are much affected by the changes being made in the farm laws,” said Naresh Takait, vice-president of Bharatiya Kisan Union.The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Acts regulates the fruit and vegetable markets in the country.Most farmers here grow sugarcane, the region’s cash crop. Paddy and wheat is also grown in some areas. “Entire sugarcane crop is sold directly to the mills. The cane prices are controlled by the government. Paddy is also bought mostly by the private players,” he said.Another BKU leader, Rakesh Takait, said, “The farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture laws is largely confined to Punjab and Haryana so far. This is because commission agents and markets have a strong network in the two states and they feel abolition of the market system will affect them the most,” he said.Farmers in Haryana and Punjab are up in arms against the three ordinances promulgated by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on June 5 to reform the agriculture sector. On Thursday, Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur, minister of food processing industries, resigned from the Union cabinet in support of agitating farmers.The BKU, which is heading the protest in Punjab, is not against the laws but wants certain amendments to secure farmers’ interests.“First, there should be a provision binding private traders not to buy farmers’ produce below the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. Second, a maximum storage limit of food grains by traders must be fixed and third the mandi tax should be abolished for farmers,” Rakesh said, adding that farmers were earlier also allowed to sell produce outside mandis.To express solidarity with farmers in Punjab and Haryana, farmers would soon hit roads.“But we are starting the agitation in UP as well with protests at all the district headquarters in the state on September 23,” Rakesh said. The opposition parties are also opposing the law.The Samajwadi Party (SP), the principal opposition party in the state, has not made up its mind on protests on the issue.“We have been opposed to the ordinances since day one because these laws, we feel, are anti-farmer and pro-corporate,” SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said. When asked if the party had any plan for protests, he said, “Our leader Akhilesh Yadav will take a call on the issue of agitation.”RLD general secretary Anil Dubey said the bills were anti-farmer and demanded the government withdraw them, though he said there was no plan as of now for statewide protests.“The party has organised some demonstrations in western UP,” he said.“Experts had been advocating agriculture market reforms for years together and the new agriculture laws in this regard are a welcome step. Their positive impact will be visible after two years or so,” said AK Singh, an economist and former director of Giri Institute of Developmental Studies.Ordinances challengedThe Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court, in the meantime, has issued a notice to the Centre and the UP government asking them to file an affidavit to a writ petition filed challenging the Constitutional validity of “The Farmers’ Produce and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020”.The two-member bench comprising Justice Pankaj Kumar Jaiswal and Justice Dinesh Kumar, in an order passed on August 26, gave six weeks’ time to file the affidavit.In their writ, filed through counsel Madhav Chaturvedi, petitioners Ashok Kumar and Satyanarayan Tripathi, both residents of Etawah, pleaded that the said ordinance was unconstitutional and hence urged the court to quash the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-western-up-farmers-are-silent-on-centre-s-new-farm-bills/story-c7eczjL9TIsRze0uldm3vO.html

The minister said the decision to disband the board was taken based after a thorough review of its functioning.“The assessment revealed that weavers from across the Nation did not benefit from the Board which barely met, and did not take weavers across all states into confidence. There was no contribution from the Board as regards policy formulation and its implementation,” Irani said in a written reply.“On the other hand, the Weavers’ Service Centres and the State Handloom departments have been working well in good coordination through interactions on policy, implementation of Government schemes, educating weavers about online marketing platforms including efforts to onboard weavers on Government e-marketplace (GeM), and addressing the problems of handloom weavers through Chaupals,” she added.The Textile Ministry decided to scrap the All India Handloom Board with effect from July 27 and the Handicrafts Board on August 3 to “ensure a leaner government machinery”, sparking controversy after the Central government ran a massive social media campaign celebrating National Handloom Day on August 7. Craft activist and one of the founders of Dastkar, a society for craftspeople, Laila Tyabji took to Facebook to talk about the board, which gave a chance to artisans to directly engage with government policy. “All these years on, it remained the one official forum, however watered down, where the voices and views of weavers and craftspeople could be expressed directly. One place where representatives of the sector were present in considerable numbers, and were actually empowered to advise the government in policy and sectoral spending,” Tyabji said. According to a gazette notification issued by the ministry and accessed by Hindustan Times, the Boards were scrapped ‘in consonance with the Government of India vision of ‘Minimum Government and Maximum Governance’. “A leaner Government Machinery and the need for systematic rationalization of Government bodies, the Government of India has abolished All India Handloom Board with effect from the date of issue of this resolution,” states the notification. Officials in the ministry said that this was just the first step in a massive churn-taking place to reduce the expenditure of the ministry and get rid of redundant boards and organizational units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-rarely-met-smriti-irani-on-centre-scrapping-handloom-board/story-i201XSsTAPbMQfikn65XMJ.html
18-09-2020||India||Jagan Reddy govt hikes petrol, diesel prices by Re 1 per litre||The YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government on Friday announced an increase in the prices of petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre in the name of road cess, a move aimed at shoring up the state’s finances hit by the Covid pandemic.An ordinance seeking to amend the APVAT Act, 2005, was promulgated by state governor Biswabhushan Harichandan in the evening, providing for levy and collection of a road development cess of one rupee per litre on petrol and diesel.According to special chief secretary (revenue) Rajat Bhargava, the economic activity has come to a halt in the state ever since lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic, affecting the revenues of the State during the months of April, May, June and July. In April, the revenue realised in the state was only Rs 1,323 crore as against Rs 4,480 crore in April 2019 which accounts for only 29.5% of the total expected revenue. Similar trends were observed for the months of May, June, July and August also, he said.Besides the fall in revenues, the Government of India has also not released the GST compensation for the year 2020-21 so far. While the stress on revenues from all sources continued, there is steep increase in the expenditure relating to the health services for combating Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the government is also implementing several schemes for the welfare of people from downtrodden sections. “The twin impact of fall in revenues and enhanced expenditure on health services and welfare schemes has impacted the capital expenditure on infrastructure development,” Bhargava said.Taking all the factors into consideration and keeping in view the necessity of allocating dedicated funds to the road development in the state, the state government has decided to levy “Road Development Cess” of Re 1 per litre on petrol and diesel in addition to the existing levies on the two products in public interest, the official said.“The proceeds of the Road Development Cess which will be around Rs 500 crore per annum shall be transferred to the Andhra Pradesh Road Development Corporation for exclusive use in developing road infrastructure,” he added.Last week, the Jagan government increased the VAT on natural gas from 14.5 per cent to 24.5 per cent. Earlier in July, it increased the cess on petrol from Rs 2.76 to Rs 4 (an increase of Rs 1.24 per litre), apart from VAT of 31% and on diesel from Rs 3.07 to Rs 4 (an increase of 93 paisa per litre), apart from a VAT pf 22.25%, stating that the state’s own revenues had dried up due to Covid-19 pandemic situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-govt-hikes-petrol-diesel-prices-by-re-1-per-litre/story-mGtUU7Ij7263ZaEDKjsrOM.html
18-09-2020||India||Top govt panel reviews Ladakh situation, preps for 6th round of military talks||A high-powered government panel on China on Friday reviewed the latest developments in the eastern Ladakh theatre, with focus on charting out the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), officials familiar with the developments said. The officials said the agenda for the next of round military talks between Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers - expected to take place shortly - was discussed at the high-level meeting attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane and other top officials. The meeting took place a day after Singh told Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling borders, signalling a resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC. While the date is yet to be finalised, the corps commander-ranked officers could meet in the next few days to take the military talks forward, the officials said. The situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent maneuvers by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area. Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. The upcoming meeting will be their first meeting after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. “The recent developments have increased India’s bargaining power as there will definitely be an element of quid pro quo in the talks,” the officials said. In tensions that began in mid-May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the de-facto border, known as the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang in Ladakh, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching areas they could previously patrol. “No force in the world can stop Indian jawans from patrolling. If our soldiers have made sacrifices, it is for this reason that they have laid down their lives,” Singh told Rajya Sabha on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-govt-panel-reviews-ladakh-situation-preps-for-6th-round-of-military-talks/story-sf4sAFsJHdZJ98k3maNROK.html

18-09-2020||India||India, Japan looking at working together in Bangladesh and Myanmar: Jaishankar||India and Japan are looking at the possibility of cooperating on projects in Bangladesh and Myanmar as part of their efforts to work together in third countries, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. The India-Japan Act East Forum, which focuses on specific projects to modernise India’s northeastern region, also has a larger significance for connectivity with Bangladesh and Myanmar, Jaishankar said during a virtual event to mark the release of a report on the theme “India-Japan: Time to seize the opportunities”. The recent signing of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), which covers the reciprocal provision of supplies and services by the defence forces of India and Japan, will enhance stability and security across Asia, he said. The minister’s remarks assume significance against the backdrop of efforts by several countries, including India, Australia and Japan, to forge new partnerships with countries across the Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s growing aggressive and assertive activities. India and Japan, Jaishankar noted, had moved from discussions to practically working together in third countries. “We’ve done a little bit of that in Sri Lanka and I think we’re today trying to see whether we can cooperate and coordinate more closely in Bangladesh and Myanmar,” he said. While noting that India and Japan were already working closely within the framework of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia Summit and the Quadrilateral dialogue, he suggested that they could also cooperate in Russia’s Far East and the Pacific Island countries. Jaishankar described ACSA, which was signed last week, as “a very practical manifestation of our ability and intent of working together”. He added, “I’m very confident that it would both be a big plus for the evolution of the Indo-Pacific vision of both countries [and add] to the stability and security of Asia.” Both countries are trying to shape the Indo-Pacific narrative to reflect the rebalancing of the world and Asia and bilateral defence and security cooperation has “progressed remarkably fast”, he remarked, adding that Japan is the only country with which India has both an annual summit and a 2+2 dialogue between the defence and foreign ministers. The Covid-19 pandemic has expanded national security to include health security along with economic and supply chain security, as well as the concept of strategic autonomy in terms of supply chains, and this could be a new area of cooperation with Japan, he suggested. While replying to a question at the event organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Jaishankar said, without naming China, that it is important for all players to work together to ensure Asia’s rise. “If we are to give to Asia a more prominent place in world politics, then it’s important for all the nations of Asia, especially the large and important nations,...to get along together because if they spend their energies not in a positive manner but kind of contesting each other, they’re not going to advance the interests of Asia,” he said. Toshihide Ando, the deputy chief of the Japanese mission, told the event that Japan is a steadfast partner for both the “Make in India” and “Make for the world” initiatives. He added, “India will become stronger by playing a pivotal role in global supply chains through enhanced trade and investment.” Japanese businesses are keen to play a bigger role in India’s new quest to be the hub of global supply chains, and the number of Japanese firms operating in India increased to 1,454 last year, he noted. However, Ando also listed challenges faced by Japanese businesses in India, including complicated legal and tax systems, late payments, difficult labour issues, inadequate infrastructure, and problems linked to enforcement of contracts. “In an increasingly uncertain world, Japan and India can bring about an assurance of peace, stability and prosperity by working with other like-minded countries,” Ando said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-looking-at-working-together-in-bangladesh-and-myanmar-jaishankar/story-oMBX03xb696RNvZDtsoXiP.html

The federal agency recovered 5.5 kg gold worth Rs 2.75 crore from the car that the smugglers were travelling in and later 200 kg of unaccounted silver from the premises of a Jodhpur-based financier. In a statement issued on Friday evening, DRI said that “acting on specific intelligence, the officers of DRI Jodhpur intercepted a vehicle at Kharia Meethapur on the Jaipur-Jodhpur highway (near Balari), suspected to be carrying smuggled gold of foreign origin, in the early hours of September 18”. On being apprehended by the DRI team, one of the three occupants of the intercepted Innova SUV, opened fire without any provocation in which one of the team members was critically injured and had to be rushed to the hospital, the agency said. “The rummaging of the intercepted vehicle led to the recovery of about 5.5 kgs of smuggled foreign-origin gold having market value of approximately Rs 2.75 crore. The smuggled gold was found concealed in a specially made cavity under the passengers’ seats and was being transported from Jaipur to Jodhpur,” the DRI said. The agency added that “In the follow up search at the residence of the Jodhpur-based key financer of the smuggled gold, around 200 kg of unaccounted for silver bars were also recovered”. The agency refused to share further details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dri-official-critically-hurt-after-he-was-shot-by-gold-smugglers-5-5-kg-of-gold-seized/story-g05O5ghNIT71yefCfJE73K.html

This was the second time the airline flew an infected passenger.The DCAA had sent a notice to Air India Express. The notice stated that the flight IX1135 operated by the airline from Jaipur to Dubai International Airport (DIA), had a passenger on board, who had contracted SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19.“You are aware of our previous intimation made to you by our letter dated September 2 for boarding a passenger with a Covid-19 positive test result, who endangered the other passengers on board and also caused a serious health risk.Boarding a passenger with Covid-19 positive test result for the second time is contrary to and is in violation of the laid-down procedures and protocols relating to air travel to and from airports in the Emirate of Dubai during the pandemic,” stated the notice.The notice had led to the temporary suspension of all Air India Express flights to Dubai for the next 15 days.Airline officials said that the ground handling agencies concerned have taken appropriate punitive action against their employees who have been held accountable for the lapse at Delhi and Jaipur.An airline official said, “Prior to the receipt of the notice, the airline submitted a letter to the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority expressing our apologies and detailing the various actions taken by us in association with the ground handling agents concerned to guard against such a lapse in the future.

18-09-2020||India||ED attaches three hotels worth Rs 100 crore in PMC Bank fraud||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached three hotels in Delhi worth Rs 100 crore in connection with its money laundering probe in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) bank fraud, officials familiar with the development said. The agency has so far attached unmortgaged properties worth around Rs 360 crore in the scam belonging to the promoters of HDIL - Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, officials said. The PMC Bank scam, which came to light last year, is a unique case when it comes to money laundering investigations as the ED has for the first time not touched properties which are free of any encumbrance or are mortgaged with the bank. This was done in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, which had taken control of PMC Bank in September last year over concerns expressed by thousands of depositors. ED had given a no-objection certificate (NOC) in November 2019 for the bank to recover the money from HDIL’s mortgaged properties, said an officer cited above. Among the assets attached on Friday include - Hotel Conclave Boutique at A-20, Kailash Colony; Hotel Conclave Comfort at D-150, East of Kailash and Hotel Conclave Executive at C-22, Kalkaji, which are allegedly owned by Libra Realtors Pvt Ltd, M/s Deewan Realtors Pvt Ltd, Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Romy Mehra, and M/s Libra Hotels Pvt Ltd and its Directors; companies linked to HDIL, according to the second ED officer. The second officer said that three hotels are now known as Fab Hotels.The anti-money laundering probe agency also said in a statement on Friday that “investigation revealed that proceeds of crime totaling Rs 247 crore were obtained fraudulently by M/s Libra Realtors Pvt Ltd, M/s Deewan Realtors Pvt from PMC Bank in the guise of loans. These loans are part of the Rs 6117 crore owed by HDIL group of Companies to PMC Bank”. The ED had initiated a probe under prevention of money laundering act (PMLA) in the case in October last year against Housing Development Infrastructures Ltd (HDIL), its promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Sarang Wadhawan, bank’s chairman Waryam Singh and then Managing Director Joy Thomas and others on the basis of a FIR by Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai Police. The ED has found that Wadhawans have laundered more than Rs 2500 crore out of a total around Rs 6600 crore that the company - HDIL - had taken from PMC Bank between 2007 and 2013.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph told senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the Zakat Foundation, that the affidavit of Sudarshan TV has allegations of foreign funding against his client. Hegde said his client is a charitable organization and has been supporting non-Muslims as well and this kind of social service is not known even in government circles. The bench told Hegde that some Foreign Contribution Regulations Act (FCRA) records with regard to foreign funding have been filed by the TV channel and it is upon his client to intervene in the matter or not. Hegde said Zakat foundation does not conduct any residential programmes and only pays the fees of the IAS coaching classes. The top court was hearing a plea which has raised a grievance over Sudarshan TVs ‘Bindas Bol’ programme with the channel promo claiming it would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’. In its affidavit filed by Sudarshan TV through its Editor in-Chief, the channel has said: “The Answering Respondent (Suresh Chavhanke) has used the words “UPSC Jehad” because it has come to the knowledge... through various sources that Zakat Foundation has received funds from various terror-linked organizations.   “It is not that all contributors to the Zakat Foundation are terror-linked. However, some of the contributors are linked to organizations or are organizations that fund extremist groups. The funds received by the Zakat Foundation, in turn, are used to support aspirants for IAS, IPS or UPSC,” it had said. The affidavit had further said when it comes to light through various sources that funds contributed by tainted organizations are being used to facilitate people joining UPSC, there is a serious issue requiring public debate, discussion and scrutiny... “There is no statement or message in the four episodes broadcast that members of a particular community should not join UPSC. UPSC is an open competitive examination and members of every community may participate in the entrance examination and qualify..,” the journalist said in his 91-page affidavit. In the response to the plea filed by lawyer Firoz Iqbal Khan, seeking banning of the programmes, the channel said the thrust of its episodes was that there appeared to be a conspiracy which needed “to be investigated by NIA or CBI” as the “terror linked organizations” were apparently funding the Foundation in India, which in turn has been supporting Muslim UPSC aspirants. Earlier, in the day, the channel, which is facing legal proceedings in the top court, has moved an application seeking live telecast of hearing of the plea.   It had on September 15, restrained the channel from telecasting the episodes of ‘Bindas Bol’ till further orders saying that “the intent” of the episodes “prima facie” appeared to “vilify” the Muslim community. The application filed by Sudarshan News through its Director and editor Suresh Chavhanke said, “It is respectfully submitted that present case is one of the most important cases concerning the public at large as the question of freedom of press protected by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India is involved.”   It said that lakhs and crores of viewers of the channel wants to know about the legal proceedings conducted before this Court and they want to hear the points of arguments being raised by the parties. “Direct for Live of the Proceedings of this case through audio-visual broadcasting/telecasting universally by an official agency as the court may deem fit and proper,” the application said. The hearing in the matter is going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-zakat-if-it-will-intervene-in-sudarshan-tv-case-as-channel-alleges-terror-linked-funding/story-GcwwSf1ntQun0oXvdhFbNP.html

18-09-2020||India||Kept pleading with govt not to go ahead with farm bills: Harsimrat Kaur Badal||Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader who stepped down as the Union food processing minister on Thursday night, said on Friday that she kept pleading with the government not to go ahead with farm bills until all apprehensions and fears of farmers are cleared.“I kept on protesting ever since these ordinances were circulated for comments in the Cabinet. I was acting like a bridge between farmers and the government to clear all doubts and fears of farmers. I kept on pleading that the government should not bring these bills until all apprehensions and fears of farmers are cleared,” Badal told PTI in an interview.She said she feels saddened that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations. “I left my mother in ICU in the hospital to fulfill my duty to attend Parliament debate on these three legislations and register my protest. Thereafter, I resigned in protest against these proposed legislations,” Badal said.She said there is no point in bringing these bills while presenting them as being in the interest of farmers when the farmers themselves have apprehensions about these measures. “I feel very saddened about the fact that my voice was not heard in the Cabinet and the government did not send it to a parliamentary select committee for consultations with all stakeholders including farmers. If my voice had been heard, farmers would not have come out on roads to protest,” she added.Badal resigned soon after her husband and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal strongly opposed the bills in Lok Sabha on Thursday night, claiming these proposed legislations will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab, and announced that Harsimrat Kaur Badal will quit the government in protest against these three bills.Badal, who first became Union Minister for Food Processing in 2014 and retained the portfolio in the second term of the BJP-led NDA government starting 2019, said she kept on pleading with the government not to move ahead with these bills without taking farmers on board. SAD voted against the three bills -- Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, which were passed by voice vote in Lok Sabha. Congress and several other opposition parties are also opposing these bills, while SAD is the only NDA member to come out against these proposed legislations that seek to replace the ordinances already promulgated by the government.Emphasising that the government should not rush with these bills, Badal said it should be referred to a select committee of Parliament and all stakeholders should be consulted on these proposed legislations.On her resignation, Harsimrat said, “Please don’t see this as a resignation, as this was my duty as a representative of Punjab and of farmers.” On Punjab chief minister and Congress leader Amarinder Singh calling her resignation a ‘drama’, hitting back at him she said, “He himself is the biggest drama and the biggest liar.” “Amarinder Singh and Congress are doing double-speak. When these ordinances were planned, all chief ministers were consulted and he had concurred. Also, these three bills were part of the Congress party’s manifesto for the 2017 assembly elections manifesto and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” she added. Badal said Singh failed to fulfil all other promises made in the Congress party’s manifesto, barring this one and farmers in Punjab are now on roads and are paying the price for his misdeeds.Asked whether SAD would pull out of the NDA also, Badal said it was for the party to decide and a collective decision would be taken on that issue by all senior leaders together.Badal had also recalled this decades-old association between the two parties in her resignation letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. Describing her tenure as minister as ‘a remarkable and most memorable period of my life’, Badal said she was satisfied that the NDA-led government delivered on many critical and long-standing issues of the Sikh community, including justice for 1984 riots victims.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kept-pleading-with-govt-not-to-go-ahead-with-farm-bills-harsimrat-kaur-badal/story-q3Ukn1UgCxj40dKbNJOCTM.html

He appealed to the members to maintain the dignity of the house. “It is my responsibility to protect all the members, I would request Mr. Anurag Thakur to say a few words on the objections raised by the other members,” Birla said. Following the speaker’s appeal Thakur expressed regret over his remarks. WATCH l BJP’s Nehru-Gandhi jibe Vs Congress’ ‘Himachal ka chokra’ counter “I had no intent to hurt the sentiments of anybody. If anyone is hurt then I regret it,” Thakur said. The proceedings of the lower house were adjourned four times in a row since 4.00 pm over the uproar followed by Thakur’s remarks. During a discussion on the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill in the lower house, Thakur accused the Nehru-Gandhi family of cheating the public through creation of various funds under different names after Congress leaders, including Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari criticised the PM CARES fund.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, seeks to provide the same tax treatment to PM CARES Fund as available to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. “Nehru ji ordered the creation of the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund in 1948, like a royal order but its registration has not been done even till today. How did it get FCRA clearance?” Thakur said. From the high court to the Supreme Court, every court has validated the PM-CARES fund. Little children have contributed to it from their piggy banks. Nehru set up a fund that has not been registered till date. You (Congress) only made a trust for the benefit of the Gandhi family. You made Sonia Gandhi its chairman. It should be investigated,” he added. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also took a dig at the MoS calling him a “boy from Himachal”.“Who is this boy from Himachal”… “How did Nehru come into this debate? Did we take (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi’s name?” he lashed out.Irked by the remark, opposition members demanded an apology from the MoS.

18-09-2020||India||India exploring options to meet Bangladesh’s onion needs after formal protest from Dhaka||Indian authorities are exploring the option of allowing the movement of onion supplies already contracted for by Bangladeshi importers after Dhaka formally complained about the impact of New Delhi’s ban on exports of the commodity. Scores of trucks carrying onions destined for Bangladesh have been stopped at border crossings in West Bengal after the Directorate General of Foreign Trade banned all exports of the item on Monday following a shortage and sudden increase in prices in the domestic market. As prices spiked in Bangladesh after the ban, the foreign ministry in Dhaka formally complained to the Indian high commission through a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence on Tuesday, people familiar with developments said. The matter was also raised by the Bangladeshi mission in New Delhi, the people said on condition of anonymity. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, who made a previously unannounced visit to Bangladesh on August 18 to put bilateral ties back on track after they were hit by a string of irritants, has taken personal interest in the issue and is involved in efforts to find a solution, the people said. This had also been the first visit abroad amid the Covid-19 pandemic by Shringla, who was India’s envoy to Dhaka during 2016-19. “One option in the pipeline is allowing the shipment of all onion supplies that were contracted for by Bangladeshi importers before the ban came into effect. A solution is expected soon,” one of the people cited above said. This is the second time in less than a year that an Indian ban on onion exports has had an impact on Bangladesh and triggered a formal reaction from Dhaka. Bangladesh Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina formally raised the earlier ban during a visit to New Delhi last October and had jokingly told a public gathering that she had asked her cook to prepare her food without onions. She had also said the Indian side should give advance notice of such bans. The note verbale from Bangladesh’s foreign ministry expressed “deep concern” at the Indian ban as it “directly impacts the supply of essential food items in the Bangladesh market”. It noted that at a meeting of the commerce secretaries of the two sides during January 15-16, the “Bangladesh side requested the Indian side to consider not imposing export restriction on essential food items required by Bangladesh, and in case of any event necessitating such a restriction, it was requested that Bangladesh side be informed ahead of time”. The latest ban, the note verbale said, “undermines the discussions that took place in 2019 and 2020 between the two friendly countries on the matter and understanding shared”. Bangladesh called on India to resume onion exports in view of the “excellent ties of friendship and understanding enjoyed by the two countries”. The Bangladeshi side is concerned as the sudden ban triggered panic buying by the public and hoarding by unscrupulous traders, who bought available onion stocks and then artificially drove up prices, the people said. They pointed out the matter had caused embarrassment for the Sheikh Hasina government, with its opponents raising questions about the benefits derived from better ties with India. Bangladesh is largely able to meet its annual requirement of about 2.5 million tonnes of onions from domestic production but imports from India make up almost 90% of the shortfall. As it did last year, Bangladesh may turn to Turkey and Egypt to make up for the deficit in supplies. Foreign policy commentator Maya Mirchandani, who closely tracks the neighbourhood, said there could be domestic compulsions such as a shortage for the ban on onion exports but such moves need to done in a more calibrated manner. “While restricting exports, we should at least meet existing export commitments and then take care of future exports on a need-based approach. If we pride ourselves on a neighbourhood first policy, we should ensure there are no ruffled feathers with crucial neighbours such as Bangladesh,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-exploring-options-to-meet-bangladesh-s-onion-needs-after-formal-protest-from-dhaka/story-4gP9rokpXdkHrGgjQ8BWOM.html
18-09-2020||India||Telangana minister tweets state is fluorosis-free, cites Centre’s report||The Telangana government on Friday claimed that the state has become free of fluorosis, a bone-crippling disease, that has ruined thousands of lives over the decades due to contamination of water with high fluoride content.Quoting a report of the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, tabled by the central government in Parliament on Thursday, Telangana municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao tweeted that Telangana, along with Gujarat and Uttarakhand, had been declared a fluorosis-free state with zero affected areas.“No of Fluoride affected villages at the time of formation of #Telangana was 967. After the successful implementation of the Mission Bhagiratha, the number has come down to Zero. This is an excerpt from an official statement in parliament by Govt of India,” the minister tweeted.Mission Bhagiratha is a flagship programme introduced in the state in 2015, aimed at providing piped safe potable drinking water to every household. Special focus was laid on providing safe drinking water to villages where the fluoride content in the water was high.Nalgonda in Telangana was the worst-affected district due to the disease that affects bones and teeth.Over one lakh people are suffering due to fluorosis in villages such as Munugode, Nampally, Marriguda and Devarakonda that have high fluoride content in water.The Indian Natural Resource Economic and Management (INREM) Foundation, which conducted a survey in the fluoride-affected villages of Nalgonda, declared this February that there had been no new cases of fluorosis in the district in the last six years.INREM director Dr Rajnarayan Indu said the intensity of the disease had come down due to supply of safe drinking water under Mission Bhagiratha. He suggested that focus should be laid now on setting up Fluoride Rehabilitation Centre in all Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of all fluoride-affected blocks.However, Fluorosis Vimochana Samithi, an NGO working in Nalgonda’s affected areas, said the problem still persisted in several villages.“Successive governments have taken measures such as setting up of reverse osmosis and mineral water bottling plants in some villages and installation of defluoridation plants. But what about the groundwater? It still contains a high quantity of fluoride that enters the body through food,” Samithi convenor Kanchukatla Subhash said.He pointed out that one can still notice several people with crippled limbs, twisted joints, bent spine, stunted growth and yellowish or brownish enamel on their teeth. “We don’t want symptomatic treatment for a chronic disease. We want a permanent solution,” Subhash said.Congress MLA from Munugode assembly constituency Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy said the credit for Telangana fluorosis-free state would go to the Congress and not the TRS. “During the Congress regime itself, systems were established for supply of Krishna water to all the affected villages. What the TRS government had done was only to take the water to the houses through pipes. Even this project is not complete,” he said.The permanent solution, according to Subhash, is to complete the Srisailam Left Bank Canal project, which will lift water from Srisailam reservoir, which would provide irrigation to three lakh acres of agricultural lands and drinking water to 516 villages, including the fluoride-hit villages of Nalgonda district.“The project, which began in 2005, has come to a halt. There is no sign of the project being completed in the near future,” Subhash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-minister-tweets-state-is-fluorosis-free-cites-centre-s-report/story-ULEIYC14VGhXZukiSbefCK.html
18-09-2020||India||Intel agencies to probe new Turkish NGO outreach in Kashmir: Official||Indian intelligence agencies have started running security checks on Turkey-linked charities that have suddenly become active in Jammu and Kashmir over the last year after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered a strident speech at the United Nations General Assembly last year that mirrored Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s pitch on Kashmir, people familiar with the matter said.A national security planner said the intelligence probe also covers the role of individuals connected to the nonprofits with close links with Turkey and prepare a comprehensive report on their activities, overt and otherwise.A more intensive probe could be ordered later against identified groups and individuals that are believed to have crossed the red lines, he said. The second-level probe could include a hard look at the foreign funds received and its use.The move follows multiple reports from India’s intelligence community over the last few months that red flagged efforts to radicalise Indian Muslims in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country. Analysts had then pointed that Ankara’s attempt to expand its influence against the backdrop of President Erdogan’s pitch to challenge Saudi Arabia’s dominance in the Islamic world at a global level and offering a reshaped, conservative Turkey with Ottoman traditions as a model for Islamic nations to follow.The intel reports had also spotted a spike in the activities of Turkey-linked NGOs in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country, some of them linked to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party). The growth of their activities coincided with a change in the tenor and extent of reportage and analytical pieces on Kashmir in the Turkish media that reflect Pakistan’s viewpoint. Also, people having deep links with Kashmiri separatists are being used by Turkish national media to target India.An intelligence report recently submitted to the government has noted efforts by Turkey-linked NGOs to reach out to Kashmiris with assistance during Ramzan. Some others have been organising webinars and other events where topics such as the amended citizenship law, riots and hate crimes are discussed. An official said the narratives projected at these online interactions and on social media are provocative.“These are not discussions where different viewpoints are presented but are meant to reinforce fears around Islamophobia in India,” the official said.Islamophobia has been a recurring theme in Pakistan and Prime Minister Imran Khan’s offensive against the Indian government for about a year and had tried to weave a narrative around it in Gulf countries and other Islamic-majority countries.Erdogan was seen to be working on this narrative earlier this year when he lashed out at India for the Delhi riots. “India right now has become a country where massacres are widespread. What massacres? Massacres of Muslims. By who? Hindus,” Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara in February.India had then denounced his “irresponsible” statement that the external affairs ministry said was driven by his “political agenda”.“The comments are factually inaccurate and are driven by his political agenda.

They blamed the monsoon trough travelling from the Bay of Bengal towards the westerly direction instead of the usual north-westerly for this. The sultry conditions are likely to continue for another 10 to 13 days till the monsoon fully withdraws from the region without any rainfall, ushering pleasant autumn.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the rainfall deficit in northern India in September was up to 99%, highest for any region in the country. Southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana received up to 50% excess rain during the same period. Chitradurga district in Karnataka got 245% excess rainfall.Kinnaur in Himachal, known for its apples, received 88% less rainfall. Uttar Pradesh’s western parts were almost dry with districts like Bulandshahr and Mathura recording 100% rain deficiency. New Delhi recorded 76% less rainfall and was the driest district in the national capital. Southern Haryana districts such as Gurugram and Faridabad recorded close to 90% less rainfall.Also Read: Monsoon withdrawal delayed by one week according to IMD“Only one trough was formed in the Bay of Bengal during this period and that also travelled towards the westerly direction bringing in some rain in West Bengal, Odisha and north-east India. ...north and north-west Delhi remained dry,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.North and north-west India normally receives good monsoon rainfall due to oscillation of troughs getting their moisture feed from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. With very less formation of troughs, the region witnessed westerly dry winds. This added to the humid conditions in the region, said an IMD scientist, who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.The usually warmer weather with temperatures ranging from 32 degree Celsius in hills of Himachal and Uttarakhand to 39 degrees in Delhi, five to eight degrees above normal, has impacted horticulture.Also Read: Spike in severe cyclones, extremely heavy rain over India: Earth sciences ministry to RS“Because of the excessive heat, the colour of apple in my orchards turned almost yellow from red. No rain has resulted in leaf fall, turning the fruit, which looked good a month ago, into bad quality fruit. Nobody buys a small and pale red apple,” said Chander Mohan Justa, an orchardist in Shimla.Devendra Sharma, an agriculture expert, said the poor rainfall in the food bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh could have some impact on the summer-sown kharif crop output. “Though the sowing was good because of good early monsoon rains, the dry patch in August and September has dampened the farmers’ mood,” he said.The areas along the western coast from Maharashtra to Kerala received 90 to 100% excess rain whereas most of the north-eastern states received up to 50% of rain than normal, the IMD data showed. Sindudurg in Maharashtra and Chitradurg (Karnataka) received up to 300% of the normal rainfall between September 1 and 17, according to IMD.A recent Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur study found that by end of this century, southern India is likely to register the maximum increase in rainfall compared to the states in central and north India. “In the worst-case scenario, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India and by 18.5 mm per day in the Western Ghats in southern India,” said Rajib Maity, a professor at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study.In its weekly forecast, IMD has not projected any major rainfall activity in the remaining monsoon season. The monsoon is expected to fully withdraw from western India in the third week of September and from the rest of the country by mid-October. The temperatures are expected to be higher than normal for northern and central Indian plains.The anti-cyclone activity, a sign of monsoon withdrawal from western India, is now visible in central Pakistan. This means monsoon withdrawal from Rajasthan would start in a week.Despite less rainfall in September, Mritunjay Mohapatra, director-general of IMD on September 8 said the overall monsoon in India is expected to be 102% of the normal.“We are not expecting any improvement in rain deficiency over northwest India now because we are heading towards monsoon withdrawal,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune, agreeing that monsoon was literally over in northern India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-appears-to-retreat-over-north-india-south-and-east-receive-heavy-rainfall/story-YX9G6mZ1qfzCEUtCIlN9bN.html
18-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Various measures taken to ensure availability of essential drugs, says govt||The government has taken “timely and effective” measures to tackle any possible disruptions in supply of essential drugs during the Covid-19 pandemic and ensured their seamless availability across the country, Parliament was informed on Friday. “The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) has taken various measures to ensure the availability of essential drugs at reasonable prices during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers D V Sadananda Gowda said in reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha. Giving details of the measures taken by the government, Gowda said a ‘control room’ has been set up with a helpline number and “issues like non-availability of medicines, masks, gloves, hand sanitisers etc”, and price violation in the case of these essential items were resolved promptly. An inter-ministerial committee under the chairmanship of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) Joint Drug Controller S Eswara Reddy has been constituted to monitor trends of export and import of APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), formulations and medical devices to ensure their timely availability in the country and to prevent shortages, he added.  The committee submits its reports from time to time, Gowda said.   Availability of drugs has been ensured by coordinating with state health authorities like state drug controllers (SDCs) and central government authorities including CDSCO and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), he said while detailing about the government’s “timely and effective measures” in this regard. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the DoP collected the critical information from drug manufacturers that was used in decision making to ensure drug availability, Gowda said. About the other measures, he said that “steps have been taken to ensure the availability of Heparin used in Covid-19 treatment. Further, on intervention in the issue of price-parity of N-95 masks by the NPPA, major manufacturers, importers of N-95 Masks have reduced their prices significantly up to 67 per cent”. The DoP also coordinated on issues related to production of raw material, medicines, medical devices, packaging material etc, he said. It also ensured seamless movement of raw materials, packing materials, finished goods, manpower among other things to see availability of life saving essential drugs during the lockdown, Gowda said. “The NPPA has taken various steps to ensure the availability of life saving essential drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol, vaccines, anti-tuberculosis drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, cardiac drugs, imported anti-epileptic drugs and various Covid-19 drugs,” the minister explained. Further, on the intervention of the DoP, manufacturers of Remdesivir have created a helpline to make the drug available, Gowda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-various-measures-taken-to-ensure-availability-of-essential-drugs-says-govt/story-RmVWUoi6VCFMo0Nch6yhfO.html

Addressing the media, Gomes said the decision will help him to work at the grassroots and strengthen the party. “It is a strategic decision to step down. For four years, I was the convener and now the party’s work can be seen on the ground. Now there are many leaders in the party who can take on the administrative roles. The need is instead to work on the ground and to bring other good people into the party. So I have taken up that responsibility,” he said. “I am also aware of the ground level situation and until we do not strengthen on the ground, our work will not go forward,” he added. Gomes had quit as Goa Civil Service officer ahead of the 2017 Goa assembly elections and joined the AAP. In a short time, he was named the party’s convener. His decision to step down comes barely weeks after the party’s general secretary in the state Pradeep Padgaonkar also stepped down on health grounds after he contracted Covid-19 and needed hospitalisation. Gomes said that the two resignations despite coming within weeks of each other were not connected. “There is no connection between the two resignations,” he said. The charge as party’s convener has been given to Rahul Mhambrey, the party’s treasurer. The AAP failed to win a single seat at the 2017 assembly elections in Goa with all but one of the party’s 40 candidates losing their deposits, including Gomes and Padgaonkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-s-goa-convener-steps-down-calls-it-strategic-decision/story-oZWinVp7ORfWCPRE3agPyL.html

With most players grappling for liquidity, the sector is experiencing unprecedented stress as domestic demand for products is yet to pick up, FIMI Vice President R L Mohanty said. “In the current, difficult and challenging scenario after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the mining industry is passing through a period of high uncertainty as the mineral-based manufacturing sector is yet to come back to normal pre-COVID level of production,” Mohanty said. He was speaking during an online event on ‘GST in Mining- Issues and Challenges, organised by Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI). “Considering the present economic scenario and high effective tax rate on mining in India, it is necessary to have uniformity in GST rates for sustained growth of the mining sector,” he said. Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced on July 1, 2017 to replace multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple, transparent and technology–driven tax regime to facilitate economic growth. “While the introduction of e-way bill has enabled hassle free movement of minerals and other goods, but still the mining sector faces several issues and challenges relating to payment of GST on royalty, District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) contribution, inverted duty structure, upfront payment etc,” he said. The mining industry faces acute financial difficulty in utilisation of the input tax credit availed by the owners on their purchases of input materials, capital goods and services etc. “While a higher rate of GST is charged on supplies and services whereas GST on minerals and processed minerals is payable @5% and as such it becomes a case of inverted duty structure,” he said. Another issue of rationalisation of GST on royalty is that currently, 18 per cent GST is charged on the royalty amount while on sale of minerals GST at the rate of five per cent is charged. “It is important to have GST on royalty on the same rate as applicable for sale of minerals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uniformity-in-gst-rates-necessary-for-sustained-growth-of-mining-sector-fimi/story-AX1JjGsXjB0XojNY3Fg0zM.html
18-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Lockdown leads to spike in tea prices; 79% hike in August wholesale prices||Prices of tea, especially the CTC (crush, tear, curl) variant, which is most widely consumed, are on the rise in both wholesale and retail markets after they were stable for around five years.Wholesale price index (WPI), which measures changes in prices of goods before they are retailed, for tea grew at an all-time high of 79% in August. The figure for May was -1.8%. While the corresponding figure for June and July was 8.9% and 45.8%, respectively. A sudden drop in production for nearly a month due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced 68-day nation-wide lockdown restrictions is being attributed as the main reason for the hike in tea prices this year. All the nearly 800 tea gardens and thousands of small tea growers across Assam had to stop plucking of leaves and production from end-March and until early May due to the lockdown, a first for the 180-year-old industry.The lockdown had impacted the first flush, which occurs between March and April annually and accounts for the best quality of tea leaves for the rest of the year. Also read: Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, schools in Assam to reopen from September 21“Tea is a commodity. Its price rises or falls depending on its demand and supply. The lockdown is the main cause for the drop in tea production,” said Raj Barooah, director of Rujani Tea. “Skiffing – the removal of overgrown leaves that were not plucked due to the lockdown -- and extended monsoon rainfall also contributed to low production this year. Most gardens are reporting up to 40% decrease in production, as compared to last year. This is the primary reason behind the increase in prices,” he added.Barooah, whose family-owned Aideobari Tea Estates, has been producing tea for over 120 years, cited that their two factories at Kakodonga and Aideobari have recorded a drop in production of 38% and 27%, respectively, this year, as compared to 2019. “The rise in prices is due to a drop in supply because of the lockdown. This had affected tea auction as well. The auction picked up since end-August,” said Priyanuz Dutta, secretary, Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC). GTAC has sold around 49 million (m) kilograms (kg) of tea between end-April and until mid-September, as compared to 63 m kg during the same year-ago period. “Last year, the price of CTC tea leaves was around Rs 130-Rs 140 per kg, which has increased to Rs 250-Rs 260. Prices are likely to stabilise or drop by around 15% in the next couple of weeks because production has gained momentum,” said Sikandar Bansal of Aggarwal Brothers, a Guwahati-based tea trading firm. Tea traders and garden owners are of the view that the quality of tea produced in Assam has improved this year, most likely due to untimely skiffing, which is not usually done across all the plantations around the same time. The situation is similar in the tea-growing Dooars region of north Bengal, which is also reporting a rise in prices due to an acute shortfall in supply because of the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions. “The hike in tea price is directly related to the shortfall in supply. There was a huge shortfall in production until July because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said SK Saria, managing director (MD) of Soongachi Tea Estate in the eastern Dooars. “Though the production capacity was met in August, the previous shortfall is yet to be overcome. There was an increase in tea consumption during the shortfall in supply, which helped the industry fetch good prices,” he added. Kamal Kishore Tewari, chairman, Siliguri Tea Auction Committee (STAC), said, “Production of tea in the country has reported a shortfall of 200 m kg, while the demand has increased exponentially. At STAC, which is the largest auction centre of CTC variant in north Bengal, the average prices have increased by around Rs 100 per kg as compared to that in April.” (With inputs from Pramod Giri in Siliguri)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-leads-to-spike-in-tea-prices-79-hike-in-august-wholesale-prices/story-2oysgQT0unsuFJwsTjYEuM.html

He also defended the Centre’s decision to bring the ordinances, saying there was nothing “abnormal” and that governments have been taking this route, depending on the necessity.Both the bills were introduced in the Upper House on September 14, the first day of the ongoing monsoon session, which is being held against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 and replaces the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated on April 24.The 1973 Act was amended in 2018 to provide for the supersession of the Central Council of Homoeopathy. The council was required to be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession.This provision was amended in 2019 to require the reconstitution of the council in two years. In the interim period, the Centre constituted a board of governors to exercise the powers of the council.The bill seeks to amend the Act to increase the period for the supersession of the council from two to three years.The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020, amends the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970. The Act provides for the constitution of a central council, which regulates the education and practice of the Indian medicine system (including ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy).The bill replaces an ordinance promulgated on April 24. The proposed legislation provides that the central council will stand superseded from April 24 (the date of promulgation of the ordinance).The council will be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession. In the interim period, the Centre will constitute a board of governors, which will exercise the powers of the council.Earlier, when the House met, the proceedings were adjourned for 30 minutes till 9.35 am as a mark of respect to sitting member Ashok Gasti and former nominated member Kapila Vatsyayan, who passed away recently.Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu read out obituary references for Gasti as well as Vatsyayan.

18-09-2020||India||Covid-19 +ve BJD MLA in home isolation raided by CBI over ponzi scam||Coronavirus positive senior BJD MLA Debi Prasad Mishra was raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday over his alleged involvement in Rs 578 crore Seashore chit fund scam.A five-member team of the CBI, along with two witnesses, took part in the raid that is being conducted at seven places. The probe agency, in August 2016, has already interrogated Mishra’s two associates -Prafulla Singha, a BJD leader, and Dilip Mishra.Seashore is one of the 44 companies that is being investigated by the CBI since May 2014, following a Supreme Court order. The company reportedly raised around Rs 578 crore from gullible people offering 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors against their deposits.Mishra, former school and mass education minister under home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the CBI officials asked him about the boating project of Seashore on Mahanadi river which was allowed during his tenure as tourism minister. “I had allowed Seashore to set up a boating project in Mahanadi along with a restaurant on the outskirts of Cuttack city. Besides, I had also given permission to the company to manage a government-run guest house at Atri in Khurda district. All this was allowed as per the government’s decision. I have already appeared before the CBI and been interrogated in this matter,” he said, adding that CBI officials have taken all files from the department. In September 2017, the CBI had arrested the then BJD MLA Prabhat Biswal in connection with the Seashore ponzi scam. He was later released on bail in June 2018.The CBI has filed two charge-sheets before a Bhubaneswar-based CBI court - March 2015 and January 2018 - accusing Seashore chief Prashant Dash and his brother Prabhat of embezzling about Rs 578.2 crore, collected from investors between 2006 and 2011. The case is now being tried. The ED is also separately probing the Seashore group’s financial transactions.The Seashore scam has remained a major source of embarrassment for the Naveen Patnaik government after the CBI found that several senior IAS, IPS and BJD leaders were involved in it. Operating through one Subhankar Nayak, the company allegedly paid illegal gratification to some IAS, IPS officers of Odisha and BJD leaders for expanding its business. Nayak was earlier arrested and sent to jail in November 2014. The company also gained access to Saroj Sahoo, a one-time DTP operator who worked in Naveen Niwas and allegedly played an important role in the regional party. In September 2017, the CBI arrested erstwhile BJD MLA Prabhat Biswal in connection with the scam.Seashore was started in 2006 by Prashant Dash, an economics professor in a private college in Angul district, with the company raising capital from public without listing itself in stock exchange, mandatory if the number of shareholders cross 50. It also registered some of its firms under the Odisha Self Help Cooperative Societies Act that allowed it to remain out of the government’s checks and balances.To attract customers, the company offered 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors against their deposits, which was nearly four times the rates offered by nationalised banks. The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in February and March 2011 had alerted the Odisha government on how the company was collecting a huge amount of money from investors assuring them of high returns. The commission being paid to agents ranged from 15 to 20 per cent. Using his proximity to former BJD strongman Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, Dash entered into a clutch of partnerships with state government in healthcare, tourism, dairy, pharma, food processing and cooperative sector, it said.Most of these partnerships did not help the government as Seashore never had the requisite expertise and know-how to run the new business. In 2012, it signed an MoU with Grid Corporation of Odisha, a bulk power supplier for purchase of solar power from the firm.However, the agreement fell through after Seashore had failed to pay the bank guarantee of Rs 24 crore within the stipulated time. Like Saradha which ran a TV channel in Bengal, Seashore too started a TV channel, STV, in Odisha. It reportedly recruited the wife of a senior IPS officer for an astrological show at a huge cost to the company. Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif graced the inauguration of the TV channel in May 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-positive-bjd-mla-raided-by-cbi-in-ponzi-scam/story-wXZDo4Gc9oLPlpUOmCBjOK.html
18-09-2020||India||PM Modi defends farm bills, says critics misleading farmers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took on critics of his government’s farm liberalisation plan, a day after the lower House passed two of the three farm bills, accusing detractors of spreading “misinformation and lies”, while reassuring farmers that the reforms were in their best interests. His comments, made in an address dedicating a railway bridge in Bihar and also on the microblogging site Twitter, came after Lok Sabha passed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 by a majority voice vote. On Tuesday, the lower House had passed a third legislation, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. Also Read: ‘What politics?’: Farmers protesting against farm bills everywhere, says Harsimrat Kaur Badal after quittingThe main Opposition party, Congress, and a clutch of smaller parties have opposed the reforms. A key opposition to the bills came from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet after her party opposed the bills, exposing a crucial rift between the two parties over efforts to unshackle the farm sector. Watch l ‘Agri bills protect farmers, oppn spreading misinformation’: PM Modi Modi addressed farmers over concerns about prices and the country’s procurement system, under which the government buys farm produce at minimum support prices (MSP) from farmers. “People who ruled this country for decades and were in power…such people are trying to mislead farmers. They are telling lies to farmers,” Modi said. Also Read: Why farm sector reform bills are angering farmers: All you need to know“Fake news is also being spread that wheat and rice etc. will not be procured by government agencies from farmers. This is an absolute lie, completely wrong and an attempt to cheat farmers,” the Prime Minister said. A key bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows buyers of farm produce to trade outside the mandi system or wholesale market system run by states under the agricultural produce market committees or APMCs. APMC laws require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits. The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these markets without any taxes and will therefore open up APMCs to competitions. “The reforms will give new freedom to farmers. These reforms will bring more options and opportunities for farmers to sell their produce.” Congratulating farmers of the country over passage of this bills in the lower House, Modi said the reforms would “protect farmers” from “middlemen”. “Middlemen stand between farmers and their customers; these middlemen take a big chunk of farmers’ income. These reforms have come as a protective shield for farmers.” “The agriculture sector will benefit from modern technology and our farmers will also be empowered,” the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets. किसानों को अपनी उपज देश में कहीं पर भी, किसी को भी बेचने की आजादी देना, बहुत ऐतिहासिक कदम है। 21वीं सदी में भारत का किसान, बंधनों में नहीं, खुलकर खेती करेगा, जहां मन आएगा अपनी उपज बेचेगा, किसी बिचौलिए का मोहताज नहीं रहेगा और अपनी उपज, अपनी आय भी बढ़ाएगा: PMCritics have called for greater regulation and oversight, alleging that the reforms would replace public monopolies with private one. “Ultimately these so-called reforms are going to lead to replication of old structures outside mandis. Creating two market spaces with two completely different sets of rules is a recipe for disaster,” said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture “Government will not come to know anything about transactions in these new markets. Not knowing will give the excuse not to act. Farmers fear this, rightly so,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-defends-farm-bills-says-critics-misleading-farmers/story-UT2pBUnVESGwWLNEGEeHhO.html

He should support farmers,” the senior Congress leader said. Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) is in alliance with the BJP in Haryana and Punjab’s SAD, meanwhile, is the BJP’s oldest ally. Badal was the sole SAD representative in the central government, holding the food processing industries portfolio.Singh further praised his party for ‘making the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act pro-farmers.’ “Congress government had made APMC Act in favour of farmers. But now, any big trader can open a mandi and under these new anti-farmer bills, any dispute at mandi will be handled by officials. All these four anti-farmer ordinances should be seen in totality,” he further said.Farmers are against these bills as, according to them, these would lead to complete dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have vociferously protested against these legislations in Parliament. However, PM Modi has assured farmers MSP would not be withdrawn. The three contentious bills are: The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.While the Lok Sabha passed the latter two on Thursday, the former was passed by it on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-suffer-big-defeat-digvijaya-singh-warns-dushyant-chautala-against-supporting-bjp-on-anti-farmer-bills/story-KiYFHt5deZTHqFh74OlgzI.html

Mangalore, Bantwal, Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady, Kadaba and Moodabidri talukas fall under Dakshina Kannada district.Saying that he has already talked with the commissioner on this issues, the BJP chief said, “In our time, we stopped the operation of clubs. Pubs should also be shut down in the district. It is ruining youngsters. If the government doesn’t take any decision, I will inform the youth wing (party) to take appropriate action through court.”The controversy over Karnataka’s pub and club culture goes back to 2009 when BS Yediyurappa was the chief minister and his government strongly opposed to the growing pub culture in districts surrounding Bengaluru at that time — in the aftermath of Mangalore pub attack. On January 24, 2009, Sri Ram Sena attacked a group of young crowd in a pub in Mangalore.

The infection spread among people working in a state-owned biopharmaceutical plant in Lanzhou city, which produces animal vaccines after a leak occurred last year.Here’s all you need to know about Brucellosis outbreak:* According to Chinese authorities, the biopharmaceutical plant had used expired disinfectants for producing Brucella vaccines for animals between July and August last year. This indicated that the bacteria was not eradicated in the factory exhaust.* Subsequently, the contaminated gas from the factory formed aerosols containing the bacteria, which was then carried by wind to a nearby Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute. This resulted in infecting close to 200 people there as well in December last year.* There are 3,245 people who have contracted Brucellosis, according to health officials in Lanzhou. Another 1,401 people also tested as an early positive for the disease, news agency AFP reported. The total positive cases also included 20 students and faculty members of Lanzhou University, some of whom had been to the institute.* Brucellosis, caused by brucella bacteria, is often caused by close contact with infected animals or animal products that can bring about fevers, joint pain and headaches.* Health authorities have said there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission of Brucellosis so far. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that person-to-person transmission of brucellosis is “extremely rare” but some symptoms may reoccur or never go away.* This infection outbreak, like other such as the coronavirus disease, has also traced its origin to animals. Sheep, cattle and pigs were most commonly involved in the spread of the bacteria, Lanzhou’s health commission has said.* In this infection, some symptoms like recurrent fevers, chronic fatigue, swelling of the heart or arthritis are expected to never go away and reoccur in patients who have tested positive, according to the US’ CDC.* Brucellosis also goes by the name of Malta fever or Mediterranean fever and can cause symptoms including headaches, muscle pain, fever and fatigue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-new-bacterial-outbreak-brucellosis-infects-thousands-all-you-need-to-know/story-cksNA18wPv35tsgr6QOQyL.html

18-09-2020||India||‘They are spreading lies’: PM Modi messages farmers amid row over farm bills||Be cautious against those trying to mislead you by creating doubts, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi to farmers on Friday, a day after BJP’s oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal pulled out its only minister from the union cabinet over the farm bills. The PM, without naming anyone, said some are “bent upon spreading lies”.The farmers’ produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) bill, 2020 and the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services bill 2020, were passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday that led to opposition by the Congress and resignation of Union minister Harsimar Kaur Badal of the Akali Dal.“Those who did nothing for decades when they were in power are today opposing the bills for agriculture reforms aimed at deregulating the farm sector to give farmers better options and opportunities. The bills are aimed at unshackling the farmers and protecting them from middlemen. They can now sell their produce anywhere, anytime on their own terms,” the PM said.Modi was speaking at the launch of 12 railways projects, including the long-awaited Kosi Rail Mahasetu connecting Kosi and Mithila regions, in Bihar through video conferencing.Aware of the opposition to the farm bills, especially by the Congress and also from SAD, Modi congratulated the farmers for the bills that he said would usher in greater freedom and returns for their produce and work as a ‘protective cover’ for them.“Some people are bent upon spreading lies and siding with middlemen despite having done nothing for farmers for decades when they had the opportunity. They also talked about it, mentioned it in their manifestoes before elections and conveniently forgot about it later, but when the NDA government has done it, they have problems. They have developed a tendency of opposing for the sake of opposing,” he added.Modi said the farmers of the country need to be cautious against those trying to mislead them by creating doubts. “They are spreading rumours that the government will not procure foodgrains at the minimum support price (MSP). Let me tell you, it is wrong. The government is committed to ensuring MSP to farmers. The government procurement will also continue as it is today,” he added.Referring to CM Nitish Kumar, Modi said Bihar understood the problems of farmers due to agriculture produce market committee (APMC) Act quite early and now the Centre was following the Bihar model. Bihar had dissolved all agriculture marketing committees and marketing boards in the state in 2006 after repealing the state government’s then APMC Act.Modi said that the NDA government had done so much for the farmers in the last six years that was never done earlier. “We have looked into each problem the farmers have to face. To prevent farmers from falling into loan trap, the PM Kisan Kalyan Yojana was launched and so far over 10-crore farmers have benefited from it, wherein over Rs 1-lakh crore has been directly deposited into their bank accounts without any middleman,” he added.Modi said that aware of the irrigation problems, Rs 1-lakh crore is also being spent on the Kisan Sinchai Yojana. “The first Kisan rain also ran from Bihar to Maharashtra. A lot has been done and a lot more will be done for the welfare of the farmers. They need to guard against those who don’t want betterment of farmers. We want to unshackle farmers so that they could have multiple options and opportunities to increase their income,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-are-spreading-lies-pm-modi-messages-farmers-amid-row-over-farm-bills/story-u0g3G7QFlB132g2DFV7sCL.html

If MPLADS had to be curtailed, it could have been for a period lesser than two years, Azad said. “I would request that... it (MPLADS) should be done away with only for one year, and that too only half of it, and the rest should be provided to the MPs,” Azad said.Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) said the central vista project appeared like a luxury at this time of severe resource crunch and added that the new parliament building in the offing should be put on hold as should the governments ad-spend.YSRCP member V Vijaisai Reddy had another suggestion—to cut the salaries of and penalise members who disrupt the House.Joshi said MPLADS funds or the central vista were not within the scope of the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bills-to-reduce-salaries-of-mps-ministers-gets-rajya-sabha-nod/story-szgRpEwj6EOx1fm4SHcbFM.html

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said the Centre must give financial aid to states to help them tide over the economic crisis as states fill up the coffers of the central government.“The Centre is responsible for the collapse of the economy. Fatal experiments like demonetisation [withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes in 2016] are responsible for the chaos in the economy. Without any preparation [a countrywide] lockdown was announced, and while doing so there was no coordination...,” the editorial said.It added Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on March 13 there is no medical emergency in the country. “On March 22, Prime Minister called for [voluntary] Janata curfew [for social distancing]. On March 24, after a notice of only four hours, a 21-day strict lockdown was announced. The chaos and uncertainty that started then is still going on. Never has there been so much chaos.”The editorial said states like Punjab, Delhi and West Bengal have sought financial assistance from the Centre. It added revenues of states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have reduced by 75%. The editorial asked the Centre to take a “hefty loan” from the World Bank and distribute money to the states while calling it the “only alternative”. It noted the Centre announced a relief package of Rs 20 lakh crore during the lockdown and added “it is a mystery where the money has gone”.The editorial said at least 22% of the Centre’s revenue comes from Mumbai, but it is not ready to help states. “Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have borne the maximum brunt of Covid-19 and suffered losses worth Rs 14.4 lakh crore,” the editorial said.The Centre late last month offered the states two borrowing options to plug a shortfall in their Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year, as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the economy. The states can borrow Rs 97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate and repay the amount from the cess charged on luxury and sin goods like liquor after the GST regime completes five years of implementation in June 2022. The second option is for the states to borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore in consultation with the central bank. Some states have insisted that the Centre borrow the money instead and compensate the states for the shortfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-responsible-for-economy-collapse-must-borrow-from-world-bank-to-help-states-saamana/story-Mf6tgsYHTmHctC9aDO7F7L.html

These bills were very necessary to protect the middlemen between the farmer and the customer, who take a large part of the farmers’ earnings themselves.*At the time of elections, they talked big in order to woo the farmers, used them, put in their manifesto and forgot after the election. Today, when the BJP-NDA government is doing the same things, they are spreading all sorts of lies.* These people are forgetting how aware the country’s farmer is. They are seeing that some people do not like the new opportunities being provided to the farmers. The farmer of the country is watching those people who are standing with middlemen.* Now it is being propagated that the benefit of MSP will not be given to the farmers by the government. It is also being said that the government will not buy paddy-wheat etc. from farmers. This is a lie, its wrong, farmers are being deceived.* Our government is committed to providing fair prices to farmers through MSP. Government procurement will continue as before.* Anyone can sell his product anywhere in the world, wherever he wants. But only peasant brothers and sisters were denied this right. Now, with the new provisions in force, the farmer will be able to sell his crop in any market of the country at his desired price.* Today I want to give a clear message to the farmers of the country with humility. Do not get into any kind of confusion. Farmers of the country have to be vigilant against these people. Beware of those who ruled the country for decades and who are lying to the farmers today.* Considering the problems faced by the farmers, our government has made constant efforts to overcome every problem.* They are beating the knack of protecting the farmers, but actually they want to keep the farmers in bonds. Those people are supporting the middlemen, they are supporting the earnings of the farmers with the looters in between.* This is the need of the country and also the demand of the times.

It would weed out ineligible beneficiaries from various schemes. The social registry would be a super database in which databases of all departments would be integrated. We expect the social registry to be ready by the end of March next year,” said Meena.Odisha runs around 60 social assistance programmes that account for a large share of its annual GDP. Programmes like Kalia, Madhubabu pension yojana, Mamata scheme, Biju pucca ghar yojana, Biju krushak kalyan yojana, Mukhyamantri swasthya seva mission, Barishtha nagarika tirtha yatra yojana and Kalinga shiksha sathi yojana, cover almost 70 per cent of the total 4.2 crore people of the State.Though the social welfare schemes have ensured BJD’s victory in successive elections since 2000, the schemes have also bled the state treasury as there have been allegations of ineligible and dead beneficiaries crowding the list. A month ago, Odisha had made Aadhaar verification of beneficiaries of National social assistance programme and Madhu babu pension yojana as mandatory to get the monthly pension. Though it temporarily backed down from its decision at the last moment following protests from activists, the SSEPD department wants to follow through the process. Similarly, at least 50,000 people from the 51 lakh beneficiaries of Kalia scheme too, were found to be ineligible and asked to return the assistance money.Also Read: Rs 10 lakh hike in ex-gratia for Odisha cops and staff killed by MaoistsOfficials said the existing databases of national food security act, Kalia, birth & death, MGNREGA, mission shakti, old age pension, disability pension, scholarship, skill development would be sanitised through local government directory mapping.Officials involved with the process said the agriculture and farmers’ empowerment department which is preparing a farmers’ database for social registry has devised an anomaly detection algorithm to detect any fraud or data anomaly such as during buying seeds for paddy, selling oilseeds.Also Read: Opposition parties snub Congress in joint protest over GSTA detailed SOP with a 3-tier verification has been created that would ensure collection of farmers’ number, their gender, marital status, mobile number, residential address and bank account details for Aadhaar authentication, LGD mapping, bank account verification and Aadhaar lookup with national payment corporation of India.

What is politics in this? Farmers are agitating not only in Punjab but also in Haryana, Rajasthan, UP, Maharashtra. There is opposition in south India,” Harsimrat Kaur Badal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation from the Union Cabinet and directed that Narendra Singh Tomar be assigned the additional charge of the ministry, according to a press release.The SAD had been asking the Centre not to go ahead with the three agriculture-related bills for approval of Parliament “until all reservations expressed by farmers’ organisations, farmers and farm labourers” are addressed.Though the new measures, which are aimed at freeing up farm trade from restrictions, at guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices, and at laying down a new architecture for contract farming, have been hailed by economists, farmer groups fear that they will lead to exploitation by big food-trading monopolies.“I have resigned from Union Cabinet in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation.

Rawat, while addressing a query about the Char Dham road project during a press conference in Dehradun on the completion of three and a half years of his government, said “5.5 metre road width se kaam nahi chalega. (5.5 m road width won’t work). Stressing upon the need to have a wider road in the strategically important border areas, Rawat said he will urge the Central government to look into this matter.“When we take border security aspect into consideration, widening of the Char Dham road is required,” he said. The all-weather road project aims to connect the four shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri through an 826km long road. Darshan Singh Rawat, media coordinator for CM Rawat, said the chief minister will be soon writing to the Centre on the necessity for a wider Char Dham road from a strategic point of view and for improving connectivity in areas bordering China in the state. The official, however, added that the state government can’t file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on the matter since the Central government and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) are directly dealing with the matter. On September 8, 2020, the Supreme Court had ordered that the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) circular of 2018 is to be followed for Char Dham road construction. The MoRTH circular says that the roads in the hilly and mountain terrains are to be of 5.5 m width (18 ft) with two-lane structures (23 ft). Also Read: On China, India is making a mistake | OpinionThe apex court had upheld the views of Ravi Chopra, chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) appointed high powered committee (HPC) on Char Dham road project which recommended 5.5 m intermediate road width against the view in support of 12 m total road width-- submitted by the majority group of the HPC-- in tune with the 2012 circular of the MoRTH. In August last year, the Supreme Court had ordered the formation of an 11-member high-powered committee to “consider the cumulative and independent impact of the Char Dham project on the entire Himalayan valleys…” Also Watch: India’s ‘Island Gambit’ against China?

A review meeting with the union road and transport minister was held on July 17 this year on the progress of the road project costing Rs 12,072 crore.It was then informed that over 350 km of the road network has been constructed so far as part of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-lists-why-char-dham-road-widening-is-important-it-s-strategic/story-rt4xEoI4mf3TeMC0ZOcxbM.html

An initiative of divisional forest officer, Varanasi, Mahavir Kaujalgi, the forest department is developing the forest with financial assistance from ‘national clean air’ programme through UP pollution control board.“We started working on developing the natural forest two-and-a-half months ago. First of all, many rows of one metre deep trenches were dug up. These were filled with straw and organic fertilisers and soil was prepared to develop the special root zones so that the roots could grow vertically,” said Kaujalgi. “Thereafter, plantations of different species of vegetation began. So far, 20,000 saplings of 40 indigenous species have been planted. The remaining 10,000 would be planted in the next four days,” he added.Also Read: Here is what PM Modi wants as birthday giftThe Indian Forest Service officer said the aim was to provide clean air to the city. Kaujalgi underwent training to use the Miyawaki method for developing the forest a year ago. “Selection of plants is very important in developing the three-layer natural forest,” he said.“The first-layer trees are the tall ones; of sagaun, kadamb, mango, mahua, neem, peepal, indigo and several others. They need much sunlight and grow fast.” Also Read: PM Modi birthday: Ganga puja, cleanliness drive mark occasion in Kashi“The species comprising the second layer include sahjan (drumstick), kaner and various other species which need partial light. The third layer includes flower plants like bougainvillea and many shrubs which demand less light for growing. All plants grow together and a natural first, second and third layer is developed within two years,” the forest officer added.“After this forest grows well using the Miyawaki method, such forests can be developed elsewhere,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-layered-forest-coming-up-in-kashi-village-adopted-by-pm-narendra-modi/story-3LiwO9GEuAeozf2RqPnwKM.html

18-09-2020||India||Covid-19 may lead to decline in life expectancy globally: Study||The Covid-19 pandemic could cause a short-term decline in life expectancy in the severely affected areas of the world, unless the spread of the disease is contained, according to a study. The research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined the impact of Covid-19-related deaths on life expectancy for four broad world regions across multiple rates of infection and age groups. “Our study provides the first assessment of the potential impact of Covid-19 on period life expectancies according to a range of scenarios of prevalence rates over a one-year period,” said Guillaume Marois, from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, who led the study. Period life expectancy is a measure of the number of years that an average person may expect to live. Prevalence is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a disease at a specific time. The researchers noted that improved healthcare, socioeconomic conditions, and education are among the key factors influencing our health and how long we live. Life expectancy has been used as a measure of human development across regions and countries. The researchers built a model that simulates the probability of getting infected by Covid-19, the probability of dying from it, and the probability of dying from another cause for a period of one year, taking into account the different fatality rates from the disease for different age groups. They then calculated the impact of Covid-19 on life expectancy by reconstructing life tables and life expectancies from the simulation and comparing them with those used for the inputs. The study found that at very low prevalence rates, the Covid-19 pandemic would not affect life expectancy. However, at prevalence rates of only 2 per cent, the disease could cause a drop in life expectancy in countries where average life expectancy is high -- roughly around 80 years. “At 10 per cent prevalence, the loss in life expectancy is likely to be above one year in high life-expectancy countries such as those in Europe and North America,” Morois said. “At 50 per cent, it would translate into three to nine years of life lost in high life-expectancy regions. In less developed regions, the impact is smaller given that there is already lower survival at older ages,” he added. However, Morois noted that even in the most affected regions, the life expectancy will likely recover once the pandemic is over. This type of analysis is useful to decision makers as it shows in broad strokes the potential cost of human lives lost due to the disease., according to the researchers. “These ‘what-if’ scenarios can give policy-relevant information on what could potentially happen to life expectancy under different levels of prevalence, which vary with public health strategies to reduce and prevent the spread of Covid-19,” IIASA World Population Program Deputy Director Raya Muttarak, a study coauthor, added. “We show that if the virus spread widely in the population, for instance, in the absence of any lockdowns and social distance measures, this could result in a notable drop in period life expectancy,” Muttarak said. The new study provides an important first estimate of the impact of Covid-19 on life expectancy, but new developments in healthcare or broader impacts of the pandemic on healthcare access or economic systems could also affect mortality rates and life expectancies. The researchers point out that the potential overload of health care systems at higher rates of prevalence would inevitably lead to higher mortality. However, as healthcare providers gain more experience and knowledge in treating the disease, mortality rates may decrease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-may-lead-to-decline-in-life-expectancy-globally-study/story-U2D9J9zXyfTjMNsRb9PKeL.html

The number of deaths rose to 115 from 54 in the same period.According to the official data, Rajkot’s case fatality rate is the lowest in the state but some recent incidents have raised suspicion of there being some discrepancy in the data on the number of deaths. A local Gujarati daily in Rajkot reported on September 3 that 32 bodies were cremated/buried in Rajkot city the previous day as per Covid-19 protocols but only three deaths were recorded in Gujarat’s Covid health bulletin.Rajkot municipal commissioner Udit Mishra denied hiding real death figures and said that a death audit committee determines the cause of deaths of Covid patients.“Some people have confused routine deaths with Covid deaths. This may be because suspected Covid patients are cremated following the Covid protocol when they die. Covid death figures are decided by the audit committee,” said Mishra.Former president of the Rajkot medical association (RMA) Dr Chetan Lalseta said: “One should not attribute all deaths to Rajkot district. Many terminally ill patients coming from the neighbouring districts also contribute to the high death numbers in Rajkot.”Still, the situation turned so bad that the Gujarat government had to rush its health secretary Jayanti Ravi with a team of health experts and doctors to the home town of chief minister Vijay Rupani on August 31 to bring the situation under control.“All efforts are being made to reduce fatalities in Rajkot district. Around 15 doctors from other districts would be stationed here and additional ventilators would be provided,” news agency PTI quoted her as saying on August 31.Also Read: ‘Great leader and loyal friend’: US President Trump extends birthday wishes to PM ModiAs the cases have risen exponentially, residents have gone into isolation.“We had no option but to go for a self-imposed complete lockdown as cases were rising very fast and lockdown is the only way to control the chain of transmission,” said Suresh Kumar, communications in-charge of the Rajkot wholesale textile merchants association.He said the voluntary lockdown is almost complete with essential good shops opening for limited hours every day. “There is a huge fear among people as the virus is spreading very fast.

They are indirectly promoting private medical colleges and quackery.”Notably, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had moved a motion to take up Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Rajya Sabha in the morning. He claimed that the Central Council of Homoeopathy did not cooperate with the Centre in carrying out its duties.BJP MP Prasanna Acharya from Odisha also took part in the discussion and was of the view that there is a dire need to make the homoeopathy system “robust” for the needy.“Homoeopathy is an old Indian system of medicine and it is accessible to the poor. So we need to make it robust.” However, he stressed on the proper need for demarcation of powers and functions which has not been addressed in the bill,” Acharya said in the Upper House during a discussion over the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP T Siva claimed that most Bills have taken state government powers stating, “This is one more attempt of this government to strike at roots of federalism. From the day they assumed office, most Bills passed have taken away the powers of state government.”“Standing Committee has very clearly stated that there is no representation of State Medical Councils in the Advisory Council. So, it is recommended that there should be a provision for representation of elected members of State Medical Councils,” the DMK MP added.Moreover, Congress leader Ripun Bora, after briefly describing the history of the Council stated that the government has a history of “taking away the autonomy “ of institutes and organisations.The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced in Rajya Sabha on September 14, 2020. The Bill amends the Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973.The Act sets up the Central Council of Homoeopathy which regulates homoeopathic education and practice. The Bill replaces the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 which was promulgated on April 24, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-can-be-expected-from-govt-that-says-cow-urine-can-cure-disease-tmc-mp/story-KkxHuHhpTk1h6YEis5U91K.html

HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.Devi said her statement was distorted and that she had said it is the duty of officers to provide benefits of government schemes to the people and develop the area. “If officers work properly, the government will get the benefits of the schemes.”Congress spokesman JP Dhanopia said they will lodge a complaint with the EC. “What the minister Imarti Devi said speaks volumes about the ruling party’s design to misuse government machinery during the bypolls.”BJP leader Hitesh Bajpai said Devi has denied having made such a statement. “Distorting her statement must be a handiwork of some mischievous elements to defame the government and the ruling party. People know well who these elements are. In the manner the video has been edited gives strong evidence that there are some people behind it.”Devi was also a minister in the Kamal Nath government before she joined the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-move-ec-after-bjp-minister-says-govt-can-manipulate-elections/story-6AhEFBtag4CFm5LSKLBu0H.html

18-09-2020||India||Allies for decades, SAD-BJP move away as govt passes farm bills||In April 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was slated to file his nomination papers for the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency, a gesture of the PM had created quite a flutter on social media.The PM had touched the feet of veteran Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) leader and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal (92), which was recorded by TV cameras for posterity.Badal is over two decades senior to the PM both in age and politics. The PM’s respect for the SAD’s patron had underlined the importance of the ties between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the SAD, the oldest constituent in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The BJP top brass has always been proud of its special ties with the SAD for decades. Also Read: Farm bills: Farmers’ body announces three-day ‘rail roko’ agitation in Punjab from September 24In May 1996, when the BJP had emerged as the single-largest party after the parliamentary polls, the SAD was the first political entity to endorse the former’s bid to form the government at the Centre. Perhaps, SAD has been the only BJP ally, whose unflinching loyalty to the senior partner has never been in doubt through the years. Leaders of both parties valued each other’s role in agitations, especially during the Emergency, declared by the then PM Indira Gandhi, between June 25, 1975 and March 21, 1977. In Punjab, the SAD’s home turf, the BJP is largely seen as an urban political force, while the junior ally has deep rural connect in the agrarian state.The SAD-BJP alliance had ruled Punjab for a decade between 2007 and 2017. This was largely because the SAD had managed to wean away a section of urban voters, who had chosen the Congress in the past.Also Read: Why farm sector reform bills are angering farmers: 5 things you need to knowLeaders from both the parties on various occasions had described the alliance as unbreakable and everlasting.The BJP was content to play second fiddle to the SAD in the latter’s bastion, despite the former calling the shots at the Centre. The exit of the BJP’s most prominent Jat Sikh and Punjabi face, Navjot Singh Sidhu, who had advocated a tougher stance against the Badals, is also attributed to the party leadership’s decision not to upset the SAD.However, there were strains, despite a common ideological mooring to oppose the Congress. Many felt that the Akalis had moved away from their core Panthic agenda because of the close proximity with the BJP.The SAD, which is trying to regain its lost ground in Punjab to the ruling Congress and a new entrant the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), is primed to play the role of an aggressive opposition in state politics after the BJP’s oldest ally withdrew from the NDA government on Thursday. Union minister for food processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Modi government on Thursday in protest against the legislations aimed to liberalise trade in agricultural commodities. The timing could not have been more opportune as the SAD’s move is aimed at tapping its huge rural constituency, where farmers’ issues have traditionally struck electoral chords.Though the lone SAD representative in the Modi government has resigned, the party is still a part of the NDA. Now, the decades-old ties are on the line as the Centre’s legislative push is seen to hit the SAD where it hurts the most – anti-farmers’ issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allies-for-decades-sad-bjp-move-away-as-govt-passes-farm-bills/story-aC8bUnOLGkbo7Kp9iSEC1M.html
18-09-2020||India||India readies for QUAD and 2 plus 2 dialogues, China is elephant in the room||United States, India, Australia and Japan are in conversation to decide the venue and date of QUAD security dialogue next month, which will be followed by the 2 plus 2 dialogue between India and US here. As of now, Japan is an option for the QUAD dialogue or both QUAD and 2 plus 2 dialogues could be held back to back in New Delhi late next month.The QUAD dialogue is an informal tie-up between democratic countries that share military logistics support, inter-operability through exercises and information and are committed to keep the Indo-Pacific sea lanes of communication free from artificial constructs and constraints. The QUAD dialogue will be held in person between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne. The ministers are guided by the leadership of the four countries who share personal rapport and global visions for peace. The delay in the date and venue is due to the change of government in Japan with prime minister Yoshihide Suga taking over from ailing Shinzo Abe.For the two plus two dialogue, defence minister Rajnath Singh will join with US secretary of defence Mark Esper in New Delhi.Although the QUAD is not targeted at any particular country, the informal group is closely watching the rise of wolf warriors in Communist China and its impact on security of Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean with Beijing opening fronts against all four QUAD members---from land disputes to exports to data extraction. The rise of QUAD is a direct consequence of China claiming the entire South China Sea through artificial nine dash line which has been rejected by the global body tribunal.QUAD is expected to be further strengthened as India has 2 plus 2 dialogue with US and Japan at ministerial level and with Australia at the foreign secretary level. All the four nations time and again conduct military exercises and the chances of QUAD navies participating under the rubric of Malabar exercises is very high though the decision is still to be taken.The QUAD will be followed by the two plus two in Delhi, with US and India to initial the long pending foundational basic exchange and cooperation agreement for sharing geospatial data. While the US is ready to supply top of the line military hardware to India including armed drones, it has been left to the latter to work out what it requires to deal with a rising global power next door.Given the fact that the People’s Liberation Army is dragging its feet on total disengagement from Ladakh sector, it is quite obvious that the Chinese aggression in western sector in May 2020 will be a hot topic of discussion for both QUAD dialogue and 2 plus 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-readies-for-quad-and-2-plus-2-dialogues-china-is-elephant-in-the-room/story-E9fBjJLOaOvKVWvJO7QM5I.html

18-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: What to expect today||Finance-related bills will come up for passage and introduction in Parliament on Friday, amid rising Covid-19 cases within the Parliament complex, posing new challenges before the monsoon session. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will introduce The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020. The bill will replace an ordinance that was promulgated on March 31 to provide certain relaxations related to compliance, such as extension of time limit and waiver of penalty, in relation to the Income Tax Act, 1961 (IT Act), some Finance Acts, the Central Excise Act, 1944, the Customs Act, 1962, and the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988. The Parliament will quickly clear the supplementary demand for grants and the related appropriation bills in the Lok Sabha on Friday. The appropriation bills or additional budgetary support to some ministries are raised if some ministries need extra money to tackle excess expenses. Sitharaman will also move The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Bill, 202 and The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 for passage. In the Rajya Sabha, the government will try to pass The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Ayush ministry will also move the bill to amend the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 for passage. The Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020 — that was brought to reduce MPs’ salaries by 30% — will also be passed in the Upper House. The Indian Institutes of Information Technology Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 will also be passed. The Parliament complex will also kickstart a tightened health safety protocol under which MPs would be encouraged to undergo a fresh round of RT-PCR tests even as sanitisation of the chambers and Parliament building has been intensified following the recent Covid cases. “No formal direction has been issued for MPs yet as we saw many of them are already taking a repeat RT-PCR test on their own. Speaker’s office has already clarified that any lawmaker is free to take as many tests as he wants,” said a senior official involved in the safety planning. An internal circular of the Lok Sabha, accessed by HT, said that any ministry officials who want to come to the Officials Gallery will have to show RT-PCR negative report. “The officials issued with ‘official gallery’ passes must carry/show their RT-PCR (negative) report for Covid-19 not more than 72 hours before their visit to Parliament House. The official gallery is right next to the first row of the ruling benches and various ministry officials sit there to assist their ministers as and when there is a debate related to their sector. Both Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla hurriedly consulted various experts and lawmakers before tightening the current Covid safety protocols. The three new cases involving MPs left both the presiding officers worried and resulted in a new, tight set of norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-what-to-expect-today/story-uCrzHFWgZb3PYR6qa7IBhN.html
18-09-2020||India||Parliament tweaks testing after 2 more MPs test Covid +ve||Repeat RT-PCR tests for lawmakers, mandatory tests for government officials visiting parliament, and daily antigen tests for reporters and Parliament officials — these are part of the tighter safety norms that have been hurriedly put in place after more Members of Parliament (MPs), who attended the ongoing monsoon session, tested positive for the coronavirus disease.The changes came after Union tourism and culture minister Prahlad Patel and BJP’s senior Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, a day after transport minister Nitin Gadkari did. All three had tested negative in the gold standard RT-PCR tests over the weekend, and experts said their positive tests points to the need for frequent repeat testing — and for the lawmakers attending Parliament’s ongoing session to wear masks and maintain social distancing even while out of the House.Also read: Nitin Gadkari tests Covid +ve 2 days after attending monsoon sessionParliament officials said lawmakers would be encouraged to undergo a fresh round of RT-PCR tests and that more intensive sanitisation of the chambers and Parliament building is happening. All three leaders attended Parliament before testing positive. They also didn’t rule out a shorter-than-planned monsoon session if more lawmakers attending it test positive.“No formal direction has been issued to MPs yet (on the tests) as we see that many of them are already taking a repeat RT-PCR test on their own. The speaker’s office has already clarified that a lawmaker is free to take as many tests as he want,” said a senior official involved in keeping Parliament safe.An internal Lok Sabha circular, reviewed by HT, said that ministry officials who want to come to the Official Gallery will have to show a negative RT-PCR test report taken ”not more than 72 hours before their visit to Parliament House”.The gallery is right next to the first row of the treasury benches and various ministry officials sit there to assist their ministers as and when there is a debate related to their department.Both Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla hurriedly consulted various experts and lawmakers before tightening the current Covid safety protocols. The three new cases involving MPs have left both presiding officers worried and resulted in a new, tighter set of rules.Also read: Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tests positive for Covid-19Parliament has also made it mandatory for its officials dealing with MPs and the public to undertake daily rapid antigen tests. The results of these are usually available in 15-20 minutes as against a minimum of 5-6 hours for the RT-PCR test. They are not as accurate, though.The circular added: “Officials issued with general entry session passes must carry/show their rapid antigen (negative) report for the same day of their visit to Parliament House.”Journalists entering Parliament will also have to undergo daily antigen tests.Patel said on Twitter on Thursday morning: “My Covid report came positive last night. Those who met me on Tuesday should maintain caution.”Similarly, Sahasrabuddhe, president of Indian Council for Cultural Relations, took to the Twitter to announce, “Last Friday, got examined and was tested Negative, hence attended Parliament! But last night I had headache+mild fever, got examined and have tested Positive for Covid-19! .”Top officials refused to rule out a curtailment of the monsoon session if cases continue to grow in the two Houses. A top functionary told HT on Thursday: “That is always an option. But we also have to think how to balance the fact that on one side we are keeping all services such as metro rails, shops, buses open, but we ourselves are shutting down the session.”The monsoon session, delayed by two months due to the pandemic, started on September 14 after all lawmakers, officials and journalists covering the session were tested for Covid-19. It also saw unprecedented arrangements including MPs of one House spread across both Houses of Parliament to maintain social distancing, plexiglass sheets separating seats, a sit-and-speak order, and the two Houses working in shifts.With the three MPs, thus far, 32 lawmakers have tested positive since late last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-tweaks-testing-after-2-more-mps-test-covid-ve/story-xUeBbitpGr5iG1oC1mPzmN.html

Also Read: Will Covid-19 vaccine be ready by this year? Trump promises defy the lessons of pharmaceutical historySuch a crisis had occurred during the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25 in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “Between March and June, PMBJK had faced many challenges regarding shortage of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other raw materials of pharmaceuticals, disturbance in supply of medicines to the centres from central and regional warehouses due to non-availability of vehicles for transportation, etc. Keeping this in view, the expansion plan is being chalked out,” the ministry said.At present, PMBJK stocks are stored in four warehouses that are located in Gurugram, Chennai, Bengaluru and Guwahati. Plans are afoot to open two more warehouses in western and central India. The government is also considering the appointment of distributors in states and union territories (UTs) in a bid to strengthen the supply chain system.The scheme has been approved with a budget of Rs 490 crore between 2020-21 and 2024- 25. “Despite the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions and testing times because of the pandemic, PMBJK achieved appreciable sales turnover of Rs 146.59 crore in the first quarter of 2020-21, as compared to Rs 75.48 crore achieved in the same year-ago period. Between July and September 15, the stores added sales of Rs 109.43 crore. The total sale up to September 15 is Rs 256.02 crore.

18-09-2020||India||No power can stop Indian forces from patrolling Ladakh areas, asserts Rajnath Singh||No force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling borders, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday, signalling a resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the de-factor border, known as the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang in Ladakh, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching areas they could previously patrol.Singh’s remark came in response to comments by former defence minister AK Anthony, who was reacting to the statement by the incumbent made earlier in Rajya Sabha. “The former defence minister has said that China is stopping us from patrolling. I want to make it clear that is the reason for our fight with China. These were patrolling points that were traditional and are well-defined,” he said. Singh added: “...No force in the world can stop Indian jawans from patrolling. If our soldiers have made sacrifices, it is for this reason that they have laid down their lives.”Antony also said that the ongoing talks with China should result in India being able to restore how things were till mid-April in the eastern Ladakh theatre and the outcome should allow that forces are able to patrol right up to India’s perception of its border. In the statement earlier, Singh gave a detailed assessment of the Ladakh situation. “It is easy to start wars but there is no control over how they end,” the minister said, underscoring the important of restraint. While the rest of the statement was similar to that delivered in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the defence minister took some questions from members in the Upper House. He is also due to separately hold a closed-door meeting with opposition leaders on the sensitive issue.“It is reassuring to hear the defence minister say that the army will patrol to its traditional areas in eastern Ladakh. However, this will only happen if there is an agreement on disengagement and a return to previous protocols,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). The Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aggressive forward deployments in the eastern Ladakh theatre have hindered the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns in Depsang, Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Kongka La, officials familiar with the developments said on Thursday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. While Depsang was not among the friction points on the LAC that Singh mentioned in his statement, the officials said the PLA’s deployments in forward areas in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. Also read: China not honouring customary alignment of boundary with India: Rajnath SinghThe Depsang plains lie south of Daulat Beg Oldie in a strategic area that the military calls Sub-Sector North (SSN).Before the current standoff began, the Indian Army patrolled right up to India’s perception of the LAC marked either by geographical features or so-called PPs (in the absence of natural features) dotting the LAC. In his statement, Singh said China has mobilised a large number of troops and weapons systems along the LAC and the eastern Ladakh theatre, and “there are several friction areas, including Gogra, Kongka La and north and south banks of the Pangong Lake.” The Indian Army took control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline in the first week of September, shortly after it moved and occupied strategic heights on the southern bank to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory, in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. Fingers 4 and 8 are eight kilometre apart. The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4. In the Rajya Sabha, Antony flagged concerns about the PLA’s forward deployments restricting the scope of Indian patrolling activity in the Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake. “The other areas where patrolling activity has been affected include Kongka La and Gogra. These areas have traditionally not been disputed as both sides had a somewhat common perception of the LAC. But Depsang and Finger Area are the main worry,” the officials said. In 2013, the PLA set up positions 19km into the Indian side of the LAC in the Depsang sector and triggered a face-off that took three weeks to resolve. Prepared for the long haul in the Ladakh theatre, India has made arrangements to provide logistics support to its soldiers deployed in forward areas — more than 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed in the theatre through the winter months to deal with any provocation by the Chinese forces.Separately on Thursday, the ministry of external affairs said China should sincerely work towards resolving issues. “The Chinese side should sincerely work with the Indian side for complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas, including Pangong Lake, as well as de-escalation in border areas in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols on maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas,” said spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-power-can-stop-indian-forces-from-patrolling-ladakh-areas-asserts-rajnath-singh/story-zfr9TqXzW9nOzsK3SmmqAL.html

The farmers argue that the legislations would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the ‘mercy’ of big corporates.The government, however, says that the bills will help farmers across the country get a better market for their price and produce.Nevertheless, farmers in both Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against the legislations for weeks now. On September 10, protesting farmers were lathicharged in Haryana’s Kurukshetra.On Thursday, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MP and union minister of food processing industries, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, resigned from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet as a mark of protest against the bills. The party, however, will continue to support the government from the outside.Badal was the only SAD representative in the Modi government. The party from Punjab is the oldest ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power at the Centre.“Harsimrat Kaur Badal ji’s resignation has come very late. It’s to calm down anger of people. Even today, if Sukhbir Badal ji realises, then he should ‘gherao’ the Parliament with lakhs of his workers,” Pandher later said on the minister’s resignation.While one of the three bills- -the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020- -was passed on Tuesday, two others were passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday, with the SAD voting against them.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-farmers-body-announces-three-day-rail-roko-agitation-in-punjab-from-september-24/story-qymu8FM7Cs4od2qOVbHGiI.html

With ruling BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal joining the opposition in protesting these bills, Modi asserted that many forces are trying to “mislead’ farmers and assured the farming community that minimum support price (MSP) and government procurement of their produce will continue along with a lot of other options for them.Also read: ‘System of MSP, govt procurement retained’: PM assures farmers after passage of agricultural reform bills These reforms will provide new opportunities to farmers to sell their produce and will lead to increased profits for them, he said. Modi also urged farmers and those associated with the agriculture sector to listen to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply to the discussion on these bills. “These agriculture reforms will provide new avenues to farmers to sell their produce which will increase their profits. Agriculture sector will benefit from modern technology and our farmers will also be empowered,” the prime minister said in a series of tweets. Many forces are trying to mislead farmers, he added, while assuring them of the benefits of these reforms. Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.Also read: Congress MPs burn copies of farm bills It has already passed Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the foreign ministers of Bahrain and the UAE for the signing of the historic agreements aimed at normalising relations between Israel and the Arab countries. They came almost 26 years after the signing of a declaration for a peace deal between Israel and Jordan. “We have followed the Abraham Accords signed in Washington DC by the UAE, Bahrain, Israel and the US. As I have said earlier, India has always supported peace and stability in West Asia, which is our extended neighbourhood,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “As such, we welcome these agreements for normalisation of relations between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain,” he added. Srivastava reflected the fine balance struck by India in its ties with Israel and the Arab states when he said that New Delhi will “also continue our traditional support for the Palestinian cause”. India, he said, hopes for the “early resumption of direct negotiations for an acceptable two-state solution”. Also Read: What the Israel-UAE-Bahrain accord means for India and the worldPrime Minister Narendra Modi became the first Indian premier to visit Israel, with which India has forged strong ties in the fields of defence, technology and trade. At the same time, the Modi government has worked assiduously to court Arab countries in West Asia, which is home to some eight million expatriates and a key source of energy. Under the Abraham Accords, the UAE and Bahrain will normalise their relations with Israel and expand engagements in politics, security, trade and connectivity. More Arab states are expected to ink similar agreements with Israel, while some countries such as Saudi Arabia have said they stand with the Palestinian people and sought a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-welcomes-abraham-accords-calls-for-talks-on-two-state-solution/story-g5MOU9PIpwxQ0Zzc5CfZ3N.html

That disastrous decision made the party richer, but cost millions of American jobs. It is time to protect American workers and take back our leverage over Beijing by withdrawing China’s permanent trade status,” Cotton said in a press release announcing the bill.China could still maintain its MFN status with the US, but the privilege would have to be renewed by the US President annually, with Congress allowed to override the decision of the President, the release said.The bill also includes a list of human rights and trade abuses that would disqualify China for MFN status, absent a presidential waiver, it added.The list includes the use of slave labour, re-education prison camps, forced abortion or sterilisation and organ harvesting from prisoners, the release stated.Other listed abuses include religious persecution, harassment of expatriate Chinese who are critical of the government and the theft of intellectual property from Americans, according to the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-legislation-will-end-china-s-most-favoured-nation-trade-status-senator/story-wApJfcWIl96oA2Y2gsAk5I.html

The broad areas and sectors covered by private companies are providing materials, mechanical fabrication, electronic fabrication, system development, integration etc,” he added.Under the Department of Space, the government has created INSPACe to encourage, promote and handhold the private sector for their participation in the space sector. Private players will also be able to use ISRO infrastructure through INSPACe.The decision of the government was conveyed to the members of the scientific community elaborately and scientific community welcomed the government’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-allow-private-firms-to-utilise-isro-infrastructures-jitendra-singh/story-UgwToqnLfohiTX6lUOsW2J.html
18-09-2020||India||‘LAC flare-up may hit Covid efforts’: Singapore high commissioner||It is imperative for India and China to find an amicable solution to their border standoff as any flare-up of tensions could have far-reaching implications for post-Covid-19 recovery efforts across the region, Singapore’s new high commissioner Simon Wong Wie Kuen said on Thursday. Expressing concern at the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in his first interview to the Indian media after presenting his credentials last week, Wong acknowledged the two sides could be in for a “long winter” and that efforts to find a solution may not be easy, though there is no alternative to dialogue. The envoy also spoke on Singapore’s priorities in its economic relations with India, participation in New Delhi’s plans to forge resilient supply and value chains, and collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. Asked about the implications of the India-China standoff, Wong said there is a “stalemate and a stare-down situation”. He said, “It may be a long winter, it will not have an easy solution but I think the messages coming out from both sides are very calm and the operating principle is still trying to figure out something of a resolution through diplomatic means.” He added, “We are good friends of both India and China. The last thing we want is to have skirmishes grow bigger and bigger because now both sides are in a stare-down position and the troop levels of both sides are very high. We don’t want any untoward incidents happening because from the Covid-19 recovery point of view, if we have two big economic engines suffer as a result, the whole Asian economy will suffer for a prolonged period of time. “We don’t want to see that happen, we have been urging both sides to stay calm and find an amicable solution to it…But we are concerned about what’s happening in Ladakh in particular, in Pangong Tso. We hope calmer heads prevail.” Responding to a question on whether resolving the border issue will be a protracted process even if current tensions dissipate, the envoy said it is “always problematic [in] relations between…two humongous neighbours to resolve [things]”. He suggested “harsh negotiations” would be better than an exacerbation of tensions. “If you were to have harsh negotiations and you cross with words, I think it’s easier because it’s common practice, even in FTA negotiations – harsh, tough negotiation postures, but thereafter, when the deal is done, you shake hands and that’s it,” he said. “But the memory of 1962 is very, very strong because it was a military conflict…My humble advise is that both sides should think very carefully how they want to move forward and to be sure, both sides understand this very clearly...in the operating principle, both sides should sit down and talk and resolve this diplomatically,” he added. Amid the Covid19 crisis, the world being at an “inflection point” and a very “acrimonious US-China relationship”, Singapore’s priorities for the relationship with India include enhanced trade and investments and collaboration in areas such as healthcare for developing vaccines, Wong said. Even during the Covid-19 crisis, Singapore committed around $2 billion of new investments into India, and it is also keen to work with India on forging new supply and value chains, he said. “Because we came in early to India, that conversation of plugging India into our part of the world is continuing non-stop…Cumulatively, Singapore has $85 billion committed to India. On your side, you have close to $60 billion. It is an equal partnership and we have about 650 Singapore companies set up in India and about 8,500 Indian companies are set up in Singapore. That notion of supply chain security and supply chain rework is always in play,” Wong said. Wong said there will be “a competition of ideas” in the Indo-Pacific and Singapore endorses the Asean vision for the region – “which is to say we keep the waters around our region peaceful, the organisation should be inclusive and not exclusive, it should not be targeted at one or two particular countries, and the focus should be on economics, and less military”. The Indian preference, he noted, is to “have Quad, Quad-plus or trilaterals”. He added, “India is free to have conversations with like-minded parties which share same interests...I feel that down the road, India should also have a conversation with Asean on the configuration of your ideas and the Asean ideas.” Wong also spoke on Singapore’s efforts to help foreign workers, including some 100,000 Indians, affected by the pandemic. Besides free medical facilities and testing, Singapore has provided to grants to companies so that salaries are paid even when workers don’t go to work. However, as many businesses that hire foreign workers have closed down, they may be sent home and the “next step is for us to make sure that they are fairly compensated and if they intend to stay on, we will have to look for jobs for them”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-flare-up-may-hit-covid-efforts-singapore-high-commissioner/story-iQN5oFDCUuKIEgI7xdbbHN.html

The five NSAs, who joined a virtual meeting hosted by Russia, also discussed challenges and threats to global, regional and national security. Contrary to speculation, there were no bilateral discussions by the Indian and Chinese NSAs on the margins of the meeting against the backdrop of the border standoff. “This was a virtual meeting and bilateral talks are not possible in this format,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. A statement issued by the Russian side after the meeting said the five countries had prepared a draft anti-terrorism strategy that will be submitted for approval during the upcoming Brics summit. The draft strategy reflects fundamental aspects of the Brics states, such as respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, adherence to international law and recognition of the UN’s central role in security matters, the statement said. Also read: Ball in Beijing’s court: MEA on parleysThe NSAs also discussed biological security cooperation and information and communications technology security, and there was a proposal to continue work on a system for countering security threats in the sphere of information. The participants expressed concern over the escalation of tensions around Iran, Venezuela and Syria, according to the Russian statement. It added that the Brics states are cooperating within the framework of building a multi-polar system based on justice and equality. There was no official word from the Indian side on the outcomes of the meeting, which was chaired by Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s security council, and joined by Indian NSA Ajit Doval, Chinese NSA Yang Jiechi, Brazil’s M Innosencio, and South Africa’s minister of state security Ayanda Dlodlo. The Russian side also criticised the deployment of weapons in space by the US and the use of outer space for military operations. It also proposed the creation of new mechanisms in the field of countering epidemiological threats and to conduct expert consultations on bio-safety in the Brics format.

18-09-2020||India||Govt may defer Air India sale, reduce debt to sweeten the deal||The government may defer the planned sale of Air India by up to three years until the turbulence caused in the aviation industry by the Covid-19 pandemic eases, two persons aware of the development said. Another option under consideration is sweetening the deal by reducing the Air India debt liability that a prospective buyer of the airline would assume.Experts engaged in the process of divesting Air India have pointed to the lukewarm response by investors to the existing offer on the table and suggested that the government consider extending the October 30 deadline for submission of bids,reduce the debt liability of Rs 23,286 crore or allow bidders to place a value on the government’s equity stake and say how much how much debt they would assume, the two persons said on condition of anonymity. The government has already trimmed the debt liability that a buyer would need to assume by more than half. It has extended the deadline for bid submissions four times. The other options before the government is to defer the national airline’s sale by two to three years to let the investment climate improve or wind up its operations, the two persons cited above said. “The option of allowing bidders to quote both debt and equity value appears practical in the current domestic and global business environment, but a final call will be taken by the competent authority,” one of the two persons said.A group of secretaries is expected to discuss the topic again this week before the matter is referred to a ministerial panel headed by home minister Amit Shah to take a final call, the persons said. Other members of the panel, called Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM), are the ministers for finance, commerce and civil aviation.The government has already trimmed the debt liability of a potential buyer. It decided to transfer a significant portion of the total Rs 60,074 crore debt of Air India to a special purpose vehicle, Air India Assets Holding Ltd, and limited the debt exposure that a buyer would face to Rs 23,286 crore.The finance ministry and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) did not respond to email queries seeking comment.Participating in a debate on the Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Hardeep S Puri, minister of state for civil aviation, said a sale is the last resort to keep Air India alive. “Talking about privatisation of Air India, if we could help it, we would keep it, but with Rs 60,000 crore debt, the choice is not between privatisation and non-privatisation. Some of my colleagues must realise that the choice is between privatisation and closing down.”Investors’ interest has dimmed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts said. Domestic and international air traffic to and from India may decline by at least 50% in the current financial year, causing significant job losses and forcing some airlines to ground aircraft, HT reported earlier this year.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners, said: “Under normal circumstance, given the baggage, disinvestment and valuation of Air India would have been challenging, something made worse by the prolonging pandemic...“It is also important to consider additional sops and support to make sure AI remains a going concern. The other option is to cough up funds to maintain current operations, which is difficult given the fiscal pressure and the uncertain future.” According to Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, the government will be under duress to extend the deadline beyond October 30 given that there has been no submission of an expression of interest by a potential buyer. He said the operating cost of Air India is higher than that of other airlines by more than 20%.“The debt of Rs 23,000 crores is secured against the fleet. Hence the government may not be able to simply move the debts to the SPV without the underlying security. The government would most likely raise funds and pay off the debts to make the fleet debt-free,” Vijayasarathy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-defer-air-india-sale-reduce-debt-to-sweeten-the-deal/story-yCMGyKmA0S9rNygGLCp1dP.html
18-09-2020||India||Gaganyaan mission: Astronauts to undergo Isro module next year||Four astronauts selected for the country’s first human spaceflight will return from Russia in March and undergo training modules designed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) for the mission slated for December 2021. While in Russia, their training is helping them get accustomed to conditions in space — the US, Russia and China are the only three countries to have conducted human spaceflights — the four astronauts will undergo mission-specific training back home. “The four astronauts, who had been selected from a pool of Indian Air Force pilots, are currently undergoing basic training in GCTC (Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre) in Russia. They will be back by March next year. They will then receive specific training in India, for which the simulators have been defined. These are the areas where the industry will be contributing in a rich way to realise the simulators,” Dr Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Human Spaceflight Centre of Isro, said. There will be three main parts to the training in India: a module on the overall project, a module for crew members, and a module on the flight hardware and software. “Each one is more and more complex (than the previous one),” he said at the International Space Conference and Exhibition organised by Confederation of Indian Industry in association with Isro and its other arms. India’s first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, has been designed to carry three Indian astronauts to the low earth orbit — an orbit of 2,000km or less — for a period of five to seven days. But Isro chairperson Dr K Sivan told HT earlier this year that two unmanned flights prior to the final mission will determine whether just one or two crew members will be taken to space and whether the crew will be there for the entire duration, or for just one day, or just over two hours.Isro has planned the first unmanned flight in December 2020, the second in July 2021, and the first human spaceflight mission in December 2021 — much ahead of the August 15, 2022, deadline set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, the timeline could be affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to officials.Before the first unmanned flight, Isro needs to complete at least three major tests — an air drop test for the parachute system that will demonstrate the ability to successfully recover an orbiting space capsule; a flight of the test vehicle; and an abort test to demonstrate the escape of the crew in case of an emergency at the launch pad. Isro has also shortlisted six experiments that will be carried out in space aboard the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission. This includes four biological experiments – a study on changes in kidney stone formation in drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly), the study of SIRT1 gene in it, microbial contamination, and co-crystallisation under microgravity conditions.Nair said Gaganyaan will be the first of Isro’s human spaceflight mission, which will be expanded to the exploration of other planets and also the moon in the future. For this, Isro will partner with the industry and academia to develop technologies such as construction in space, tele-robotics and artificial intelligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaganyaan-mission-astronauts-to-undergo-isro-module-next-year/story-t4FPl0e2b7sLMgqyJ6QoyH.html
18-09-2020||India||Opposition parties snub Congress in joint protest over GST||Eight regional parties on Thursday did not invite the Congress to take part in a joint protest against the government over the Goods and Services Tax (GST) dues that the Centre owes to states. Leaders belonging to the Trinamool Congress, Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Samajwadi Party (SP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena gathered near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the Parliament House complex to seek immediate release of compensation for a shortfall in their share of GST collections. Out of these eight parties, NCP, Shiv Sena, DMK and RJD are the Congress’s allies in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Bihar respectively. The Congress, along with the NCP and Shiv Sena, is part of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance in Maharashtra.The move is being seen as a setback to the Opposition’s bid to put up a united front against the Centre in Parliament during the ongoing monsoon session. The leaders who participated in the protest were Derek O’Brien and Kalyan Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, K Keshava Rao from the TRS, RJD’s Manoj Jha, AAP’s Sanjay Singh; Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav of the SP, NCP’s Supriya Sule; TR Baalu and TKS Elangovan from the DMK, and Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena. When asked why the Congress wasn’t invited, party spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “This is something that those parties should answer. As far as the Congress is concerned, we consistently raise from all platforms the issues that affect the everyday lives of every single Indian.”Asked why they did not call the Congress for the protest, a leader of a regional party said the TRS and the AAP were not comfortable sharing space with the party. Watch: Opposition parties protest in Parliament over GST dues Addressing reporters after the protest, O’Brien said: “It is increasingly becoming clear to us that in Parliament, the regional parties are finding it easier to coordinate with each other to strategise. The Congress can no longer decide the subject and then the dosage of opposition strategy. They cannot do something in states and seek support in Parliament.” Echoing his views, Banerjee said that the Congress teams up with the BJP in Bengal to attack the Mamata Banerjee government and then expects cooperation in Delhi. “All (the regional) parties are strong in their respective regions and are very comfortable working with each other.” The immediate trigger for the stand of the TMC appears to be the appointment of a known baiter of CM Mamata Banerjee, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, as the West Bengal Congress president. In his first press conference in Kolkata, Chowdhury attacked the “totalitarian regime” of the Trinamool Congress. The move also was in contrary to an understanding reached between key leaders at a virtual meeting called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on August 26 to discuss the issues of GST compensation and holding entrance exams in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from four Congress chief ministers, Captain Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry), the chief ministers of West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee), Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray) and Jharkhand (Hemant Soren) attended the meeting. The Congress did not invite chief ministers of Odisha (Naveen Patnaik), Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal), Andhra Pradesh (YS Jaganmohan Reddy), Telangana (K Chandrasekhar Rao) and Kerala (Pinarayi Vijayan). All the leaders agreed to work closely to take on the central government in and outside Parliament. AAP leader Sanjay Singh said the eight parties will have more joint meetings in the coming days. The protest came ahead of a scheduled discussion on GST in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-snub-congress-in-joint-protest-over-gst/story-UbASEiO59LmQ3Ap7QED57L.html
18-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Maharashtra is a clear outlier in terms of how it has been affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It ended Wednesday with 1.12 million cases – it is the province with the most cases in the world – and 30,883 deaths, according to the HT dashboard. Its cumulative positivity rate is still 20%. On Wednesday, its positivity rate was 24%. For six months to the day, the western state has topped India’s daily Covid numbers in terms of daily cases. For much of this period, it has also topped the daily death tally. On Wednesday alone, it accounted for 474 of the 1,139 deaths in the country (41.6%), and 23,365 of the 97,932 cases (23.8%).It isn’t clear why Maharashtra has been ravaged by the disease. Sure, Mumbai, India’s commercial capital, has among the highest population densities in the world, as also some of the largest slums, but many of Maharashtra’s social and health metrics are better than those of the so-called BIMARU states. New York state, similar to Maharashtra in some ways (just as NYC is similar to Mumbai) was similarly roiled by the virus, but not as persistently as the Indian state. Cases in the US state peaked in early April, and have been fewer than 1,000 a day for the past three months (and a bit). It is the kind of thing the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research should be investigating. It isn’t clear why they aren’t doing so -- understanding what’s happening in Maharashtra may help us learn how to fight the virus better. Both the urban and rural parts of Maharashtra have been affected – the former more than the latter, but that’s true of India as well – and every large city in the state has been hit hard. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMaharashtra has never tested enough. It has so far carried out 5.5 million tests. That translates into a little over 45,000 tests per million, but given the scale of the crisis in the state, it should be doing more. Its positivity rate is yet to traverse the trajectory seen in most countries – an increase with more testing, then a plateau, and finally a decline. Given the numbers, it is also likely that Maharashtra’s contact-tracing process isn’t very effective – although it’s not clear to what extent this could have made things better in a state where the virus has been in community transmission mode for months. But neither of these adequately explains the scale of the crisis in Maharashtra.Demographics could offer an explanation – but the state isn’t very demographically different from the rest of India. Sure, Maharashtra is home to 10.7% of the country’s population of people over the age of 60 (a group vulnerable to Covid-19); 9.9% of its population is over the age of 60, but this proportion is higher in Kerala, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh.So could genetics – except the genetic profile of the Maharashtra population isn’t markedly different from the Indian population as a whole, although previous studies have established that it (expectedly) bears more similarity with south Indian populations rather than central Indian ones.Also read: What these new Covid-19 figures reveal about MaharashtraThat leaves two other factors. The first is Maharashtrian society, culture and living conditions in the state. The second is the state’s response to the pandemic. On the second, there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that Maharashtra’s government was either more proactive or less proactive than administrations in other Indian states in managing the disease. And on the first, we simply do not know enough, although it is a fact that, at least in Mumbai, social distancing isn’t possible and that cases in the state have seen a renewed surge after the recent Ganesh Chaturthi festival.And so, Maharashtra’s numbers will have to remain a mystery for now – the rare instance of an early hot spot of the coronavirus disease continuing to be one six months into the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-WC1vsrRvkq2AJdYWe4ZBQP.html
18-09-2020||India||Do falling farmer suicides mean less rural distress?||The number of farmers committing suicide has been decreasing for four consecutive years and last year it was the lowest in 25 years. Farmer suicides are often seen as an indicator of economic distress among farmers. But these numbers do not show us the full picture. A look at four reasons why this may be.1. Total suicides going down At least 10,281 people engaged in farming committed suicide in 2019, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which works under the ministry of home affairs. This is the lowest figure since 1995, the earliest year for which the number is available. The decline in the number of farmers’ suicides marks the continuation of a trend since 2016. Farmers’ suicides have often been seen as the most macabre reflection of what many believe is a growing crisis of viability in Indian agriculture. India’s farms employ more than 40% of its 400 million plus workforce, while its share in Gross Value Added (GVA) has fallen below 15%. GVA is the value of goods and services produced by the country minus the cost of inputs and raw materials , Do the falling farmers’ suicide numbers capture an improvement in the material well-being of India’s farmers? Activists and experts believe that the official numbers suffer from underreporting. The fact that the NCRB has discontinued the practice of giving the share of farmers’ suicides because of economic distress has only added to the confusion.2. Suicides among cultivators did not decrease in 2019 The headline farmer suicide numbers includes both farmers who cultivate crops on their owned or leased land as well as agricultural labourers who work on farms for a wage. The NCRB started giving this break-up in 2014. Except in 2014, the number of suicides by cultivators has always been greater than the number of agricultural workers. Also, most of the fall in headline farmers’ suicide numbers has happened because of a fall in the number of suicides by agricultural workers. Suicides by cultivators actually went up from 5,763 to 5,957 between 2018 and 2019. Even as the number of suicides by agricultural labourers has shown a decreasing trend over the last six years, suicides among daily wage earners – the main difference between the two is that the former work in agricultural fields – has been constantly increasing in this period, from about 15,700 in 2014 to nearly 32,600 in 2019. 3. States underreport data Many large states report no farmer suicides, according to the NCRB data. In 2019, for instance, 5,957 farmer (cultivator) suicides were reported from 17 states and union territories while 19 others did not report any. At least a third of the farmer suicides were reported by just three states – Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Nine states have not reported a single suicide by cultivators in last six years. These include states such as Bihar and West Bengal. On the other hand, 12 states have reported farmer suicides every year in the last six years. 4. Reason of suicides not known There has always been a debate on whether farmers’ suicides are the result of economic distress or something else. For example, a 2015 Rajya Sabha reply by the then agriculture minister, Radha Mohan Singh, listed love affairs and impotency along with economic distress as the reasons driving farmers’ suicides; expectedly, his reply triggered a huge controversy (https://bit.ly/3h9C1Kn). This debate was somewhat settled when NCRB published data on reasons for suicides among farmers in 2014 and 2015. The 2014 and 2015 numbers showed that farmers were more likely to commit suicide due to economic reasons than others. Of the cultivators who killed themselves in 2015, an overwhelming 59% did so for reasons such as poverty, farming-related issues and bankruptcy or indebtedness. Among agricultural labourers, only about 9% killed themselves for these reasons. Among all persons who committed suicide, 4.5% killed themselves for these reasons. NCRB has stopped giving data on the reason of suicides among farmers since 2016. Vijoo Krishnan, leader of the All India Kisan Sabha, the farmers’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said the organisation has details of farmers who killed themselves in several states that have officially reported no farmer suicides in recent years. “Actually there is a gross underreporting. Comrades in Bengal and Bihar informed us that many farmers committed suicide there last year but the official data shows no suicide,” he said, adding: “Even in states which have reported a large number of suicides, the actual number of suicides is higher.” Krishnan said it was also possible that some of the farmers were being classified as daily wage earners in the NCRB reports. “When poor farmers are in extreme distress, they work as agricultural workers or as daily wage workers.” Agriculture specialist Devinder Sharma said many farmer unions have been contesting the data reported by the states. “States want to present a good image that they are actively taking steps to address agrarian distress,” he said, adding: “A lower number of farmer suicides officially reported by states gives an impression that things are improving in the states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-falling-farmer-suicides-mean-less-rural-distress/story-zTjZSXixRTleFZmPnylTRI.html
18-09-2020||India||Pleas against lawmakers: HC special bench to monitor cases||Criminal trials involving elected representatives will now be monitored by a special bench of each high court and in cases where a trial has been stayed, the special bench will hear and decide on continuing or cancelling the stay, preferably within two months.An order to this effect was passed on Wednesday by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) that seeks to fast-track pending criminal trials involving sitting and former legislators.“Ensuring the purity of democratically elected institutions is the hallmark of the present proceedings,” a three-judge bench headed by justice NV Ramana said. “Such special consideration (to expedite cases against legislators) was required not only because of the rising wave of criminalization that was occurring in the politics in the country, but also due to the power that elected representatives wield to influence or hamper effective prosecution.” The bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy, said: “The chief justices of the high courts shall also designate a special bench, comprising themselves and their designate, in order to monitor the progress of these trials.”A court- appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court), senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, in two reports submitted on September 8 and 15, highlighted that despite the best efforts by the court to constitute special courts for trying cases against legislators, close to 4,442 criminal cases involving 2,556 sitting members of Parliament (MP) and members of legislative assemblies (MLAs) were pending. Reasons for trial getting delayed included stays granted by various high courts, insufficient special courts to exclusively try cases against MPs/MLAs, a shortage of prosecutors and latches in prosecution, and lastly, delayed investigation.The top court bench headed by Ramana requested high court chief justices to list all pending cases involving MPs/MLAs (sitting and former) where a stay has been granted and asked the special benches to decide “whether the stay granted should continue”. This exercise is to be completed within a period of two months, the bench said. The bench held that the present Covid-19 situation should not be grounds to adjourn the cases because they can also be heard through video conferencing.The action plan to be prepared by the concerned chief justices in two weeks will provide a blueprint after assessing the existing number of cases vis-à-vis number of special courts, the need for special courts and adequacy of infrastructure in the state, number of judicial officers, the maximum cases to be assigned per judicial officer, distance of the designated court from the districts where cases are pending, and expected time for disposal of cases.In his reports, Hansaria suggested adding more special courts, one in each district, with a dedicated judicial officer who should decide the cases within one year. Any stay granted by a high courts must either go or be decided on speedily, he said. Based on these suggestions, the bench passed a slew of directions to the high courts asking them to prepare an action plan on expediting the existing pending cases in each district and constitute special bench to monitor the trials.The apex court also sought a status report from solicitor general Tushar Mehta on the stage of investigation pending against MPs/MLAs in cases probed by central agencies such as Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate. There are 175 cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and 14 cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act pending against sitting/former MPs and MLAs.The court, in its order, directed Mehta to indicate the status with regard to grant of sanction for prosecution, reasons for delays and expected time for completing the trials/investigations in the report to be presented by the next date of hearing, expected to be October 1.Mehta had submitted on Wednesday that the Centre supports a time-bound completion of trials pending against legislators. The law officer submitted, “Appropriate action would be taken by the nodal departments against any officer responsible for unreasonable delay.”Advocate Sneha Kalita, assisting the amicus curiae, said: “Having more special courts functioning under strict vigilance of designated special bench of high courts will certainly go a long way to expedite trials in cases against elected representatives. This was suggested by the amicus curiae too. The court has also sought information from CBI, ED on status of grant of sanction to prosecute legislators. This will help investigations in cases against MPs/MLAs to be time-bound.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pleas-against-lawmakers-hc-special-bench-to-monitor-cases/story-7NGSQkPnRjU991Jb3vkiRL.html
18-09-2020||India||Digital media may require regulation, TV doesn’t: Govt||The Union government on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to refrain from laying down guidelines to regulate electronic media such as television channels, but if the court does embark on the process, suggested that it should first be undertaken for digital media including web portals and YouTube channels.In an affidavit filed on Thursday before a bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud, the Centre said that electronic media was already governed by laws made by Parliament and previous judgments delivered by the top court.This court may not undertake the exercise of laying down any further guidelines… it is desirable that if this court decides to undertake the exercise, it should first be undertaken with regard to digital media, as there already exists sufficient framework and judicial pronouncements with regard to electronic media and print media,” the government submitted.The affidavit was filed in the case against television (TV) channel Sudarshan News, which came into the limelight after it telecast a show called “Bindas Bol” relating to the entry of Muslims in the civil services.The top court on September 15 barred further telecast of the controversial programme and took strong exception to the contents of the show, observing that the first four episodes gave an impression that it was being aired with the insidious objective of vilifying the Muslim community and to bring it into disrepute.The bench, which also comprises justices KM Joseph and Indu Malhotra, also expressed an inclination to hold a detailed hearing to decide on regulation of TV news channels and suggested the appointment of a committee of five distinguished citizens to frame standards for regulation of the electronic media.In its affidavit, the Centre submitted that no such exercise needs to be undertaken merely based on few episode of one channel, Sudarshan News.“Even if this court considers it appropriate to undertake the said exercise, there is no justification to confine this exercise only to mainstream electronic media. Digital media has faster reach from wider range of viewership / readership and has the potential to become viral because of several electronic applications like Whatsapp, Twitter (and) Facebook,” the affidavit stated.The case will be taken up for hearing on Friday.Meanwhile, Sudarshan News filed its response in the matter on Wednesday defending the programme and the use of the term “UPSC Jihad” in the programme.The Noida-based channel maintained that it has no ill will against any particular community or individual, and does not oppose selection of any meritorious candidate. The programme, it claimed, was intended to highlight the allegedly dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organisation with links that supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants.“The issue the court had sought reply from the Central government was as to whether the specific programme in Sudarshan TV using specific expressions like ‘UPSC Jihad’ was permissible under the present legal framework and if not, what guidelines are required to be framed to avoid this occurrence in future. In this regard, the counter-affidavit appears to be evasive if not supportive of the broadcast of the programme in question. The question as to whether digital media has to be regulated or not was a non-issue before the court and ought not to have been gone into,” Supreme Court advocate Sriram Parakkat told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-media-may-require-regulation-tv-doesn-t-govt/story-NIZDasJ44lW5elOyrVHuZP.html
18-09-2020||India||AG denies nod for contempt case over Rajdeep Sardesai tweet||Attorney General (AG) KK Venugopal on Thursday declined to grant permission for initiation of criminal contempt of court proceedings against journalist Rajdeep Sardesai for his tweets criticising the Supreme Court’s handling of the contempt of court case against lawyer Prashant Bhushan.Sardesai’s tweets were not of a serious nature so as to undermine the majesty of the court or lower its stature in the mind of the public, Venugopal said in his letter to advocate Om Prakash Parihar, who was representing the petitioner, Astha Khurana.“The reputation of the Supreme Court as one of the great pillars of our democracy has been built assiduously over the last 70 years. Trifling remarks and mere passing criticism though perhaps distasteful are unlikely to tarnish the image of the institution,” AG said in his letter.As per Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, the consent of AG or the solicitor general is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by a private individual.“Satyamev Jayate [Truth always wins]!thank you to guardians of the law and constitution,” Sardesai tweeted. This is the second instance in recent weeks when Venugopal has declined consent for initiation of contempt of court proceedings.On August 23, he rejected permission to a petitioner from Karnataka seeking initiation of criminal contempt of court proceedings against Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker for her statements criticising the top court and its judgment in the Ayodhya dispute.In the Prashant Bhushan case -- where the top court, on its own, initiated criminal contempt of court proceedings against the activist-lawyer for two tweets -- the Centre’s top law officer urged the court not to impose any punishment on Bhushan.Venugopal appeared in that case in his personal capacity at the court’s request. “Your Lordships should reprimand him and tell him not to repeat it in future. But do not punish him. It will be greatly appreciated at the Bar. That will be a fitting end to this case,” he said on August 20. Khurana, who hails from Panipat in Haryana, highlighted multiple tweets by Sardesai to buttress her case for initiation of contempt proceedings against him.On August 14, the day Bhushan was convicted for contempt of court, Sardesai had tweeted, “Prashant Bhushan held guilty of contempt by Supreme Court, sentence to be pronounced on August 20. This even as habeas corpus petitions of those detained in Kashmir for more than a year remain pending.”Later when the top court imposed a sentence of Re 1 on Bhushan on August 31, Sardesai posted the following tweet: “Rs 1 token fine imposed by SC on Prashant Bhushan in contempt case. If he doesn’t pay it, then 3 months jail sentence. Clearly, court looking to wriggle out of an embarrassment of its own making.”Khurana also referred to older tweets in which Sardesai allegedly cast aspersions on justice Arun Mishra, who had heard Prashant Bhushan’s contempt case, and former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi.“I do not find any warrant for initiation of proceedings for criminal contempt. I accordingly decline consent,” AG stated in his letter..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-denies-nod-for-contempt-case-over-rajdeep-sardesai-tweet/story-RG7HzeadrMDochtH2qZlVM.html
18-09-2020||India||Pakistan plans a change in Gilgit-Baltistan status||The Pakistan government plans to make Gilgit-Baltistan the country’s fifth province, two years after powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for the region were transferred to a local assembly. The government’s plans were outlined by the federal minister for Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan affairs, Ali Amin Gandapur, during an interaction with a group of journalists in Islamabad on Wednesday. He said the region will be accorded the status of a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of Parliament. Prime Minister Imran Khan is expected to visit the region soon and make a formal announcement about the change, Gandapur was quoted as saying in reports in the Pakistani media. “After consultation with all stakeholders, the federal government has decided in principle to give constitutional rights to Gilgit-Baltistan,” he said. “Our government has decided to deliver on the promise it made to the people there.” There was no immediate reaction to the minister’s remarks from Indian officials, though New Delhi has consistently opposed changes made in the disputed region by the Pakistan government. India claims Gilgit-Baltistan as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Gandapur also said that subsidies and tax exemptions for the region wouldn’t be withdrawn after the grant of constitutional rights. “Until the people there stand on their feet, they will continue to enjoy this facility,” he said. Also read: After Senate defeats, Pak govt passes all FATF-linked bills via joint sessionPeople familiar with developments said the Pakistani military establishment had been in touch with political parties regarding the changes. Khan’s ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party is backing the changes with an eye on upcoming elections in Gilgit-Baltistan so that it can make political gains and form the next government in the region. Gandapur said the elections were likely to be held in mid-November. Preparations had been completed and the distribution of tickets by the PTI will begin soon, he added. He contended that the “deprivation” faced by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan for 73 years would end with the change. Besides constitutional rights and a provincial setup, important steps are being taken for developing the region, he said. This includes work on Moqpondass special economic zone under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and steps to improve health care, tourism, transport and education, he said. In 1999, Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled that the people of Gilgit-Baltistan are Pakistani citizens and directed the federal government to start appropriate administrative and legislative measures. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order was introduced, whereby the Northern Areas were renamed as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in Parliament. In 2015, a committee constituted by the federal government proposed giving Gilgit-Baltistan the status of a province, and three years later, a new order transferred all powers of the local council to the local assembly. The people cited above said any move to give the region the status of a full-fledged province would be welcomed by local residents. Some stakeholders had suggested the region should be provisionally given the status of a province and it should be made a full province only after the Kashmir issue is resolved, the people said. Though the proposal made by the committee in 2015 didn’t go through because it didn’t have the blessings of the security establishment, it appears that the Pakistan Army has had a change of heart in view of the changes in Jammu and Kashmir since August last year, the people further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-plans-a-change-in-gilgit-baltistan-status/story-jxshC3dBmBsUgP9FPWjvUK.html
18-09-2020||India||Road accidents in India down by 35% this year||The number of road accidents in the first six months of the year (January to June) were around 1,60,000, 35% less than the average number of accidents reported in the corresponding period in the previous six years, an obvious result of a nationwide lockdown imposed in March to slow the spread of the Covid-19 infection. The number of people who died also dropped by 30% this year.The information on the accidents was provided by the government in Parliament on Thursday.On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019. The month-wise breakup of accidents for the previous years is from annual reports on road accidents published by the ministry of road transport and highways, and annual reports on accidental deaths and suicides published by the ministry of home affairs. (See chart 1) There was a drop in the number of road accidents between 2019 and 2020 in all states and union territories except three small northeastern states – Meghalaya, Sikkim and Nagaland. Among big states, the largest percentage drop in the number of road accidents was seen in Karnataka (48%). Delhi reported a 46% drop in accidents this year. (See chart 2) The 68-day long nationwide lockdown imposed in the last week of March, reduced traffic and mobility in the months of April and May. Even in June, many parts of the country were under localised lockdowns, and many business, merchant and recreational establishments continued to be closed. The number of accidents from April to June this year (50,336) was 55% less than the corresponding number last year (1,12,215).In terms of fatalities in road accidents, 56,288 people died in the first six months of this year compared to 79,678 in the same period last year, a drop of about 30%.In the April to June period, the number of fatalities in road accidents dropped by nearly 51% compared to the same period in 2019, which is about 20,000 less fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-accidents-down-35-this-year/story-31f6RBO5unpQGQ8G1asurL.html
18-09-2020||India||Soon, like flight fares, train fares to include ‘user charge’ at redeveloped, high footfall stations||The Indian Railways will soon start levying ‘user fees’ as part of train fares for the stations that have been redeveloped and those with high footfall in order to generate revenue to provide better facilities for passengers, Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav said Thursday.Once it comes into effect, it will be for the first time that such charges are levied on rail passengers. Yadav said the charges will be nominal and will be applicable in about 10-15 per cent of the 7,000 railway stations across the country.“We are going to keep a very small amount for the user charge. We will issue a notification for the user charge for all stations including both those that are getting redeveloped and those that are not,” the chairman said. “When the redevelopment of the stations gets completed, the money will go to the concessionaires. Till then that money will go to the railways for improving facilities across stations. It will be an affordable amount, but it is important to levy if we want to provide world class facilities similar to the airport development. We want to upgrade all our major railway stations,” Yadav said. He further said the Railways will not levy the charge across all the 7,000 stations but all major stations where the footfall of passengers will increase over the next five years. “It will be done in about 10-15% of all our stations where we expect the footfall to increase,” he added. The statement comes in the backdrop of concerns raised over potential rise in the prices of ticket fares with private entities being allowed to run trains in the country. “I believe that competency will ensure that eventually the prices of both passenger and freight fares will decrease in due course,” said Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.The Railways has plans to redevelop 50 railway stations and monetize its land. The redeveloped hubs will be called ‘Railopolis’, according to the Railways. It will lease the land out for 60 years for commercial purposes. “We want Railways to drive India’s growth story. In countries like Japan and South Korea the growth story was also driven by railway infrastructure. We are confident that going forward, the railways will contribute 1-2% towards India’s growth,” Kant said. The policy think-tank Niti Aayog had earlier in October pulled up the Railways for delayed implementation of the Centre’s plans for redevelopment of stations. Niti Aayog had recommended an empowered group of top bureaucrats to develop 50 stations on priority basis.The scheme to redevelop stations was first announced in 2016 wherein 400 such stations were planned to be completely overhauled, the cost for which was to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the stations.On the Railways’ plans to allow private operators to run a certain number of trains in the country, Kant said, “The focus is Make in India. Even the global companies that participate in this will have to follow the Make in India norms by DPIIT. This will bring in manufacturing capacity in India. When Alstom and Bombardier can manufacture metro trains in India then why can’t trains be manufactured. Everything will be set up in India”.The Indian Railway Station Redevelopment Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) the implementing agency of the station redevelopment project earlier handed over two railway stations -- Habibganj in Madhya Pradesh and Gandhinagar in Gujarat -- to private parties for development under public-private partnership plans to complete both by December 2020.While 94.05 per cent civil work has already been completed at the Gandhinagar railway station, the project at Habibganj is now 90 per cent complete.Additionally, engineering, procurement and construction contracts have been awarded and commercial tenders floated for development of three stations – Anand Vihar, Bijwasan and Chandigarh.Requests for qualification were invited in December 2019 for developing Amritsar, Nagpur, Gwalior and Sabarmati stations, and 32 applications were received till June 26, 2020, out of which 29 were shortlisted.The IRSDC has also taken up five stations for developing integrated facility management and 90 more are in the pipeline. The agency is now working on Mumbai’s CST station and the New Delhi Railway Station in the Capital.The modernisation of stations includes developing/re-developing the new/existing railway stations and upgrading passenger amenities by new constructions/renovations.It allows re-development of the station buildings, platform surfaces, circulating area to better standards so as to serve the need of the passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-like-flight-fares-train-fares-to-include-user-charge-at-redeveloped-high-footfall-stations/story-mWTPenXkUFeRSTR0J5ohaM.html
18-09-2020||India||Legislation for reforms in agriculture sector passed by Lok Sabha||The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed two farm bills that bring far-reaching, liberalising reforms to the agriculture sector, one to free up agricultural trade from all restrictions and the other to provide a new framework for contract farming. The bills seek to open up the farm sector to more competition, modernise supply chains by enabling bigger agribusinesses to engage with farmers more directly and create seamless access to markets, which are currently fragmented. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which replace similar ordinances, were passed by a majority in the lower house through a voice vote. The ordinances that will be replaced by the bills bring the full force of liberalisation to the farm economy. They were first announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 15 in the second of her series of briefings on proposed reforms, following up on the May 12 announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of a package worth Rs 20 lakh crore to spur growth. Major parties that opposed the bills were the main opposition Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Siromani Akali Dal, Samajwadi Party, the Trinamool Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Left parties, Nationalist Congress Party, the Indian Union Muslim League and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Also read: Harsimrat Kaur ejects out of Cabinet over farm bills, her party stays in NDAThe Biju Janata Dal demanded the bills be sent to select committees. Shiv Sena supported the bills, but recommended changes. Parties that supported the bills included the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telugu Desam Party, the Janata Dal (United) and YSR Congress Party. The main provisions of the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 allow barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of primary agricultural commodities. Farm produce, under a decades-old system, are sold mainly in notified wholesale markets run by so-called agricultural produce marketing committees, or APMCs, under state laws. The APMCs require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in these notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits. The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these tax-free markets and will therefore open up APMCs to competition. The bill will enable food traders to buy farmers’ produce from any market, rather than bind them to the specific markets where they are licensed to operate. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 lays down a new architecture for contract farming. It provides for a national framework on farming agreements, enabling a farmer to engage with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a mutually pre-agreed price. “I am happy that everybody expressed their views on the bills. Some have opposed it, some supported. I want to say this with great responsibility; till Narendra Modi is Prime Minister, our farmers’ interests will be kept supreme,” farm minister Narendra Tomar said, replying to the debate. “Please take off your politician’s lens and view the bills through the lens of a farmer.”Also read| ‘System of MSP, govt procurement retained’: PM assures farmers after passage of agricultural reform billsHe slammed the Congress, asking why it’s government never acted on the Swaminathan commission’s recommendations to give farmers 1.5 times over costs in the form of support prices. In his right to reply, the Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “Show me one farmer who is happy over this bills. Haryana and Punjab are on fire.” “I appreciate the sentiments of Harsimrat Kaur (the minister who resigned from Modi Cabinet) who had the gumption to oppose the bills. These bills are no silver bullet.” Parties opposing the bill accused the government of intruding into states’ jurisdiction and taking advantage of the Covid pandemic to introduce “anti-farmer legislations”. “Had there been no corona, farmers’ anger would have been visible in the streets , who does the BJP stand with, foreign investors, Adani-Ambani, dhanna seth (moneyed traders) or farmers?” asked Ritesh Pandey of the Bahujan Samaj Party, registering the opposition of party chief Kumari Mayawati. Despite the political bickering, reforms in “agricultural marketing” or the buying and selling of farm produce have been a long time in the making. Various government panels and economists have often argued for changing existing structures of agricultural trade that are highly fragmented. “Ultimately these so-called reforms are going to lead to replication of old structures outside mandis. Creating two market spaces with two completely different sets of rules is a recipe for disaster,” said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture “Government will not come to know anything about transactions in these new markets. Not knowing will give the excuse not to act. Farmers fear this, rightly so,” she said. Economists said some concerns of farmers were valid and the solution was to bring appropriate regulation and oversight. “Ultimately, when we open up the market, we need to open it up in a substantive way. What we need is a market-clearing mechanism. The solution is to have effective regulation,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the Bengaluru Dr. BR Ambedkar School of Economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legislation-for-reforms-in-agri-sector-passed-by-ls/story-9CkWrFweJ6tMU0hiCdSyTI.html
18-09-2020||India||Harsimrat Kaur Badal quits Cabinet over farm bills||Minister of food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet on Thursday after the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) opposed legislation seeking to liberalise agricultural markets, exposing a rift between the party and its long-time ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on reforms in the farm sector. The party continues to be a part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). While announcing SAD’s decision to withdraw its only representative from the Narendra Modi Cabinet, her husband and party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said the party will continue to support the government and the BJP, but will oppose “anti-farmer policies”. “These bills have many provisions that go against farmers’ interests. We have repeatedly asked the government that please address the apprehensions of farmers, but the government had done nothing. Therefore, I oppose these bills,” Sukhbir Singh Badal, the MP from Ferozpur, said in Lok Sabha during the debate on the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which replace similar ordinances. SAD had been asking the Centre not to go ahead with the three agriculture-related bills for approval of Parliament “until all reservations expressed by farmers’ organisations, farmers and farm labourers” are addressed. Though the new measures -- aimed at freeing up farm trade from restrictions, at guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices, and at laying down a new architecture for contract farming -- have been hailed by economists, farmer groups fear that they will lead to exploitation by big food-trading monopolies.“I have resigned from Union Cabinet in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation. Proud to stand with farmers as their daughter and sister,” Harsimrat Kaur Badal wrote in a Twitter message.In a statement, she said the move would be a “normal course of action for any Akali,” stressing that “SAD can’t be a party to anything anti-farmer” and that the trust of farmers in the party was “sacred to us.”On September 12, SAD formally asked the Centre not to enact the three farm ordinances during the monsoon session of Parliament, which began two days later. On Tuesday, Sukhbir Badal voted against the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha, saying the proposed legislation was “against the interests of farmers”. “The legislations will affect the entire procurement system. It is not just about mandis. It doesn’t take into {account the} realities of our farm sector,” Badal said, opposing the bills on Thursday.The new changes say that the government can invoke the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) ,1955, only if retail prices rise 50% in case of non-perishables and 100% in the case of perishable items from the average retail prices in the preceding 12 months or last five years. SAD was a party of farmers, Badal said. The Centre would have done better to organise a meeting with farmers before moving ahead with the bills and adequately address their concerns, he said. The Congress government in Punjab had passed a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha against the ordinances, prompting SAD to fiercely oppose the bills after initially supporting them. SAD’s core committee issued a press release saying it had met farmers’ organisations to listen to their views. “Farmers are against these bills because it would make them vulnerable,” Badal said. Farmers are already protesting these ordinances in food bowl states such as Haryana and Punjab, and influential farmers’ unions are also preparing to square off with the government on the demand of making profitable sales in the form of minimum support prices, or MSPs, a legal right. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella group of nearly 200 farmers’ groups, has opposed the bills. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh is also unhappy with the ordinances. It demanded safeguards for the farming community, and so has the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Farmer groups said they feared the new changes would lead to big monopolies. This would be just as bad as current cartelisation in mandis known as agricultural produce market committees (APMCs), they said. “We want the ordinances to be signed into law with appropriate safeguards, such as a national portal of farm trade corporations,” said Mohini Mohan Mishra, all-India secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/badal-quits-cabinet-over-farm-bills/story-doN5dPg1TwiUchcswdZJ8I.html
18-09-2020||India||‘Nearly 80% of Covid-19 deaths in Kanpur due to co-morbidities in patients’: Report||As many as 78 percent of those who died in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, while undergoing Covid-19 treatment succumbed to other diseases (co-morbidities), which the virus aggravated, medical experts found during an audit of Covid-19 related fatalities in the city. The district administration commissioned the audit on the directives of the state government.Dr SK Gautam, head of the death audit team, said co-morbidities had emerged as a key factor behind the deaths. It was clear that the patients had other ailments before getting infected, he added.“Their immunity level kept going down. They were fighting their ailments and this virus at the same time and died as a result,” he said.Kanpur has reported 554 deaths since April and the team has audited 428 of these cases. It found that 336 of these deaths were the result of co-morbidities in patients.In 60 percent of cases, the team concluded that diabetes, pneumonia, hypertension or acute respiratory distress syndrome were responsible for the deaths. Cancer, kidney, heart and gastro related ailments contributed to the other deaths, according to the audit team.Also read: ‘Yoga in burqa’ - Uttarakhand boxer girl fights all odds to teach yoga to womenCovid-19 claimed the lives of 78 youths. People between 12-50 years largely passed away due to delayed treatment. They received treatment at home for their symptoms, got their Covid-19 test done late and reached the hospitals at a late stage, the team concluded. By that time they reached the hospital, the virus had already infected their lungs considerably, impairing their functioning, the team observed. As a result, the oxygen saturation level recorded in most of the cases was below 40 at the time of their admission to the hospital, they said.Nine of the patients were anaemic and their haemoglobin level was found to be below 7. Five patients were injured in road accidents and tested positive for Covid-19 on being admitted to the hospital.Dr Richa Giri, superintendent in chief of Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, which is a level-3 Covid-19 facility, said delay in seeking specialized medical help and admission in hospital was also a key reason.“On finding symptoms, people should not wait. They should get themselves tested instantly,” she said.The audit was necessitated following the high Covid-19 mortality rate in Kanpur. Initially, the deaths were reported from the L3 (level 3) hospitals and later a large number of fatalities was recorded from the L2 Covid-19 facilities. The audit team, however, did not mention the non-shifting of patients to L3 hospitals from L2 hospitals as the reason for deaths.The L3 hospitals did not have any space left for the new patients. Besides, another facility of 160 ICU beds—30 of them with ventilators—was delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-80-of-covid-19-deaths-in-kanpur-due-to-co-morbidities-in-patients-report/story-UR3WjexyDH4Q11exFkR7yI.html
18-09-2020||India||Railways to levy user fee as part of train fares soon||Indian Railways will soon start levying a user fee as part of train fares, seeking to raise funds for redeveloping railway stations and modernizing infrastructure to attract investments, Railway Board CEO VK Yadav said on Thursday. The user fee to be levied by the national transporter for the first time is in line with the user development fee (UDF) paid by air passengers. UDF is charged at various airports and the rate varies from city to city. Railways plans to levy the user fee across nearly 700-1000 railway stations. “We are going to keep a very small amount for the user charge,” railway board CEO VK Yadav said at a press conference, adding that it would be levied at stations that are being redeveloped as well as those that are not. “When the redevelopment of the stations gets completed, the money will go to the concessionaires; till then that money will go to the railways for improving facilities across stations. It will be an affordable amount, but it is important to levy if we want to provide world-class facilities similar to the airport developments. We want to upgrade all our major railway stations,” Yadav. About 10-15% of India’s 7,000 railway stations where the state-run transporter exporter expects higher traffic over the next five years will be covered by the new levy, he added. The proposal comes in the backdrop of a government plan to attract private investment to the national carrier. Railways plans to redevelop 50 railway stations and monetize its land. The redeveloped hubs will be called Railopolis. Indian Railways will lease the land out for 60 years for commercial purposes. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who was also present in the press conference, said private investment in Indian Railways will introduce competition and lead to fare reductions in the future. “We want railways to drive India’s growth story. In countries like Japan and South Korea the growth story was also driven by railway infrastructure. We are confident going forward that railways will contribute 1-2% towards India’s growth,” Kant said. “It is like when private banks were set up in India. So many private players came into the banking sector. But that didn’t lead SBI {State Bank of India} to shut. Private investment will bring in newer technologies. It will create competition in the railway sector. Competition will increase efficiency and reduce fares in the long run, “ he said. Apex policy think-tank Niti Aayog had, in October, pulled up the ministry of railways for delayed implementation of the government plan. Niti Aayog recommended that an empowered group of top bureaucrats be constituted to redevelop 50 stations on a priority basis. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had in 2016 announced a plan to redevelop 400 railway stations during its first term. The cost of station redevelopment was to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and space in and around the stations. The railway ministry has also begun the process of allowing private companies to run trains on 109 routes, opening up one of one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy. “The focus is Make in India, even the global companies that participate in this will have to follow the Make in India norms by DPIIT. This will bring in manufacturing capacity...When Alstom and Bombardier can manufacture metro trains in India, then why can’t trains be manufactured?. Everything will be set up in India,” Kant said. DPIIT is short for Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-to-levy-user-fee-as-part-of-train-fares-soon/story-9sFOIlbBx4L0y0cAafexnN.html
18-09-2020||India||PM replies to wishes, with personal touch||NEW DELHI: In response to their wishes on his birthday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday sent personalised messages to thank political leaders, film stars, cricketers and a host of other people who greeted him on turning 70.The PM’s timeline on micro blogging platform Twitter was full of congratulatory messages and photographs and a bulk of these received a response. Most messages to leaders came with a line or two about the bilateral ties between the countries; for instance in response to the Australian PM, Scott Morrison’s message typed in Hindi, the PM wrote, “Thank you @ScottMorrisonMP for your warm wishes. It is great to hear from a close friend! As two vibrant democracies, India and Australia will continue to further strengthen their comprehensive strategic partnership.”Boris Johnson, the UK PM’s greeting too was met with a line about the historic ties between the nations and their “common commitment to further strengthen them.”Film personalities Kangana Ranaut and Karan Johar who have been in the headlines for their sparring were both thanked for their wishes, as were journalists and members of the opposition.Some of the messages were an indication of the PM’s familiarity with the person. A case in point being the message to actor Madhuri Dixit; “Thanks! Best wishes to you and your family in growing your kitchen garden,” the PM tweeted to the actor.Chief Ministers of non-BJP ruled states; Mamata Banerjee, Pinarayi Vijayan and E Palaniswami all received a response to their greetings.There were a few witty ones as well. In response to actor Milind Soman’s tweet wishing him a proactive opposition the PM said, “Thank you for your birthday wishes and wishful thinking. :)”Soman had tweeted, “Dear Prime Minister @narendramodi on your 70th birthday I wish you good health and a good and proactive opposition, to push you to do better for our great country :)”.Earlier in the day, BJP leaders carried out a host of programmes to mark the PM’s birthday, which is being observed as a week-long Seva Saptah. BJP president JP Nadda said the best way to celebrate the PM s birthday is to serve those who are poor, deprived and exploited.“Politics and fighting elections are the work of political parties. However, Modi ji not only changed the culture of India but also of the party. Today, we are not only doing politics but also undertaking ‘sewa’ works,” he said and also released a book titled “Lord of the Records” at BJP headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-replies-to-wishes-with-personal-touch/story-V01PiOJst8duU0sHooLSmJ.html
18-09-2020||India||From LAC to LoC, Indian Army on alert||The Indian army is on alert, not just on the line of actual control (LAC) bordering China, but along the entire line of control (LoC) with Pakistan, which is seeing an increase in ceasefire violations, particularly since August last year when the government altered the special status in Jammu and Kashmir. The LoC is witnessing 300 to 400 violations every single month. The government made statements on both the LAC and the LoC this week, without giving the monthly breakup. According to a report tabled in the Parliament on the first day of the current session, 3,186 ceasefire violations by the Pakistan Army have been reported this year along the Indo-Pak border between January and September this year. The violations have nearly doubled from the 1629 reported in 2018. In 2019, the figure stood at 3168 for the entire year. Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has often spoken of being prepared for a two-front aggression which is currently under play on the LAC as well as the LoC. The LoC has been particularly hot since August 5, 2019 when the government hollowed out Section 370 which gave the erstwhile northern state of Jammu and Kashmir its special status. Also read: Ball in Beijing’s court: MEA on parleysPakistan has openly contested the status change at the highest political and military levels and the comparative figures for the month of August alone are in indication of prolonged and heightened tensions. There were as many as 307 ceasefire violations in August 2019 as against 44 in August 2018, according to official ministry of defence (MoD) figures seen by HT. The ceasefire was violated over 300 times in each of the subsequent months with March 2020 seeing 411 such violations. On average, March saw as many as 12 violations per day. While the face-off with China started in early April this year, Pakistan too has upped the ante, with close to 400 violations ever single month between March and August, according to official MoD data. Defence minister Rajnath Singh underlined in Parliament Thursday that India would not step back from taking harsh decisions, even, as he said that China has amassed battle machines and troops along the LAC. The LAC has been on fire since April with both sides adding troops, particularly in Eastern Ladakh. India lost 20 soldiers including a commanding officer at Galwan Valley on June 15, while the Chinese army too suffered an unspecified number of casualties. The LAC has witnessed soldier deaths for the first time since 1975. Bullets too, flew for the first time in 45 years in early September. The stand-off on the line of actual control continues despite high-level engagement at the level of foreign and defence ministers of both sides. A follow-up meeting at the military level is expected, though no date has currently been fixed. As one army official, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media said, “We cannot afford to drop our guard either with China or Pakistan. They appear to be in a tango.” India is meanwhile preparing for a long haul as it heads into the winter months, mindful of the fact that the terrain along both fronts is inhospitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-to-loc-indian-army-on-alert/story-iq4Ay8toAuRLQb39rMKMRI.html
18-09-2020||India||Ball in Beijing’s court: MEA on parleys||India on Thursday pushed back against China’s efforts to deflect responsibility for delays in the disengagement process in Ladakh sector, saying Beijing should sincerely work for de-escalation and not make further attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Indian side also insisted on implementing the consensus reached by the Indian foreign and defence ministers and their Chinese counterparts at meetings in Moscow earlier this month for “quick and complete disengagement of troops from all friction areas along the LAC”. The move came soon after China’s foreign ministry called on India for the second consecutive day to “immediately correct its wrong practices, disengage on the ground as soon as possible and take concrete actions to ease tensions” on the border. “The Chinese side should sincerely work with the Indian side for complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas, including Pangong Lake, as well as de-escalation in border areas in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols on maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “We hope the Chinese side will strictly respect and observe the LAC and not make further attempts to unilaterally change the status quo,” he added. Also read| ‘It may be a long winter’: Singapore envoy amid India-China tension at LACSrivastava’s remarks suggested the two sides hadn’t been able to move forward with the five-point roadmap hammered out by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in their talks on the margins of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Moscow on September 10. The roadmap envisages that both sides “should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions”. “Both sides should, therefore, focus on easing tensions in the friction areas by refraining from any actions that may lead to an escalation in the situation. This requires strict adherence to the bilateral agreements and protocols and not making unilateral attempts to change the status quo,” Srivastava said. Tensions have spiked on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake, where troops from the two sides are within close range of each other and where there have been several instances of firing since late August – the first time guns have been used along the LAC since 1975. Experts say India is keen to tamp down tensions in this area, and at other friction points such as Gogra and Kongka La. Srivastava also noted that defence minister Rajnath Singh stated categorically in Lok Sabha on Tuesday and in Rajya Sabha on Thursday that India is committed to a peaceful dialogue through diplomatic and military channels. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin again put the onus for disengagement and de-escalation on the Indian side, saying New Delhi should “immediately correct its wrong practices, disengage on the ground as soon as possible and take concrete actions to ease the tensions”. He also sought to blame India for the tensions in eastern Ladakh. Troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have always strictly abided by agreements between the two sides on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the disputed boundary, and are committed to safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said. On Wednesday, Wang had said China was not to blame for the crisis at the border, which has taken bilateral ties to its worst level in decades. “It is the Indian side that has breached the agreements, trespassed the territory first and fired shots to threaten the safety of Chinese border troops first,” he had said on Wednesday. The Indian government has already dismissed such allegations from the Chinese side, saying PLA troops had engaged in provocative military manoeuvres and were not ready to disengage. Also read: China’s envoy cheers Jaishankar-Wang roadmap, then blames India for tensionOn Thursday, the nationalistic Global Times tabloid also accused India of not being sincere about honouring the consensus to disengage. An article in the tabloid a meeting of national security advisers of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping was a good opportunity to ease border tensions but everything depended on India’s sincerity. NSA Ajit Doval and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi, a member of the political bureau of the central committee of the Communist Party of China joined the virtual meeting hosted by Russia. Hu Zhiyong of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences told Global Times that China should be prepared to face the fact that consensus with India is possible but it should remain vigilant over whether India can keep its promises. Zhao Gancheng, from the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said since Yang and Doval know each other for a long time, the Brics meeting brings hopes of peace. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said both sides were clearly in a stalemate and would hold on to territory while continuing their efforts to gain an advantage wherever possible. “At the same time, they will be careful not to escalate too much and allow the diplomatic processes to proceed and see what they yield. In any case, we are entering winter and I don’t see the possibility of a major escalation of hostility since it will be difficult to mount an offensive campaign in the harsh weather conditions of winter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ball-in-beijing-s-court-mea-on-parleys/story-1iUn6ODHRxzdbbpEJPhYkL.html
18-09-2020||India||Rajnath Singh may brief Opposition on LAC situation||Defence minister Rajnath Singh is likely to meet leaders from other parties as early as this week to brief them on “additional points” on the “actual situation” of the India-China border conflict after Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday suggested that this would be a suitable way to discuss the sensitive issue.A senior Congress strategist said that the briefing may happen soon, and that former defence minister AK Antony will represent the Congress at the meeting along with some other senior leaders. HT reported on September 16 that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has indicated to some opposition leaders that a closed-door meeting on the India-China border situation may be considered, while ruling out a full-fledged public discussion on the subject during the monsoon session.Rajnath Singh gave a situation report to members in both Houses, and though other speeches were permitted on the issue in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, a select number of speakers were permitted to raise questions after Singh read out his statement in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. Even before questions were posed to the minister, however, Naidu said: “I have a suggestion to the defence minister. If you agree, you may like invite some leaders in your office to share additional information on the issue. Some officials can also come.” Also read: Ball in Beijing’s court: MEA on parleysHe added: “They (political leaders) are all our own people. Everybody is interested in country’s safety and security and they should also know the actual position.”Towards the end of the session, Naidu again reminded Singh of his suggestion for a briefing meeting. Officials said that Singh later met Naidu in his chamber and told that it was a “good suggestion”, and that he was working on it. According to the proposal floated to select non-NDA leaders, the defence ministry brass may brief floor leaders of different parties on efforts to normalise the situation in the LAC, and reply to queries they may have on the subject. Some army generals may also be invited for the briefing meeting. “A senior minister called me to say that the government may think of a briefing meeting for floor leaders of different parties on the Indo-China situation. The proposal is at a nascent stage, and needs further discussion,” said a senior non-NDA leader, requesting anonymity. Intervening during the India-China debate, Naidu said that some propaganda claimed India is divided on the conflict.  “As the Chairman, I want to explain India’s culture is always of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is a family). We have never attacked any country. This is a very sensitive issue. Our soldiers are at the frontier. Raksha Mantri has explained at length about their situation. But there is a propaganda running in international magazines that India is divided, its has major differences and all those useless comments. The message should go from this House that we stand united with our soldiers,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-may-brief-oppn-on-lac-situation/story-hEil3iChgzN3gYv7JilPaN.html
18-09-2020||India||India’s first general aviation terminal for private jets inaugurated||India’s first general aviation terminal for private jets -- which promises faster turnaround of business jets and chartered planes, shielding them from the clutter of general passenger terminals where they now compete for taxiing slots with commercial flights -- was inaugurated by union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport on Thursday. The new terminal, which had been ready for use since July this year and was awaiting a final security nod from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), will start operations from Sunday afternoon, officials familiar with the matter said. Delhi airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) said the terminal can handle more than 50 passengers every hour and can cater to 150 private jet movements every day. “The terminal can handle Code C type aircraft, which are 50-seater charter aircraft and the biggest in their category,” the airport operator said.With 57 dedicated chartered aircraft parking bays, the newly developed apron is spread over an area of eight lakh square feet, DIAL said.  The terminal offers a dedicated car parking with direct access to the city side, the airport operator said, adding the building and aircraft boarding area are at a walking distance from each other for easy and quick boarding or alighting of passengers.Apart from its aircraft handling capacity, the terminal building houses spacious passenger lounges, food and beverage sections, 24x7 personal concierge services and common processing area, the airport operator said. “For quick access, the terminal has its own immigration and customs area. Facilities for crew members and staff such as restrooms and briefing area are available in this new terminal, DIAL said.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which guards the Delhi airport, will also manage security of the new terminal. A senior CISF officer, who did not wish not to be named, said at least 40-45 CISF armed personnel will be deployed at the new terminal throughout to frisk passengers and to secure the perimeter.The terminal has an access control system, Wi-Fi enabled services, and an integrated perimeter security control system, DIAL said.The terminal was built at a cost of Rs150 crore over one-and-a-half years by Bird ExecuJet Airport Services Private Limited, a joint venture between Bird Group and ExecuJet Aviation Group, an international business aviation company based in Switzerland’s Zurich Airport.A spokesperson from the Bird ExecuJet Airport Services Private Limited said nothing was imported for the construction of the terminal and it is purely India made. “It’s a proud moment and we hope given the current scenario, the GA terminal will prove to be a gateway for foreign investors, connecting them directly to the national capital,” the spokesperson said.Puri, who inaugurated the terminal, said India’s civil aviation sector is all set to emerge stronger in a post-Coid world and general aviation will have a significant contribution to it. The new terminal at Delhi airport is the need of the hour, which would significantly support this growth, the minister said.Delhi-based private jet operators said they were looking forward to operating from the new base.Kanika Tekriwal, CEO and founder of JetSetGo Aviation, a private jet operator based in Delhi, said, “With the new terminal for private jets, we will address two major things -- time and exclusivity. Earlier, our guests used to board their flights from either Terminal 1 or Terminal 3, along with commercial flight passages, and took similar processes to board a private flight, making it challenging for someone who is paying a premium price.”“Now, with the new terminal, our guests will be able to fly with us in almost no time and with utmost privacy,” Tekriwal said, explaining that this, however, will not really change the number of flight slots they get.Despite the new terminal, private aircraft will still have to compete for take-off and landing slots with commercial flights. An official from Delhi airport said that the new terminal will help cut time. “Runway 29/11 -- the largest in Delhi -- is closer to the new terminal, and this will make taxiing time of these private aircraft significantly shorter,” he said, adding the shorter distance between the terminal building and flight boarding point will also make the process of boarding quicker and less cumbersome.Tekriwal said the charges for hiring a private jet depend on the size of aircraft and the length of the trip. “They start at Rs 80,000 per hour for an eight-seater turbo-prop and go all the way to Rs 5-6 lakh per hour for a 16-seater jet. Plus there are airport and other landing charges.”Captain Archit Gupta, CEO, Atom Aviation, another Delhi-based private jet service provider, said the new terminal looks classy and elegant. “It has been rightly designed but the capacity of 50 passengers per hour is slightly low as bigger aircraft have more passengers. When more than 2-3 departures happen at the same time, there could be chaos.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-first-general-aviation-terminal-for-private-jets-inaugurated/story-OhckoR1ZXD4uIfKCp81q3M.html

TMC responds||Will ensure free and fair polls in the state, promised West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to people on Thursday, adding that the police have played a partisan role in the recent political violence and killings. “The base of democracy is a free and fair electoral system. If a citizen cannot cast his vote without fear it becomes a danger for democracy. I promise to the people of West Bengal that I will ensure free and fair elections, come what may,” Dhankhar said in Hindi at the Raj Bhawan while speaking to television channels. Assembly polls in Bengal will be held next year. “Our democracy was achieved against a lot of sacrifice. I say with a heavy heart that dilution in democratic standards has gone down to a dangerous level. It is necessary to put shackles on this dilution,” said the governor. “Which party comes to power or forms the government is not my concern. I am only concerned about how the government is formed,” said Dhankhar.The governor alleged that the state government was dependent on the police for running the administration. “No government should operate by using the police as a crutch. By doing this a government endangers democracy. I have said time and again that this government is using the police. I have proof. There has been political violence and killings in recent days. Police have played a partisan role, going outside the limits of law,” said Dhankhar. Reacting to the governor’s statements, state power minister Savandeb Chattopadhyay said, “Every political party wants a free and fair election. But ensuring that is the job of the Election Commission of India. The governor does not conduct elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ensure-fair-polls-in-bengal-says-governor-dhankhar-tmc-responds/story-r3fySrUXE7cW8VH7DHYwBI.html

18-09-2020||India||Rajkot emerges as Covid-19 hotspot, people impose self-lockdown||At least half the 7,033 Covid-19 cases and 115 deaths in Gujarat’s Rajkot have been reported in the past month, official data shows. State health department data shows that the number of cumulative cases increased from 3,289 on August 16 to 7,033 on September 16. The number of deaths rose to 115 from 54 during the same period.Rajkot’s case fatality rate is the lowest in the state, however, there may likely be some discrepancy in the data. On September 3, a local Gujarati daily reported that 32 bodies were cremated/buried in Rajkot city the previous day as per Covid-19 protocols but only three deaths were recorded in Gujarat’s Covid-19 health bulletin.Rajkot municipal commissioner Udit Mishra denied the possibility of death figures being hidden and said the death audit committee decides the cause of deaths. “Some people have confused routine deaths with Covid-19 deaths. This may be because suspected Covid-19 patients, who die, are cremated with Covid-19 protocol. We provide Covid-19 death figures as decided by the audit committee.”Former president of the Rajkot Medical Association (RMA) Dr Chetan Lalseta said, “One should not attribute all deaths to Rajkot district. Many terminally ill patients coming from neighbouring districts also contribute to high death numbers in Rajkot.”Still, the situation turned so bad that the Gujarat government had to rush its health secretary Jayanti Ravi with a team of health experts and doctors to the city on August 31 to bring the situation under control.“All efforts are being made to reduce fatalities in Rajkot district. Around 15 doctors from other districts would be stationed here and additional ventilators would be provided,” news agency PTI quoted her as saying on August 31.As the cases of infection rise exponentially, residents have gone into isolation.“We had no option but to go for a self-imposed lockdown as cases were rising rapidly and lockdown is the only way to control the chain of transmission,” said Suresh Kumar, communications in-charge of the Rajkot Wholesale Textile Merchants Association.He said the lockdown, though voluntary, is almost complete with essential good shops opening for limited hours every day. “There is a huge fear among people as the virus is spreading rapidly. People are not coming out of their homes voluntarily now,” he said.Lalseta said a huge spike in Covid-19 cases was witnessed after the Janmasthami festival (August 11) when people gathered in large numbers despite restrictions imposed by the state government.As the cases increased, he said, 160 of 300 registered doctors in the city were infected, hampering the disease management in the 170 sq km city. He, however, added that things look better now with 90 percent of them having recovered. On Thursday, Rajkot reported 46 new Covid-19 cases and one fatality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajkot-emerges-as-covid-19-hotspot-people-impose-self-lockdown/story-MrWWjuwJIqGAp6mYmDR1eJ.html
18-09-2020||India||‘Yoga in burqa’: Uttarakhand boxer girl fights all odds to teach yoga to women||A 17-year-old boxer, Rehnuma Mikrani, is kicking all odds one punch at a time to teach yoga to about 40 women of her community in Haldwani town of Nainital district. Hailing from a humble family background, Rehnuma is the daughter of an autorickshaw driving father and a mother who works at a local Anganwadi centre. A state-level boxer, Rehnuma decided to teach yoga and other exercises to the women in her community about one and a half month ago during the lockdown. She began by teaching yoga to four women and now has a batch of around forty women of her community who come together every morning in the local playground. However, the initiative was not an easy one to start as she and the other women had to face all sorts of odds including criticism from some members of the community and lewd comments from local boys. Also read: Section 144 in Mumbai: Does anything change? All you need to knowRehnuma, who has been training at Sports Authority of India’s day-boarding extension centre for boxing in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, said, “It all started in July when my mother and few other women asked me to teach them yoga and other exercises as being a sportsperson, I was trained in such things.”“I was at home during the lockdown but I tried to continue my regular workout at a nearby sports ground. There, I saw a few Muslim women doing some basic exercises near their houses but not in a proper way. I discussed it with my mother who then said asked me to teach it to teach them since I am trained in it. I agreed and then five of us, my mother, three other women and I, started practising in the playground where I used to go,” said Rehnuma. The small group then started gathering early at 5.30 am to practise yoga and other exercises till 7-7.30 am. Rehnuma said that it was not at all an easy for them initially as “men would stop on their way just to stare at them”. “Not only they would stop to see what we are doing but some also used to pass lewd comments and body shame us, saying, “Look at these ladies… what they are doing? They rather sit at home”. Initially, we didn’t pay heed to them but when it crossed a limit, my mother and I confronted them after which they stopped passing comments,” she said. Also read: ‘No need to panic’ - Aaditya Thackeray on Section 144 imposed in MumbaiRehnuma’s mother Shabnam who has been supporting her from day one, said, “Not only random people at the ground but some local Muslim scholars also objected”“After seeing us, more women started joining us later and the number reached forty. However, this also drew an objection from some local Muslim scholars. They didn’t confront us directly but would raise their objection before the men of our community that we should not do this in public, rather sit at home as it is against the customs and all...,” said Shabnam. “However, we didn’t stop going there to practise yoga as we knew we would face such hurdles. And we were doing all this for our health and fitness,” she added.“Among 40 women, some are as young as 14 while some are over 45. We gather every morning as a family and practise yoga with full dedication. In fact, we have also bought a small speaker after pooling money to play music during yoga. We all really enjoy it and don’t bother about criticism now,” said Shabnam.Many women come in Burqa to practise yoga. Samreen Khan, 23, who has been with Rehnuma since the start and is also a trained yoga practitioner, said, “Belonging to a society where women are not allowed to move freely and are expected to be in veil or burqa, we decided to teach these women yoga in burqa only.”“Most of the women are practising yoga with us in burqa and they have absolutely no problem with that. They say, by doing so they are able to uphold the customs and practise yoga also for their health and fitness,” said Samreen. She said initially many women were hesitant in joining them but once they joined they were able to understand the benefits of yoga. “Many of them suffered from health issues like blood pressure or joint pain and didn’t know what to do. Now, after joining our group, they have learnt many yoga asanas and exercises which are helping them improve their health,” said Samreen. The initiative has been appreciated by many prominent members of the community. SMA Kazmi, social activist and a political expert based in Dehradun, said, “What these women are doing is highly appreciable. What Rehnuma is doing is for the health and fitness of women in our community which makes it all the more important and praiseworthy. There are several restrictions on women in our community but she has braved them all to teach them yoga. This is what should be appreciated by all,” said Kazmi. Another social activist from Haldwani, Tanuja Joshi, too hailed Rehnuma for her efforts and said, “What she is doing is beneficial for the health of these women. Yoga is above any religion and keeps people fit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yoga-in-burqa-uttarakhand-boxer-girl-fights-all-odds-to-teach-yoga-to-women/story-QRa7BaSSuz5pRhRaaYBwpO.html

A special NIA court relied on the evidence collected against Gogoi and observed that it cannot be said that the accusations are wholly improbable, according to an NIA statement.Gogoi is set to move the state high court against the rejection order delivered in Guwahati on Friday.Gogoi was arrested on December 12 as a preventive measure while protests against the CAA in the state raged and resulted in violence at several places. Gogoi’s case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which filed a charge sheet against him on June 29, 2020 for alleged conspiracy in league with the proscribed Maoist outfit, the CPI (Maoist) group, for commissioning of alleged terrorist acts.“It pertains to larger conspiracy hatched by CPI (Maoist), a proscribed organisation, wherein Akhil Gogoi and other accused persons intentionally conspired, and incited acts preparatory to commission of terrorist acts,” an official statement by NIA said.Also Read: Kerala gold smuggling suspect had good rapport with CM’s office: NIANIA has argued that the alleged conspiracy hatched by Gogoi in connivance with others included disrupting supplies and services essential to the life of the community and causing damage and destruction of public and private property aimed at striking terror in a section of people of India.“Accused Akhil Gogoi and others have used passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament as an opportunity to further the Maoist agenda and to promote enmity between different groups and to do acts, prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, thus endangering security and sovereignty of the State,” the statement added further.Also Read:NHRC asks Chhattisgarh to compensate activistsAkhil Gogoi is associated with Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a peasant organisation based in Assam.The agency had earlier conducted raids at Gogoi’s residence in Guwahati.The hearing on Gogoi’s bail plea continued for 10 days in NIA court, which ultimately resulted in its rejection on Friday.

18-09-2020||Editorials||The glorious uncertainty of the 13th IPL||The T20 game is unpredictable. But the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which begins on September 19, promises to be particularly unpredictable. Consider the unknowns. All IPL teams were assembled keeping home conditions in mind; for example, Kolkata Knight Riders is packed with fast bowlers and big- hitting batsmen who like taking on pace and bounce because of the nature of the Eden Gardens pitch. How will they cope with the low and slow pitches of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)? Data says that T20 scoring rates in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, two of the three venues for this season (the third is Sharjah), have lower scoring rates than any of the Indian venues, except Chennai. Data also suggests that it’s much harder to hit sixes on the UAE pitches than on Indian grounds — will this give someone like Virat Kohli, whose strength lies in anchoring an innings rather than exploding from the first ball, an ideal platform to excel? How will the pitches hold up to the sheer volume of matches? Each venue will host roughly a game every second day for two months. How will the players cope without crowds? Will it drop the intensity of their game, or help them focus better? And what about the fact that a majority of the players are coming off a very long layoff? What will it do to their fitness and their match endurance? Finally, there is, of course, the inglorious uncertainty of playing while a pandemic rages in the background, threatening to breach the sporting “bio-bubble” at the slightest slip-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-glorious-uncertainty-of-the-13th-ipl/story-b35RuCVK2lL5O5iamLpJeK.html
