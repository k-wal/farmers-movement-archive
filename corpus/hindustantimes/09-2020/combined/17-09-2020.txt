Combining forces and finding common ground has never been more urgent than now, in the midst of a pandemic, and the Abraham Accord is set to generate immediate results. This historic agreement also brings opportunities for India, which enjoys strong bilateral relations with these developed and thriving economies. India will benefit greatly by expanding its cooperation in many areas including health care, energy, agriculture, cyber security, regional security, technology, water and more.The leaders of Israel, the United States (US) and the UAE hailed the agreement as a “historic diplomatic breakthrough that will advance peace in the Middle East”, “chart a new path”, and “unlock the great potential in the region”. India’s ministry of external affairs praised the agreement between Israel and the UAE, defining both as “key strategic partners of India”. The scope for successful collaboration among the three countries is huge. For example, the health ministers of both Israel and the UAE have already agreed to cooperate on health issues, particularly on the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Israel and India have also been cooperating on joint research and development for rapid testing of Covid-19, as well as new technologies to combat the pandemic. Developing together, and subsequently utilising the significant relative advantage of India in manufacturing, can bring promising results for the sake of humanity and the whole world, as well as harmonising with the great vision of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi of “Making in India, for India, and for the world”.While business delegations and a student exchange programme are being planned, the UAE and Israel have also committed to working together on medical research and pharmaceuticals, collaborating particularly in the development of treatments and vaccine trials for Covid-19. Apex National Investment has signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel’s Sheba Medical Center, establishing Israel as a major destination for medical tourism from the UAE. Both countries have suffered under the ongoing coronavirus crisis, and it’s, therefore, fitting that the first field of cooperation is in health care.Like India, Israel and the UAE are young countries that have managed to develop dynamic, thriving economies in a few decades. Both the UAE and Israel will gain from the expansion of trade and commercial ties. The Israeli ministry of economy and industry has estimated that Israeli exports to the UAE could jump to $500 million a year, and that Emirati investments in Israel could reach $350 million a year. The cyber-security, medical, financial, and communications industries are expected to benefit in particular from the newfound expansion of trade and investment between the two countries. Given that both countries are strategic partners of India, we can imagine the promising potential that is embedded in this exciting peace agreement.These initiatives and collaborations represent a bit of what is to come in the normalisation of relations between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. The citizens of all three countries will quickly see their lives enriched as a result of this agreement, paving the way for increasingly more countries in the region to realise the vast potential that exists in making peace with Israel. As economic opportunities in the region arise, they will also expand beyond the immediate region to benefit our friends in India.The challenges we are facing today know no borders, and it is essential that we combine our capabilities for the benefit of all of our citizens. We call on all those following this historic moment to voice their support for the agreement. This historic peace agreement opens a new era of peace and prosperity for the whole of West Asia, India, and the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-the-israel-uae-bahrain-accord-means-for-india-and-the-world/story-SHrfuRXQbkhaYGbc16ZcKJ.html
17-09-2020||News||An alternative jobs and skill strategy for India||The British described India as an ocean of trees. This tree cover was nurtured by village and tribal communities. To organise the drain of India, as Dadabhai Naoroji put it, the British destroyed these community organisations and took over forest land as State property. Only Goa was spared. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to break down village communities, but stopped when faced with substantial losses in land revenue. Goa, therefore, remained an ocean of trees till 1961, attracting hordes of tourists. To this day, the gavkari, or “communidad” organisation continues to bravely hold on to Goa’s natural heritage. Following Independence, India’s ruling classes stuck to the same colonial mindset. Nevertheless, the country’s deep-rooted democracy resulted in the enactment of several pro-people measures, such as the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution establishing Panchayat Raj in 1992, the Right to Information Act in 2005 and The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA). All of this helped in restoring rights. Gadchiroli, Maharashtra’s easternmost district, has the highest level of tree cover in the state at over 70%, safeguarded by its predominantly tribal population. It is the one district where the Community Forest Resource (CFR) rights and provision of FRA have been implemented properly, with thousands of villages being assigned lakhs of hectares to manage minor forest produce sustainably. This was the result of a combination of capable tribal leadership and competent and honest officials. CFRs have been granted from 2009 and have led to skill development and community-based employment. Before the Act was in place, young women in Gadchiroli had a taste of the government’s ill-conceived skill development plan when they were trained to become air hostesses. On completing the course, no airline was willing to employ the women. Pachgaon, a village in neighbouring Chandrapur district, has been assigned CFR rights over 1,000 hectares. The gram sabha asked each family to submit five rules regarding management of forest resources and other civic affairs. These were then discussed in a meeting over two days and 115 rules were unanimously accepted. The entire community now abides by these 115 rules. These include regimes regarding the harvest of bamboo and other minor forest produce, regular patrolling of CFR areas and sharing of responsibility in sorting and auctioning bamboo. The villagers used to earn to a fair income plucking tendu leaves for contractors earlier. But this involved setting fire to parts of the forest, which the people deemed undesirable. The tendu trees are now producing an abundance of fruit. This fruit is in high demand and, in the long-run, the village may become economically better-off selling the fruit rather than plucking the leaves. The wages for bamboo harvest were three times what contractors paid. Nevertheless, they managed to make a net profit of Rs 35 lakh from the sale of bamboo in 2015. This has been invested in organising forest and village development works which provide year-round employment. Prior to being empowered by the CFR rights, many villagers used to migrate all the way to Gujarat to earn a living. Now, no one leaves the village. The lessons from villages such as Pachgaon must reach all other CFR-holding villages. To kick off such a process, Maharashtra’s tribal development department sponsored a special five-month training programme in the field at Mendha-Lekha, the first village to win CFR rights in 2009. I was associated with this programme in which 24 young men and three women were trained. Following the training, they have formed groups of villages, processing and marketing minor forest produce, while diligently maintaining accounts and paying taxes.Or take Kudumbasree, a network of community-based women’s self-help groups from Kerala, which provides a different kind of experience in strengthening community organisation. This network is engaged primarily in activities related to food production, processing and restaurants. Large tracts of farmland are fallow in Kerala because the owners find the costs of chemical inputs and labour prohibitive. Kudumbasree groups take such lands on lease and make them productive. They can afford to do so because, without alternative employment, their members accept lower wages. They don’t use chemical inputs, thereby reducing the cost of cultivation and taking pesticides out of the ecosystem. As a result, they are successfully in practising organic cultivation.Empowering communities through organisation and resource rights is a very effective and desirable route to both employment generation and skill development. India needs to think of an alternative economic paradigm to prevent the distress we have seen this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/an-alternative-jobs-and-skill-strategy-for-india/story-wkgAv5EE5jHmVfEZf6KirJ.html
17-09-2020||News||New Delhi’s salience in the Afghan matrix||After months of delay and wrangling, the intra-Afghan peace talks finally began in Doha, Qatar, last week. These talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban delegation saw envoys and organisations from over 15 countries participating, underscoring the wider regional and global ramifications of these negotiations. Yet, the challenges were clear from the opening remarks of the main interlocutors. Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, was categorical that while “the legitimate demand of our people and the goal of peace is to end all forms of war and violence through political means,” they wanted a constitutional system in the country that would preserve democracy, elections, women’s rights, minority rights, rule of law, human and civil rights. In essence, he underlined the need to preserve the achievements of the past two decades. Mullah Baradar, Taliban’s deputy leader, tried to strike a conciliatory tone but the group has been clear about its goal: Preserving religious values and striving for an Islamic system.The United States (US) has left the choice of the political system to the Afghan government and the Taliban but has not been shy of articulating its preferences. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, suggested “that protecting the rights of all Afghans is indeed the best way for you to break the cycle of violence”, even as he warned that the “choices and conduct” during the negotiations will affect both the size and scope of future US assistance. Earlier this year, in February, the Donald Trump administration decided to reduce its military footprint in Afghanistan; this is likely to go down to 4,500 troops by November. Though Washington is not convinced that the Taliban has weaned itself off completely from Al Qaeda or that it can be a trusted partner in ensuring peace in Afghanistan, there is a wider political consensus in the US on the need to bring troops back home. For Trump, claiming that he managed to conclude an “endless war” would be a significant policy success to highlight in his beleaguered re-election campaign.So, in more ways than one, the preference matrix of key players in these negotiations is not in sync, posing fundamental challenges to both the process and the outcome. For the Afghan government, it is essential that violence by the Taliban should cease before any substantive talks on power-sharing can begin. But for the Taliban, their ability to unleash dramatic violence is a major leverage that they would like to exploit in political negotiations. But the Taliban also seem to recognise that today’s Afghanistan is not the one they controlled from 1996 to 2001. Afghanistan’s nascent democracy has thrown up new voices, new actors and new aspirations. Reports of the Taliban engaging with China to build infrastructure after a US withdrawal is an indicator that governance is now one of the priorities which cannot be ignored. And this is where India comes into the picture. Despite the pessimism in some quarters that India has lost it all in Afghanistan, ground realities are more complex. India’s approach is also evolving in line with the changing strategic environment. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remarks at the start of the intra-Afghan talks in Doha conveyed India’s priorities even as they subtly underlined its reservations. For New Delhi, it is imperative that “the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, promote human rights and democracy, ensure interest of minorities, women and the vulnerable, effectively address violence across the country.”India’s primary concern emanates from a perceived Pakistani victory in managing to bring the Taliban back to political power in Kabul, thereby energising Islamist extremists in South Asia to target India. India’s regional security environment could be further undermined if the Taliban let Pakistan use Afghan territory for gaining strategic depth vis-à-vis India. Then there is the China factor. Given its close ties with Pakistan, Beijing would like to ensure that the Taliban sever their ties with Uighur extremists in Xinjiang. In exchange, China might emerge as the key economic benefactor of a Taliban-dominated Afghanistan, nudging Pakistan to bring the country into the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. These are significant challenges and New Delhi must be cognisant of such pressures. But it should also remain alive to new possibilities and alignments. India’s role as Afghanistan’s largest development partner cannot be easily dismissed; it also remains the most popular country for ordinary Afghans. New Delhi has strong ties with not only the US and Europe, which will be critical for Afghanistan’s economic reconstruction long after foreign military forces leave, but also with neighbours such as Russia and Iran, key for Afghanistan’s strategic autonomy. The Pashtun question which divides Pakistan and Afghanistan also gives New Delhi significant leverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Taliban have been signalling their intent to engage with India. They seem to get the salience of New Delhi in the Afghan matrix much better than many in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/new-delhi-s-salience-in-the-afghan-matrix/story-yFuhS2A1hPjK7cjrQoUNsI.html
17-09-2020||News||Boosting women’s entrepreneurship and economic leadership||W omen’s representation in leadership positions has been on a rise in recent years, but not enough to close the economic opportunity gap. The World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020 reveals that it will take almost a century to achieve full parity at the current pace. The disparity is particularly striking in India. It ranks 112 out of 153 countries on the overall Global Gender Gap Index. The Covid-19 pandemic seems to have applied brakes in several areas where workplaces were becoming more diverse as well as areas where access to resources across gender had become more equitable. The pandemic has hit the most vulnerable the hardest, making these disparities worse. Oxfam India has estimated the economic loss from women losing their jobs during this pandemic at nearly $216 billion. In these trying times, we need to transform challenges into opportunities and accelerate the shift towards both greater inclusion of women in the workforce and women-led entrepreneurship. Covid-19 is far from over. Work from home is now widely prevalent. Here is an opportunity to deploy technology as the new leveller to strengthen women’s economic participation. It is heartening to see 34% of Indian IT workforce is women. They could be further provided access to new skills and blended technologies to move seamlessly in the rising sectors on digital platforms — telemedicine, e-learning and e-commerce.As the Sustainable Development Goals demonstrate, adopting the gender lens properly and creating a culture to provide more opportunities to women requires collaborative and concerted action. We need to do the following. One, accelerate women’s entrepreneurship. Currently, women constitute around 14% of the total entrepreneur base in India. We must accelerate both the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship through capacity- building in areas such as branding and marketing as well as facilitate financial and institutional linkages for business support.Two, increase women in the workforce at all levels of management and leadership. Women account just 14% of leadership roles and 30% of professional and technical workers. We have not made much progress in terms of leadership roles at the chief executive officer (CEO) level. India has the third-lowest rank in the Asia-Pacific in CEO representation (2%), the second-lowest rank for female chief financial officer (CFO) representation (1%). Ranked 23 globally, India’s female representation on boards increased by 4.3% over the past five years to 15.2% in 2019. The global average is 20.6%. Three, empowerment of women at the micro-enterprise and grassroots levels. Women-owned enterprises can generate over 50–60 million jobs by 2030. Financial reforms must come with a gender lens as micro-enterprises led by women face specific issues that require interventions such as digital and financial literacy programmes, handholding for reliable market access, and a greater network of Self Help Groups (SHGs). In the 2019 Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs, India ranked 52 among the 58 countries. We must aim to be in the top 10 over the next few years. There are some developing economies which are already are outperforming their more developed counterparts. Women business-owners as a percentage of all businesses account for 38.2%, 37.9% and 36% respectively in Uganda, Ghana and Botswana. With equal access to education, health and financial resources, there is no reason why India cannot reach one of the highest levels of women’s entrepreneurship.The road ahead is not easy, and the pandemic has not been gender-neutral. Long -existing inequalities and social disparities have sharpened on gender lines and in access to resources including food, education and health care. Industry must use its position to work with all stakeholders in championing and “empowering the greater 50%”. For it is only where women work that economies grow rapidly and countries prosper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/boosting-women-s-entrepreneurship-and-economic-leadership/story-uneUWvKDjNBkyFFSIpZSNL.html

The data also revealed that as many as 176 people also suffered injuries in these accidents.In Punjab, 3,320 (52.56%) out of the 6,316 road mishaps were caused by speeding, and 2,487 people lost their lives in these accidents.Careless driving and overtaking was the second biggest reason behind road mishaps in Ludhiana in 2019, causing 152 accidents in which 104 lives were snuffed out and 88 suffered injuries. Driving under the influence of liquor or drugs caused nine accidents and claimed one life.Two commuters lost their lives in two road mishaps as the person behind the wheel was fatigued. Defect in the vehicle caused one accident in which one person died.Stray cattle on the road, weather conditions and lack of road infrastructure caused five accidents each and vehicles parked on road shoulders claimed eight lives in eight accidents. As many as 23 mishaps were caused by other reasons while in two, the cause is not known.Dr Kamal Soi, member of the national road safety council, said that authorities concerned are not taking road mishaps seriously and they should identify the cause and work to rectify it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-maximum-roads-mishaps-in-2019-due-to-speeding/story-ILzARCHQdz3xzptFKPtmtJ.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CET registrations for engineering surge to 5.3 lakh from 4.1 lakh in 2019||Registrations for the state common entrance test (MH-CET) exam for engineering courses surged by more than 1 lakh aspirants this year as compared to 2019. Official records shared by the state CET cell revealed that 5.32 lakh aspirants registered for the exam this year as compared to.13 lakh students who had registered for the exam in 2019. The registrations in 2018 stood at 4.35 lakh. The exam, which was originally scheduled to take place between May and June, will now be conducted between October 1 and 20 owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The rise in registrations could be attributed to the delay in conducting entrance exams for professional courses or the central authorities directing institutes to introduce newer branches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain for engineering courses. “Last year, we witnessed one of the lowest registrations for a number of reasons, including the fact that the exam went from a pen-and-paper test to an online-format, which discouraged several aspirants. This year, the registration numbers reiterate the fact that engineering is still in demand among the youth,” said an official from the state CET cell. “While civil and mechanical engineering branches are witnessing a drop in student applications, the introduction of new dimensions such as AI, data science and analytics, as well as robotics, by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) could be one big reason for the revival of engineering degrees among the youth. We, however, need to wait and find out if all those who registered for the test will appear for the exam,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra. While registrations for this exam had ended in March, the ambiguity on the date of examination had left many students worried. Recently, state minister of higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that MH-CET exam will be conducted in October, and therefore, the registration process was reopened for interested candidates for a couple of days earlier this month. Every year, a large number of engineering aspirants who opt for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) also apply for MH-CET and choose to give the exam depending on their JEE score. While this too could be attributed to the sudden spike in registrations for the state entrance exam, experts feel that the opening of new-age branches of engineering could be another reason behind so many students getting attracted to engineering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cet-registrations-for-engineering-surge-to-5-3-lakh-from-4-1-lakh-in-2019/story-5ko1GzDg16TSPivTte6F3J.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees sharpest 1-day Covid case spike; Maharashtra tally now 1,145,840||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its second-highest single-day spike of 24,619 cases, the 11th day of more than 20,000 fresh infections, taking the count to 1,145,840. Mumbai, for a second consecutive day, recorded its sharpest single-day spike of 2,411 cases. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the city has reached 178,385, of which 32,959 are , active cases.Since the beginning of this month, the city has witnessed a rise in daily Covid-19 cases with record-breaking single-day spikes being reported every other day, in line with the civic body’s anticipation of a spike in cases post Ganeshotsav. Last time the city recorded a relatively lower single-day spike was on August 24 with 703 cases.On Thursday, the state also crossed the 31,000 mark for Covid-19 casualties after 398 more deaths were reported, taking its tally to 31,351. The highest toll in a day was also reported at 515 on September 15.The high number of casualties continues to be a concern for state authorities as it is still the highest in the country. Figures showed that the state’s contribution in total Covid casualties is around 37.68%, with 83,198 deaths reported across the country. In Mumbai, 43 deaths were reported, which took its toll to 8,323. The case fatality rate (CFR) is 4.6% and the recovery rate stands at 77%. The daily Covid-19 infection in the state is constantly on the rise, which has concerned state authorities. The surge has led to a rise in active cases as well, which has crossed the 3 lakh mark, as the tally rose to 301,752 cases. It comes to 26.33% of the total cases reported so far.It took the state only 15 days to complete 300,000 active cases as the 200,000 mark was breached on September 2. It took 51 days to complete 200,000 active cases and 126 days for the 100,000 cases. The first Covid-19 case was detected on March 9.The state has recorded over 353,227 cases in 17 days of this month and its average per day cases comes to 22,778. The reason behind the surge is that the state is getting a significant number of cases from rural areas.The rise in cases has also brought additional burden on the health infrastructure, which has left local authorities struggling. The issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.“It has been observed that the pandemic is spreading fast in rural areas, which is worrisome as we don’t have adequate infrastructure to deal with the situation. Currently, there is a shortage of oxygen beds in the rural areas. The cabinet has directed the health department to augment the infrastructure as well as install jumbo tanks and supply of big cylinders to ensure sufficient number of oxygen beds are available wherever required,” said a senior minister, requesting not to be named.“We are also arranging ambulances for Covid patients from remote areas so that they can be moved to the nearest tehsil places where oxygen beds have been made available,” he added.Three months ago when the state started relaxing lockdown restrictions in phases on June 3 under ‘Mission Begin Again’, most of the cases used to come from urban areas, but the scenario has changed with free movement of people.Till June 3, the contribution of all the 34 districts in the total cases 6,165 cases (8.23% of the total cases), which has been increased to 392,002 cases that comes to 34.21% of the total cases) on September 17. Besides, the major hotspots from rural areas are Pune district, Satara district, Ahmednagar district, Sangli district, Raigad district, Solapur district and Jalgaon district, where fresh cases recorded were 1,712; 774; 626; 552; 522; 514 and 506 respectively.The state government has also set a target to increase daily Covid testing to 1.5 lakh a day from the current average of over 90,000 tests per day. “We want to increase testing to 1.5 lakh per day. The aim is to cover maximum people and break the chain and thus it can be observed that daily testing figures are increasing,” said a senior official from the health department.On Thursday, it has conducted a record 98,614 tests and the total number of tests conducted till date are 5,604,890. The number of average tests in the past week is 90,047 a day.State to appoint over 1,200 PG med students To deal with shortage of doctors in the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government decided to appoint over 1,200 super-speciality and post graduate medical students on bond service. The decision was taken by the state medical education department on Thursday.The medical students will join government as well as BMC hospitals for a period of one year and will also be remunerated up to Rs1 lakh a month.Amit Deshmukh, state medical education minister, said that 1,204 medical students from super-speciality and post-graduate courses will be appointed at the government, medical colleges and affiliated hospitals.Of them, 385 will be appointed assistant professors at government medical colleges, 178 as assistant professors at BMC run medical colleges, 282 as expert officers at civic hospitals and the rest 359 will be appointed at dedicated Covid hospital and dedicated Covid health centres, the minister informed.This year, a total of 1,648 students have appeared for super-speciality and post graduate medical courses and 1,204 will be selected for bond service from the ones who will clear the examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-sharpest-1-day-covid-case-spike-maharashtra-tally-now-1-145-840/story-AWiuvDU58TXiSxzTQeCfPJ.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Navrati to New Year’s: Festive period may add to rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra||As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise, the state and city administration fear a further spike, with the upcoming festive season that stretches from October-December. The nine-day navratri festival, which is celebrated with much galore in the city, begins from October 17, followed by Diwali, another major festival that begins from November 14, followed by Christmas and New Year celebrations.Apart from increase in testing and more relaxations with the state’s Mission Begin Again campaign, social interactions during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival is also being considered as one of the reasons for a spike in cases in the city and state. The average daily Covid-19 cases shot up after Ganesh Chaturthi from nearly a 1,000 cases in August to 1,800+ cases in the first week of September. Since September 5, cases are being reported in the range of 1,800-2,300 almost daily. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded its single-highest spike of 2,378 cases in a day.In Maharashtra, between August 20 and 31, around 10,000-15,000 cases were being recorded daily, which has increased to 20,000+ cases almost daily since September 5. On Wednesday, the state crossed 1.1 million cases.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force, said, “I agree that the risk is higher with the upcoming festival season. However, it is time citizens start taking the onus and adjust to the new normal. People are still not getting tested immediately after developing symptoms owing to the stigma attached to the infection.”He further said, “There is also lack of cooperation from citizens when it comes to wearing masks. The government is only going to bring in more relaxations hereafter. It is for the citizens to bring in behavioural changes while dealing with a pandemic.”Navratri event organisers HT spoke to said that while they are waiting for the state government to issue guidelines, they are sure of not celebrating the festival this year. Some, however, think the state may allow people to celebrate, however, with reasonable restrictions.“Navratri is largely about garba and dandiya, which is impossible with social distancing norms. So it is clear that there will be no celebrations this year,” said Neil Somaiya, BJP corporator from Mulund, who has been organising a navrarti event at Mulund (East) for the past few years.Pravin Chheda, who has been organising dandiya nights since 25 years in Ghatkopar, said, “Even Ganesh Chaturthi was not celebrated the way it usually is. How can navratri be celebrated without social gathering? The state might only allow societies to maybe do puja within the buildings.”Ajitkumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner of N ward, which covers Ghatkopar, and has a huge Gujarati population, said at present, cases are on the rise in many areas of the ward namely Pant Nagar and Rajawadi. “Ideally, celebrations should not be allowed as the number of cases is increasing in many pockets. But if there are demands from local representatives and citizens, then we will escalate it to higher authorities,” Ambi said. He also said a decision on whether to allow relaxations or curb the celebrations will be taken in two-three days.Meanwhile, some organisers are also considering ‘virtual navratri’ to keep up the festival spirit. Jignesh Khilani, secretary of Ghatkopar Gujarati Samaj, which hosted Falguni Pathak in 2017, said, “We are thinking on the lines of arranging virtual navratri. We are waiting for the state’s guidelines on it.”Manoj Kotak, member of Parliament from the Mumbai North-East, which has many Gujarati pockets, also said that they might consider looking at virtual dandiya nights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navrati-to-new-year-s-festive-period-may-add-to-rising-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra/story-LzpGLJFKP7PQfJxR2SXi1O.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Tenure extension of co-op society committees not political: Maharashtra government to Bombay HC||The Maharashtra government, while justifying its decision to postpone elections of managing committees of cooperative societies, extend the tenure of members and not appoint administrators as it did for gram panchayats, has said in its affidavit to the Bombay high court (HC) that allegations that the postponement was politically motivated were misplaced. The affidavit stated that while gram panchayats are democratically-elected constitutional bodies, cooperative societies are independent voluntary bodies and the state has very little power to enforce its jurisdiction on them. The state was submitting its response to a petition filed by Arun Kulkarni through advocate Satish Talekar challenged the June 17 order and the July 10 ordinance issued by the state announcing the extension of the term of the managing committees of cooperative societies. The petitioner claimed that the state had acted arbitrarily and in a biased manner when appointing administrators to the public bodies. The petition averred that because the gram panchayats were predominantly occupied by elected representatives having affiliation to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the state was quick to appoint new administrators as elections could not be held due to the Covid pandemic. It added that administrators were not appointed for cooperative societies as they were headed by the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) loyalists. The petition claimed that in light of this arbitrariness on the part of the state, which was politically motivated, the court should direct the state to set aside the June order and the July ordinance and direct the state to appoint administrators. Pursuant to the direction by the court to the state to respond to the submissions of the petitioner, the state said that while the gram panchayats were constitutional bodies to which persons were elected democratically, the posts in cooperative societies were independent and voluntary, and hence, the state did not have jurisdiction to appoint administrators to them. The state buttressed its submissions with the fact that the Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 allowed postponement of elections and hence sought the dismissal of the petition. After perusing the affidavit, the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla on Thursday directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder and posted the matter for hearing on October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tenure-extension-of-co-op-society-committees-not-political-maharashtra-government-to-bombay-hc/story-WBKiJ4Y5Duu5xOUbZOqnTL.html

17-09-2020||Chandigarh||PU online exams: Delay at rural colleges in Ludhiana on Day 1 due to network issues||The online examination at several PU-affiliated colleges in rural areas, which was scheduled to start at 9am on Thursday, was delayed as many colleges downloaded the question paper late amid connectivity issues. This forced many colleges to give extra time to students to attempt the two-hour paper and send the answer-sheets in PDF format in the next two hours.After receiving the question papers via WhatsApp groups, many students called their teachers to know which questions to attempt. There were a total of 14 questions, of which the first six were short-answer type. The rest were long answers.Due to poor connectivity in rural areas, a large number of students reached their respective colleges to submit the hard copy of their answer-sheet.GTB College, Dakha, did not receive the question paper from the university till 9.45 am. Officiating principal, Avtar Singh, said, “We finally downloaded the question paper from PU’s website. The students were also confused after receiving the question paper and contacted teachers to know how many questions were to be attempted. Over 12 students of final-year submitted the answer-sheets to the college in an envelope as they could not upload the PDF online.”Due to connectivity problems, the authorities of government college, Karamsar, could download only 30 out of 160 answer-sheets sent by students till 4 pm.At Gobind College, Narangwal, the authorities downloaded the paper at 8.56 am instead of 8.40 am due to connectivity issues. Kuldeep Batta, district president of PCCTU, said, “Due to connectivity issues, we downloaded the question paper 16 minutes late. The university has asked students to attempt 50% of the questions of their choice, but many students contacted their course teachers to know which were to be attempted, and wasted a lot of time.” The university opted for online mode to conduct exams for final-semester students due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many academicians have stated that the varsity should have organised physical exams or marked them on the basis of aggregate marks scored by them in previous semesters. College forcing students to submit hard copies of answer-sheets: Parents Several parents have alleged that authorities of Ramgarhia Girls College, Miller Ganj, have asked students to submit hard copy of the answer-sheet to the college after the exam. Principal Inderjeet Kaur denied the allegations and said, “Today was the first online exam and we have asked the students not to panic if they can’t send the answer-sheet in PDF format. Few parents and students submitted the hard copy of the answer-sheet to the college today as they were unable to send it online. For the next exam, we have informed the students to learn how to convert the pages of the answer- sheet into a PDF.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-online-exams-delay-at-rural-colleges-in-ludhiana-on-day-1-due-to-network-issues/story-u88PYd6VYgKSK7L0gdwj6N.html

The attack took place on September 10, and the victim succumbed to his burn injuries on Thursday, after which the accused was arrested. According to Badlapur rural police, the incident occurred in Done village in Vangani, Ambernath taluka. The victim Chandrakant Pawar, an electrician, his wife and two daughters lived in the B wing of Vishwanath Apartments. The accused Nikhil Gurav lived in the C wing. “Pawar moved into the building six months ago. In the second week of September, his elder daughter went to the C wing to get her electricity bill from the secretary of the building. Gurav’s mother allegedly passed a few remarks on the girl’s looks, after which the daughter got into a fight with her. The matter was resolved later,” said a police officer. On September 10, Gurav got drunk and went to Pawar’s house. “He started arguing with the girl and her mother. A few members of Gurav’s family also reached the spot. As the fight escalated, the accused allegedly got petrol and threatened to set the house on fire. Pawar then intervened and took the man inside to calm him down. The other family members were outside at the time,” added the officer. A while later they heard a commotion and found Pawar on fire. Gurav had run away from the spot. Pawar suffered 70% burn injuries and was admitted at a Mumbai-based hospital for treatment. He succumbed to his injuries on September 17. S Nigade, senior inspector of Badlapur rural police station, said, “We have arrested the accused and produced him in court. He had been remanded in police custody for 14 days. The argument was petty and it turned into a massive altercation from Gurav’s side. We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. We also have video footage of the incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/badlapur-man-set-ablaze-by-neighbour-dies/story-ebfZGq0mcbsnIeeu4NbAjP.html

Our motive is to raise the issues being faced by residents and work for the development of the city. Even if the BJP councillors met the mayor separately, we have no issues as our aim is to raise the voice of the public.” When asked about BJP councillors’ meeting the Mayor, Dang said that the BJP leadership did not invite the SAD councillors to the meeting. “But we have no problem with that as both of us have raised the issues for providing relief to the public,” he said.Sources in the BJP said that the party councillors did not participate in the meeting of SAD councillors, as the district president of BJP Pushpinder Singal was not consulted before fixing a meeting with the mayor.BJP district president Pushpinder Singal said, “A delegation of state BJP leaders were in the city on the day when SAD councillors met the Mayor.

During inquiry it was revealed that the accused was involved in nine cases in Ghatkopar, Pant Nagar, Mahim and Sakinaka police stations. The accused, Tufail Siddiqui, a resident of D’souza complex in Sakinaka, was working with a private firm but had lost his job a few months ago. As he could not find another job due to the lockdown, he decided to dupe people, said a police officer.“The accused would stand near ATMs, mostly in slum areas, and target people who faced difficulties in withdrawing money. He used to approach them under the pretext of helping them and would memorise their pin numbers. He would then give the victim a fake ATM card instead of the real one,” said inspector Pramod Kokate of Ghatkopar police station.With his arrest, the police claimed to have solved nine cases of cheating — five cases in Ghatkopar, two in Pant Nagar, and one case each at Mahim and Sakinaka police stations, added Kokate. The accused has been remanded in police custody till Friday, following which he would be arrested in another case registered against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mba-graduate-arrested-for-duping-people-in-mumbai/story-Hb0zyuuUn9T3KBikUmiFfL.html
17-09-2020||City||DU principals deny govt allegations, say they are being falsely accused||New Delhi: A day after education minister Manish Sisodia alleged that state-funded colleges in Delhi University (DU) were not paying salaries to employees despite having funds, principals on Thursday said the government was “falsely” accusing them and forcing them to indulge in an “illegal act” of using student funds for wages.In a digital press conference, DU Principals Association (DUPA) president and principal of SGTB Khalsa, Jaswinder Singh, said the money Sisodia mentioned about was ‘students’ welfare funds’ of colleges and any diversion would amount to “misappropriation”. “How come the Hon’ble Deputy CM is asking the colleges to pay salaries from the student’s society fund, which is collected from the students for specific activities and purposes? Any diversion of funds would amount to misappropriation, which we are not doing but the deputy CM is forcing us to do,” Singh said.In a fresh statement on Thursday after the principals’ presser, Sisodia dismissed their claims and reiterated his allegations.The Delhi government has been at the loggerheads with 12 DU colleges that it fully funds over the release of grants for the last six months. While the principals of these colleges have been alleging they have not been able to pay their staff since May as grants were not issued, the government said the colleges have been provided with enough funds in the present academic year. Sisodia had on Wednesday alleged that at least four out of these 12 colleges had enough funds in their accounts. He cited an initial report of an independent audit conducted by the Delhi government in these colleges, indicating misappropriation of funds. The colleges in which Delhi government is conducting an audit include Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Deen Dyal Upadhyaya College, Bhagini Nivedita College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya and Maharshi Valmiki College of Education.Manoj Sinha, secretary of DUPA and principal of Aryabhatta College said, “The student’s society fund and development fund are collected from students every year by all colleges, which are governed by University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations across the country. And, nowhere salaries are paid out of these funds. These are used for organising student activities. It’s unfortunate that the deputy CM termed it a donation.”The colleges said the Delhi government had released only Rs 37.5 crore to them in this academic session as of now. The required amount, the association said, was Rs 270 crore for the financial year 2020-21.Sisodia had on Wednesday said several staff members and teachers complained of misuse of funds, which necessitated an audit in six of these colleges. Reacting to the statement, Singh said, “Accounts of all the funds are maintained by the college as per accounting norms of UGC and general financial rules. All these accounts are audited by the statutory auditors every year. Further, the Delhi government conducts local fund audit every year and CAG audit periodically...the only apparent basis of identifying the six colleges for special audit is that the members of their (government’s) choice could not be elected as chairperson in their governing bodies. If that is so, it amounts to scuttling the democratic process.”Poonam Verma, principal of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, said, “We have no fear in showing our account details but we cannot use our students’ funds for paying the salaries of our teaching and non-teaching staff. Hearing false allegations from the office of the education minister is disheartening.” Sisodia had alleged that the college did not provide balance sheets to the auditors.Sisodia, in a fresh statement, dismissed the claims and said the colleges were depositing their funds in FDs and “incessantly” demanding money from the government. “On one hand, these colleges have been saying that they do not have sufficient funds to pay the salaries of their staff, and on the other hand, the money in their FDs is consistently increasing. This money is not provided by the Delhi government to deposit in the FD. Some colleges have FDs that have up to Rs 15 to 30 crores. What portion of this money has come from which sources? How is it being used? This needs to be investigated by the audit team. I hope that the Delhi University administration will cooperate with the audit team is investigating the possibility of corruption in the college funds,” he said in a statement on Thursday.The association requested chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to intervene. “The chief minister should intervene and the Delhi government should immediately release the pending 75% grants for this academic session so that the salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff can be paid,” the association said.DU dean of colleges Balaram Pani had said Wednesday he won’t comment before going through the Delhi government’s audit report but offered no fresh reaction on Thursday .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-principals-deny-govt-allegations-say-they-are-being-falsely-accused/story-to70KBUa4uS3fdSZm2KwfL.html
17-09-2020||City||Commercial goods vehicles in Delhi can reset speed governors at 80 kmph, up from 40kmph||New Delhi: Heavy, medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles fitted with a speed governor (a speed limiting device) registered after October 1, 2015, and plying in the national capital, can now have a maximum pre-set speed of 80 kilometres per hour. The Delhi High Court on Thursday set aside a provision in the notification issued by the Delhi government in July 2018, capping the maximum attainable speed of such commercial vehicles at 40 kmph. This means that transport vehicles in Delhi, which were designed to stop if they crossed 40kmph on the speedometer, will now have their speed governor settings revised to 80 kmph. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said the Delhi government does not have such powers to cap vehicular speed limit under its Rules and neither the MC Mehta judgment, passed in 1997 by the Supreme Court, confer such powers.The notification issued by the Delhi government on July 17, 2018, fixed the speed limits of various types of commercial vehicles. The notification added a provision that had said light, medium and heavy good vehicles registered on or after October 1 2015 shall have a maximum pre-set speed of 40 kilometres per hour. The pre-set speed limit of a vehicle is different from the city speed limit set by the Delhi government’s transport department and Delhi Traffic Police, which is 60kmph for private vehicles and 40kmph for commercial vehicles. In highways crossing the national capital, this limit is 70kmph. The court’s judgment came while hearing a plea by a motor vehicle dealer, particularly those manufactured by Maruti Suzuki India Limited. These include the models Maruti Suzuki Omni Cargo, EECO Cargo, and Super Carry, which are classified as light goods vehicles.According to the petitioner, he was unable to register his vehicles in Delhi due to restrictions laid down in the notification, which capped the speed to 40 km per hour. He said all his vehicles were verified and specified by an authorised testing agency to have a rated speed of not more than 80 kilometres per hour (“kmph”).Appearing for the petitioner, its counsel had contended that the Motor Vehicle Act empowers the state government to issue a notification in respect of vehicles registered prior to October 1, 2015, whereas the proviso in the notification applies to vehicles registered on or after October 1, 2015.Defending the notification’s proviso, advocate Anupam Shrivastava and advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsels of the Delhi government, said they had issued the notification in accordance to the MC Mehta judgment. The counsels during the hearing had said central government rules do not empower them to pass the notification with respect to such vehicles registered after October 1, 2015.The court, while quashing the proviso, held that the MC Mehta judgment does not confer power upon the state government to issue the impugned notification. It said the judgment proceeds on the basis that the Act and Rules contain sufficient provisions to enable the authorities to act in the interest of curbing the menace of traffic in Delhi.“In view of the inaction of the executive, the Supreme Court issued the directions contained in the Annexure to the judgment. However it was made expressly clear in paragraph 2 of the judgment (MC Mehat) that the directions issued by the Supreme Court were intended to have effect until the executive acted to fill the lacuna,” the HC said in its judgment of 25 pages.Reacting to the judgment, Delhi Traffic police said it will wait for the court order and abide by whatever directions have been issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/commercial-goods-vehicles-in-delhi-can-reset-speed-governors-at-80-kmph-up-from-40kmph/story-xyD8t9w8aa1tJDZhA7ldOP.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Six months on, teachers yet to receive SSC paper correction dues in Maharashtra||Nearly six months after teachers from the state evaluated the answer sheets of the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination, the state board is yet to pay their dues. Several teachers have written to board officials demanding that their dues be cleared with immediate effect.“Teachers have evaluated the answer sheets in a very difficult situation amid the Covid-19 outbreak this year. Despite this, the dues are still not cleared. It has been six months since the exams and nearly two months since the results were declared, but we are still awaiting our dues,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of the Teachers Democratic Front, which has written to the board.Sandeep Sangave, secretary of Mumbai divisional board, said the dues of teachers would be cleared soon and the process for the same is on. “The board is working with reduced staff due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown-related restrictions. In addition, there were some delays in getting bills from teachers and custodies while some account details provided by a few teachers were also incorrect. These factors seem to have led to the delay. Teachers should not worry as they would get their dues in a couple of days,” he added. Teachers have also requested the board to increase the rate of paper evaluation considering the costs involved in travelling amid lockdown. “This year, teachers have spent a lot of money from their own pockets to transport papers from their schools to homes and vice versa. The board only gives ₹200 as travel allowance, which is not enough considering trains were shut and teachers had to spend auto and taxi fare on their own,” said Pandya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-months-on-teachers-yet-to-receive-ssc-paper-correction-dues-in-maharashtra/story-JowO28TCTwDQ8tJl00rVQJ.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Financial duress acute in North corporation, commissioner asks officials not to take up fresh projects||Given the acute financial crisis that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is currently undergoing, its commissioner Gyanesh Bharti has issued an order directing all heads of the departments “ to not to create any additional financial commitments”. He said apart from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the corporation’s “adverse financial condition” was also due to the non-payment of grants on time by the Delhi government. This is the first time that the commissioner of a municipality has raised the issue of the city government not paying grants/dues on time. Civic functionaries said that means no new project is likely to be taken up until the situation improves. As a result, all development works, such as the construction of new drains, roads, parking spaces and allocation of councillors’ funds, are likely to be affected. In the circular issued on September 11, Bharti also accepted that the financial situation was so grave that the municipality was unable to pay salaries and pensions to certain categories of employees and former employees for the past five months.“After the outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent lockdown of Delhi since March 2020, the internal revenue of North DMC has decreased drastically. Further, the grant-in-aid, transfer duty and other such dues from GNCTD (Delhi government) are also not being released on time. In view of this, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is facing a severe financial crunch that even salaries and pensions for the last five months to certain categories of employees have not been released,” the circular read.Bharti further said that in view of the adverse financial condition of the north civic body, and keeping in mind the existing cash and committed liabilities, it has become expedient to avoid the creation of any further additional financial liability. “All heads of departments are hereby once again directed not to create any additional financial commitments except in unavoidable circumstances,” Bharti said.A similar order was issued in August 2019 by then commissioner Varsha Joshi. According to civic officials, the north corporation has a workforce of around 50,000 and it spends nearly ₹350 crore every month on salaries. Officials explained that other than self revenue generation, the civic body also gets a grant from the government along with a share in various taxes and advertisement revenue that the government collects on behalf of the corporation.Teachers, doctors, nurses, sanitation employees, paramedical staff, engineers and other employees in different departments of the north corporation are currently owed a salary backlog of four to five months. The civil contractors of the north corporation have not been paid their bills since March 2015.Hundreds of employees of different departments have been protesting at the Civic Centre — headquarters of north and south corporations — against non-payment of salaries.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, said the Delhi government has to give approximately ₹1,600 crore to the north civic body in first two quarters of the current fiscal. Of this, the government has so far released only about ₹400 crore. “The situation will improve if the Delhi government releases the pending ₹1,200 crore (approx). This is the first time that the commissioner has also raised the issue of non-payment of dues by the city government. We have been saying the same thing for past few months,” Prakash said.Vikas Goel, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in the north corporation, stressed that the government had been paying its share to the corporation on time. “The commissioner’s statement seems to have been made under pressure from the political executive,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/financial-duress-acute-in-north-corporation-commissioner-asks-officials-not-to-take-up-fresh-projects/story-dOMTfHmK3NZLaSBAZK3YTI.html

During the inspection, Malhotra found that no sterilisation was done at the centre for the last five days and it lacked cleanliness. “I had received a complaint that the company which has been awarded the contract to take up dog sterilisation in the city, claims money from the MC by showing more sterilisations done at the centre. The MC pays around Rs 1,000 per sterilisation. I inspected their registers and found that no dog was sterilised in the last five days. The staff said that some team members are not well, due to which the work was stopped,” said Malhotra, while adding that the project was also put to halt in the August due to exodus of labourers amid the pandemic. “The officials said that around 15 dogs are sterilised at the centre on a normal day, but only five to six were being sterilised lately due to shortage of labour. I will ask municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to mark an inquiry into the matter. Proper monitoring should be done so that public money is not wasted. Also, the officials have been asked to maintain cleanliness at the centre,” said Malhotra.Despite repeated attempts, municipal corporation veterinary officer Harbans Dhalla could not be reached forcomments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-work-done-at-mc-s-dog-sterilisation-unit-for-5-days-ludhiana-senior-dy-mayor/story-QLX7zXktcYcr43JkHZzlzN.html

Once enrolled, they would have to attend classes on a regular basis,” said an official. Every day, BMC conducts two live sessions of 45 minutes each for students of Classes 1 to 8 and four live sessions of the same duration for Classes 9 and 10 students.

There is a need for extraordinary measures to meet the extraordinary situation”, the statement read.The NC leaders expressed their dismay over acute shortage of oxygen, wondering why the need for it had not been anticipated immediately after outbreak of the disease, leaving patients in a lurch in the midst of the corona crisis.They called for installation of liquid oxygen generation plant besides other plants in hospitals on the war footing, besides similar facilities at district hospitals to cater to needs of peripheral health institutions.They said the shortage of oxygen has proved detrimental to patient care, causing anxiety among the infected people and their attendants.Provincial president Devender Singh Rana, senior leaders Ajay Kumar Sadhotra,Surjeet Singh Salathia, Rattan Lal Gupta, Syed Mushtaq Ahmed Bukhari, Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, Sajjad Kitchloo, Kashmira Singh, Khalid Najeeb Suharwardy, Abdul Gani Malik, Javeed Rana and others signed the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nc-demands-increase-in-bed-strength-installation-of-oxygen-plants/story-xYwv2McbJG49ZRHyspCiQO.html

DC Sharma and Sabharwal are members of the high powered committee formed for shifting dairy units outside the city. In a letter to DC Sharma and MC chief Sabharwal on Thursday, Talwar said that the sewer lines in different parts of his constituency remain choked due to the dumping of cow dung by dairy owners. Talwar said that Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) had earlier proposed to set up an effluent treatment plant (ETP) for the Tajpur road dairy complex, but that project has been put to halt after a high powered committee was formed by the local bodies department for taking a final decision on shifting the dairy units in the last week of August.The committee has not yet been able to take a final decision regarding the shifting of dairy units, due to which residents of his constituency are facing troubles. The NGT has also directed the MC to stop dairy units from dumping waste into the sewer lines and Buddha Nullah. The high powered committee should take a final decision of shifting of dairy units in 15 days. If it is decided that dairy units would not be shifted, then the PEDA authorities should be directed to start the process of installing ETP, which would also take around two years. Sites being identified, but govt yet to decide: MayorA meeting of the high powered committee was held under the chairmanship of Mayor Balkar Sandhu at his camp office on Thursday. DC Sharma and MC chief Sabharwal also attended the meeting.Sandhu said that dairy units have to be shifted and four sites in villages have been identified. The officials have been asked to look into the feasibility of the project and a final decision would soon be taken in this regard. But final approval has to be given by the state government. “We are also working on the project to allow change of land use at the existing dairy complexes. Being a dairy owner myself, I have said that the CLU should be provided free of cost as dairy owners will also have to purchase the plots in new dairy complexes to be established outside the MC limits,” said Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/take-final-call-on-shifting-dairy-units-outside-city-limits-mla-talwar-urges-dc/story-U8GFXWRaSZKDuwf0l1SUrL.html

To another question on vacancies in hospitals in Bilaspur district, Saizal said recruitment is a continuous process and the said vacant posts would be filled on priority basis.Replying to Congress legislator Vinay Kumar, who asked why the status of 255 doctors appointed under the National Health Mission was contractual even after three years of service, the health minister said there is no provision for regularisation of doctors under the central programme. There are 1,154 employees of different categories and they are engaged under the rules of the Centre and the state government cannot do anything about it, Saizal said adding that out of these, 863 employees are engaged through outsourcing.Elaborating further, he said the Mission’s terms of service provide for recruitment of doctors on contract and outsourcing basis. “The recruits are engaged for one year at first and, if deemed necessary, their services are extended further. The state government’s rules do not apply here as it is the Centre’s programme,” the minister explained.Responding to a query raised by BJP MLA Reena Kashyap, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said the new sub-divisional magistrate office in Sarahan, for which 13 posts were approved, was now open and that its notification had been issued on August 22, 2019. Out of the 13 posts, 4 posts have already been filled and the remaining will be soon. The DC has issued orders to transfer the records from Rajgarh to Sarahan to start the work, said Bhardwaj.The minister also divulged that door-to-door garbage collection has been started in Solan city council and 191 employees have been engaged for the same. He said there are 25 dustbins for waste collection and orders have been issued to fix the four bins whose base is damaged.

While the occupants pelted stones on the team, the BJP raised an agitation against GLADA for damaging the idols kept inside the decades-old temple.Seeking FIR against the GLADA officials, the district BJP unit led by district president Pushpinder Singal staged a protest inside the Moti Nagar police station till late night on Wednesday. Following this, the police had lodged an FIR. Station House Officer, Moti Nagar police station, Inspector Simranjit Kaur said, “We have lodged an FIR against unidentified GLADA officials under Section 295-A of the IPC on the complaint of BJP leader Tirath Taneja. No official complaint has yet been filed by the GLADA officials after the drive was interrupted on Wednesday.”Meanwhile chief administrator of GLADA, PS Gill has written to commissioner of police, Rakesh Aggarwal, asking him to look into the matter and take action against those who had interrupted the drive and pelted stones on the team.

17-09-2020||City||Monsoon session: Ruckus over job reservation, SC/ST welfare in HP Assembly||Clamour continued in the Assembly on Thursday as the Opposition created ruckus over non-reservation of jobs for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and no allocation of funds from the SC/ST component plan.The Congress had given an adjournment notice under Rule 67 to discuss the issue on the penultimate day of the ongoing monsoon session.However, as soon as the subject was brought up, the Opposition and treasury members engaged in a heated exchange even as Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar kept urging them to let the discourse proceed smoothly.The issue was raised by Congress legislator Jagat Singh Negi, who demanded that it be discussed by adjourning the remaining House proceedings. He alleged that the state government was not concerned about the issues of Dalits and tribals. He called it discrimination and it led to a huge uproar from the BJP members.Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj argued that all matters cannot be discussed under Rule 67. On this, leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the House should discuss the issue raised by the Congress member.Soon, others from the Opposition started shouting slogans and when Negi claimed that they are not being heard, the former walked out of the house.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said since the beginning of the session, the Opposition had been creating unnecessary hullabaloo.He said that earlier Congress members had demanded to start the session without delay and when it was, they began running away from the discussion.Since the Speaker had already ruled that more than one subject could not be discussed under Rule 67, the Opposition should not have staged a walkout, the CM said.He said usually only one serious and urgent topic can be discussed under the rule and that has already been done. “It is totally wrong for the Opposition to make such remarks that only one side is being heard.”Claiming that the government was in full cooperation and answering all questions, the CM said there is not a single subject to which the former has not responded.Bhardwaj said as a parliamentary affairs minister he has to talk to the Speaker and Secretary on many topics related to the functioning of the House and whatever happens in the chamber is not discussed in the House.He argued that the discussion sought by Negi could have been held under any other rule, but not Rule 67, as the most pressing matter of Covid-19 has already been discussed under it.The Speaker said Congress members Jagat Singh Negi, Mohan Lal Brakta, Nand Lal and Colonel Dhaniram Shandil had sought a discussion under Rule 67 over government jobs not being given to SC/STs and non-release of funds from SC/ST component plan. A notice under Rule 130 in the same regard came from CPI (M)’s Rakesh Singha and has been sent to the government for a reply, Parmar said.“The way Negi is trying to create sensation in the House by talking about this issue is wrong,” the Speaker added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-session-ruckus-over-job-reservation-sc-st-welfare-in-hp-assembly/story-wGgbZDiVWPwOXAxrx1QnCP.html

They said that notices are being served to decade-old shops when CLU norms were not even notified.Councillor Sunita Rani said, “We have demanded that the mayor should call a house meeting on the issue. The recovery of CLU charges should be deferred for two years and the rates should also be revised to bring some relief to residents. If the MC does not stop harassing the public, we will be forced to take to roads in protest.”Former councillor Inder Aggarwal said that they have also demanded that MC should drop the town planning scheme in the city, which will also bring down the CLU charges. Also, the hike in development charges for residential properties, wherein the charges have been increased from 174 per yard to 518 per yard, should be rolled back, he added.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “We will table the issue in the upcoming MC house meet. We also want that CLU charges should be reduced but the final decision has to be taken by the state government.”Earlier, senior deputy mayor, Sham Sundar Malhotra, Congress councillor-cum-chairman of Punjab State Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) and shopkeepers in different parts of the city had also opposed the recovery of CLU charges amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-seeks-revocation-of-clu-notices-to-shopkeepers-in-ludhiana/story-CXqmbeKmjc0z9SUguAE7nL.html

Any person requiring medical assistance will need to be taken outside Spiti for treatment and maintaining social distancing in cold will not be possible.“We collectively believe that our valley cannot afford to get exposed to this pandemic before the winter,” said Targe.The decision to close down tourism is a difficult one for us as the valley depends heavily on it, but it is a necessary step to help curb the entry of Covid-19 into Spiti, he added appealing the tourists to cancel or postpone their plans for the season.‘Make Covid report mandatory’ Targe said the decision to open the border was expected as the state government has to consider every aspect, including Himachal’s economy.However, it was shocking that the condition of having a Covid negative report was removed, targe said adding, “The government should reconsider the decision and make the report mandatory. It would help keep the state safe from the pandemic.”Targe also complained that the government didn’t carry out any awareness drive to educate people about the importance of social distancing and other norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-keep-virus-away-spiti-valley-to-remain-closed-for-tourists-till-october-31/story-aDA1bxrKYHkLoYy5NaD5rO.html

He also stressed on collaborations with other institutions in the area of research.He said this in an online panel discussion on “National Education Policy and agricultural education and research” organised by PAU. Many vice-chancellors and former V-Cs of various universities, fellows of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) and faculty of PAU participated in the discussion.More than 160 participants comprising renowned educationists and agricultural experts attended the deliberations.Dhillon said that change is a must but a balance between old and new has to be maintained.“PAU has already been multidisciplinary by producing eminent agricultural scientists, litterateurs, great poets, artists, Olympians, etc. The university has made tremendous strides in the challenging times of the Covid-19 pandemic by staying connected with 40,000 to 50,000 farmers on Facebook and now, it is all set to hold virtual kisan mela on September 18 and 19,” he added.“Flexibility and multidisciplinary approach in education are important but societal change is equally vital. Student’s outlook needs to be changed in order to meet the needs of the global standards,” said Dhillon.Lauding emphasis on mother tongue and school education in NEP, he said, “Every culture has its own importance and it must be recognised.”Jai Rup Singh, founder V-C of Central University of Punjab, Bathinda called the NEP “a well-drafted and articulated document.” But he expressed concern over the emphasis on ‘multidisciplinary education’ in the policy. “As per NEP, it is written that by 2030, there shall be at least one large multidisciplinary higher educational institution in or near every district. With a total of 739 districts in India and 950 universities (as per UGC on August 4) in addition to a huge number of colleges and standalone institutions, how are the educational institutions going to thrive? There is no money to pay salaries,” he said. “The implementation of a multidisciplinary approach is a challenge as each university has its own niche and expert area,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-year-msc-in-agriculture-not-viable-as-per-nep-says-pau-v-c/story-kMadh9KeYYNFt3fkypY2pJ.html

He said the proposed laws will “destroy” the 50 years of hard work done by successive Punjab governments to build the farm sector. He recalled Punjab’s massive contribution in making India self-sufficient in food grain production as he vehemently opposed the bills. He also announced in the House that Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal will resign from the government, which she did in the evening. Sukhbir, who had earlier opposed the bill to amend Essential Commodities Act, was on Thursday participating in the debate on the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill. The two bills were taken up together for discussion in the Lok Sabha. On Tuesday, he had opposed amendment in Essential Commodities Act. “Our party was not consulted before the ordinances were framed. The centre erred grievously in not taking stakeholders on board,” Sukhbir said. “Some states are industrialised, some are tourism intensive, some have information technology industries, while Punjab depends on agriculture. We have focused on agriculture because there was time when our country was fighting hunger. The state accounts for just 2.5% land of the country, but we contributed up to 80% of food requirement in the 1980s and now our contribution is 50%,” Sukhbir said. “We are a party of farmers and if they are apprehensive, we will stand with them,” he said, adding that if the bills were passed, the purchase of food grain will be monopolised by the corporates. He also clarified that SAD continues to be a constituent of the NDA. “We took up the matter at all fora, and farmers were not satisfied. We can’t stand with bills which farmers are opposed to,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-badal-opposes-farm-bills-in-ls-says-laws-will-destroy-50-yrs-of-hard-work/story-4ZgZ12YbQoCf53VNncdNJI.html

The police said a large part of the seized contraband was concealed in a tyre of a tractor that was lying abandoned in the shrubs of a forest department’s land situated across the Ravi river near Kakkar village of Ajnala sub-division in Amritsar. The village falls along the India-Pakistan border. The arrested accused are Sarabjit Singh aka Sabha, and Surjit Singh aka Billu of Kakkar village, and Jagtar Singh aka Daya (employee of the forest department) of Rania village, which too falls under the Ajnala sub-division. Police said the accused, who have confessed to having links with some Pakistan-based drug smugglers, had been getting heroin supply from across the border in the guise of tilling the forest department’s land across Ravi. Addressing a press conference in Batala, inspector general of police (IGP-Amritsar range) SPS Parmar said the trio were arrested at a barricade at the Bhagat Singh Chowk in Fatehgarh Churrian. “At the time of the accused’s arrest, 157gm of heroin and an electronic scale were recovered from their possession. During interrogation, the accused confessed that they had been in contact with some Pakistani smugglers. They also told the police that they have hidden a large quantity of heroin near the border,” said the IGP. SSP Rashpal Singh said after the confession, a search operation was launched across the Ravi River and along the international border in Kakkar village with BSF officials. “We recovered 16 packets of heroin weighing around 5.4-kg from the tyre of Holland company hidden in the shrubs on forest department land. We also seized four more packets weighing 1-kg from the shrubs,” said the SSP.

The tractor was to be transported in a boat from across the Ravi to Kakkar village. Police added one of the accused Surjit Singh was expert in rowing a raft. The trio had been getting information of the heroin from Pakistan-based smugglers though WhatsApp calls.

A 1993-batch IPS officer, Chawla was holding the charge of administration, telecom and information technology. The home minister, it is learnt, was upset with ADGP Chawla for not complying with his orders, including proposals to transfer police officials. “The ADGP, administration, did not respond to any communication sent by me.

The home minister said Chawla was entrusted with the task of implementing universal helpline number, Dial 112, an emergency response support system for informing the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. “But the Dial 112 project is also at a standstill, which is why I have ordered that all his charges be withdrawn,’’ the minister said. On being asked as to why he paid an unscheduled visit at the police headquarters in Panchkula on Thursday, Vij said he went there to check whether his orders to divest ADGP Chawla of all charges were being complied with or not. As per the orders issued, three officers will now supervise the work looked after by Chawla till further orders.

He will come to the office but will have no work to do,’’ the home minister said.

Holding a virtual briefing, Khattar said the Opposition was misleading farmers about the three agriculture related bills introduced by the Central government in the Lok Sabha. The chief minister said the three bill will not lead to closure of government mandis as was being said by the Opposition. “Procurement of crops on MSP will continue and no procurement will be done below MSP,” he said. He said that the Bills introduced by the Central government would only empower farmers to directly engage with potential buyers at a price higher than the MSP and eliminate free trade barriers in agricultural production. He said that with regards to contract farming, no contract will be signed with the farmers below MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-committed-to-procure-crops-on-msp-khattar-assures-farmers/story-IpeEksuLNrtujNL5ZINbDN.html

Digvijay Chautala, who is younger brother of deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and president of INSO, the youth wing of the JJP, said the “JJP apologises to the farmers subjected to lathicharge.” He said, “JJP was always with the farmers...and interests of the farmers are always supreme for the party. After watching the video of lathicharge on farmers, the first thing we did was to condemn the incident as it was wrong.”He said the JJP had also demanded an inquiry into who issued orders for the lathicharge. “The police were wrong to resort to lathicharge,” he said. Stating that the Central and state governments had already made it clear that foodgrains will continue to be procured under minimum support price (MSP), Digvijay said some political parties were misleading farmers.

They also wore black robes, saying “I am a farmer and farm labourer and don’t betray me”.“We will oppose these bills from Parliament to panchayats.

17-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana enacts law to validate de-licensing of land||Haryana governor SD Arya has assented to the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (second amendment and validation) Bill, 2020 passed by the assembly on August 26 to legitimise de-licensing of land with retrospective effect (January 30,1975). A notification in this regard was issued on September 14 by the law secretary. The newly enacted validation law has come as a major relief to the developers of the Gurgaon-based Ambience Mall and other cases involving de-licensing of land. The Punjab and Haryana high court had on July 10 quashed the town and country planning department’s October 18, 2001 and September 1, 2010 orders to de-license two chunks of land (8 acres and 3.9 acres) of the 18.98 acres approved for constructing the Ambience Lagoon Island residential complex. It allowed raising a commercial complex, the Ambience Mall, on de-licensed land. The CBI, on HC orders, had also registered a criminal case in the matter. More than 54 cases of de-licensing of land were also discovered by the department after the high court orders. The HC had termed the term de-licensing a misnomer in the context of the Act and the case at hand. The bench said that state counsel had admitted that there was no such provision in the Act. The court also said the department’s argument that clause 21 of the General Clauses Act, which gives power to grant a licence also contains implied power to de-license, was bereft of any merit or logic. During the one-day monsoon session around three weeks ago, the state assembly had passed the Bill thereby approving insertion of a new clause section 3 (a) in the Act which would give the power to add to, amend, vary, suspend, withdraw or rescind, license or notification, order, rule or direction or to de-license, from retrospective effect. The Bill also contained a significant validation clause which said that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal or any authority, any action taken or orders issued, things done or purporting to have been taken or done relating to sub section 3(a) of sections 3 by the director, before the commencement of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (amendment and validation) Act, 2020, shall be deemed to be as valid and effective as if such action, approval, orders were issued or action taken in accordance with its provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-enacts-law-to-validate-de-licensing-of-land/story-4VkYFVlw2MjLDc4SLRhddP.html
17-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers fret as basmati prices plunge below ₹2,000||The price of basmati varieties of rice has dropped below ₹2,000 leaving farmers who were hoping for a bumper harvest this season crestfallen. Grain markets across the northern districts of Haryana reported that paddy, especially PUSA-1509 (an early variety of basmati), was being sold for ₹1,800-₹2,000 per quintal. Farmers say the prices this season were around ₹800- ₹1,000 below last year, causing a loss of around ₹20,000 per acre. Rajbir Singh, who was selling his produce at the Ladwa grain market of Kurukshetra, said, “This is a bad year for farmers as private traders are purchasing paddy at an arbitrary rate. In the absence of buyers, I had to sell two acres of produce for ₹1,940 per quintal.”A farmer, Suresh Pal of Yamunanagar, said, “The few buyers in mandis are making the most of farmers’ helplessness. We cannot store our produce for long and so are selling at a loss.” Growers of parmal and PR varieties of paddy are not faring any better as government agencies are yet to start procurement.Aggrieved farmers allege that in the absence of government agencies, they are selling their produce for around ₹1,300- ₹1,400 per quintal, which around ₹500 less than the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government.“For the last five days, my produce is lying in the grain market as the traders are not ready to purchase it for above ₹1400,” said Subhash Chand of Yunispur village, Karnal.Procurement should have begun from September 15: BKU Reportedly, government agencies will begin procurement from October 1. However, farmers have demanded that the government advance the procurement as most varieties will be harvested within three months.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Tikait) president Ratan Mann says, “Most crops take three months to harvest. This year paddy transplantation began from June 15, thus the government should have ensured that procurement began from September 15.” In another setback for farmers, the All India Rice Exporters’ Association (AIREA) has decided not to procure paddy until the government exempts the market fee on paddy procured from the grain markets.AIREA president Nathi Ram Gupta said, “In the interest of farmers, the government should exempt the market fee and rural infrastructure development fee, which is around 4% on paddy procured inside the mandis of the state. After all, the government has exempted market fee on the paddy procured outside the mandi.”In this regard, AIREA has issued an advisory to private traders asking them not to procure paddy till the government decides on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-fret-as-basmati-prices-plunge-below-2-000/story-GqZFElMs1s7EghIhn9BL2I.html
17-09-2020||Pune||Maha forest department to tag leopards as part of four-year academic study||The state forest department, Pune region in association with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has started a joint leopard monitoring project in the wake of rising number of leopard spotting in the district. The initiative has received permission from the state government to study hotspots in the district and place collar tags on leopards. The department has maintained that leopard tagging would lead to professional research and academic study on the leopards and their ecosystems. According to the forest department, collar tagging will help them in finding movement patterns, population demographics and its behaviour for future conservation of the endangered species.The four-year leopard study is divided into four phases. In the first phase, the leopard hotspots will be located in Pune district. The hotspots are at forty villages which come under the jurisdiction of Junnar, Ambegaon, Khed and Shirur tehsils of the district. The second phase of study will comprise study of leopard habitat, lifestyle, its path trajectory and leopard population census in the district. Junnar forest division incharge and deputy conservator Jairam Gauda, said, “In order to study the leopard ecosystem and other details, it was essential that they be collar tagged.The state government has given us the permission for tagging and academic research work will begin soon. As part of the next phase which includes leopard census, we will study the area where leopard visits or spotting are the maximum. We will conduct an area survey which includes setting up of camera traps.The camera traps will be set up at every two kms which will help us keep a close tab on leopard movement and at the same time ensure safe surveillance of the wild animal.”Based on the inputs of leopard surveillance, the forest department will be able to prevent man-animal conflict and accordingly devise a policy for the safety and security of animals, Gauda said.Over the past few years, the talukas of Junnar, Khed, Ambegaon and Shirur have witnessed maximum leopard spotting. According to the forest department, new areas comprising north Daund, Baramati, Indapur and road which goes to South Satara have also seen leopard visits. The said areas will see more number of leopard spotting in the near future, forest officials said.Wildlife experts maintained that paddy farming had gone up thrice in the district. Paddy fields provide ideal cover for leopards to hide and increase in paddy cultivation has led to an increase in leopard population and area of influence. Recently, a two-year-old leopard was found dead after being mowed down at the Katraj tunnel on August 15. Seven leopard attacks- one in Hinjewadi and the second in Keshavnagar -were reported in the district in 2019 wherein two persons were killed and seven were reported to be injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/maha-forest-department-to-tag-leopards-as-part-of-four-year-academic-study/story-ipML3HxVWRpEu81DjTu6bO.html

But Har-Ki-Pauri was opened for sacred Ganga dip for pilgrims though it was ensured that social distancing norms and entry-exit of pilgrims were properly managed,” said Lal.Pradeep Jha, the president of Ganga Sabha that manages the Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat, said since March 17 this was the first time that such a large number of pilgrims arrived there. “We thank the administration for listening to our suggestions with regard to lifting the prohibition on taking a dip at Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat on Pitra Amavasya. We hope...more pilgrims and tourists come to Haridwar,” he said.At Narayani Shila only morning and evening aarti was held by temple priests.Chief priest of Narayani Shila, Pundit Manoj Kumar Shastri, said the temple committee was of the view that it should remain closed on Pitra Amavasya because of Covid-19.Police personnel were deployed at Har-Ki-Pauri’s entry and exit points to ensure social distancing and prevent overcrowding.“Today [Thursday] is the last day of Shraadh period of 16 days and it has brought us hope of normalcy soon returning here as well as elsewhere in the country. We are also hoping that soon Covid-19 vaccine comes up and Mahakumbh is held in a grand way,” said Sanskrit-Vedic scholar Tesu Raj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/haridwar-pilgrims-throng-har-ki-pauri-on-pitra-amavasya/story-mcS1EyAZcJzVcI1tWQqHAO.html

They have asked us to supply around 6 tonnes of nettle grass per year. We have sent them samples which are being tested. The company is ready to take uncarded samples also. This [offers] great scope for youth and women in getting employment in this sector,” said Manoj Chandran, the Board’s chief executive officer.Also read: May take decades to clean Ganga water, say expertChandran said the Board is in talks with other firms also. “As we have a fixed market, regular purchases can be made in the nettle season. After collection of the raw material, we process it to make yarns and villagers weave different products for sale. But now only a small quantity is being produced. We are planning to export nettle grass which will encourage more people to get involved in this field. They can practise farming of the grass or earn through collection and processing of the raw grass.”A Board’s study has found there are 96 different types of nettle grass available in Uttarakhand. The Himalayan nettle grass among them has the maximum fibre content--85%--making it suitable for textile and related industries.STS Lepcha, a former principal chief conservator of forest, said that Himalayan nettle grass is found in high-altitude areas, mostly above 2000 m. “In 2007-08, the minimum support price for Himalayan nettle grass was Rs 40 per kg which has now increased to almost around Rs 70. ...we are also encouraging locals to cultivate it.”The Uttarakhand government has been making tea from nettle grass and selling it through development cooperatives. A collection centre and carding facility are also being set up in Rishikesh to increase its production.Chandran said the Board is working on developing techniques through which the fibre made from this grass can be used for making car bodies.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat last year wore jackets made of nettle grass to promote the use of its products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/eye-on-european-market-uttarakhand-promotes-himalayan-nettle-grass-goods/story-22rvjhotKE8pQPmjxhUp3I.html
17-09-2020||City||SAD should now quit central govt, says farm cell head Maluka||Bathinda With a dharna by agitated farmers outside the residence of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal entering its third day on Thursday, farmers’ cell head of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Sikander Singh Maluka said the party should now quit being part of the Central government.“As a whip has been issued, SAD’s five MPs (two in Lok Sabha and three in Rajya Sabha) are bound to vote against the controversial farm bills. The coalition dharma says an ally should quit the partnership, if it opts to vote against the bill moved by the government. There is a general feeling that quitting the ministerial berth in the Centre is the only option that Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal had,” Maluka, a confidant of the Badal family, told HT on Thursday.Activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) started a six-day dharna outside the residence of Badal at Muktsar district’s Badal village on Tuesday. Maluka, also a core committee member of SAD, said Akalis had a historic political association with the BJP, but the party chose to oppose the farm bills as it always stands with masses.On September 3, SAD had released a video message of the Akali patriarch Badal stating the three ordinances (now bills) are in favour of the farming community. Badal had charged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and other political parties of misinterpreting the bills as anti-farmers. Maluka, however, admitted that the party had to oppose the bills due to widespread resentment among farmers. SAD opted to be the voice of farmers as the common agriculturist seriously apprehend that assured purchase by the government would be gradually taken over by the private sector, and the corporate sector would monopolise agriculture.“It is still being debated if the bills are in the interests of farming or not. But, a common farmer has been made to understand it is against the agrarian community. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s opposition of the bills on the floor of the House has been welcomed by our entire chain of workers,” Maluka added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-should-now-quit-central-govt-says-farm-cell-head-maluka/story-CJt9W7gVvmxXJuHzFQeaHK.html

The woman said she then took a second opinion where the deformity was confirmed, and moved high court to seek permission to terminate the pregnancy as it had by then crossed the 20-week limit set by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.Also Read: RTI activists seek resumption of services of quasi-judicial bodies in MaharashtraOn August 27, she was referred to a medical board of specialist doctors by the high court.

This decision was taken at the meeting, chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, in line with the recommendations of the committee, constituted under the chief secretary by the higher education department, to consider the representations received from various sponsoring bodies for relaxation/amendment in various clauses of the policy-2010 for the establishment of new private universities in the state. The cabinet also gave the nod to amend provision 4.3(g) of the policy, making the sponsoring body eligible for setting up a private university on leased land, subject to the lease being a long-term one, for 33 years, from a government authority or gram panchayat. The Punjab Private University Policy-2010 had no provision for taking land on lease for setting up a university, while most states have such an enabling provision of land requirement. Under the policy, the state government has so far approved 14 universities. There is a proposal to establish four more private universities.CLU waiver for Radha Soami Satsang bhawans The cabinet also approved waiver of fee for Change of Land Use (CLU) and several other charges for Satsang Bhawans established, or to be established in future, by Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) across the state. Apart from CLU, the other charges to be waived include external development charges (EDC), permission fee (PF), social infrastructure fund (SIF) and building scrutiny fee. It may be recalled that the state government has already exempted above charges for educational, health, religious and social institutions set up by SGPC, Durgiana Mandir, Amritsar and Devi Talab Mandir, Jalandhar, by a notification in 2012. Sub-committee to finalise modalities for PACL disinvestment A proposal for formation of an empowered cabinet sub-committee on disinvestment of 33.49% equity shareholding of Punjab Alkalies & Chemicals Limited (PACL) was given clearance. The sub-committee will comprise cabinet ministers Brahm Mahindra, Manpreet Singh Badal and Sunder Sham Arora. This decision was in response to the proposal mooted by directorate of disinvestment and public enterprises. The other members of the committee will include principal secretary (finance), principal secretary (industries), managing directors of PSIDC and PACL, besides director public enterprises and disinvestment as its convener. 15th finance commission tied grants for rural piped water Priority will be given to providing functional house tap connections (FHTCs) in the remaining 17.59 lakh households from the tied grants for water under the 15th Finance Commission to meet its 2022 target of 100% piped water connectivity. It was also decided to push Phase 2 of Swachh Bharat Mission (gramin), for making all villages in the state open defecation-free in next 5 years. Co-op audit (group-b) service rules to be amended The cabinet gave its approval to amend the Punjab Cooperative Audit (Group-B) Service Rules, 2016, by merging the post of senior assistant (accounts) with that of senior assistants, to pave the way for promotional avenues to the senior assistant (accounts) working in the audit wing of the cooperative department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-relax-constructed-area-condition-for-universities-to-promote-higher-education/story-avo8Iaw4eI5iOCFfhr7ngK.html
17-09-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ahead of Cabinet reshuffle, Bhaya meeting Pilot creates buzz||The infighting in Rajasthan Congress seems unending. After a Congress MLA wrote to chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanding removal of an unnamed corrupt minister from the Cabinet, mines minister Pramod Jain Bhaya met former state party chief Sachin Pilot and then Gehlot on Wednesday, leading to speculations that all was not well in the Cabinet which is expecting a reshuffle in some days. Also read: All bodies recovered from Chambal river in Rajasthan boat tragedyBhaya was believed to be made a minister from Pilot’s quota in Gehlot’s Cabinet but stayed with the latter even after Pilot’s rebellion along with 21 other MLAs.On Wednesday morning, around 11.30 am, Bhaya reached Pilot’s residence in Civil Lines and had a closed-door meeting till 12.15pm. He is probably the first Cabinet minister, who met Pilot, after the Congress high command was able to end Pilot’s rebellion mid-August by assuring him that his concerns would be addressed.Outside Pilot’s residence, Bhaya said he was visiting Pilot as he hadn’t met the leader for a long time. “When two politicians meet, they obviously talk politics,” he said. Thereafter, Bhaya met Gehlot at his residence at around 2pm. The meeting lasted for about half an hour.On September 14, a letter by Congress MLA Bharat Singh had circulated on social media, in which he demanded removal of a minister (without naming anyone), calling that minister a mafia of corruption. Singh, member of state wildlife board, is considered close to Gehlot. A senior leader familiar with the development, requesting anonymity, said both the MLA and Bhaya come from Hadoti region of Rajasthan and have not been on the best of terms.The leader said Bhaya’s meeting with Pilot should be seen in the light of Bharat Singh’s letter and that the minister’s performance was discussed at meetings with party high command recently. “As a reshuffle is expected soon, Bhaya’s meeting the two leaders could save his ministerial berth,” the leader said.Bhaya refused to comment on Singh’s letter, saying he was a senior and respectable leader. “He can have his personal opinion. I do not want to comment. In democracy, all are free to write,” he said. A second Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Certainly, the meeting has it political meanings, especially after the month-long political crisis. A clear line between Gehlot and Pilot camp is drawn, things might look settled but differences are very much there, and amid this, the meeting has created a buzz of reshuffle.” Finding an opportunity to attack the Gehlot-led government, BJP leaders quoted Singh’s letter to claim that corruption was prevalent in his Cabinet. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat tweeted, “It seems that part-2 of the film nakara-nikama by the Chief Minister is going to be released soon.” Reacting to Shekhawat’s tweet, Independent MLA and Gehlot loyalist Sanyam Lodha asked who the big brother had chosen for part two of film nakara-nikama. Naming three BJP leaders, he tweeted that they had played a key role in nakara-nikama part-I. “Now tell who the mota bhai (big brother) has chosen for part-II,” he tweeted. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said Congress is one party that faces such issues whenever it is in power. Earlier, there were no challenges but they are a serious concern and they should keep their house in order. “In every party there are rivalries, in Congress, it is out in the open whereas in BJP, it is behind close doors. They haven’t learnt how to run an organisation, especially when they have an opponent like (PM) Modi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-ahead-of-cabinet-reshuffle-bhaya-meeting-pilot-creates-buzz/story-ExhHe6ladvoPBYlQH8FRTL.html
17-09-2020||Pune||11 of 50 Covid-positive children in Pune develop multisystem issues; 6 show brain ‘involvement ‘||Of the 50 children admitted at two city hospitals, 11 reported severe Covid-19 symptoms including multisystem inflammatory and six of those eleven showed impact on their brain, said treating doctors. As more cases are now being reported among children, the complications among the paediatric patients are also coming forward. The hospitals are defining children as anyone below 18 years of age. Of the six kids, a 13-year old girl child lost her life during the course of her treatment two months ago at Sahyadri hospital. Doctors at both the hospitals have now studied these kids and found that the virus has evolved which is leading to such complications in kids who could be saved through earlier detection and treatment. Dr Sagar Lad, a senior paediatric intensivist consultant at Sahyadri and Jehangir Hospital said “Among the six we lost one child who was admitted just six to eight hours ago, the other five are now healthy and discharged. We noticed that these children report paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood (MIS-C). The children tested Covid-19 antibody-positive so they were once infected but are now not infective. The antibodies developed during the course of the infection by the body ended up damaging their own system.” Dr Lad also said, “The children showed symptoms of brain involvement, excessive sleepiness, altered sensorium, convulsions and severe headache. Since the antibody test is positive so these are the post-infection complications. The children who might test negative for the infection may show such symptoms later so they must be watched for signs including rashes, swelling, fever for over 48-72 hours, swelling on joints, redness, excessive sleepiness, irritating behaviour. However, it must be emphasised that not all children report this and with timely intervention, the child could be saved as the recovery rate is good among children.” Dr Pradeep Suryawanshi - head, department of Paediatrics and Neonatology, Sahyadri Speciality Hospital who was also part of the study said, “Covid-19 was assumed to be a relatively benign disease in children but since the last three months there are various cases coming up with hyperinflammatory syndrome secondary to Covid-19 infection. Generally, children are less affected because receptors, where Covid virus attaches in the breathing tract, are less in children. But PIMS TS disease is seen 3-4 week after Covid-19 infection. There is a formation of auto-antibodies which damages the blood vessels in the body, especially of heart causing disease called Kawasaki like disease and also produces a shock.” “These patients need aggressive treatment. If we diagnose it early and treat appropriately chances of recovery are good and do not produce any complications. Hence, prompt recognition of PIMS/MIS-C is of utmost importance as it can improve outcomes,” said the doctors. The doctors also cleared that not all children with Covid-19 land up in PIMS as it depends on the child’s immune system to handle such infection. Only a few cases have been reported in the world so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/11-of-50-covid-positive-children-in-pune-develop-multisystem-issues-6-show-brain-involvement/story-wwsXdJAl4nRMEN4cg8grRI.html

Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, district civil surgeon and nodal Covid-19 officer said, “It could not be said conclusively as to why male gender is more affected than the female gender. There could be multiple factors including lifestyle habits like smoking and alcohol which leads to comorbidities. workstyle, physical activity, and also that the female gender has more immunity than the male gender. However, we cannot say for sure which factor is the most contributing factor.

The extension of 90 days was granted over and above the maximum period of 180 days prescribed under section 36-A (4) of the NDPS Act, which expired on June 28, 2020.Igwe’s counsel, Advait Tamhankar submitted that the order passed by the special court was not only illegal and perverse but was also against the mandate of section 36-A (4), since it was passed sans “application of mind”. He pointed out that no independent report of the prosecutor, as required under section 36-A (4), was submitted for seeking the extension.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for NCB, conceded that the order did not indicate that there was an independent application of mind by the prosecutor. He, however, tried to justify the special court order saying the NCB application did have the grounds warranting the extension.Justice Prithviraj Chavan, however, rejected the request and said it is quite clear that section 36-A (4) requires a report by the public prosecutor and not the investigating officer, and the report should indicate the progress of investigation.“A bare look at the impugned order demonstrates a total non-application of mind by the special court, which cursorily passed the order without assigning any reasons, which is a sine qua non for further detention of the accused in custody” said justice Chavan.Also Read: Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally goes past 1.1mn“It is apparent from the application dated June 23, 2020 moved by the prosecution that it was signed by the intelligence officer of the NCB, Mumbai, which is simply endorsed by the Special Public Prosecutor by putting his signature,” said the judge.“It, therefore, cannot be said to be a report of the public prosecutor, as the public prosecutor seems to have acted like a postman,” the judge said.HC added that the right of default bail accrued to the accused in terms of section 167 (2) of CrPC has been thwarted by the special court by granting the extension.Observing that liberty of the Nigerian national needed to be protected, justice Chavan granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and one or two sureties in the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nigerian-man-caught-with-drugs-gets-bail-as-ncb-fails-to-file-charge-sheet/story-uhkyfTX4jQduzCCv8g6WaJ.html
17-09-2020||Chandigarh||Don’t need whip like Akalis, united in fight against farm bills: Punjab Congress leaders||Punjab Congress leaders on Thursday said that in contrast to the Akalis, their party was united over the farm bills and did not need a whip to vote against the Centre’s bid “to destroy the state’s agriculture”. They were reacting to a statement of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema over chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh leading a delegation to submit a memorandum to governor VP Singh Badnore on the issue “instead of directing his MPs to express solidarity with the farming community by voting against the agri ordinances”. “The Congress MPs have been fighting against these dangerous anti-Punjab ordinances from the outset and knew which way to vote, unlike those of the SAD, whose MPs were lost due to lack of clarity or direction from their leadership, which has been changing its stance on key issues to suit their personal interests,” said Manish Tiwari, also an MP. He was joined by state Congress president Sunil Jakhar and cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu. The Congress MPs, not just from Punjab but around the country, had voted against the bills, which, unfortunately, the BJP-led NDA, of which the Akalis continue to be a part, succeeded in passing through majority in the House by voice vote, they said in a statement. The Congress MPs already had clear directions from the party leadership, including Captain Amarinder Singh and the high command in Delhi, on the party’s stand on the ordinances, which the Akalis openly supported at the time of their introduction. “Why would they need new directions, given that there had been no change in Captain Amarinder’s or Congress stand on the issue, unlike SAD’s Sukhbir Badal?” they said in a release. ASK WHY SAD IS STILL PART OF NDA They pointed out that it was the SAD, along with the BJP, which had refused to reject the ordinances during the all-party meet convened by Captain Amarinder, and had subsequently stayed away from the Vidhan Sabha session to avoid voting for the resolution against the same. “The sudden U-turn by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal left Akali MPs at a loss to figure out what their party’s stand was, necessitating a whip to vote against the bills in Parliament,” they added. Even now, they said, Sukhbir and his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a minister in the Union Cabinet, continue to cling to their pretence of power in the NDA in the hope of promoting their petty personal interests. “Why has Harsimrat not quit the Cabinet? Why has Sukhbir not pulled the SAD out of the NDA even after the Narendra Modi government failed to address their purported concerns on the farm bills?” the Congress leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-need-whip-like-akalis-united-in-fight-against-farm-bills-punjab-congress-leaders/story-CTYs681nwylJvF3WJtymsJ.html

The return flight, which was supposed to depart around 6:20 am was more than three hours late and took off around 10 am with 65 passengers, a senior airport official said. “These Kolkata-London flights are part of the Vande Bharat Mission and would continue till October 24,” an airport official said. Air India had started a direct flight between Kolkata and London in 2005. The services were, however, discontinued in September 2008 because of poor load factor. British airways, too, moved out of the sector in March 2009. The first Vande Bharat flight between London and Kolkata took off from Heathrow airport on September 16 afternoon and landed at the NSCBI airport in Kolkata in the early hours of Thursday. “The flight was scheduled to land around 2:20 am. But it landed almost an hour early around 1:20 am. It was a nice experience. It would be great if direct flights resume between Kolkata and London. It would help a lot of businessmen, students and even tourists,” said Vedanta Gupta, a passenger who arrived in Kolkata.

17-09-2020||Lucknow||UP’s women self-help groups crumble, family support system hit||The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on women self help groups (SHGs) in Uttar Pradesh (UP) as they struggle to make two ends meet in absence of work.“I work with a SHG that does zari work but I am without work since lockdown. Earlier, we used to get large orders in August and September due to Diwali but there are very few orders this time,” said Rubina Raza Khan, 40, a member of a Moradabad based SHG.“I used to earn around Rs 12,000 in these months but have not earned a single penny this year,” she added. The money Rubina earned played an important part in supporting her family of five, especially the education of her two daughters and a son. “I never went to school but ensured that my children go to a school and I used to pay their fees from my earnings. I don’t know how I will manage their fees this year,” she said in despair. According to an estimate by the state government, more than 15 lakh women SHGs are registered in UP, ranging from five members groups to those with more than 50 members.“SHGs are source of income for women, especially the housewives,” said senior economist and former advisor to state government, Ravindra Bhatia. Bhatia said the SHGs in India had a very good track record of returning the loans but the Covid-19 situation can change this. “Although the majority of loans taken by SHGs are of small values, the group will face difficulties in returning them due to the decline in earnings. SHGs will have to either expand their expertise or change their work to continue to be in operation in these testing times,” he added. Also Read: Despite surge, only 35% of Covid beds occupied in GB Nagar, most remain in home isolation According to national bank for agricultural and rural development (NABARD) data, more than Rs 23,320 crore is deposited by SHGs registered with it across the country.

17-09-2020||Chandigarh||Privatisation in agriculture in name of reforms: All India Kisan Federation||The All India Kisan Federation (AIKF) on Thursday supported the agitation launched by farmers in the country and state against the “anti-farmer ordinances” issued by the Centre. In a joint statement, AIKF president and general secretary Prem Singh Bhangu and Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, respectively, said that the ordinances indicate that the government is appeasing the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which is dictating since India became its member, to abandon the support price and state procurement of agriculture produces and implement recommendations of the Shanta Kumar committee. “This policy of privatisation in agriculture and handing it over to corporates is being carried out under the name of agriculture reforms,” Bhangu said in a statement. Opening of private markets, unrestricted trade, movement and unlimited storing and hoarding of agri-goods would open floodgates for big corporates and will abolish the small and marginal farmers, they added. “Parliament led by the BJP is going to pass the remaining two Bills also by the blatant misuse of its majority. But it will be in utter disrespect of the aspiration and sentiments of the people,” said the two leaders. They said that the state committee of the federation will meet in Doraha on Saturday to chalk out its protest strategy and submit a memorandum to the President for declining assent to the three bills passed by Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/privatisation-in-agriculture-in-name-of-reforms-all-india-kisan-federation/story-pOXcUT5zVJWVkjJzZihOEI.html

Jalandar authorities are, thus, finding it hard to meet daily targets.In many localities, most people with co-morbidities have refused to undergo covid tests even when teams visited their houses. Following this, local administrations in the Doaba region are now taking assistance of panchayats to ensure testing of all village residents.The administration has also asked Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) workers and panchayats in the district to generate more awareness among locals and ensure covid testing. “The biggest concern is that people are coming late for treatment and many are not willing to undergo the test. To tackle this, we are seeking help from gram panchayats and many have already submitted affidavits that they will cooperate with health officials,” said Kapurthala deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal.Jalandhar had identified 35,000 people and Kapurthala over 40,000 people with comorbidities such as fever, TB and non-communicable diseases in a survey in August. However, not even 40% of these have been tested yet, with most unwilling to get tested. Epidemiologist Dr Satish Kumar said rural areas were more challenging than urban, and that SDMs concerned and panchayat members are already visiting localities with health officials to assist them in sampling.“Health department officials are making efforts. There cannot be an immediate improvement and change in the attitude of people to come willingly for tests. Otherwise, we are conducting tests of hundreds of people a day,” said Dr TP Singh Jalandhar nodal officer covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-unwilling-to-go-for-voluntary-covid-testing-in-doaba/story-W5WIcegX1zTAAGmV5jnF8L.html

17-09-2020||Delhi||Wedding photogs get together: Protest no work, start campaign||A Delhi-based wedding photographer, Dev Verma, recently died by suicide. He used to work as a freelancer at the studios owned by Delhiite Raman Dipak, who tells us, “Dev was a freelancer with us and due to fewer weddings off late, he wasn’t getting much business... Most photographers like us are getting one fourth of the money that we used to get earlier for covering a wedding, and it’s very disappointing. We are not caterers! We have equal amount of work since our focus still remains to capture the memories of a family, in the best possible way. And those who can’t attend a wedding look forward to seeing the pictures and videos.” The incident has triggered a campaign to lend a helping hand to the wedding photographers in distress, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign states that the wedding industry has witnessed a scathing effect, and over 25 lakh people are on the verge of losing their jobs. Harpreet Bachher, founder, Association of Wedding Photographers of India (AWPI) — which has initiated the campaign — says, “This national union of professional wedding photographers came together as a joint entity to create this association during the pandemic. We have around 20 core members representing various states of India. The wedding photography industry consists of more than 50,000 people, and in the pandemic they have been through much (hardship). After Dev died by suicide due to financial issues, we started this campaign to help the community, financially and mentally. We urge those in distress to reach out to their state representatives, and we’ll try to help them in our best possible capacity.”Wedding photographers across India who had been crying hoarse and protesting about the tough time they are facing, since the pandemic struck their livelihoods, are hailing this campaign. Shweta Dhiman, a wedding photographer from Chandigarh, says, “I was a banker for 10 years and then quit my job to join this industry. Seeing our dear friend, Dev give up his life due to loss of work in the current economic slowdown was heart breaking... Our work is reviving now, but clients are not ready to pay as much they were initially. People don’t seem to understand that the photography requirements don’t reduce with the scale of a wedding.”In fact photographers believe that such initiatives are the need of the hour. “We are hoping that this campaign will help stop any other incident in the community, and will also clear Dev’s dues, so that the family doesn’t have to deal with financial issues and suffer further,” says Dhiman. And Bengaluru-based wedding photographer Anand Kumar, adds, “We need to be strong and prevent more people from dying this way. I’m trying my best to support the community, and also raise awareness about the issue through my social media.”If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

17-09-2020||Delhi||When life itself is an ode to the spirit of living||Dealing with a pandemic under normal circumstances is strenuous enough, but when you are detected with a life-altering disease, it takes great measures of courage to come to terms with it. Adarsh Dham, 62, was detected with High Grade Sarcoma Stage II in June. For this fiercely independent single mother who raised her two sons single-handedly on a government teacher’s salary, coming to terms with the life-altering implications of this disease was not easy.“At first, I was told to get an MRI because a tumour was detected and that, a simple biopsy would be required. I didn’t think much about it, but then there were two tumours which turned out to be cancerous,” says Dham, adding that she had no choice other than accepting it as part of her destiny. Her first surgery was on June 24, followed by another one on July 27, which took eight hours to complete. “I went in very peacefully and was not thinking about corona at all. Maine itni aage ki sochi hi nahi. The doctor had prepared us mentally for the surgery and its aftermath that there was no anxiety while going in,” she says. Her family, including her elder son, 33-year old digital marketing professional Apar Dham, however, was having sleepless nights. “Cancer is such an uncharted territory that you know nothing about it till it hits you. Tests, medical opinions and general running around to find the best treatment, plus the fear of the pandemic was such that we did not have time to take stock of the situation till after her surgery. Moreover, due to the pandemic, we couldn’t get as much support from our friends and extended family as we would have otherwise received. Only a few friends and relatives were able to come forward,” he shares. Read: This family believes that kindness is what will save the worldHer daughter-in-law, Anchal Dham, quit her job when the first diagnosis came. “There was no option of hiring a nurse or attendant because we didn’t want any outsider to enter our house or be near our mother. My brother Anupam also took a sabbatical to share the workload,” says Apar.Immediately after the surgery, Adarsh was administered morphine through an epidural to combat the pain and had multiple tubes coming out of her. “I was restricted to my bed and had difficulty even sitting up. The tubes came with their own set of complications and risk of infection,” she says. Explaining the implications of the surgery, Apar says, “A medical equipment, which is common in these surgeries, is going to be permanently attached to her. We have to get her special clothing which is loose and can be opened from the front for ease of movement. Earlier, she would need someone to help brush her teeth, change her on her side on the bed and clean-up after her. We can see it claws away at her dignity.”With the support of her family, she is tiding over these hurdles. “My babies look after me as if I am their child. They are around me all the time, so that I don’t overthink,” says this survivor who rang in her 62nd birthday on September 1. “We baked a cake at home and my kids got me some knick-knacks. We are trying to get back to normal,” she shares. Without losing a beat, Adarsh recalls how she used to travel every few months and take cruises with her friends. “The four of us want a break from this now. I wish to do all of that once my body allows and the pandemic dies out,” she concludes. With a loving family by your side, there’s no way you can let hope slip through your fingers.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/when-life-itself-is-an-ode-to-the-spirit-of-living/story-dVASJV9PBzY1fYPa6I7x2N.html
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Indian Navy develops Mumbai’s largest Miyawaki urban forest||A 2,500 square (sq) metres (m), or 0.6-acre, of barren patch in Malad in Mumbai has transformed into a mini urban forest with seven to nine feet (ft) trees in less than nine months.Between January and September, the Indian Navy, along with environment group Green Yatra, developed Mumbai’s largest dense plantation to date by using the Miyawaki technique (see box) on a plot in front of the main campus of Indian Navy Station (INS) at Hamla in Marve-Malad.Forests grown under the Miyawaki method – developed by Japanese botanist and plant ecology expert Dr. Akira Miyawaki – have improved carbon-dioxide absorption, have reduced noise and dust , and added more green surface area, as compared to monoculture plantation. Plants grow 10 times faster and 30 times denser than traditional techniques, with any average plantation area supporting 45 saplings across 150 square ft.At INS Hamla, 10,500 saplings of 40 different native species were planted in phases between January 18 and February 27. “The forest is flourishing under our care, and the plants have grown nine-ft tall with almost 100% survival rate. The location of the forest within the boundaries of the base provides protection to the plants, which are expected to become self-sustaining within a year,” said Captain Sridhar Warrier, chief public relations officer (CPRO), Southern Naval Command.According to Green Yatra, the entire plantation process – prior to January – took 2,400 labour hours and 440 machines, including excavators and dumpers, and involved excavating the bed area for the three-ft-deep plantations.The process included laying 200 dumpers worth of soil such as 165 tonnes of black soil and biomass, manual stone removal, levelling the land, developing a one-ft-high bed mount, making pathways and channels to supply six litres of water per metre square, and planting 10,500 saplings in two phases with each at least two-years-old.The plantation method using this technique focuses on density, said Pradeep Tripathi, founder, Green Yatra. “This is against the average plantation density of three to five plants per sq m depending on the site. Plantations at INS Hamla were four plants per sq m since the site is very close to the coast and there is high wind speed. Also, saplings support each other’s growth and prevent sunlight from reaching the ground halting the growth of unnecessary weeds,” he said.Fixing support sticks to each plant, remulching, and sprinkling microbes and boosters for proper plant development are an integral part of post-plantation maintenance. “Whenever there was any water shortage, the navy supported us with their own resources. We have had an overall survival rate of 98.5%,” said Tripathi. Native trees included a combination of deciduous and evergreen fruiting tree species such as amla, neem, mahua, kokam, mango, silk cotton, banyan, and pride of India. Around 40 species were divided into four layers, including 18 tree species, 12 sub-trees, four canopy species, and six shrubs up to three ft in size. Captain Warrier said a similar plantation drive – of 15,000 more saplings by next February -- was in the works known as the Miyawaki phase II, which would be located near the same site. “The first phase was funded by DCB Bank. This method of indigenous forest by native trees produces rich, dense and efficient protective forest in 20 to 30 years, while natural succession will need 200 years,” he said.Experts said such plantations were welcome for urban environments that are fast losing green cover but do not match the complex forest ecosystem. “These techniques cannot be substituted for natural forest, which represent the non-artificial cycle of carbon, oxygen, minerals and biodiversity, and cannot be replicated by artificial means. For urban spaces, these small green zones may have limited benefits such as reduction of particulate matter, improved oxygen supply, and minimal micro-climatic changes. However, these urban greening concepts cannot be undermined as there is hardly any land available amid the concrete expanse in major cities in the country,” said Dr. Subhash Ashutosh, director-general (D-G), Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun.STATUS OF MIYAWAKI PLANTATIONS IN MUMBAIPraveen Pardeshi, former commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), had last year proposed to plant 377,416 trees under the Miyawaki project at a cost of Rs 35 crore across 100 locations spread over 31 acres in Mumbai. “Our intention was to have half of the recreational areas of every layout should be a Miyawaki forest. Among the 100 locations, plots in Malad, Colaba, Worli and Priyadarshini Park have yielded good results. The idea is to transfer the cost of greening not just to the public exchequer but also the Mumbaikars gaining the most. The security of these plantations is also automatically protected,” said Pardeshi.Besides BMC’s efforts, five major plantations across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have been completed by Green Yatra. The following are the projects:Central Railside Warehouse Company Ltd, Jogeshwari, area 2,300 sq. m, ,7000 plants, 40 species completed in three phasesBhandup Complex, area: 1,200 sq. m, 3,500 plants with 46 speciesState Reserve Police Force Premises in Taloja, Navi Mumbai, area: 700 sq m, 2,000 plants with 40 speciesAmbernath, area: 100 sq. m, 320 plants with 40 speciesINS Hamla, area: 2,500 sq. m, 10,500 plants in phase I with 40 species and another 15,000 plants proposed in phase II in February, 2021.100 YEAR OLD FORESTS IN 10 YEARSWith over 3,000-odd urban mini-forests created using the Miyawaki plantation technique, which can accommodate 12,000 saplings in one-acre land, can increase the number of trees per person within Mumbai through native tree plantation within a brief span of time. The features of this technique include:- 10 times faster growth- 30 times denser than traditional plantations- More biodiverse- Better noise and dust reduction- 30 times better carbon dioxide absorption- Native and organic(Source: Green Yatra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indian-navy-develops-mumbai-s-largest-miyawaki-urban-forest/story-Gy70kJ0bDToRRVMkBqVWNO.html

Assam has been reporting around 2,500 new Covid-19 cases almost daily for around a month. So far, the state has recorded 148,969 Covid-19 cases. Also read: India crosses 60 million mark for Covid-19 testingIn September, the state reported around 40,000 new Covid-19 cases and over 200 deaths. The first Covid-19 positive case in Assam was diagnosed on March 31 and the first death due to the viral infection 10 days later. “In August, Assam had reported 68,000 Covid-19 cases and another 30,000 in the first 10 days of September. If the trend continues, we may record around 90,000 new Covid-19 cases in September alone,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said recently. The recovery and the death rate in the state is 80.10% and 0.34%, respectively, according to a bulletin issued by National Health Mission (NHM), Assam, on Wednesday. At present, the doubling rate of fresh cases is 33 days. Altogether, 2,815,285 tests, including both reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen detection (RAD), have been conducted across the state. The total tests per million population stand at 83,095. Around 1,000 recovered Covid-19 patients have donated plasma across the state until Wednesday and over 1,500 patients suffering from the contagion have been given plasma treatment, the NHM bulletin stated. Private hospitals are running out of regular beds and also in intensive care units (ICUs) in the state capital Guwahati, which is a part of the Kamrup Metropolitan district, because up to 500 new Covid-19 cases are being reported daily. However, beds are available in hospitals and dedicated Covid Care Centres (CCCs), said the minister. “We have adequate ICU and isolation beds in hospitals and there will be no problem in September. We are planning to increase ICU beds in a bid to cope with a rise in Covid-19 patients from October,” said Sarma. “Two large oxygen tanks are being set up in Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), which will be followed by similar measures in other medical colleges in a bid to meet the increased demand of oxygen for critically ill Covid-19 patients. It will help us store oxygen for at least 15 days,” he added. The minister said that there have been several cases in the state, where patients have died after recovering from Covid-19 . However, there has been no survey of the total number of such deaths, Sarma added. “Though the Covid-19 situation in Assam is critical, we are geared to cope with it. The public should take precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing stringently in a bid to rein in the viral infection,” said Samir Kumar Sinha, principal secretary (health), Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-covid-19-deaths-cross-500-cases-inch-close-to-150-000/story-QznBhCdgOtyvaFMCmB7g0M.html

Navratri organisers HT spoke to said that while they are waiting for the state government to issue guidelines, they are sure of not celebrating the festival this year. The nine-day festival begins from October 17.“Navratri is largely about garba and dandiya which is impossible with social distancing norms. So it is pretty clear that there will be no celebrations this year,” said Neil Somiaya, BJP corporator from Mulund, who has been organising Navrarti fest at Mulund East since the last few years.Pravin Chheda, who has been organising dandiya nights since 25 years in Ghatkopar said, “Even Ganesh Chaturthi was not celebrated the way it used to be. How can Navratri be celebrated without social gathering? The state might only allow societies to maybe do puja within the buildings.”Also read: India crosses 60 million mark for Covid-19 testingHT had reported that officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are also fearing a spike in cases with the festivals lined-up -- Navratri, Diwali, Christmas and New Years’. Mumbai had witnessed a plateauing of cases in August. However, the Ganesh festival, relaxations during Mission Begin Again and increased testing are widely believed to be behind the resurgence of cases in the city.The average daily Covid-19 cases shot up after Ganesh Chaturthi from nearly a 1,000 cases in August to 1,800+ cases in the first week of September. Some organisers, however, are considering ‘virtual Navratri’ to keep up the festival spirit. Jignesh Khilani, secretary of Ghatkopar Gujarati Samaj, which also hosted Falguni Phatak in 2017, said, “We are thinking on the lines of arranging virtual Navratri. We are waiting for the state’s guidelines on it.”On Wednesday again, the state surpassed another milestone of 1.1 million Covid-19 cases with 23,365 new cases recorded.

17-09-2020||Delhi||Protests against forced eviction of Delhi slum dwellers to be held||A coalition of non-governmental organisations, groups working for the welfare of the urban poor and slum residents will hold protests in Delhi and other parts of the country seeking consultations with slum residents for their rehabilitation in light of the Supreme Court’s August 31 order for the removal of 48,000 slums along railway tracks in the national capital. The Centre on Monday ruled out immediate evictions and told the court that discussions were underway to implement its orders. It added no coercive action will be taken against the slum-dwellers until a decision is taken. Congress leader Ajay Maken and slum dwellers have challenged the railways’ demolition notices, saying they had been issued in total disregard for the policy of rehabilitating them amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: Delhi govt offers all help to railways in rehabilitating slum dwellersThe Railway Basti Jan Sangharsh Morcha, the coalition, said it will hold the protests even as it welcomes the Centre’s promise of no coercive action against settlements on railway land for four weeks and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s assurance to slum dwellers that they would be a part of the consultative process over the issue.Basti Suraksha Manch convener Shakeel Ahmed said they will go ahead with the national day of protest and want the governments to accept their demands. “The residents should be consulted while the state and the Centre draw up a plan for their rehabilitation as it affects their homes and livelihoods.”Also Read: State, Centre did little to stop SC order on removal of slums along railway tracks: MakenThe coalition wants the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s policy for rehabilitation of slums to be followed and in-situ housing provided within 5km of the existing site.CityMakers Mission International facilitator Indu Prakash said the worst part is the court did not hear over 250,000 residents. “It is a supreme injustice done to these people, especially at a time when the country is fighting a pandemic.

Late in July, an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) was killed in a hit-and-run incident on the Rajokri Flyover. That was followed up by an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) getting mowed down by a car whose driver was signalled to stop during a checking in West Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar in mid August.The officer killed in the latest incident was identified as ASI Radhe Shyam, who was posted in the Burari traffic circle.The fatal hit happened around 4 pm while Shyam and his colleagues were checking vehicles for traffic violations. “Shyam had stopped a truck and was directing it to pull over to the side of the road when another truck from behind hit him,” said a senior police officer.An injured Shyam was rushed to hospital even as other police officers stopped the truck from escaping. Its driver, Deepak Shukla, has been arrested.Shyam was declared brought dead at the hospital. The police said that he has left behind a wife and two children who live in Rohini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-traffic-cop-mowed-down-by-truck-third-on-duty-officer-to-be-killed-in-three-months/story-4LFNSFU40oelGW4bcr99SM.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: High court to hear pleas against politicians for hate speech||The Delhi high court (HC) on Thursday will hear a bunch of pleas seeking registration of first information reports (FIRs) against several leaders across party lines for allegedly making hate speeches during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 agitation that eventually led to communal riots in north-east Delhi in February.One of the pleas had sought registration of FIRs against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma, who delivered hate speeches that had led to the violence, leaving 53 killed and over 400 injured. Mishra denied delivering hate speeches and distanced himself from the violence in north-east Delhi.Another plea had accused the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders of delivering hate speeches before the riots broke out. On February 26, the Human Rights Law Network had filed a plea on behalf of civil society activist Harsh Mander seeking FIRs against Mishra and Thakur to be booked for making speeches that purportedly triggered communal violence in north-east Delhi.An organisation named Lawyers Voice had filed an intervention in the plea on the following day, making similar allegations against several Congress and AAP leaders. A third plea by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind had said that the Delhi Police should be directed to preserve closed circuit TV (CCTV) footage of the riot-affected areas between February 23 and March 1. The plea had alleged that FIRs have not been lodged against persons responsible for the riots. Delhi Police has drawn flak for the arrest of student activist Umar Khalid (33) on Sunday night while refusing to act on the hate speeches by the BJP leaders. Khalid was in the forefront during the anti-CAA protests before the riots broke out in February. Earlier this week, nine retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officers wrote to Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava expressing their fears of law enforcing authorities cracking down on protesters while letting the “real culprits “ go scott free. Police have maintained that the riots were orchestrated by a section of anti-CAA protesters, who had mobilised people at the protest sites, delivered inflammatory speeches and planned the communal violence.Earlier, police had told the court that investigation into the north-east Delhi riots have not revealed any evidence that pointed towards the role of the leaders, who allegedly made hate speeches. Police had also said that there was “no actionable evidence” against the leaders indicating their role in instigating or participating in the riots. Mishra had said on July 15: “It is clear that the entire propaganda campaign against me was fake. People, who organised riots in Delhi, are filling fake complaints against me and some ‘urban Naxals’ tried to promote that. The fake campaign against me stands exposed. I am sure not only rioters but also their support groups in media and politics will be punished by the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-high-court-to-hear-pleas-against-politicians-for-hate-speech/story-yG4zwPKxjH0T7ioGtLux0N.html

17-09-2020||City||3 deaths a day, Kapurthala has Punjab’s worst Covid-19 fatality rate||With an average three deaths a day in the past one month, Kapurthala district now has Punjab’s worst Covid-19 mortality rate at 4.83%, followed by Ludhiana (4.28%) which has witnessed the highest number of cases of infection as well as fatalities in the state. Also, the death toll in Kapurthala has crossed the 100 mark. The authorities in the district, which recorded 1,570 positive cases and 85 deaths in the past one month, are struggling to curb the spread of the disease. On August 17 alone, the district reported as many 621 positive cases and 23 deaths. So far, it witnessed a total of 2,263 confirmed cases and 108 deaths from the virus. The mortality rate in Jalandhar, which has the second highest number of coronavirus cases among all the districts in Punjab, is 2.67% with 271 deaths. Other districts with higher number of deaths such as Amritsar (269) and Patiala (253) have a morality rate of 2.74% and 3.85% (till September 15). Moreover, hospitals in Kapurthala district do not have level-3 bed to treat critical patients. It only has level-1 and level-2 beds. When the patients’ oxygen level goes down, they are referred to the Amritsar Medical College with some preferring to go to private hospitals in Jalandhar for further treatment. The district health department officials have set a target of collecting 1,000 samples daily to detect cases at early stage and control the death rate. But on Tuesday, the district collected nearly 600 samples. “One of the major reasons behind spurt in cases and deaths is a lack of cooperation from the public. People arrive late for treatment and it leads to increase in death rate. Many people are not even willing to undergo a Covid test,” a senior health officer. Deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal said, “Most of the patients who died had comorbidities and they were taken late for treatment. The health department has launched a drive to take sample of patients with comorbidities.” “Nearly 40,000 people comorbidities have been identified so far. Over 15% sampling has been completed,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-deaths-a-day-kapurthala-has-punjab-s-worst-covid-19-fatality-rate/story-hgcVUQrCxp2N8XrxnTTuMK.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Welcome to the home of fakirs||Delhi is full of fakirs, often spotted at its many Sufi shrines, attired in their robes, turbans, and with begging bowls.But what’s their idea of home? These long-haired bearded men saddled with sacred necklaces and prayer beads.Some of these ascetics living in deliberate poverty can be spotted at the south Delhi Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nasiruddin Chirag Dehlavi. A 14th century tomb tucked in the corner of the shrine’s sprawling courtyard serves as a kind of long-term dormitory for visiting fakirs who might stay for months at a stretch.Their accommodation here is rustled out from within the tomb’s white chamber where any number of mattresses smell damp. This noon a washing line is strung along the facing wall, weighed down with lungis and drapes and even a track suit.The chamber has a niche stacked with dinner plates and mineral water bottles. The presence of a rat trap suggests that even the otherworldly must suffer from the nuisance created by some of God’s creations.Then there’s a small gas burner, along with a vessel filled with milk. Also spotted: a walking stick. And this all is a makeshift home for a fakir, a word that originated from the Arabic for poor.Adjusting a mattress, one of the fakirs, a man in his 30s, says that “we people don’t belong to anybody…when we get together, we enjoy each other’s company but we are not dependent on anybody for comfort.”He goes on to describe their scant materialpossessions as objects of utility “to which we attach no emotions.”Fakirs are solo souls, another gentleman clarifies, explaining that they have no family; an assertion that makes one of their bags hanging on a hook look poignant. It depicts a newly-wed couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/welcome-to-the-home-of-fakirs/story-cGmeKl69GCcnBKHycd72UL.html

As per Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, each MP needs to adopt five villages during his or her tenure. The office of Sangrur deputy commissioner wrote to the MP in August 2019, October 2019 and in September 2020, but he did not adopt any village. Mann said he will not adopt any village because the central government never released special funds for the scheme. “Even MPLAD funds have been suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. “How can I adopt a village without funds? If the government will not issue funds for a particular programme, we cannot develop the idea. If the Prime Minister wants to focus on villages, he should release special funds for development,” said Mann. Sources said that Mann had to face criticism during his first tenure when the adopted villages were not allegedly developed by the MP. “I raised the issue in Parliament today that the government may issue guidelines for the distribution of MPLAD funds but should not suspend them,” he said. “The government can cut our salary and allowances, but the MPLAD funds should be increased and released on time,” he said. Sangrur additional deputy commissioner (development) Rajinder Singh Batra said the MP didn’t respond to repeated reminders of the administration. “As per government guidelines, we have been writing to the MP, but the administration is still waiting for a favourable response from him,” Batra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sangrur-mp-bhagwant-mann-yet-to-adopt-a-village-says-can-t-do-without-funds/story-oAanQdHX7qn7eUmmy8kPIM.html

The CTU staff blamed it on the lack of awareness about the resumption of inter-state services, coupled with fear of infection.The buses were operational from both the bus stands—ISBT, Sector 17, and ISBT, Sector 43.“The conductor scanned us and asked us to sit leaving the middle seat empty,” said Ashok Nath of Jagatpura in Mohali, who was travelling with his wife and waiting for his bus at ISBT-17.Amit Gupta, general manager, CTU, said, “We started with 33 buses and all routes were functional. Occupancy-wise, it was a good start.”“The staff was instructed not to pick passengers on the route and to operate only between source and destination. However, certain buses that could not manage to get 26 passengers, passengers were picked up en route,” said a CTU staff member, wishing not to be named.After a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 23, CTU had suspended services. On June 10, CTU had briefly resumed bus services to neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab, but again suspended them after a few days owing to a sudden surge in the coronavirus cases. Passengers welcomed with thermal scanners, sanitisersAll bus conductors were provided with thermal scanners and sanitisers and every passenger was scanned before boarding.Despite the facility of purchasing tickets online through CTU website www.ctuonline.chd.gov.in or through the mobile app ‘CTU Musafir’, most passengers opted to purchase them from the conductor before boarding the bus.Every bus coming in or out of the bus stand was sanitised. The seats had stickers pasted on seats indicating ‘sit here’ and a cross mark meaning the seat was to be left empty. Most passengers were wearing masks with a few having replaced the protective gear with handkerchiefs.In some buses, the drivers used polythene sheets to separate themselves from the passengers and nobody was allowed to sit in the first three seats of the bus.Rush witnessed at bus standsThough people were largely seen maintaining social distancing, a few were found standing in groups while waiting for buses. Many had masks around their necks and opted not to wear them. “The conductors were asking passengers to wear masks properly, but no one checked those waiting at the bus stand,” said Shudhashu Mishra, a resident of Sector 49 who was travelling to Hoshiarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-transport-undertaking-resumes-inter-state-bus-service-to-thin-occupancy/story-qLlSoVdAC05YeneuufABbN.html

17-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid pandemic in Ludhiana: From 19 days in mid-August, doubling rate improves to 27 in September||Hovering around 20 days in the latter half of August, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Ludhiana has significantly improved in September, government data reveals.Currently settled at 27.43 days, if this doubling rate continues, the number of positive patients in Ludhiana - 14,908 on Wednesday – will double to 30,000 only by the mid of October.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, doubling rate helps estimate the time taken for the cases to double – the lower the number of days, the higher the spike in Covid-19 cases.Sometimes, a large surge or dip in the number of cases can give an erroneous impression of the spread of the disease. Therefore, doubling rate is calculated using the average of five, seven or 10 days to capture the Covid curve over longer periods.For instance: if Day 1 had 100 cases and these multiplied to 200 in a week, the doubling rate will be seven days; if it increased to 400 in the next two weeks, the rate will be 14 days, and so on and so forth. Hence, the higher the number of days, slower the progression of the outbreak.The rate is calculated on the emergence of new cases, and thus, changes every week.After recording the highest spike of cases in a single day with 462 positive cases on August 21, the doubling time was down to 19.44 days in the third week of month.However, as the first 11 days of September recorded 304 or fewer cases, the doubling time increased to 28.51 days by the week ending on September 8.This figure again dipped to 27.43 days by the week ending on September 15 as September 12 recorded district’s second-sharpest surge in cases with 435 new infections within a single day. However, the cases have been fewer since.From an average 975 samples per day in the beginning of August, the number of daily samples now being collected for testing in Ludhiana is 4,686.DIP IN ACTIVE CASESAnother silver lining is that the number of active cases is also on a decline. As per government data, the number of active cases was 1,214 in the beginning of August and multiplied to 2,334 on August 21.But as of September 16, with a total of 14,908 cases and 622 deaths, the active cases have reduced to 1632.According to district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar, the doubling time helps assess the situation, but Ludhiana’s status will be better analysed after a month. “The district has seen a decline in a number of parameters. The positive cases were 438 on Tuesday, but came down to 286 on Wednesday. Hopefully, with better awareness among Ludhiana residents, cases will start to swiftly come down soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-pandemic-in-ludhiana-from-19-days-in-mid-august-doubling-rate-improves-to-27-in-september/story-sus1wZricBGArbOWVOU2MI.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Initial findings of antibody survey in Delhi suggests 33% exposed to Covid-19||The prevalence of antibodies for Covid-19 rose from 29.1% to roughly 33% between August and September, according to the initial findings of the serological survey in Delhi, senior officials in the Capital’s administration said on Wednesday.The number represents the proportion of people from among 17,000 who were sampled, though the final figures are yet to be officially released. If extrapolated to the roughly 20 million population, the finding implies 6.5 million people may now have been silently exposed to the virus, more than 33 times the 193,526 confirmed infections till September 7 (the date on which the 7-day sampling ended). “The report has been submitted to the health department and it is currently being reviewed. The final report could have minor variations in the final sero prevalence since data from some wards are also being re-checked,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named. Covid-19 is known to manifest itself as asymptomatic infections, making its detection hard. Since late July, Delhi has been conducting monthly serological surveys to identify how many people may have had such an infection and silently recovered. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe findings relate to the third survey and, according to the person cited above, the final results are likely to be announced by next week. The presence of antibodies could prevent a second infection, at least for a short while, though scientists are yet to determine this for a certainty. If protection after an infection lasts for long, a sero prevalence of 60-70% could be enough to lead to herd immunity, when an outbreak begins to die out as the virus finds fewer susceptible people to infect. In the first survey held between June 27 and July 10, the sero prevalence among those sampled was 22.9%. The following month, this proportion rose to 29.1%. In terms of estimated infections across the city, the July survey projected 4.5 million cases, followed by 5.8 million in August. This translates to 1.3 million more people being infected in the one-month period in between.Going by the initial findings, the latest serological survey suggests that fewer people were silently infected in August: roughly 800,000, compared 1.3 million the previous month. Also read| Families can perform last rites of Covid-19 victims: Calcutta high courtThe first survey covered 20,000 people, followed by 15,000 in August and 17,000 in September. The findings also suggest that Covid-19 testing has been able to catch a larger share of the infections. Comparing sero survey-estimated projections in July and August with the corresponding numbers of confirmed cases shows that the proportion of possible true infections detected rose from 3.3% to 5.5%.Delhi leads the country in rate of testing per capita. “A sero survey is necessary to find out the true burden of the infection in the city or state. More importantly it helps identify the number of asymptomatic people who had the disease and recovered from it. Such people, in most cases, are not even aware that they are infected,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/initial-findings-of-antibody-survey-in-delhi-suggests-33-exposed-to-covid-19/story-gU2HGo8wAPJSEZv1BgQXbK.html
17-09-2020||City||Gurugram logs highest ever single-day spike of 421 new cases||Gurugram: Gurugram district on Wednesday reported the highest ever single-day spike of 421 new coronavirus infections, according to the district health department – surpassing the previous single-day increase of 339 cases recorded on September 13. The death toll also climbed up to 153 as two more deaths were confirmed on Wednesday. Emphasising that increased testing is behind the rising number of cases, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Gurugram is currently conducting highest number of tests across the state. It is almost 13% of the total 31,000 tests administered in the state in a day. If we are doing 4,000 tests a day, then at the current positivity rate of 11-12%, 400 cases are expected.” On Wednesday, at least 3,839 tests were administered — 2591 samples in government facilities and 1248 in private labs. The tests per million in Gurugram has reached 1,46,098.The total tally of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the district has now reached 16,330. Of these, 2,654 (nearly 16% ) are active cases. Data shows that the daily growth rate of active cases is almost 2.3%. Based on the active cases, Gurugram’s Covid-19 burden on the state is almost 12.44%. Currently, it has the highest number of active cases in the state, followed by Karnal (2018) and Faridabad (1835). The number of recovered patients has reached 13,523 in Gurugram, with 204 patients recovering on Wednesday. The recovery rate now stands at 82.81%. According to the district health bulletin, out of the active cases, 2,403 are home-isolated and 38 are in designated isolation facilities. There is also a surge in the number of hospitalised patients. At least 213 patients are undergoing treatment in 40 hospitals of the city. Yadav said that to help Covid-19 positive patients, who require surgery for appendix, fracture or any other routine surgery, an operation theatre has been prepared at the polyclinic in sector 31. “It is a Covid-19 theatre only for positive patients who require immediate surgery,” said Yadav. Data shows cases are doubling in every 38 days, which was almost 80 days until last week of August (August 28). The overall doubling rate of the state is 27 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-logs-highest-ever-single-day-spike-of-421-new-cases/story-4qteJ8HwDU8wFGDAUEWK6H.html
17-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Health department starts CT scan facility only for Covid-19 cases||Gurugram: To facilitate hassle-free CT scan of Covid-19 patients, the district health department has designated specific hours at its diagnostic centre in old Civil Hospital, Jharsa Road, to exclusively cater to such people. Health officials said many private hospitals are refusing to conduct the scan and instead asking patients to get reports on their own, which has been hampering timely diagnosis and treatment. Since the coronavirus infection is a respiratory disease, doctors suggest imaging of lungs to understand the impact of the disease on the organ. Based on the diagnosis, medication is prescribed. “The service will be operational for only Covid-19 patients from 5pm to 8 pm. The effort is to put a system in place where people can get their CT scan easily. Timely diagnosis would assist in identifying serious cases, further reducing the mortality,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. At present, of every 10 people visiting the diagnostic imaging centre at old Civil Hospital, five are Covid-19 positive patients, according to Sunny Saurabh, operations manager. “As of now, these patients were mostly referred by the Civil Hospital in sector 10. Only a few came from private hospitals. CT scan of these patients was conducted after 7pm. Since the dedicated service for three hours will start now, more footfall is expected,” said Saurabh. According to Saurabh, the centre will remain open for other patients from 6am to 5pm. From 5pm till 8pm. only Covid-19 patients will be allowed, after which the centre will be completely disinfected and closed. The health department has fixed the charges for patients referred by private set-ups. “The CT scan charge for a case referred by the government hospital is Rs 1,520. Those referred by private facilities will be charged Rs 2,800. Patients can take appointment on these numbers -- 7082111726,7082403242,” he said. The purpose behind starting the designated service, according to Yadav, is to timely detect serious cases. “It has come into our notice that private hospitals are asking patients to get a CT scan report after they are confirmed positive for coronavirus or complain of some health issue. It is a hassle for the Covid-19 patient and the kin before hospitalisation.” It is suggested that once a patient tests positive, he/she should be isolated and, if required, hospitalised where the test should be conducted. Doctors say they also prescribe CT scan for patients who test negative in the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) but show all the symptoms of the disease. Dr P Venkata Krishnan, internal medicine, Paras Hospital, said, “CT is only for moderate to severely ill patients. It is prescribed in those cases where patients have all the respiratory symptoms yet shows negative in the Covid-19 test. It helps to confirm the case based on the lobes created in the lungs and directs in exact prognosis.”Dr Risabh Rajput, director, Covid-19 lab at Modern Diagnostic and Research Centre, said, “We are getting cases where physicians are prescribing CT scan, suspecting it to be a Covid-19 case. Sometimes, physicians do not mention Covid-19 and simply ask for the scan. In these cases, in the clinical reports we have to mention about patient’s chances of contracting the coronavirus. Therefore, every person coming to the centre is considered to be a possible Covid-19 patient based on which safety precautions are taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-health-department-starts-ct-scan-facility-only-for-covid-19-cases/story-wWT3AvJXmWGvYb4l6U2RbN.html

17-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Affordable housing scheme extended to Vatsal Valley||Home buyers in Gurugram can now buy affordable plots at Vatsal Valley, earlier known as Gual Pahari, on the Gurugram-Faridabad road as the government has extended the Deen Dyal Jan Awas Yojana Affordable (DDJAY) Plot policy, 2016 to this area. Under this scheme, developers can offer plots of 80 square metres (sqm) to 150 sqm. Buyers can also get independent floors registered even for plots of size 80 sq metres, which reduces the cost of a unit, said a developer. Four floors along with a stilt can be constructed as per the latest government norms, he added. As per the Vatsal Valley (Gual Pahari) final development plan, the proposed land use has earmarked 75 hectares for residential use, 55 hectares for transport and communication, 30 hectares for public utilities, 153 hectares for public and semi-public uses, 45 hectares for open spaces and 16.45 hectares for special economic zone (SEZ) and 28 hectares for Abadi village. Pradeep Agarwal, managing director of affordable housing company Signature Developers, said that extension of this scheme to Vatsal Valley will further open avenues for home buyers from the middle.class. “The plots of small sizes can be sold for lesser price under this scheme and there are many takers for such.projects. Projects under this DDJAY have been launched in Sohna and met with good interest,” he added. Earlier this scheme was meant for low and medium potential urban areas but it was extended to high potential zones such as Sohna and Gurugram keeping in view the interest shown by buyers in affordable group housing projects. “A large number of developers have shown interest in projects under this scheme in Sohna, Gurugram and Manesar. There is a strong demand for affordable group housing and affordable plots and we are hopuful that many companies would come for such projects in Vatsal Valley and all other areas in the district,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram. Makrand Pandurang, director, town and country planning department district said that extension of DDJAY to Vatsal Valley will help more people get affordable housing and will also curb the illegal colonisation of agricultural land. The department is also extending this scheme to all urban areas. “The companies interested in developing such projects can apply online and they can come to the department for any query and assistance,” he said. The notification issued by director, town and country planning on September 14 states,” The Haryana government has extended the Deen Dyal Jan Awas Yojana of 2016 to Vatsal Valley earlier known as Gual Pahari. The interested companies/ parties and individuals can submit the applications under DDJAY through online portal on any working day within next 30 days.”Ashok Yadav, a real estate dealer said, “Government should facilitate such projects so that end user can buy such plots with ease” he said. DTCP officials said that the Haryana government had also amended the DDJAY in July whereby the upper limit of 15 acres for grant of license was waived but subject to 40 per cent net planned area in a given residential sector. The minimum area required for a license in Gurugram Manesar residential complex was also reduced to 5 acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-affordable-housing-scheme-extended-to-vatsal-valley/story-2Do3UTN2zRZDdTgzqRhNzJ.html
17-09-2020||Gurugram||Attacked while on duty, Mahendragarh forest guards moved to Gurugram civil hospital for treatment||Two guards with the Mahendragarh district forest department were injured after they were attacked by suspected encroachers in the protected Aravalli forest in Kalba village on Wednesday. First referred to a government hospital in Rewari, the guards were later brought to Gurugram’s Civil Hospital in sector-10 after their injuries were diagnosed to be serious, forest officials said. Officials identified the victims as range forest officer Rajneesh Kumar and deputy ranger Chandra Gupta. Vipin Kumar Singh, Mahendragarh district forest officer and an eyewitness to the clash, said, “I saw my colleagues being beaten up with sticks and strangled with towels. The intention was very much to injure them. They have suffered fractures and will require stitches on their heads and mouths.” Kumar said that they had come across the group while on a routine patrol of the Nangla-Chaudhry forest range, which includes several Aravalli villages, including Kalba. “A group of people were using an earthmoving machine to uproot trees and quarry rocks on protected forest land. When my colleagues warned them of punitive action if they did not stop immediately, they were surrounded and thrashed. I was some distance away in another car, and was able to call for additional staff, who broke up the altercation,” Singh said, adding that an FIR against the suspects, allegedly resident of Kalba village, had been filed with the Mahendragarh police.A similar incident had occurred in June, when a range forest officer in Faridabad was beaten by the land mafia in Surajkund, for taking pictures of illegal constructions coming up on protected forest land in the Aravallis. Citing this incident, Alok Verma, principal chief conservator of forests, Haryana, said, “Such blatant disregard for the law is unacceptable. The state must do more to protect its forest officers who are putting themselves in harm’s way, especially when encroachers seem to have no qualms about assaulting men who are on duty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/attacked-while-on-duty-mahendragarh-forest-guards-moved-to-gurugram-civil-hospital-for-treatment/story-qfB1Dm6yCdAuekHyhX9NYJ.html
17-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Land criteria for property NOC changed to one acre||To curb the illegal registration of small plots, the Haryana government has amended the law to mandate a no objection certificate (NOC) for land less than one acre in area, and vacant land.Earlier, selling agricultural land measuring less than two kanals needed an NOC from the competent authority. Rampant corruption led to several illegal sales and the blooming of unauthorised colonies in the district. The government said it would bring in necessary systemic changes and legislative amendments to curb the practice and bring in transparency.The amendment to the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Area Act 1975, notification for which was issued on September 14, follows the transferring of all land registries online to minimise human interference.Makrand Pandurang, director of the department of town and country planning, said, “This move will stop registration of plots which were smaller in size and led to development of unauthorized colonies. Getting an NOC has been made mandatory.” DTCP officials said that a large number of illegal registeries have been carried out in the district without obtaining the NOC under section 7 A of Haryana Urban Area Act 1975. A large number of colonies on agricultural land had come up due to registration of small plots in the city, and the state government was forced to ban registries and introduce a new property registration regime to curb these practices, they added. Pandurang also said that the category of land needing NOC has also been changed from agricultural to vacant land. The notification by Haryana government stated that “vacant land shall mean such land wherein either no construction of any nature exists or such construction is in existence which is either uninhabited or not fit for human habitation and stands constructed without following the due course of law.”Haryana government on July 22 had banned registration of properties across the state as it was revealed that a large number of illegal registeries had been carried out without obtaining NOC from DTCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-land-criteria-for-property-noc-changed-to-one-acre/story-GnCFy2vfaasW2PBIEnXW7O.html
17-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Only 40 applicants found eligible for plots under oustees quota||Gurugram: The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) said that only 40 out of 294 landowners, who had applied for an alternative plot under the oustees quota, have been found eligible for it after a 10-day screening process. As per HSVP rules, only those landowners, whose over 75% land has been acquired for development of residential sectors, are entitled to get a plot from the authority under the oustees quota, officials said. The HSVP officials said that claims of the applicants were screened in a series of meetings led by HSVP administrator Jitender Yadav from September 1 to 10, and only 40 oustees were found eligible. Now, a draw of lots for allotting alternative plots to these applicants would be held on September 22, they said. The landowners whose land has been acquired for public utility projects such as roads, water treatment plant, bus stand and similar facilities are not eligible to get a plot under the oustees policy, the officials clarified. Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer I, HSVP, said that during the screening, it was found that land of 254 applicants had been acquired for construction of infrastructure projects such as roads, power substations, water treatment and similar facilities. Under the HSVP policy, such landowners are not eligible for a plot under oustees quota. “Only those landowners whose land has been acquired for development of residential sectors are eligible to get plots under this quota,” Gogia said, adding that a draw to allot plots will be held on September 22. The authority had invited online applications for plots under this quota in 2018 after which 294 landowners applied for the same. Another reason for rejection of claims for plots was that while land of a single owner was acquired, their multiple heirs had applied for plots separately. “A single owner will get a single plot, but if his three or four sons apply for separate plots then all of them are not eligible,” said another authority official, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-only-40-applicants-found-eligible-for-plots-under-oustees-quota/story-Au1s0hdKy62hyp3G5N6joM.html
17-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Truck driver held for illegally transporting liquor||Gurugram: The police on Tuesday arrested a truck driver for allegedly illegally transporting liquor near the old tax barrier on national highway 48 in Bilaspur. The suspect had hidden 127 cartons of liquor underneath sacks of garments and scrap, and was carrying a fake receipt of the goods, the police said. According to the police, the crime branch of Manesar received a tip-off about a truck carrying liquor illegally, following which the police set up a check post on the highway in Bilaspur. The police said around 7pm, a truck coming from Dharuhera-Rewari side abruptly slowed down about 20 metres from the police check post and tried to turn around. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The truck’s movement raised suspicion and the driver was caught by the police team. At first, he claimed that he was carrying garments and scrap in the canter to Ahmedabad (Gujarat). He also produced a receipt dated September 12 of a transporter. The police team removed the tarpaulin from the top of the canter and found sacks of garments. However, under the sacks, 127 cartons of liquor were found. The driver could not produce the requisite licence or permit to transport the liquor.” The suspect has been identified as Sahroon alias Kikar Singh, a native of Ferozepur Jhirka in Nuh. The police said during further questioning, he said that he used to procure the liquor from Panipat and transport it to Gujarat. A crime branch official, requesting anonymity, said, “The truck driver said that he charged Rs 30,000 for a one-way trip to Gujarat and that he had transported the liquor across states at least twice. He said that he hoodwinked the police at a check post as he had hidden the liquor underneath the garment sacks and used to show them a receipt of goods to establish credibility.” A case was registered against the driver under relevant sections of the Excise Act at Bilaspur police station on Tuesday. The truck and liquor cartons were seized, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-truck-driver-held-for-illegally-transporting-liquor/story-csXbp3M8QU97Goa0TGvsPJ.html
17-09-2020||City||For getting registry appointment, buyers and sellers also need to pay MCG dues||Gurugram: Buyers and sellers of property, along with obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the department of town and country planning, will also have to get a no-dues certificate from the municipal corporation of Gurugram to get an appointment for registering a property, according to a new system introduced recently.Apart from property tax, the MCG has added other civic taxes in the online software system, which has been integrated with the registration process in a bid to generate revenue from property owners. The new system, which was launched last week, has been taken to generate more revenue and to prevent illegal registration of plots in a bid to check unauthorised development of colonies. According to the new online system, house owners whose properties fall in MCG’s jurisdiction will have to clear dues pertaining to property tax, which is annual, development charges, which are a one-time payment, water and sewage charges, which are monthly payments. Dinesh Kumar, zonal taxation officer, MCG, said the new system has been integrated with the registration process and property owners will have to pay their dues before getting an appointment for registration. “This system will generate more revenue for the civic agency and help homebuyers know about their dues. They can also pay these online,” Kumar said. An applicant will get a one-time password to clear the dues with the civic agency. Once the payment is done, the applicant will be allowed to get an appointment for property registration. “The property owners can pay dues online, get their registered mobile numbers and emails changed if required. Around 10 to 12 people come to the registration office at mini-secretariat to pay their dues daily,” said Sandeep Sharma, an MCG official deployed at the registration office. Property owners said the new regime for registration was cumbersome and needed lot of formalities to be fulfilled to get an appointment for registering a deed. “The buyers are finding this system difficult to manage as number of documents need to be uploaded. And now those in MCG areas also need a no-dues certificate,” said Subash Sharma, a real-estate dealer. Asked about issues being faced by property owners in getting appointments, the DTCP officials said they have already started taking online submissions for issuing NOCs. “The applications will be accepted online and soon the new process will become smooth after everyone becomes familiar with it,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-getting-registry-appointment-buyers-and-sellers-also-need-to-pay-mcg-dues/story-gaHI7a186AzSZbHuSqLPwN.html
17-09-2020||City||Overflowing sewers raise a stink at Gurugram Sector 46||Gurugram: Blocked drains and overflowing sewers have become a common sight in Sector 46 over the last one month with residents claiming that repeated efforts to raise the issue with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have fetched no results and the situation is getting worse with each passing day. Residents said with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the authorities should keep all areas sanitised and alleged that they have neglected the sector and left people to deal with the unhygienic situation on their own. The lanes have turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to overflown, stagnated sewage and the situation has become worse since after the heavy rain last month, residents say, adding the unbearable stench has made it almost impossible to venture out. “It has been more than a month that we have been following up with the civic authorities but to no avail. The situation is getting worse with each passing day,” said Rajkumar Yadav, president, resident welfare association (RWA), sector 46. The residents said some of the sector’s lanes are severely water-logged and people are living in fear in pockets where uncovered power transformers stand nearby. “The authorities should at least conduct a survey or remove the sewage from the roads. The main pipelines are under the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the sector has been transferred to MCG but still no one is interested to even visit the sector and give an assurance by when the issue will be resolved. At least the authorities should provide us with some alternative immediately,” said Praveen Kapoor, a resident. Last month, three buildings in the city had tilted, including one in this sector, after heavy rain. It was demolished for safety reasons, but the residents had alleged at the time that the inadequate drainage system caused water-logging, which weakened the building’s foundation. “We have complained to the MCG officials several times but to no avail. For the past five years, every time it rains, sewage water spills on to the roads and no one makes an effort to get it cleared. Residents cannot walk on the roads and children are forced to stay indoors,” Balbir Singh, vice president of RWA said. The residents, on Wednesday, once again wrote to the MCG commissioner and GMDA officials, highlighting the precarious condition of civic amenities in the area. The residents also alleged that desilting is not done before the monsoons, resulting in the blockage. “There are serious issues of flow and construction in such cases. A concerted effort is needed to effectively clean up the drains. The authorities cannot get away with a quick fix. The roads are in poor shape, so is the drainage,” Yadav said.  MCG officials said they are already working on the issue and are visiting each sector one by one to ensure rainwater drains are not choked and get cleaned regularly. “We are removing the water by machines and it will take at least 10 days to resolve the problem. The lines are connected to the master pipeline of GMDA, which is choked, resulting in overflowing,” said Vishal Garg, executive engineer, division 3, MCG. A GMDA official said they have given a contract for desilting the drains and once the complete drain is cleaned, the issue will be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/overflowing-sewers-raise-a-stink-at-gurugram-sector-46/story-Ay1Zp4diLrx5iSwDEOsbcP.html
17-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Local residents live in fear after Sec 57 building tilts||Gurugram: An under-construction five-storey residential building, built on a 200 square-yard plot in Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran’s (HSVP) Sector 57, has remained tilted dangerously since the last week of July after heavy rainfall, local residents said on Wednesday. The residents said after repeated requests to the house owner and the authorities, two cranes have been deployed to support the tilted structure. More than 20 families living in nearby buildings said they have been living in distress since July-end as the gap between the walls is growing and they fear it can fall anytime, if ignored. They said they have been coordinating with the authorities for more than a month but no concrete action was taken despite several meetings with senior officials, including the district commissioner. Residents of the area said due to the poor quality of construction, the building has tilted to its left as there is no other structure on that side. However, it is surrounded by buildings on other sides.Officials of HSVP had in August had demolished three other buildings in Sectors 27, 46 and 47 that had tilted precariously, following a spell of heavy rainfall in that month. The owner of this building has been asked to demolish two floors of the structure at his own cost. A junior engineer visited the site on Wednesday to probe structural issues with the building. Sumit Saxena, one of the neighbours, said there were flaws in the foundation, which caused the building to tilt. “The gaps have increased and the building is a threat to other nearby houses. The authorities should take prompt action to prevent any damage,” he said. Another neighbour, Vijay Negi, said they have been pursuing the matter with the authorities for over two weeks and are still waiting for any visible and concrete action. “The officials are not taking the issue seriously and we are having sleepless nights,” he said. HUDA officials said they had formed a committee in August, members of which visited locations from where complaints were received regarding tilted buildings. It had made recommendations to prevent such incidents in the future. Vivek Kalia, estate officer II, HSVP, Gurugram, said that the teams are constantly monitoring the site and large iron girders have been placed to support the leaning structure so that there is no risk to people in nearby buildings. “Our team is undertaking corrective measures and assessing the structural safety of the building on a daily basis. Cost of manpower and machinery deployed is being recovered from the plot owner,” he said. Kalia said the owner of this particular house has not compromised with the quality as he has constructed it for his own living. Madan Gopal Wadhwa, a resident of Sector 9 and owner of the under-construction building in Sector 57, said he has submitted the structural report prepared by the engineer to HSVP officials. “The building is sustainable and repairable and there is nothing to panic about. There is no risk to anyone’s life because of the structure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-local-residents-live-in-fear-after-sec-57-building-tilts/story-eV3xXy9uvVpoVbwtvjWQJM.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Building roof collapses, elderly man dies as 2 families fight over AC heat||A quarrel over an air-conditioner blowing hot air into a neighbour’s house turned into a full-blown assault that left a 60-year-old man dead, caused the roof of a nearby house to collapse, and injured two persons in East Delhi’s NSA Colony on Tuesday afternoon, police said. Police said the elderly man, Dharampal Singh, died after being thrown off the terrace by three to four men, who also thrashed his son and left him injured. To escape the assault, the elderly man’s nephew jumped on to the roof an adjacent house, but that roof collapsed under his weight and he got injured. Amit Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said so far, one man, identified by his first name Dharmender, has been arrested and a hunt is on for three to four more suspects. The DCP said an FIR has been registered at Farsh Bazar police station under the Indian Penal Code sections of murder, causing hurt, wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation. Explaining the sequence of events, police said Singh lived with his two sons, Dev Kumar and Babulal, who have their own businesses and Dharmender lived next door. Like the other houses in the densely populated neighbourhood, Singh’s house faced Dharmender’s. “Their houses were so close that when Dharmender installed an air-conditioner a few months ago, the hot air from the rear of the AC was blowing straight into Singh’s house,” an investigator associated with the case said. This became the reason for frequent fights between the two families. “When Dharmender’s family refused to remove their AC, we also got an AC installed in our house,” 28-year-old Dev Kumar told the police. That only escalated the matter. The dispute took a murderous turn around 2.30pm on Tuesday when Dev Kumar returned home to find Dharmender’s family and friends allegedly fighting with Babulal over the AC issue. “We hurled abuses at each other before my brother and I went to the terrace to stop the fight from escalating. Soon, four to five relatives and friends of Dharmender barged into our house, reached the terrace and started beating us with helmets and sticks,” Dev Kumar said. When Dev Kumar’s father tried to intervene, the assaulters allegedly flung him off the terrace of the two-storey house. He fell on to the roof the adjacent building and sustained serious head injuries. “Dharmender’s nephew, Arun, tried to escape the assault by jumping on to another neighbour’s terrace, but his leap caused the roof of that building to collapse and Arun was injured,” Dev Kumar said in his police complaint. Dev Kumar said the assault only ended when the police the reached the spot and the assailants fled. An unconscious Singh and his son Kumar were rushed to the hospital where the father succumbed to injuries. The DCP said the arrested accused, Dharmender, was involved in instigating the assaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/building-roof-collapses-elderly-man-dies-as-two-families-fight-over-ac-heat/story-ccfJARqPF4e3hj3Lqw7n3H.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police targeting CAA-NRC critics, says Umar Khalid in video recorded before arrest||A video pre-recorded by Umar Khalid, who was arrested on Sunday night by the Delhi Police in connection with the Delhi riots, was released on Wednesday, in which the former JNU student alleged that those who “incited rioters in front of television cameras” were being let off the hook by the police. “If you are watching this video, it means that I have been arrested,” said Umar Khalid in the two-minute video, which was shown in a press conference organised by activists to condemn the police investigation into the communal riots in north-east Delhi. “Through this video, I want to give a message that Delhi police is not arresting rioters or those who incited rioters in front of television cameras and police officials. We all saw how the Delhi police did not call these people even once for questioning, let alone register an FIR against them. On the other hand, CAA-NRC critics, including student-activists, are being implicated in false cases without any evidence,” said Khalid.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who was listed as a speaker at the press conference organised at the Press Club, could not attend the meeting, but released a statement on social media. “Questions must be raised over the investigation of Delhi riots as the purpose of this probe is not to ensure justice but to take political revenge,” Kumar said. Those who addressed the conference were former member of the erstwhile Planning Commission Syeda Hameed, Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation leader Kavita Krishnan, senior journalist Pamela Philipose and former Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president Nandita Narain.Participants and supporters, including Khalid’s family, wore masks with faces of arrested student activists.Bhushan said, “Police said that the members of a WhatsApp group, organised with the objective to support the exemplary peaceful [anti-CAA] protests, are conspirators. But people like Kapil Mishra, who were instigating violence by saying ‘goli maro’, did not face any action.”Mishra, who had denied allegations of his involvement in the riots, on Monday released a video congratulating Delhi Police for arresting Khalid and “people like him”, and likened the February riots with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The attendees later issued a statement. “We have gathered here today to express our collective anguish at the sheer brazenness with which the Delhi Police has turned the investigation into the February violence in the national capital into an inquisition of the anti-CAA protests.” “We demand an immediate end to this outrageous investigation that is being conducted with prejudice and mala fide intent. We demand that activists booked under the UAPA be immediately released; and a judicial enquiry commission be constituted to punish the real culprits and ensure justice for Delhi violence,” it added.Delhi Police had contended that an examination of witnesses revealed that Khalid was coordinating between protest sites in Delhi in connivance with other arrested accused. Delhi Police had claimed that Khalid, along with some other prominent anti-CAA protesters, had used the protest sites to plan and orchestrate the riots.Responding to a letter by veteran cop Julio Ribeiro questioning the investigation, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava had said that they were conducting a fair probe backed by evidence without discriminating on the basis of caste or religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-targeting-caa-nrc-critics-says-umar-in-video-recorded-before-arrest/story-s81uwv3aqL3etvKgVBWQTM.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt offers all help to railways in rehabilitating slum dwellers||Delhi urban development minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday wrote to Union railways minister Piyush Goyal, offering to prepare a detailed plan for rehabilitation of the slum dwellers living along the city’s railway tracks. The Supreme Court had ordered on August 31 removal of 48,000 shanties located along railway tracks in Delhi within three months. HT had first reported the matter on September 3.The Centre informed the apex court on Monday that the shanties would not be removed till a final decision is taken. The court then ordered that no coercive action be taken against the slum dwellers for four weeks.In his letter, Jain assured “full cooperation” from the Delhi government in the matter and also reiterated that the project will require multiple agencies of the state and Central government to “closely work together”. “A detailed plan has to be created... We will cooperate fully with you in formulating these policies, and the Delhi government can make these plans and give it to you if you need it,” read Jain’s letter to Goyal. The minister also said the Delhi government has more than 40,000 flats that can be used to relocate the slum dwellers. “The Delhi government also has more than 40,000 flats, out of which some are ready and some will be ready soon. These flats can also be used, if needed, and the Delhi government had also written a letter to the railways last week in this regard. But, these flats are located on the outskirts of Delhi,” Jain wrote.. He said these flats can be offered to the residents of those slums where in-situ rehabilitation policy cannot be implemented for the paucity of land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-offers-all-help-to-the-railways-in-rehabilitating-slum-dwellers/story-IcYjqWAGfzy0WruM9kZgdI.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Enough funds, but colleges not paying teachers, says Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that at least four of the 12 Delhi government-funded colleges affiliated to Delhi University have enough money in their accounts despite claiming otherwise, indicating a misappropriation of funds, a charge denied by the colleges.Sisodia’s remark comes on a day when teachers of Delhi government-funded DU colleges began a three-day strike against the alleged delay in disbursal of government grants to these colleges, which they said is the main cause behind pending salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff for months. Addressing a press conference held on Wednesday, Sisodia, however, said enough funds have been provided. “The Delhi government provided enough funds to these colleges for paying salaries but in their initial observation report, auditors have found that the funds are being directed elsewhere rather than paying the salaries to teachers. Projected salaries for this academic year is R 300 crore and Delhi government has provided sufficient funds to the colleges under the pattern of assistance,” Sisodia said. The education minister said several staff members and teachers complained of misuse of funds, which necessitated an audit in six of these colleges. The auditors submitted an initial observation report for at least four colleges on Tuesday, Sisodia said. “It was observed in the reports that colleges kept huge amounts as fixed deposits rather than paying salaries to staff,” Sisodia said. “University and college administration are doing politics and not paying salaries despite having crores in their accounts. Initially, colleges cooperated with the auditors and provided the necessary documents. However, colleges stopped cooperating with auditors on being questioned on the funds.” Sisodia said while Keshav Mahavidyalaya has Rs 10.52 crore, the closing balance of Bhagini Nivedita College shows that they have around Rs 2.5 crore as fixed deposits in their accounts at present. Despite repeated calls and messages, the principals of these colleges did not comment. “Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies didn’t even provide their audited balance sheets to the auditors. However, it was found that they had around Rs 3.5 crore in their balance sheet in the year 2018-19 and Rs 10.45 crore in fixed deposits,” Sisodia said. Principal Poonam Verma said the allegations were false and the matter was being politicised due to the governing body elections. The DU administration and the Delhi government have been at loggerheads over the formation of governing bodies in Delhi government-funded colleges for more than a year now. “The Delhi government has been targeting us because we don’t have their nominated person as the governing body chairperson. We have had a CAG audit in the financial year 2018-19 and because of the pandemic, last year’s audit got delayed. There is no need for a special audit. We are giving them all information. The surplus amount they are talking about is students’ funds and we can’t use it for salaries,” she saidThe Delhi government said Deen Dayal Upadhyay College did not provide audited balance sheets of various funds and books and donated “Rs 25 lakh for the ‘Atal Incubation centre’ from the student society fund account.” Hem Chand Jain, officiating principal, denied the allegations. “We provided all documents to the special audit team and have nothing to hide. Money collected from students for specific purposes or extracurricular activities cannot be used for other purposes other than student activities. Colleges can use student funds for emergency purposes but this cannot be done on a permanent basis. We will provide detailed clarification on the matter soon.” He said most other colleges funded by the University Grants Commission have such funds in their accounts but these cannot be used for salaries. Reacting to the allegations of financial irregularities, DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “We can’t comment before seeing the final audit report. If there are any irregularities, we will take action accordingly.” AK Bhagi, a former executive council member, said, “The students fund by no means can be used for paying salaries to employees. It is the duty of the government to pay salaries, other allowances and medical bills, etc., to employees and give grants for new and maintenance of infrastructure. Students’ fund is meant for students’ activities only.” Former academic council member Pankaj Garg said the deputy CM comments were misleading. “Monthly expenditure statements are submitted by every college and only then, grants are released. We are not against any kind of audit but in no case teachers should suffer for no fault of their own,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/enough-funds-but-colleges-not-paying-teachers-sisodia/story-Ma0aEzFvHtwOucdwe5jIpN.html
17-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro expands its colour palette, Tughlakabad-Aerocity line to be Silver||Having used up all primary colours ( Red, Blue and Yellow) and secondary colours (Orange, Green and Purple) for easily identifying its various lines, the Delhi Metro is now delving deep into the colours palette to identify corridors being developed under its Phase 4.The upcoming Tughlakabad to Aerocity corridor of Phase 4 was Wednesday assigned the colour ‘Silver’ by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). Interestingly, silver is not a colour by itself, rather it is a variant of grey, a neutral or achromatic colour (meaning a colour without a colour), which is an intermediate shade of black and white.Assigning colours and numbers to the three new lines, the DMRC said the Tughlakabad to Aerocity line will be known as the Silver Line. The corridor from Majlis Park to Maujpur will be known as Pink Line Extension, while the Janakpuri West to RK Ashram corridor will be identified as a Magenta Line Extension and will take the colours of their mother lines. The Silver Line has also been numbered as Line 10 by the DMRC. The nine existing lines of the Delhi Metro – used by an estimated 27 lakh commuters daily – is identified by a different colour each, so that people are able to remember their routes/trains easily. “Silver has been selected as the colour code for the Tughlakabad to Aerocity corridor. There is no specific rule to deciding the colour of a particular line. However, colours that are distinguishable and can be easily remembered by the commuters are selected,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said. Dayal added, “This section is the 10th line to get a colour code. The Majlis Park to Maujpur corridor is an extension of the Pink Line, while the Janakpuri West to RK Ashram corridor will be an extension of the Magenta Line and will retain the same colour codes.” Even from among the six tertiary colours -- Amber (yellow+orange), Vermilion (red+orange), Magenta (red+purple), Violet (blue+purple), Teal/Aqua (blue+green), and Chartreuse/lime green (yellow+green) -- the DMRC has already used up Magenta and Violet.The Delhi Metro has so far used Red for Rithala-Shaheed Sthal corridor; Yellow for Huda City Centre-Samaypur Badli, Blue for Dwarka Sector 21-Vaishali/Noida Electronic City; Green for Inderlok/Kirti Nagarto Bahadurgarh; Violet for Kashmere Gate-Ballabhgarh; Pink for Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar; Magenta for Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden, Grey for Dwarka-Najafgarh and Orange for the Airport Express Line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-expands-its-colour-palette-tughlakabad-aerocity-line-will-be-silver/story-EYLTZe7WoEOCrad1kAdmkO.html

17-09-2020||Pune||Onion export ban: Cong protests in Pune; auctioning resumes at Lasalgaon||Pune: Even as farmers and traders at Lasalgaon in Nashik called off their strike and resume auctioning of onions, the Congress on Wednesday staged statewide protest, demanding withdrawal of Centre’s decision to ban export of onions. At Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest market, auctioning was carried out smoothly at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) even as the supply of onion was less than average a day after operations were closed due to protests by farmers. With rates hovering around Rs 2,300 to 2,600 per quintal, a rise of Rs 500 from Tuesday’s rates, farmers too participated in the process without resistance. According to Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson at Lasalgaon APMC, the onion arrival was reduced by over 60% as most farmers did not bring their produce for auction. “Even as many farmers did not bring onions for sale today, they will have to bring the commodity at APMC. This being rainy season, farmers won’t be able to keep it in the field for long,” said Jagtap. In other markers in Nashik, including Yeola, Nandgaon and Andarsul, onion growers staged protests demanding roll back of decision. In Pune and parts of Maharashtra, Congress workers wearing onion garland staged protests while terming Centre’s decision against the farmers. State Congress unit chief Balasaheb Thorat said in Mumbai, “The decision by Centre to ban export of onion shows that the government in Delhi is anti-farmer. We want the Centre to lift the ban immediately.” Congress city unit president Ramesh Bagwe, who led the protest said this year, the crop was good as farmers worked hard during lockdown. “However, just when farmers were started getting good prices, the Centre imposed ban,” said Bagwe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/onion-auctioning-resumes-at-lasalgaon-as-congress-protests-over-ban/story-1PRLjfrFXDuFEtbx1BQzvO.html
17-09-2020||Pune||Over 40K engineering diploma seats may remain vacant this year in Maharashtra||Pune: Poor response saw the admission process for the engineering diploma courses after Class 10 being extended three times in this academic year. The latest deadline to apply for admission is September 21. Authorities said that the popularity of these courses seems to be on a decline. For the total 113,000 seats available across the state, 78,000 applications were received and only 70,000 students confirmed their admission. The dismal figure is now worrying colleges and the Maharashtra state directorate of technical education (DTE) that conducts the admission process. The number of seats and polytechnic colleges in Pune district has been reducing over the years for lack of adequate number of admissions and financial reasons. Currently, in Pune district, there are seven government polytechnics, four aided and 105 private polytechnic colleges. Between 2016 and 2020 around 16,000 seats have been cut down in these polytechnic colleges. At least 26 private colleges were also shut down during this period for low student strength and lack of funds. Dilip Nandanwar, joint director at the Pune regional office of DTE said, “The percentage of admission happening in government and aided polytechnic colleges is good in Pune district. The admission rate in some private colleges is satisfactory, but majority of them are not getting admissions due to lack of infrastructure, good faculty and many placements seats remain vacant. We extended the admission deadline for the third time and students can still apply to get admission till September 21.” Surendra Giram, principal, AISSMS College of Polytechnic, Pune said, “There are various reasons for low percentage of admission, but one of the major reasons is that direct second year diploma admission seats have reduced this year. It has impacted on the overall applications coming for engineering diploma courses. The administration has continued with the admission process despite the Covid situation. Studies, in online mode, are taken by college authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-40k-engineering-diploma-seats-may-remain-vacant-this-year/story-v03KQi9Wcjp1lf58LyItSJ.html

17-09-2020||Kolkata||Lawyer who killed husband with phone charger chord gets jail for life||The Barasat court in North 24 Parganas district on Wednesday sentenced a lawyer to life in prison for killing her husband with the chord of a mobile phone charger.Lawyer Anindita Pal Dey, 35, was convicted for murdering her husband Rajat Kumar Dey, who too was a lawyer at the Calcutta high court, on the night of November 25, 2018. Anindita Pal Dey was also accused of tampering with evidence. The victim’s body was found on the floor of the bedroom. His face had turned blue and there was a deep mark on the throat. His wife told the police that he fell from the bed and suffered a heart attack. The couple lived in an apartment in New Town in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. Their only child, a boy, is now three years old. “This was a unique investigation. The evidence filed before the court was based almost entirely on the convict’s mobile call, chat and Google search history,” said Bibhas Chatterjee, the public prosecutor. Before being arrested, the victim’s wife made self-contradictory statements for six days in an apparent bid to mislead the investigators. Later, it was found that she had been visiting websites to find information on strangulation, said Chatterjee. “We could not even believe that she had committed the murder. She behaved normally all day,” Samir Dey, the victim’s father, told the media at Barasat court. The court had pronounced Anindita Pal Dey guilty on Monday. After the sentence was announced, she said she had been framed and would fight for justice. Her lawyers will challenge the order in the higher court.

17-09-2020||Pune||J&K ‘reorganisation’ cannot be pretext for China aggression: former foreign secy Vijay Gokhale||Pune: China cannot use India’s internal reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 as a pretext to justify its aggressive posture, said former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale, during an online lecture –cum-discussion on Wednesday. The lecture was conducted as a part of Symbiosis Golden Jubilee Lecture Series. “India did not alter its international map, it did not change the border or the Chinese map. In August 2019, it only reorganised its internal map. The same thing happened in 2000, when Uttar Pradesh was bifurcated into two regions. China did not oppose then, so it cannot justify its present aggressive behaviour based on such a pretext,” said Gokhale, who has served as the Indian ambassador to China from January 2016 to October 2017. Highlighting how rejuvenation of Chinese subjects is important for the Communist Party of China, the former ambassador explained that one of China’s focal points of its comprehensive national security policy is seizing what it considers its “lost territories”. Such regions include Hong Kong, Taiwan, South and East China Sea, and Arunachal Pradesh, which it calls South Tibet. Rajani Gupte, vice-chancellor of the Symbiosis International (Deemed University) reiterated how understanding China’s outlook of the world is important for India to secure its national wellbeing. “China is a formidable force to reckon with in the new era with its significance growing in almost all realms like geopolitics, health security, economic and military. Hence, it is important to understand what Chinese President Xi Jinping meant when he said that China will be at the centre of the world stage in the next 30 years,” she said. Gokhale added that with a $14 trillion economy, China is on the road to becoming the biggest economic power soon and to build up its military as one of the strongest, will also be one of its goals. “By 2030, China will have more ships and submarines in the Indian Ocean than the US and India combined. Its augmented military capacity will be huge. There is a fundamental Chinese belief that global order is shaped by force and power and therefore, it will modernise its military structure. It is already doing so by reshaping theatre commands, introducing new service arms, weapon systems and the like,” he said. However, India must maintain its firm position and secure our own place in the world and not blink, added Gokhale. Gokhale also spoke on the economic rise of China and how China’s goal to grow at 5.8% will be difficult to follow through over the years, because of low domestic consumption, declining age of the population, low export-led growth, among other factors. However, he added that the Made in China 2025 policy will lead future growth through innovations. “China is looking at new alternatives to be relevant in the new economic order. Its ‘Belt and Road’ initiative will give it integration with Asia. New platforms like innovations will be key for China including high-speed rail, information technology,” said Gokhale. The former foreign secretary said that the Chinese government says that its economy is already on track, while other Western nations are still grappling with the pandemic. “China wants the world to see how advanced countries have been unable to handle the Covid crisis, whereas China curbed it, and its economy is already on track. This will improve China’s influence on world organisations and global world order. China is already on its way to create a parallel world with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Made in China digital platforms and its own social application which helps it create its mark in the multipolar world. However, Chinese hegemony is very different from American hegemony and hence has to be dealt with differently,” said Gokhale. Gokhale ended the lecture stating that the Chinese system has fundamental flaws, including an opaque system and that the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is fragile as it is not the people’s mandate and hence, it will always have to show power in order to be accepted. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society and SB Mujumdar, founder and president of the Symbiosis Society, were present online for the lecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-reorganisation-cannot-be-pretext-for-china-aggression-ex-foreign-secy-vijay-gokhale/story-9hikrqTDH9Szg7mtxbtJ4L.html

Pre-Covid daily ridership of the city’s public service, by its own published data, was an average of 25 lakh daily commuter with a daily average income of Rs 1.5 crore. “We are looking at the Covid pandemic like a blessing in disguise. We are working on several ideas to increase revenue. These include route rationalisation, fare optimisation, new areas and avenues for deployment of buses, and specialised new services. Also, we want to improvise services which we have been negligent about; like the Pune airport bus service, or services to the Hinjewadi IT hub and weekend services for tourism,” said Jagtap. “Along with that, we are also working on depot development, which was one of the major points at the last meeting of the board of directors. If we look at our fare revenue, it is about 90 per cent of our total revenue earnings. When we compared it with other public bus services, like the Bengaluru Municipal Transportation, or BEST, they have other areas of revenue income. Their assets and properties give them lot of rental as well. We have 18 depots in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad and 10 other areas which we will think about utilising as transit hubs, or for commercial activities which serve our purpose,” he added. Jagtap was reluctant to put a timeframe on any of these ideas coming to fruition, but insisted that the plans were imminent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poor-response-prompts-pmpml-to-try-and-explore-new-revenue-models/story-Eo5yd1nIgxVp1l4UgvEPSP.html
17-09-2020||World||‘India’s strong approach towards Chinese aggression encouraging’: White House official||The US provided “strong and unambiguous support” to India during its current border crisis with China, which is engaged in increasingly aggressive behaviour throughout the Indo-Pacific even during the coronavirus pandemic, a senior White House official said on Thursday. From a bilateral perspective China’s recent actions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India has further reinforced the importance of the US-India strategic partnership, Lisa Curtis, the deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, said in a virtual panel discussion organised by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.“Whether it was cutting off Vietnam’s access to its fishing waters, undermining Hong Kong self-rule, deploying military submarines to threaten Japan or contesting Indian territorial sovereignty along the LAC, Beijing has engaged in increasingly aggressive behaviour throughout the Indo-Pacific, even as the global community has grappled with coronavirus pandemic,” Curtis said. The crisis has strengthened America’s resolve to work towards building its relationship with India as a bulwark against Chinese aggression, she said during the discussion on research scholar Darshana Baruah’s recently released paper, “India in the Indo-Pacific: New Delhi’s Theater of Opportunity”. “Throughout the crisis, the US has provided strong and unambiguous support for India, and our cooperation has certainly grown closer. We are encouraged by India’s strong yet responsible approach to the Chinese aggression,” said Curtis, who is the Senior Director for South and Central Asia on the National Security Council (NSC) at the White House.“While always seeking to de-escalate through diplomatic means India also demonstrated military and economic resolve,” Curtis said as she asserted that the Indo-Pacific strategy, which was introduced in 2017 is designed to foster a stable free open and rules-based order. “This order is not only for the benefit of the US. It is for the benefit of all countries that pride their sovereignty and independence. The Indo-Pacific strategy, of course prioritises building relations between the US and India, because we view India as an emerging global power that shares our goals of ensuring this region remains peaceful, stable, and with the prospect of growing prosperity,” she said. America’s strategic partnership with India is really founded on shared commitments to freedom, democratic principles and the rule of law. It is based on a convergence of strategic interests, centred on promoting global security instability, she said. Noting that the Trump administration elevated the US relationship with India in ways not seen by any other administration, she said that the joint statement that was signed by President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the former’s visit to India in February is testament to this administration’s commitment to building the vital partnership. Curtis said that the US has strengthened the QUAD mechanism among the leadership of the US, Japan, India and Australia. At the outset of the Trump administration the Quad was really not even officially meeting.“But starting in November 2017, we started regular dialogue of the QUAD at the Assistant Secretary Director General level. And by September 19, we had the quad meeting at the ministerial level for the first time ever. Additionally, President Trump has met twice in the trilateral format with Indian and Japan; first at the G-20 Buenos Aires in December, 2018, and then again in Osaka, at the G-20 in June 2019,” she said. Both the QUAD and trilateral formats are really important for strengthening the institutional support and fostering that multinational cooperation that will contribute to a free and open Indo-Pacific, Curtis said.“Such mechanisms help check Chinese aggression, and which has increased since the onset of the global pandemic,” she added.Tension in eastern Ladakh increased manifold following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed. The Chinese side too suffered casualties, but it is yet to give out the details. The situation deteriorated again after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-strong-approach-towards-chinese-aggression-encouraging-white-house-official/story-0LIINKtV9927LscGe20apO.html
17-09-2020||World||Brucellosis outbreak concerns authorities in China||Authorities of the city of Lanzhou in northwest China on Tuesday confirmed that several thousand people have tested positive for a bacterial disease brucellosis due to a leak caused by a biopharmaceutical company in 2019.According to CNN, people might have gotten infected by the disease either by consuming the contaminated food or by breathing in the bacteria. The Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, situated in the Gansu province of China, in a press release said that it has set up a team to deal with the outbreak of brucellosis in the region. This disease happens when someone is in contact with livestock which is hosting the bacteria brucella.The Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute team headed by Secretary of the municipal party committee Li Rongcan and Zhang Weiwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and mayor, the team will identify 11 public medical institutions to address the outbreak. The release said, “As of September 14, 2020, a total of 21,847 people were tested, 4646 were initially screened positive, and 3,245 were confirmed by the Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention; 3,159 health files were established; a total of 23,479 consultations were held; 9 on-site medical diagnosis and treatment lectures were held and distributed.”According to the team the outbreak resulted from the leakage of gas from the Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Factory which also produces vaccine for the disease which infect animals primarily. “From July 24 to August 20, 2019, Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Factory used expired disinfectants in the production of brucella vaccine causing incomplete sterilization of waste gas from production fermentation tanks, and the waste gas carrying bacteria-containing fermentation liquid formed bacteria-containing aerosols,” the statement said. The statement pointed out that due to wind flow humans came into contact with the bacteria. “During the production period, the main wind direction in the area was southeast. In the downwind direction, human body inhalation or mucosal contact produced positive antibodies, resulting in a positive Brucella antibody incident... This incident was accidental and exposure (was for) a short time.”According to CNN, several researchers working in the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute had fallen ill first after being exposed to the virus. Heilongjiang province, which is situated in northeast China, also saw infections due to exposure to brucella. The United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says exposure to brucella can lead to Malta fever or Mediterranean fever. The symptoms are usually headaches, muscle pain, fever and fatigue. The CDC says that even though the symptoms might subside eventually, there is always a risk of some of these symptoms to become chronic and patients can develop arthritis or swelling in certain organs. Brucella outbreaks in China were on the decline since 1980s due to vaccine introduction as well as improved control measures but minor outbreaks have been reported over the past few decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brucellosis-outbreak-concerns-authorities-in-china/story-S8zJ7msgtckc0LjWcZ63TK.html
17-09-2020||World||Former model accuses Donald Trump of sexual assault||A former model has alleged she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump, then a real estate magnate, two decades ago at his VIP box in the US Open stands in New York.“He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off,” Amy Dorris, the former model, told The Guardian in an interview. “And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything,” the British newspaper quoted her as saying.“I was in his grip, and I couldn’t get out of it,” she added. “I don’t know what you call that when you’re sticking your tongue just down someone’s throat. But I pushed it out with my teeth. I was pushing it. And I think I might have hurt his tongue.”Trump was 51 at the time and was married to his second wife Marla Maples. Dorris was 24.President Trump’s lawyers have denied the incident took place at all and raised several questions about her account, the news publication said. There would have been witnesses at such a public place as the US Open, they have said and asked why did she, who was there with her then boyfriend, continue to visit and meet Trump after the alleged incident and even sat with him at the memorial service for Gianni Versace.Dorris did not report the incident, which took place on September 5, 1997, to law enforcement, but she told a friend and her mother about it. She also spoke about it to other people and a therapist in the intervening years. The Guardian said it has corroborated her account with people she had confided in at the time.The former model, who is a mother of twin daughters and lives in Florida, has said that she did consider speaking out about the assault in 2016, when Trump was the Republican candidate for president. But she changed her mind because she feared she might end up harming her family.“Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let anybody do anything to you that you don’t want,” she has said. “And I’d rather be a role model. I want them to see that I didn’t stay quiet, that I stood up to somebody who did something that was unacceptable.”Dorris joins a long list of women who have accused Trump over the years of forcing himself on them, groping or sexually assaulting them. While Trump and his lawyers have strenuously dismissed those allegations, he has bragged about assaulting women and forcing himself on them, as he did on the infamous Access Hollywood tapes that nearly ended his campaign in October of 2016. E Jean Carroll, a columnist who has alleged that Trump raped her at a Manhattan department store decades ago, filed a defamation suit against the president in 2019 for accusing her of “totally lying” while rejecting her claims. The president is being defended by justice department lawyers in a very unusual move, starting early this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-model-accuses-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault/story-rJY4DyHKLgOz43R7kxREdL.html

A total of 172 nations are now part of this global initiative. “We cannot risk having an effective vaccine for COVID-19 that people refuse because of the perception that it is unsafe. We already face challenges with vaccine acceptance for many proven vaccines,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization. Out of these 172 nations, 92 are low and middle income economies , eligible to be supported by the Covax advance market commitment. The rest 80 are potentially self-financing countries.The United States is not part of Covax; it has entered into several agreements to procure vaccines. The safety warning from WHO in the backdrop of the brief pause in Astrazeneca’s trial is significant as the pharma company reported an illness in a participant, triggering fear about Oxford vaccine. However, the trial has resumed after the UK authorities gave a go-ahead.Serum Institute of India, which is part of Oxford-Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate trial, was asked to stop the process after concerns were raised. Now, the drug controller has given a go-ahead to SII to recruit for phase two and phase three trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/safety-first-cautions-who-as-172-nations-join-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-plan/story-oiwpUzhtqeTPpwUdpxGoTP.html
17-09-2020||World||Wuhan next-of-kin accuse China of blocking Covid lawsuits||Wuhan pensioner Zhong Hanneng endured every parent’s worst nightmare when coronavirus claimed her son in February, and -- alongside other bereaved relatives -- she wants to sue the local government she blames for his death.But they have had their lawsuits abruptly rejected, dozens of others face pressure from authorities not to file, and lawyers are being warned against helping them, according to people involved in the effort.The families accuse the Wuhan and Hubei provincial governments of concealing the outbreak when it first emerged there late last year, failing to alert the public, and bungling the response, allowing Covid-19 to explode out of control.It has killed nearly 3,900 in the city and over 900,000 globally so far.“They say the epidemic was a natural calamity. But these serious outcomes are man-made, and you need to find who’s to blame,” said Zhong, 67.“Our family is shattered. I can never be happy again.”At least five lawsuits have been filed with the Wuhan Intermediate Court, said Zhang Hai, whose elderly father died of the virus and who has emerged as a vocal advocate and spokesman for families of virus victims.Plaintiffs are each seeking around two million yuan ($295,000) in damages and a public apology.But the court has rejected suits on unspecified procedural grounds, said Yang Zhanqing, a veteran Chinese activist now in the US.Yang, who is coordinating two dozen lawyers in China who are secretly advising families, said the rejections have come via curt phone calls -- not through official written explanations, as legally required -- apparently to avoid a paper trail.Staff at the Wuhan court refused AFP requests for comment.- Stonewalling -The virus emerged in Wuhan last December but city authorities initially dragged their feet, pressuring whistle-blowing doctors to keep quiet.The Communist Party continues to downplay responsibility, even questioning whether the pathogen originated in China, while trumpeting its later success in suppressing domestic infections.It held a grand ceremony in Beijing last week, where President Xi Jinping declared the nation had passed an “extraordinary and historic test” through a swift and transparent response.But Zhong tells a different story.By late January, the contagion was spreading rapidly in Wuhan, but officials had still issued no citywide alarm.With the extended Lunar New Year festival approaching, Zhong and her son Peng Yi -- a 39-year-old primary schoolteacher -- happily shopped at jam-packed stores. Millions of others left Wuhan for the holiday, taking the infection global.“We had no idea the buses were full of the virus... So we went out every day. We didn’t even know about masks,” Zhong told AFP.On January 24, as Wuhan finally began locking down, she and Peng fell ill. She soon recovered, but he worsened.Fear gripped their household, which included Zhong’s husband, Peng’s wife, and his seven-year-old daughter.For the next two agonising weeks, they spent long hours in overwhelmed hospitals begging to get him admitted, but without a positive result -- and with testing kits scarce -- he was repeatedly turned away.Peng was finally hospitalised February 6.His family never saw him alive again. He died on a respirator two weeks later.“He must have been so scared, so unhappy, with no family around. I can’t imagine how sad he was,” said Zhong, breaking down repeatedly.“Did he call out ‘Mother’? ‘Father’? I don’t know.”- Never give up -Zhang Hai believes his father was infected at a Wuhan hospital during treatment for an unrelated ailment.He says authorities are waging a campaign to discredit him, suspending his social media accounts and circulating disinformation that the legal efforts are a scam to bilk families.Others also have reported official intimidation, and next-of-kin chat groups have been infiltrated by police, Zhang alleged, blaming Wuhan’s government.“They know if I succeed in filing a case, many other families will sue, too,” he said.Wuhan’s government did not respond to AFP’s requests for comment.Zhang said dozens of bereaved relatives have coalesced in chat groups, but most are fearful of taking action.With his initial suit in Wuhan rejected, Zhang filed recently with a higher, provincial-level court. Zhong, the elderly pensioner, plans the same.Yang, the US-based activist, believes it “very likely” the government will quietly meet some families’ demands eventually, though a public apology is inconceivable.Until then, Zhang intends to appeal all the way to China’s highest court in Beijing, regardless of the personal risks.“My father is my motivation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-next-of-kin-accuse-china-of-blocking-covid-lawsuits/story-G8O9pDK5uZK0y9upynjXNP.html
17-09-2020||World||Pak to make Gilgit Baltistan its 5th province despite India’s protests||Disregarding India’s strong protests, Pakistan is moving ahead with plans to make Gilgit Baltistan (GB) its fifth province, with a federal minister saying that elections in the region that New Delhi opposes will be held in November.Prime Minister Imran Khan will soon visit the region and make the formal announcement, Ali Amin Gandapur, Pakistan’s minister for Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan Affairs, told a delegation of journalists from the region in Islamabad on Wednesday.New Delhi had conveyed to Pakistan several times that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession. In May, the external affairs ministry said Pakistan or its judiciary had no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it and rejected attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. “Instead, Pakistan should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” the ministry had said.Gandapur said the status of a full-fledged province with all constitutional rights is being planned for Gilgit-Baltistan and this will include representation in both houses of parliament. Gandapur said that elections in the region would be held in mid-November and distribution of party tickets to candidates would begin soon. New Delhi had protested Pakistan’s move to conduct elections in the region, which it considers an integral part of the country that had been illegally and forcibly occupied.“After consultation with all stakeholders, the federal government has decided in principle to give constitutional rights to Gilgit-Baltistan,” the minister said, adding, “Our government has decided to deliver on the promise it made to the people there.”After the grant of constitutional rights, the subsidy and tax exemption on wheat given to the region would not be withdrawn, he said. “Until the people there stand on their feet, they will continue to enjoy this facility.” The minister said deprivation of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan of 73 years would come to an end. Besides the constitutional rights and the provincial setup, the minister added, important steps were also being taken for the development of the region.Work on the Moqpondass Special Economic Zone would begin under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), while the government take steps to improve health, tourism, transport and education facilities, he said.The CPEC is the flagship project of Beijing’s ambitious multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India has protested to China over the project as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.In 1999, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the people of Gilgit-Baltistan were citizens of Pakistan and directed the government to initiate appropriate administrative and legislative measures. In 2009, Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self Governance Order (GBESGO) was introduced according to which, the Northern Areas were renamed as Gilgit-Baltistan. The order gave it a province like status with no representation in parliament. In 2015, the government constituted a committee headed by Sartaj Aziz which proposed giving Gilgit-Baltistan the status of a province and in 2018 a new Gilgit-Baltistan order was introduced and all the powers of the Gilgit Baltistan Council were transferred to its assembly. The GBESGO of 2009 and the Gilgit Baltistan Order of 2018 were challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan which reconfirmed its earlier judgement that the people of Gilgit-Baltistan are citizens of Pakistan. The court also suggested that certain changes should be made to the presidential order issued by the present government and instructed the federal government to promulgate the modified Gilgit-Baltistan Reforms of 2019.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-make-gilgit-baltistan-its-5th-province-despite-india-s-protests/story-gesbC768MMMHss9MbL8QCM.html
17-09-2020||World||Will Covid-19 vaccine be ready by this year? Trump promises defy the lessons of pharmaceutical history||Every effort to develop a new medicine is like launching a ship across the ocean to hunt for riches. Over the years, we’ve improved the hulls and masts, the maps are better, the sailors more experienced. But even so, vessels get turned back or new lands are barren. And, sometimes, a squall takes down the boat and all her crew.The Trump administration has set sail on one of the most ambitious vaccine development efforts in history. Operation Warp Speed is likely to deliver a Covid-19 inoculation in a fraction of the years it would usually take. In doing, so it could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and economies around the world.But the administration has also offered timelines for a vaccine that fly in the face of almost every experience in pharmaceutical history. On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump said a shot could be ready in three or four weeks. Then, on Wednesday, Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services and one of the senior leaders of the Warp Speed program, said every American could be vaccinated by the end of March.Mango said that there are enough doses in production and that trials are moving at a speed so that “the combination of those two will permit us to vaccinate every American before the end of first quarter 2021.” A few hours later, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “we do believe that it will be widely available by the end of” this year, though also referred to doses of the vaccine being production by then, as opposed to actually distributed. Mango’s and McEnany ’s remarks were contradicted by the head of the Centers for Disease Control Prevention, Director Robert Redfield, who told Congress Wednesday that it would likely take until late spring or the summer of next year for most Americans to have access to a vaccine. Other top U.S. health officials have said it’s not likely a vaccine will be ready until the end of the year, and that expanding access to the more than 300 million people living in the U.S. will take longer.“It would be aspirational to do that,” said Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “But I think it’s more toward the middle to the end of the year that you can get people vaccinated. It depends on what the vaccine is.”The U.S. has launched many ships. Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc have headed out at a rapid clip. The early data look promising, and late-stage trials in tens of thousands of volunteers could produce a rapid answer.But to deploy a vaccine widely by early next year, it’s worth keeping in mind what has to go right:Even in vaccination efforts that the U.S. runs every year, it’s hard to meet the goal of wide uptake. For the 2017-2018 flu season, only 37% of Americans actually got a vaccine, according to the CDC. Many people get it at work, at school, at a drugstores or in hospitals --places that are largely closed or that many Americans are avoiding because of the pandemic.There are a few loosely understood rules of running a pharmaceutical company, outside the necessity of making a reasonable return for shareholders.A first rule is don’t kill anyone. A second one is to help people live longer, better lives. The third is not to get sued by securities regulators.It’s a simple set of goals that often runs into the brutal reality of drug development, often summed up by insiders with the oft-repeated pearl, “science is hard.” Every year, the pharmaceutical industry spends billions on failure. Drugs seem like miracles, then turn out to be a mirage. Much of the money companies invest in research goes toward projects that are stopped because they either don’t help people or might hurt them.The result is that most companies -- there are, of course, exceptions -- are conservative in their pronouncements. And some have been in preparing for a vaccine. Merck & Co. has been quietly betting that the first shot across the line won’t necessarily be the best, and that its experimental vaccine could top the early winners. Some form of vaccine is likely to be needed for years, as well, leaving plenty of room for incremental improvements like better protection, more durable immunity, and more certain safety.To that end, earlier this month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report summarizing expert recommendations for distributing a Covid-19 vaccine.On page 11, it cites a key lesson from past mass vaccination efforts: “Under-promise and over-deliver.”Having violated the first half of that advice, the best hope now is that the U.S. delivers on the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-covid-19-vaccine-be-ready-by-this-year-donald-trump-promises-defy-the-lessons-of-pharmaceutical-history/story-8rUhMp8FHNXXf9tioB4uTJ.html

Initial talks in that direction have already begun.Johnson tweeted, “Very best wishes to my friend @narendramodi on his 70th birthday. I hope to see you soon.”The possibility of Johnson visiting India in 2020 had been discussed earlier this year, but the coronavirus pandemic has affected those plans. Only virtual interactions have been taking place between British and Indian ministers, largely on trade issues.Modi last visited London in April 2018 for a Commonwealth heads of government summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-to-see-you-soon-boris-johnson-wishes-narendra-modi-on-70th-birthday/story-AQXkYNm4eBQtEIHu3mjbIL.html

Oracle has submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that will allow it to become a technology partner in the TikTok app, as ByteDance hopes to head off a Trump order that it divest TikTok’s U.S. operations. The proposal envisages making TikTok Global a U.S.-headquartered company.But U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday raised questions about ByteDance’s plans to keep a majority stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations and said he did not favor the idea of the Chinese firm retaining control, after six Republican lawmakers urged him to reject the proposal.Trump has said he would ban TikTok in the United States as early as Sunday if ByteDance does not comply amid U.S. concerns that the company could pass user data to China’s Communist Party government.An outright sale of TikTok’s operations or technologies was not included in ByteDance’s proposal to the United States, Chinese state media reported on Thursday citing a separate statement from the company. ByteDance declined to comment when asked about this by Reuters.When asked about ByteDance’s comments regarding the need for China’s approval, the foreign ministry on Thursday urged the United States to respect the principles of the market economy and fair competition, and to stop politicising normal economic and trade cooperation. China late last month updated its export control rules to give it a say over the transfer of technology such as TikTok’s user recommendation algorithm to foreign buyers. Reuters has reported that the Oracle deal would not require ByteDance to apply to Chinese authorities for an export licence for TikTok’s algorithm.ByteDance and its founder Zhang Yiming have faced public criticism in China for seeming to give in to U.S. pressure after it was reported it was contemplating a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft Corp. Some netizens said they would stop using Douyin, ByteDance’s Chinese version of TikTok. “ByteDance, as it works to find a solution to keep TikTok’s U.S. business alive, is walking a tightrope between the demands of the U.S. government on the one side and the expectations of both the Chinese government and public on the other,” said Mark Natkin, managing director at Marbridge Consulting. “It can’t afford to make any missteps along the way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bytedance-says-china-will-have-to-approve-its-us-tiktok-deal/story-WOBcZP1vncUtVLp2bs8TLI.html

Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters “China strongly opposes” the visit by Under Secretary Keith Krach as it will “encourage the arrogant attitude of Taiwan independence separatist forces”.The US State Department says Krach was dispatched to Taipei to attend a memorial service for late president Lee Teng-hui on Saturday.But his visit to the island, which China claims as an indivisible part of the mainland, comes as the two superpowers eyeball each other over trade, tech dominance, security and human rights. Krach’s visit “seriously violates the One China Principle... and damages US-China relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan strait”, Wang said, citing the view that the island is a part of its territory.He warned Beijing will provide “a necessary response”, without giving further details.Last month, US cabinet member and health chief Alex Azar visited to highlight Taiwan’s widely praised efforts to stop Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encouraging-separatist-forces-china-strongly-opposes-us-envoy-s-visit-to-taiwan/story-8Hmj66jdRhP9rIg89JTsqK.html

An array of the nation’s biggest tech companies have warned that the policy will do “irreparable harm on businesses and the nation’s economy.”Also read: H-1B visa programme explained and what it means for IndiansBut in a ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington declined to bar the administration from imposing the visa restrictions while the legal challenge to them plays out.The case was brought by a group of 169 Indian nationals who recently went back to India after living in the US on work visas and are now attempting to return. They argued that the proclamation was “arbitrary and capricious” and called for the government to process their visa applications.Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But they said in a court filing that they will appeal.The president’s visa order freezes through the end of the year new H-1B and H-4 visas, widely used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intracompany transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs.Also read: US freeze on H-1B visas to hit IT firms coping with travel curbs amid Covid-19 crisisThe ruling on Wednesday was the second time this month that Mehta has denied a request to suspend the proclamation. Just as he did in a Sept. 4 ruling in a related case involving a group of visa applicants, Mehta found that the Indian workers fell short of the high legal threshold for an order blocking the decree while the litigation proceeds.In both cases, the judge concluded the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed in showing that Trump exceeded his authority with the proclamation.A different federal judge in Oakland, California, is weighing another request to block the decree from business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-restrictions-on-h-1b-visas-survive-early-court-fight/story-8wCTnagi3XTesGEt3YqMqN.html
17-09-2020||World||Indo-Canadian director’s short film Strong Son has lasting impact at TIFF||It may be the shortest film at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), spanning less than four minutes, but Strong Son is clearly leaving an everlasting impression on audiences, critics and organisers.The film, made by 34-year-old Indian-origin Sikh filmmaker Ian Bawa who is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, has made it to the top-ten lists of publications such as Now Toronto and the New York-based Film Stage. It has also been featured by national broadcaster CBC.Ian Bawa’s film is about the relationship between a weightlifter and his father. Bodybuilder Mandeep Sodhi was cast as the weightlifter, while the father’s role was played by the director’s parent, Jagdeep Singh Bawa. The filmmaker said he managed to submit his work for this year’s Short Cuts section at the TIFF only because pandemic-related shutdowns gave him the time he needed “to sit down, edit it and shape it”. The raw footage, Ian Bawa said, had been lying with him since last year. “I just needed a project and I threw all my energy into this,” he said.He called his film “super personal” and born of “pure passion”, as it is based on his personal equation with his father, who had immigrated to Canada from India in the 1970s. TIFF programmer Lisa Haller described the short film as “an endearing portrait” of the father-son bond. The narrative of the film includes humour and thought-provoking elements, which come out prominently through the father’s voiceover, providing the cultural backdrop of the characters portrayed. In one scene, for instance, the father ruminates aloud, “My son is getting older and I’m worried that he’s spent too much time getting strong and not enough time settling down.”Ian Bawa insists that despite highlighting typical Indian family riffs, the theme of the film is universal and the work has stemmed partly from his own personal “insecurities”.This isn’t the first time Ian Bawa has been part of a work that premiered at the TIFF. He worked with three colleagues, who call themselves the Winnipeg Collective, on the 2016 film, Imitations. “This is a year everyone is going to remember and I’m part of the new world of film festivals,” the filmmaker said, underlining the novelty factor at this year’s Toronto event that was compelled to be conducted largely online due to coronavirus-related restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indo-canadian-director-s-short-film-strong-son-has-lasting-impact-at-tiff/story-KgpsqbpHKC9BtaZrNBUtMM.html
17-09-2020||World||Outrage, calls for probe as US nurse raises alarm over mass hysterectomies||A whistleblower complaint filed in the US has sparked calls for a federal probe after it was alleged that an Indian-descent gynecologist had conducted mass hysterectomies on immigrants without their full understanding and consent at a privately-run detention centre in the state of Georgia.The complaint, filed by an employee of the detention centre, did not identify him. But lawyers representing the victims have named the doctor as Mahendra Amin, according to US media reports.“We are aware of the whistleblower’s allegations as they relate to Dr Amin and we vehemently deny them,” said Scott Grubman, the doctor’s attorney, in a statement. “We look forward to all of the facts coming out and are confident that, once they do, Dr Amin will be cleared of any wrongdoing.”Amin, 68, is an obstetrics and gynecology specialist. Prism, the news website that first reported the whistleblower complaint, said he is based in Douglas, Georgia and is affiliated with Coffee Regional Medical Center, which has since removed references to Amin from its website. According to reports, Amin studied medicine at the Government Medical College of South Gujarat University in Surat, India, and also interned there at a hospital.On Wednesday, 173 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote to the US department of homeland security, demanding an investigation into the whistleblower’s complaint.Pramila Jayapal, Indian-American congresswoman who initiated the joint letter along with senior party leaders, said, “It appears that there may be at minimum 17 to 18 women who were subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures from just this one doctor, often without appropriate consent or knowledge, and with the clear intention of sterilisation.”Dawn Wooten, a licensed nurse employed by Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) operated by private prison company, LaSalle Corrections, had filed the whistleblower complaint through Project South, a non-profit, with the inspector general of the department of homeland security on Monday. Wooten’s complaint alleged the conduct of mass hysterectomies amid rampant disregard for Covid-19 guidelines and unsanitary conditions at the facility.Project South said it learnt about the hysterectomies in interviews with multiple inmates. One of them reportedly confirmed, “A lot of women here go through a hysterectomy.” Also, some women subjected to the procedure reportedly seemed “confused” why they were made to undergo it.Wooten’s account, in her own words, is chilling. “Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy, just about everybody. He’s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady,” Wooten reportedly said, recalling a particular case. “She (the victim) was supposed to get her left ovary removed because it had a cyst. He took out the right one. She was upset, she had to go back to take out the left ovary and she wound up with a total hysterectomy. “She wants children. So she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can’t bear kids... she said she was not all the way out under anesthesia and heard him (the doctor) tell the nurse that he took out the wrong ovary.”The outrage sparked by the allegations was fuelled by a well-documented and alarming history of sterilisation of people of colour in the US aimed at preventing the rapid growth of their population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-calls-for-probe-as-us-nurse-raises-alarm-over-mass-hysterectomies/story-8RfZWLAybqJrkTv0qHKTRJ.html

This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving,” Mason said. “Hence, Barbados will take the next logical step toward full sovereignty and become a republic by the time we celebrate our 55th anniversary of independence.”That anniversary will come in November 2021.But on the Caribbean island nation the suggestion has been met with skepticism. The idea of becoming a republic has been put forward by different governments over the past decades.More recently, there has been frustration with the government’s delay in removing colonial ea statues.The bronze statue of Admiral Lord Nelson, erected in 1813, still stands on Broad Street in the capital city of Bridgetown.It was scheduled for removal last month when different countries around the world started removing similar statues from public spaces as protests against racism grew. Roy R. Morris, press secretary to the prime minister of Barbados, said in response to Reuters questions that there was no particular trigger for the timing of a renewed push to become a republic other than fulfilling a longstanding promise by the island’s politicians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barbados-governor-general-calls-to-leave-colonial-past-behind-become-full-republic/story-aaGCyaX8q9QOpHUAluL2OJ.html

17-09-2020||World||Hurricane Sally kills 1, swamps US Gulf Coast with massive floods, ‘unreal’ rain||Hurricane Sally uprooted trees, flooded streets and cut power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses on Wednesday as it brought what the US National Hurricane Center called “historic and catastrophic” flooding to the Alabama-Florida coast.Sally, which made landfall early Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 storm, was downgraded in the afternoon to a tropical storm as maximum sustained winds dropped to 70 miles per hour (113 kph).The storm is believed to have killed one person in Alabama. Also read: Hurricane Sally unleashes flooding near Florida-Alabama line, hundreds rescued“We had a body wash up, we believe it was hurricane related, but we have no definitive proof of that right now,” said Trent Johnson, a police lieutenant in Orange Beach, Ala. The person was local to the area, but has not yet been publicly identified, Johnson said. Some parts of the Gulf Coast had been inundated with more than 18 inches (46 cm) of rain over the previous 24 hours, with more precipitation expected as the storm’s winds slow further, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.The coastal community of Pensacola, Florida, suffered up to five feet of flooding, and travel was cut by damaged roads and bridges. More than 500,000 homes and businesses across the area were without power as the storm knocked over stately oak trees and tore power lines from poles. Several residents along the Alabama and Florida coasts said damage from the slow-moving storm caught them off guard.“Normally it goes away. But with this one it was first the anxiety of it coming and then when it finally came, it didn’t move,” said Preity Patel, 41, who has resided in a downtown Pensacola apartment for two years. “It was just constant rain and wind.”A section of the Pensacola Bay Bridge, known also as the “Three Mile Bridge,” is missing a “significant section,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said at a press conference. Also read: Hurricane Sally makes landfall on Alabama’s Gulf CoastThe storm was moving at a slow 5 mph pace toward the Alabama-Florida border but was predicted to pick up speed, the NHC said.“The rain is what stands out with this one: It’s unreal,” said Cavin Hollyhand, 50, who left his home on a barrier island and took shelter in Mobile, Alabama, where he viewed the damage on Wednesday. Some isolated areas could see up to 35 inches (89 cm) of rain before Sally is done, the NHC said.Upon landfall at Gulf Shores, Sally’s winds were clocked at 105 mph. Along the coast, piers were ripped away by the storm surge and winds. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey told residents not to go outside to check on damage unless necessary, and to stay away from live power lines and fallen trees.“We had strong winds for a long period of time,” said 38-year-old Grant Saltz as he took a break from clearing debris outside his Mobile restaurant. “Instead of a few hours we got it for 12 hours.”In Pensacola, where wind gusts were clocked at 77 mph at one point, images on social media showed major floods. One witness reported hailstorms in the city as well and the NHC warned of possible tornados.Pensacola police warned of high winds and urged residents not to drive around looking at damage.“We see lots of ‘lookers’ out,” the police department wrote on Twitter. “It’s slowing our progress down. Please stay at home!” Electrical crews from other states have arrived in Pensacola to aid in restoration efforts.“This year we’ve just got hurricane after hurricane,” said Matt Lane, 23, a member of a crew from New Hampshire Electric Coop, who arrived late Tuesday directly from Hurricane Laura recovery efforts in Texas. Sally is the 18th named storm in the Atlantic this year and the eighth of tropical storm or hurricane strength to hit the United States. There are currently three other named storms in the Atlantic, highlighting one of the most active Atlantic hurricane seasons on record.“We’ve only got one name left,” said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather data provider, referencing the procedure to name storms and the prospect of running out of letters. “That’s going to happen here soon, Wilfred, and then we’ll be into the Greek alphabet.” Hurricanes have increased in their intensity and destructiveness since the 1980s as the climate has warmed, according to researchers at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Climate change is also a factor in the increasing frequency of record-breaking wildfires plaguing the western United States, scientists say.Damage from Sally is expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which tracks tropical storms and models the cost of their damage. That estimate could rise if the heaviest rainfall happens over land, Watson said. As the storm moved east and inland, ports on the western Gulf Coast were reopened to travel and energy companies were beginning to return crews to offshore oil platforms.Sally shut more than a quarter of US Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas production. Two coastal oil refiners halted or slowed operations, adding to existing outages from last month’s Hurricane Laura and pandemic-related demand losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-sally-kills-1-swamps-us-gulf-coast-with-massive-floods-unreal-rain/story-aELGCtUttqU1qQ8W3KAWrM.html

The magazine’s endorsement was posted online on Tuesday, a day after Trump questioned the science of climate change in relation to the California wildfires. Helmuth said the timing was coincidental and the editorial was written during the past two months.Scientific American said that “the evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has basically damaged the United States and its people because he rejects evidence and science”.The editorial by senior editor Josh Fischman sharply condemned Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The magazine criticised Trump for seeking cutbacks in scientific funding and hobbling the US response to climate change. Biden, the magazine said, “has a record of following the data and being guided by science”. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from the Trump campaign. There’s been some pushback.

17-09-2020||World||Hurricane Sally unleashes flooding near Florida-Alabama line, hundreds rescued||Hurricane Sally lumbered ashore near the Florida-Alabama line with 105 mph (165 kph) winds and rain measured in feet, not inches, swamping homes and forcing the rescue of hundreds of people as it pushed inland for what could be a slow and disastrous drenching across the Deep South.Moving at an agonizing 3 mph, or about as fast as a person can walk, the storm made landfall at 4:45 a.m. local time Wednesday close to Gulf Shores, Alabama, about 30 miles from Pensacola. It accelerated to a light jog as it battered the Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama, metropolitan areas encompassing nearly 1 million people.It cast boats onto land or sank them at the dock, flattened palm trees, peeled away roofs, blew down signs and knocked out power to more than a half-million homes and businesses. A replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship the Nina that had been docked at the Pensacola waterfront was missing, police said.Sally tore loose a barge-mounted construction crane, which then smashed into the new Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, causing a section of the year-old span to collapse, authorities said. The storm also ripped away a large section of a fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf State Park on the very day a ribbon-cutting had been scheduled following a USD 2.4 million renovation.By the afternoon, authorities in Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, said at least 377 people had been rescued from flooded areas. More than 40 people trapped by high water were brought to safety within a single hour, including a family of four found in a tree, Sheriff David Morgan said.Authorities in Pensacola said 200 National Guard members would arrive Thursday to help. Officials also announced a three-day dusk-to-dawn curfew in the county, where the storm turned some Pensacola streets into white-capped rivers for a time.By early afternoon, Sally had weakened into a tropical storm, with winds down to 70 mph (110 kph), but the worst may be yet to come, with heavy rain expected into Thursday as the storm pushes inland over Alabama and into Georgia. For much of the day, it was moving at just 5 mph (7 kph), concentrating the amount of rain dropped on any one place.Morgan estimated thousands more will need to flee rising waters in the coming days. County officials urged residents to rely on text messages for contacting family and friends to keep cellphone service open for 911 calls.“There are entire communities that we’re going to have to evacuate,” the sheriff said. “It’s going to be a tremendous operation over the next several days.” West of Pensacola, power poles leaned halfway over in Perdido Key, Florida, as Joe Mirable arrived at his real estate business to find the two-story building shattered, its contents scatted on the ground.Digging through the ruins, Mirable pointed out a binder labeled “Hurricane Action Plan.” “I think the professionals got this one wrong,” he said before the wind blew away his hat.More than 2 feet of rain (61 centimetres) was recorded near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 metre) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service reported.“It’s not common that you start measuring rainfall in feet,” said forecaster David Eversole. “Sally’s moving so slowly, so it just keeps pounding and pounding and pounding the area with tropical rain and just powerful winds. It’s just a nightmare.” It was the second hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast in less than three weeks and the latest blow in one of the busiest hurricane seasons ever recorded, so frenetic that forecasters have nearly run through the alphabet of storm names with 2 1/2 months still to go. At the start of the week, Sally was one of a record-tying five storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic, strung out like charms on a bracelet.Like the wildfires raging on the West Coast, the onslaught of hurricanes has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing slower, rainier, more powerful and more destructive storms.An emergency crew rescued two people on Dauphin Island, Alabama, after the hurricane ripped the roof off their home and the rest of the house began to crumble.“As things started to peel off and fall apart, they got scared and called for assistance,” Mayor Jeff Collier said. He said no one was injured.In Orange Beach, Alabama, the wind blew out the walls in one corner of a condominium building, exposing the interiors of condos on at least five floors, video posted online showed. At least 50 people were rescued from flooded homes and taken to shelters, Mayor Tony Kennon said.“We got a few people that we just haven’t been able to get to because the water is so high,” Kennon said. “But they are safe in their homes. As soon as the water recedes, we will rescue them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-sally-unleashes-flooding-hundreds-rescued/story-KHJP1owhSVwcjEV5rZcxMJ.html
17-09-2020||World||Donald Trump’s town hall offered preview of debates||The coronavirus cannot be wished away. Real people kept it real. Preparation — and the moderator — matters.President Donald Trump’s town hall in front of undecided Pennsylvania voters offered an intriguing preview of how he may approach his first debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden in two weeks.Tuesday night’s event on ABC featured predictable attack lines and vague promises of policy from Trump. But it also showcased, again, the president’s struggle to effectively defend his handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 200,000 Americans.And while the president’s aides have been eager to shift focus off the virus, the town hall made clear that the campaign, now down to its final seven weeks, has remained a referendum on the president and the pandemic.Here are other takeaways from a night that served as a tantalizing opening act for the first general election debate on Sept. 29:DENIALISMMemorably, Trump said in February that the coronavirus would disappear “like a miracle.” His tone has not changed much seven months later.The president put himself at odds with some basic scientific facts about the virus, including being dismissive of his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s strong recommendation for Americans to use face masks.“There are people that don’t think masks are good,” Trump said, mentioning that waiters have struggled with their face coverings and did not like them.Trump also tried to counter his admission to journalist Bob Woodward that he had tried to “play it down” when discussing the threat of Covid-19 to Americans earlier this year. Although audio recordings of his comments have been released, Trump said: “Yeah, well, I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action.”He also, again, offered little acknowledgment of the historical injustices targeted at Black Americans.“Well, I hope there’s not a race problem,” the president said.PREPARATION MATTERSTrump has largely eschewed formal preparation for his debates with Biden, telling aides and allies that he believes his day job sparring with journalists will suffice. And Trump backers saw much that they liked in Trump’s performance Tuesday evening, including an opportunity for the president to make a rare, if uneven, display of empathy.But, privately, some are worried that Trump will face the same fate as many of his predecessors, who tend to grow complacent in the White House and can become flustered when they face their general-election rival for the first time.While some have gently advised Trump to study up, the president has largely ignored their advice for now, leaving allies holding their breath for Sept. 29.Also read: Biden advisers stress importance of masks, staying outdoors to fight CovidLONG-PROMISED POLICY PLANS“We’re signing a health care plan within two weeks,” Trump said on July 19. It would be introduced “hopefully, prior to the end of the month,” he told reporters in early August.No such plan has materialized, and few expect one to arrive before the election.Trump’s unfulfilled promises came into sharp relief during the town hall as Trump insisted he had a plan – but refused to share its details or explain why he’d waited more than 3 1/2 years to unveil it.“I have it all ready, and it’s a much better plan for you – and it’s a much better plan,” he insisted.Trump made a similar promise when it came to immigration, another issue on which he has been promising action for months without details materializing.“So we are doing something with immigration that I think is going to be very strong because we want people to come into our country,” he said. “And in a very short time, we’re going to be announcing it. And I think it’s going to have quite an impact.”REAL PROBLEMS. REAL EMOTIONS.The questions from self-described undecided voters were often more pointed than what the president is used to receiving.There was a diabetic man who explained that he had to dodge people who don’t social distance or wear a mask, a prime feature of the president’s campaign events. “Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?” asked Paul Tubiana, of Bethlehem, who said he had voted for Trump in 2016.The president sometimes began his answers before the questioners were done speaking, something Ellesia Blaque, of Wyomissing, did not allow. She asked the president how people with preexisting health conditions who work hard can stay insured. “Please stop and let me finish my question, sir,” she sternly insisted.And Flora Cruceta offered a question on behalf of her late mother, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who became a US citizen, asking, “What will you change to make more people, like me and like her, to become citizens and vote?Trump, who has worked to reduce legal and illegal immigration, promised another immigration plan that he said “actually will be popular for all.” He appeared to mishear her comment that her mother died of breast cancer and steered the conversation to the coronavirus and the prospect of a Covid-19 vaccine.MODERATORS MATTERABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos pushed back against some of Trump’s comments but didn’t always challenge the president’s misstatements.In answering a question about preexisting conditions, Trump said Democrats favor socialized medicine while his “strong” plan protects people with ailments they suffer before getting insurance.“Mr. President, I have to stop you there. ... No. 1, Joe Biden ran against Medicare for All in the primaries,” Stephanopoulos said.Stephanopoulos added that the Trump administration is trying to strike down the Obama administration’s health care law, which ensured coverage for people with preexisting conditions. He pointed out that Trump said in June 2019 that his health care plan would come out in two weeks and voters still haven’t seen it.On another pocketbook issue, Trump claimed that Biden “wants to raise everybody’s taxes.”Stephanopoulos went to the next question without noting that Biden has said no individual with taxable income of $400,000 or less would see a federal tax increase under his plans. Less than 2% of US households report that level of income.But, facing a moderator and not an opponent, Trump was able to often set the tone for the discussion. He displayed his tendency for meandering answers that don’t directly address the subject at hand.Despite pointed questions from voters about his record and some follow-ups about his misstatements, Trump barreled on and avoided the occasional outbursts that occur during his White House briefings.A debate in which Trump is face-to-face with Biden and has a strict time limit will be a different challenge entirely. For the first time, Trump will be placed on equal footing with Biden, making his preferred tactic of talking past difficult questions harder to pull off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-town-hall-offered-preview-of-debates/story-K71oN2H7yNM125sxLueSsM.html

He stabbed Bhavini Pravin, 21, in her home, when he went there to speak to her, and after some time stabbed her multiple times.He soon left the address and less than two hours after the incident, approached a police officer and made admissions implicating himself in the stabbing. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pravin died as a result of multiple stab wounds.Her father, Pravin Babu, said in a statement after Sorthi’s conviction last week: “Our daughter was only 21 years old when she was murdered…When our Bhavini was born, we felt that all of our prayers had been answered. She was the ‘Laxmi’ of our family”.“Growing up, she gave us so much joy and purpose. She was our inspiration to better ourselves and to build a future. Soon after, our two sons, Krutesh and Yagnesh, were born. Even from a young age, Bhavini doted on her little brothers. We decided to move to England so that we could give our children a better future”.“As parents our aspirations were that our daughter would get a good education, pursue her childhood career choice of nursing, marry the man of her dreams, have a family and live happily ever after.“When Jigu became engaged to our daughter, we trusted him to cherish, love and look after her forever. She was so precious to us. We showed Jigu nothing but love and acceptance. We brought him to England to give him a better life. We supported him, housed him.“And how did Jigu return our kindness – he repaid us by killing our beloved Bhavini”.Detective inspector Kenny Henry of the Leicestershire police said after sentencing: “Bhavini was a young woman who had the rest of her life to look forward to. She was a gentle caring soul and came from a close and very private family”.“It is fair to say she was the apple of her parents’ eyes. Losing Bhavini so early in life and in such tragic circumstances continues to take its toll on her parents and brothers – their lives have been changed forever”.“To have lost their beloved daughter to someone who they trusted to take care of her is something they will never recover from. Being present during the trial was understandably difficult for the family and I must commend their bravery, courage and dignity throughout”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-who-killed-estranged-partner-in-uk-jailed-for-life/story-SlkmrTD1GlqNQdLuhQ5ppJ.html
17-09-2020||World||Madrid mulls targeted Covid-19 lockdowns as infections surge||The Madrid region, one of the worst hit by Covid-19 in Spain, is planning to announce restrictions on movement on Friday that could include targeted lockdowns in virus hotspots, a senior official said, as the country’s infections surged again.Madrid accounts for around one-third of active coronavirus cases in Spain, with a higher incidence in high-density and low-income neighbourhoods, mainly in the south of the capital.The health ministry registered on Wednesday 4,728 new infections in the last 24 hours, including 1,854 in Madrid. That was up from 3,022 cases reported on Tuesday and brings the cumulative tally to 614,360 - Western Europe’s highest. With 17 new deaths, Spain’s death toll has reached 30,243.Madrid also accounts for the highest proportion of hospital capacity occupied by Covid-19 patients, at 22%, way above Spain’s average of 8.5%.“There will be decisions focused on restricting mobility,” Antonio Zapatero, head of the Covid-19 response for the region, told reporters, adding the health department was considering locking down areas with the highest incidence of the virus.“There has been a relaxation of behaviour that we cannot afford,” he said, adding people were organising parties, drinking in the street and not respecting quarantine rules. Since restrictions on movement were lifted and mass testing began in late June, infections have risen in Spain from a few hundred a day to thousands. Deaths have also increased to 50-60 per day in the past two weeks from single digits in July.“Many people are doing whatever they feel like, so I do think we need to have more measures,” said Ines Diaz, a Madrid resident. The latest plan comes amid controversy in Spain over who is to blame for the increase in infections, with regions and the central government pointing fingers at each other.Adding to the tensions, Madrid’s regional chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso said earlier this week “the way of life of immigrants” was partly to blame for the surge, attracting huge criticism.“We condemn your words that promote a racist stigma on our communities”, non-profit association SOS Racismo Madrid said on Twitter, adding that migrants usually have more precarious jobs, underprivileged housing and are more exposed to the virus.Also controversial is the region’s estimate, which it included in a report published on Tuesday, that around 40% of the active infections concern “people born outside Spain”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrid-mulls-targeted-covid-19-lockdowns-as-infections-surge/story-j2f0Grhklq01eAr5y6dXXL.html
17-09-2020||World||Mike Pompeo insists United States to enforce ‘UN’ sanctions on Iran||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted Wednesday the United States will enforce new ‘UN’ sanctions on Iran starting next week, despite overwhelming consensus that Washington is out of bounds.“The United States will do what it always does. It will do its share as part of its responsibilities to enable peace, this time in the Middle East,” Pompeo told a joint news conference with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.“We’ll do all the things we need to do to make sure that those sanctions are enforced,” he said.Pompeo last month headed to the United Nations to announce the “snapback” of sanctions under a 2015 Security Council resolution after failing to extend an embargo on conventional arms sales to Iran.Also read: Donald Trump vows ‘1,000 times greater’ response to any Iran attackThe resolution allows any participant in a nuclear accord with Iran negotiated under former president Barack Obama to reimpose sanctions, which would take effect one month afterward.President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord, which he has repeatedly denounced, but Pompeo argues that the United States remains a “participant” as it was listed in the 2015 resolution.The sanctions are authorized by a “valid UN Security Council resolution,” Pompeo said.Trump has already enforced sweeping unilateral US sanctions on Iran, inflicting a heavy toll in a bid to curb the clerical state’s regional influence.The United Nations has clearly said that it cannot proceed with the reimposition of UN sanctions, with 13 of the Security Council’s 15 nations objecting to the US move.European allies of the United States say that they support extending the arms embargo but want to preserve a diplomatic solution on the nuclear issue, which they see as more important.Playing down differences, Raab said of the nuclear accord: “We have always welcomed US and indeed any other efforts to broaden it.”“The means by which we get there, there may be shades of difference but we have handled them... constructively,” he said.The issue has come to a head less than two months before Trump seeks another term against Democrat Joe Biden, a supporter of the accord that curbed Iran’s nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-insists-united-states-to-enforce-un-sanctions-on-iran/story-d3DLT4Mc9eV5yDcOwFGFJJ.html
17-09-2020||World||Biden advisers stress importance of masks, staying outdoors to fight Covid||Advisers to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden stressed the importance of universal mask use and avoiding indoor gatherings as much as possible as the best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus during a briefing Wednesday.“Every time we open indoor bars, indoor gyms, we see an uptick” in the number of cases, said Zeke Emanuel, the vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania.Biden is expected to speak about the progress on coronavirus vaccines after the briefing ends.The Trump administration released its coronavirus vaccine distribution strategy on Wednesday, with the goal of ensuring vaccines will be shipped to administration sites within 24 hours of approval from US regulators. The federal guidance issued to states comes as the White House is funding various vaccine candidates as part of Operation Warp Speed.As the Trump administration promises an immediate vaccine, Biden advisers expressed caution about the ability to distribute one quickly. Though hopeful about its prospects, David Kessler, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, told Biden that Americans should not expect a rapid decline in cases before January if a vaccine becomes available because of “limited distribution” capacity.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBut top US health officials offered conflicting estimates Wednesday of when Americans should expect coronavirus vaccines to be widely available. Paul Mango, a deputy chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, said every American should be able to get a shot by the end of March, while Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, put it at late second quarter or third quarter of 2021.The development and distribution of a vaccine has become a political flash point in the presidential race, as President Donald Trump has promised a vaccine would be available “very soon” while Democrats and public health experts raise concerns about political interference in the process from the administration.Biden’s team has begun to plan for how his administration would oversee the complicated task of distributing a vaccine if he wins and a vaccine becomes available early in his term. His advisers are leveraging their relationships with officials in US government health agencies to monitor the administration’s progress.His advisers are primarily focused on working through the supply chain issues that will impede efforts to quickly vaccinate millions of people and end a pandemic that has killed more than 196,000 people and crashed the US economy into a recession.Experts say shrinking capacity on container ships and cargo aircraft, outdated technology to transport fragile vials of medicine and inadequate refrigeration are among the problems any administration will face in distributing the vaccine.Also read: AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trial in US remains on hold pending FDA reviewOne Biden adviser said the group is closely monitoring reports from experts on equitable distribution, particularly one from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The adviser said the group does not plan to publish recommendations before the election, but Biden advisers want to be prepared to start distribution as soon as a vaccine is ready.Though he has expressed concerns about Trump’s oversight of the vaccine, Biden has reiterated his desire for a safe one to be made available as quickly as possible.“If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I’d do it,” Biden told reporters last week. “If it cost me the election I’d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-advisers-stress-importance-of-masks-staying-outdoors-to-fight-covid/story-l7rBwQxWYr5MjX6uIhMneN.html
17-09-2020||World||AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trial in US remains on hold pending FDA review||AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine study remains paused in the US pending a regulatory review of an incident in which a UK participant became ill, federal officials said.The British drugmaker and its partner, the University of Oxford, put research into the shot on hold last week after the volunteer suffered neurological symptoms. Trials resumed in the UK over the weekend, while researchers in South Africa also restarted tests, saying that an independent safety committee concluded that the event was unlikely to be related to the vaccination.Temporary pauses in clinical trials aren’t unusual. However, the reported event has heightened worry that the global campaign to find a Covid-19 vaccine is moving too quickly. AstraZeneca is among several drugmakers who have agreed to work with and supply shots to Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s effort to expedite the development of an inoculation.Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, told CNN it’s probably just a matter of time before they restart in the US Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the Warp Speed initiative, said the trial would resume when independent safety monitors and the Food and Drug Administration determine it’s safe.“This pause while the adverse event is fully investigated means the science-based, data-driven process is working as it should,” he said in a statement.FDA’s ReviewFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during an Instagram Live event that the agency is “going to do very significant work with the company to figure out if there’s a significant safety issue or not.”The trial went on pause worldwide last week while doctors looked into the illness of a phase 3 clinical trial participant who received the vaccine and became ill. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Tuesday “it would be unusual to completely stop a trial on the basis of one single adverse event.”The Serum Institute of India has received Indian regulatory approval to resume local trials and intends to restart in the next day or two, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the regulator’s decision isn’t public.A representative for AstraZeneca declined to comment.Data from final-stage trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected as soon as next month, and Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said last week the injection could still be available by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-in-us-remains-on-hold-pending-fda-review/story-kAtwS6xxBG6nOwqUeSaCEO.html

The Lokayukta has ordered the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) of the Goa Police to register an FIR against him.Passing an order based on a complaint that the Anti-Corruption Branch had failed to register the FIR, the Lokayukta has also called for action against the then Superintendent of Police for “dereliction of duty”.“The file was sent to the then chief minister for the purpose of getting permission to register FIR and to investigate thereafter. However, the note sheets indicate that the then chief minister has merely endorsed that ‘since the matter was pending before the Lokayukta there was no necessity of parallel investigation’,” the Lokayukta noted in the order.“It is crystal clear that the then CM avoided the responsibility obviously because the present respondent was serving a minister and an MLA belonging to the ruling party,” Goa Lokayukta Justice PK Misra said in his order.Justice Misra pointed out that the chief minister, being the home minister, was well aware that “the Lokayukta with its royal force of two constables and two head constables (two have since been repatriated to the police department by now) was not in a position to make any investigation relating to disproportionate assets.”Also read: ‘Desist from regulating electronic media’ - Centre urges Supreme Court“It is evident that the ACB and the then chief minister have shirked and shied away from their responsibility by not registering FIR and conducting any investigation whatsoever on the pretext that the matter was pending before the Lokayukta,” the Lokayukta noted.“As a matter of fact, all the postings of investigative staff in the Lokayukta had been done through the vigilance department and therefore it has to be presumed that the ACB, including the then chief minister, were aware that only two constables and two head constables had been appointed in the Institution of the Lokayukta as part of investigating staff (two have been repatriate in the meantime),” he said.“In other words, the then chief minister of Goa expected that the Lokayukta was to undertake investigation relating to a disproportionate assets case with the assistance of two constables and two head constables and on that basis the then chief minister evaded and avoided the responsibility of the registration of FIR and investigation into the alleged response,” he noted.“Prima facie there has dereliction in duty by the then SP... the office is directed to initiate a suo motu proceeding against the then SP for gross dereliction of duty so that appropriate recommendation can be made,” the order read.A complaint was filed before the Anti Corruption Branch that a Nikitasha Realtors Pvt Ltd, which is owned by BJP MLA and former minister Pandurang Madkaikar, has constructed a ‘lavishly built’ home that was valued at around Rs 200 crore, despite declaring a family of only Rs 1.68 lakh for the year 2015-16, when the construction was realised.Complainant advocate Aires Rodrigues then approached the Anti Corruption Branch with but later claimed that no action was being taken by the ACB, which he said was dragging its feet. He later approached the Lokayukta.Madkaikar in his reply has denied the allegations made relating to having disproportionate assets and explained that the building was constructed by Nikitasha Realtors which is a separate private company in the real estate business and he being the Managing Director of the company was only allowed to stay in such a building.He also claimed that the construction of the building was within the means of the private company based on its valuation and assets, and that he could not be indicted unless it was demonstrated that he holds assets beyond his known source of income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/he-avoided-responsibility-goa-lokayukta-faults-ex-cm-parrikar-for-shielding-cabinet-colleague/story-u6TRz7Ranj0ML0iSs2l7TI.html

Now, both Ram temple and mosque are being constructed in Ayodhya (at separate locations). Several accused in the (Babri demolition) case have died. It is my personal opinion that the CBI court must acquit all 32 accused to end the dispute and pave the way for Hindu-Muslim unity,” said Ansari. On November 9 last year, the apex court had paved the way for construction of the Ram temple at what was known as the disputed site till then. The court also ordered the government to allot land for the construction of a mosque elsewhere in Ayodhya.“When the Supreme Court has resolved the dispute (Ayodhya title suit), the CBI court (Lucknow) must also end the dispute and acquit all accused in the larger interest of the nation,” added Ansari. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust had invited three Muslims for the Ram temple bhoomi pujan on August 5 – Iqbal Ansari, Mohammad Sharif, both from Ayodhya, and Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board chairman Zufar Ahmed Farooqui of Lucknow. But only Ansari attended the ceremony. Ansari was also against the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s decision to file a review petition in the Supreme Court against the top court’s Ayodhya verdict. The Supreme Court dismissed all review petitions in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acquit-all-in-babri-case-for-unity-muslim-litigant-iqbal-ansari/story-X7icC4k3QALOUSWJi6g1iO.html

The ward has posters with Hindi and English alphabets along with pictures on it. There is also a play area with colourful posters and matting with alphabets on it, and toys for the children being treated at the hospital. A small park with slides and swings has also put set up for the children.“We get many children who are Covid-19 positive and are admitted to the hospital along with their parents. However, if the parents develop complications and need to be moved the intensive care units then the children used to cry. They wanted to go back home. So, we felt very bad about how the pandemic was affecting little children and wanted to do something about it,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, director of the hospital.The hospital has also installed seven televisions sets that play cartoons for the children. So far, 415 Covid-19 positive children have received treatment at the hospital. There is also a separate ward for children who do not have the infection.Also read: ‘Yoga in burqa’ - Uttarakhand boxer girl fights all odds to teach yoga to women“Sometimes the patients have travelled to Delhi from UP, Haryana and Punjab and they do not have any place to leave their children behind.

The priests have been protesting against the formation of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board since June.A statement released by Rudraprayag district administration on Thursday stated, “…under section 15 (5) (6) of Devasthanam Management Act, orders have been passed to comply with the said order prohibiting any sit-in demonstration in the 200-meter radius of the shrine and the main access road from the Valley Bridge to the temple.” Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, said that the decision was taken after complaints by yatris that they were disturbed with the priests protesting outside the shrine. “We got a few complaints from yatris that priests are sitting outside the shrine bare chested and protesting, making the yatris feel uncomfortable. We had also learnt that the priests tried to convince yatris to join their protest. Representatives from the Board have tried talking to the priests along with attempts from the district administration also, but they are not budging. Now, we have said that they are free to carry out their protests, but not in the temple premises,” said Raman. He added that if the priests do not comply with the orders then it can also lead to imprisonment and will have criminal implications also. Vinod Shukla, president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, said, “We have been protesting since months now and the government has not paid heed to our demands. The government has released this order, which goes against our rights, we have been holding a peaceful protest. Now, our protest will continue and we will intensify it with support from people of the whole Kedarnath valley and we will not move till the chief minister comes to talk to us.” When asked whether the district administration or members of the Board approached them for talks, Shukla denied any meeting from the Board’s side. On June 21, The Uttarakhand high court (HC) dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha (RS) member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and 51 other shrines through the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. The court ruled that the ownership of the temple properties would vest in Char Dham shrines and power of the Board would be confined only to the administration and management of the properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-banned-within-200-m-of-kedarnath-shrine-won-t-budge-say-priests/story-b5Ia1pt40Fpr87YCvPWmpL.html

However, a party leader said there is no threat to the alliance.The SAD, which clarified that it continues to be part of the NDA government, is opposed to the farm bill moved by the government, alleging that it is anti-farmer.Also Watch | Harsimrat Kaur resigns from Union Cabinet in protest against farm bills SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said that the farmers’ produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) Bill 2020 and the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services Bill 2020 do not have the party’s sanction. The third bill, the Essential Commodities (amendment) Bill 2020 has already been passed in Lok Sabha, though the SAD opposed that as well.A senior BJP functionary on condition of anonymity said the “outstanding issues will be taken up” and sought to downplay the differences that have cropped up between the allies.After the 2019 general election, this is the second time that the BJP has been drawn into a disagreement with an ally. Soon after the Maharashtra assembly election; the BJP fell out with its oldest ally, the Shiv Sena over power sharing in the state. At the time, Sena had demanded a rotational chief minister, but the BJP turned down the suggestion. Eventually, the two allies parted ways and the Sena joined hands with the Congress and the NCP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition government in the state.On Wednesday, BJP chief JP Nadda described the three bills as revolutionary, adding that this farsighted legislation will lead to empowerment of farmers. He said the farmers would be free to sell their produce in a competitive market of their choice and only the Congress is opposed to them. When asked about the SAD’s opposition to the bills, Nadda indicated the issues had been resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-harsimrat-kaur-resigns-bjp-runs-into-trouble-with-old-ally/story-rnLsiN1xUAd6mQiRAkIM1K.html
17-09-2020||India||Harsimrat Kaur ejects out of Cabinet over farm bills, her party stays in NDA||Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has resigned from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, as the BJP ally on Thursday opposed the two farm bills that seek to liberalise the agriculture sector, exposing a crucial rift on the issue of farmers and agricultural reforms.“I have resigned from Union Cabinet in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation. Proud to stand with farmers as their daughter & sister,” tweeted Harsimrat Badal.The party, however, continues to be a part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance. While announcing the SAD’s decision to withdraw their minister from the Modi Cabinet, her husband and party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said the SAD would continue to support the government and BJP, but will oppose the anti-farmer policies. Watch | Harsimrat Kaur resigns from Union Cabinet in protest against farm bills “These bills have many provisions that go against farmers’ interests. We have repeatedly asked the government that please address the apprehensions of farmers, but the government has done nothing. Therefore, I oppose these bills,” SAD MP from Ferozpur, Sukhbir Singh Badal said in the Lok Sabha during the debate on the The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which replace similar ordinances.The SAD had been requesting the Centre not to go ahead with the three agriculture-related bills for approval of Parliament “until all reservations expressed by farmers’ organisations, farmers and farm labourers” are addressed.On September 12, the party had formally asked the Centre not to enact three farm ordinances during the monsoon session of Parliament, which began on September 14.On Tuesday, Sukhbir Badal, the MP from Punjab’s Ferozepur, voted against the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha, saying the proposed legislation was “against the interests of farmers”.“The legislation will affect the entire procurement system. It is not just about mandis. It doesn’t take into account the realities of our farm sector,” Badal said, opposing the bills today.The SAD was a party of farmers, Sukhbir Badal said. The Centre would have done better to organise a meeting with farmers before moving ahead with the bills and adequately address their concerns, he said.The Congress government in Punjab had passed a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha against the ordinances, prompting the SAD to fiercely oppose the bills after initially supporting it.The SAD’s core committee had issued a press release saying they had met farm organisations, farmer representatives and representatives to take their views. “Farmers are against these bills because it would make them vulnerable,” Badal said.Farmers are already protesting these ordinances in food bowl states, such as Haryana and Punjab, and influential farmers’ unions are also preparing to square off with the government on the demand of making profitable sales in the form of minimum support prices, or MSPs, a legal right.The All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a front for nearly 200 farmers’ groups, has opposed the bills. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh is also unhappy with the ordinances. It demanded safeguards for the farming community, so has the Bhartiya Kisan Union.Farmer groups said they feared the new changes would lead to big monopolies. This would be just as bad as current cartelisation in mandis known as agricultural produce market committees (APMCs).“We want the ordinances to be signed into law with appropriate safeguards, such as a national portal of farm trade corporations,” said Mohini Mohan Mishra, all-India secretary of the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-anti-farmer-legislation-union-minister-harsimrat-badal-resigns/story-DLHabSd0dUchJAc6sKr0yO.html

Pradhan is among 500 newly appointed women recovery agent of the state-owned power distribution company, MP Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitran, who have replaced men across 16 districts for the job.Like men, they also get five to ten percent commission of the money recovered, depending on the amount recovered, from defaulters and have been trained to use an online application to track power bills and default in payment. On average, a woman recovery agent earns, between Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per month, which these women say is enough for rural parts of Madhya Pradesh. There are additional incentives for preventing power theft in the villages, said Manoj Diwedi, public relation officer of the company.Pradhan says because of their work they have earned sobriquets such as ‘Vasooli Bhabhi’, ‘440-volt current’. Many villagers think that the work is not suitable for them. Also read: Union minister Harsimrat Badal resigns over Centre’s new farm bills“Earning from my husband’s grocery shop decreased due to Covid-19 lockdown. In June, I learnt about the new job opportunity for women in the power district company and I immediately joined it without even thinking how will I be able to do it,” Pradhan, who has a bachelors degree in education, said. She recalled that in the first month people used to ridicule her, show distrust and some elderly advised her that the work was not suitable for her. Overcoming all odds, she made some people pay bills after a month and earned Rs 500. “Now, people have started respecting me and also offer me a chair to sit,” she said. Rashmi Meena, 30, of Sonasavri village in Itarsi district, has to prevent power theft in addition to recovering money. “I couldn’t be harsh with villagers and lodge complaints on noticing power theft because of their poor financial condition,” she said. Every morning she runs into agriculture fields outside the village and urge villagers with folded hands not to steal power. “I tell them that they may have to go to jail for power theft and their children will not get government schemes benefits,” she said, adding that many villagers have now stopped power theft. Some of the women, like Nisha Vishwakarma, 42, of Bairasiya in Bhopal district, have got the support of their husbands in doing the job which is primarily male-dominated. “When people mocked my wife’s job by saying that now she would climb the electric pole too as a lineman, I just tell them that no work is gender-specific and it’s a matter of pride for me that women have been handed over a job which men failed to perform,” said her husband Balmukund Vishwakarma. Madhya Pradesh’s energy minister Pradyuman Singh said, “With their soft approach and hard work, these women are giving a befitting reply to scorn directed to them by men. The scheme has borne good result and these women have received Rs 10 lakh so far.” Diwedi said the agents get up to 15 percent of the commission depending on the pending amount and 10 percent on reporting power theft. More money recovered, higher is the commission. They also get commission on initiating new power connections, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vasooli-bhabhi-meet-madhya-pradesh-s-women-recovery-agents-for-outstanding-power-bills/story-QVmGCNWNtVEODK4Ccw91SJ.html

17-09-2020||India||WHO spotlights safety of health workers amid Covid-19, releases charter||A day after the Centre said it had no national database on the number of health workers who had died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the World Health Organization on Thursday released a Health Worker Safety Charter that calls on governments to address persistent threats to the health and safety of healthcare staff and their families who are facing disproportionately high risk of infection and death.Health worker safety is critical to ensure continued availability, access and delivery to health services. While health workers represent less than 3% of the population in the large majority of countries and less than 2% in almost all low and middle-income countries, around 14% of Covid-19 cases reported to WHO are among health workers. “No country, hospital or clinic can keep its patients safe unless it keeps its health workers safe.… Every day, health workers are exposed to stress, burnout, stigma, discrimination and even violence. Now more than ever, we have a duty to give health workers the safe working conditions, the training, the pay and the respect they deserve,” said Dr Tedros A Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at the launch of the charter. At least 136 million people are employed in the health and social services sector globally, according to the WHO. “Some of the factors that are contributing to an alarming number of infections among health workers are the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) or the proper training to use it. WHO has been supporting countries to address this issue by providing PPE to countries along with masks and face shields, gowns, gloves and goggles; and training health workers on their use and infection prevention and control,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, of which India is a part. Data from India is woefully inadequate. Since health is a state subject, the Union health ministry does not have national data on Covid-19 infections and deaths among health workers, according to the ministry of health and family welfare statement in Parliament on September 15. The Centre only has records of the deaths of only 155 health workers whose families had sought relief under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Package that offers an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh for loss of life or accidental death for people on Covid-19-related duty. In India, 64 doctors, 32 nurses, 14 Asha (community health workers) and 45 support staff, such as ambulance drivers, ward boys, cleaners, and cremation staff have sought the insurance cover, according to the government statement. This is a fraction of the deaths attributed to Covid-19 by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which said 382 doctors have died, with the youngest being 27 and the oldest, 85 years old. “If we can have national data for Covid-19 cases and deaths, why can’t we have national data for cases and deaths among doctors and other health workers? Blaming the lack of nationwide data on health being a state subject is inexcusable. Like soldiers, health workers fight in the frontlines, but unlike soldiers, we also risk taking the infection home to our homes,” said Dr Ranjan Sharma, national president, IMA. The physical risks are accompanied with psychological stress from working in high-risk settings for long hours, constant fear of infection, separation from family, and social stigmatisation. Two in five healthcare professionals on Covid-19 duty have trouble sleeping, and one in five report depression and anxiety, with the rates of depression and anxiety being higher in female health workers and nursing staff than men, found an analysis of data from 13 studies of 33,062 frontline workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study was published in the journal,Brain, Behaviour and Immunityin August.“Reducing the workload and stress on health workers is imperative. Healthcare workers are in need of psychosocial support in these trying circumstances. Communities can play their part by adopting behaviours that reduce disease spread so that healthcare systems, and as result health workers, are not burdened. We all have a role to play,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh. The charter also calls for ensuring adequate rest breaks, safe staffing levels, and fair duration of working hours for optimal physical and mental health.Among the other key recommendations of WHO’s Health Worker Safety charter are establishing synergies between health worker and patient safety strategies through infection prevention and control programmes, and reporting, licensing and accreditation standards; ensuring occupational health and safety; and zero tolerance to violence among health workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-spotlights-safety-of-health-workers-amid-covid-19-releases-charter/story-P1t4f5elKZWg5HVkOBpPLJ.html

17-09-2020||India||‘Desist from regulating electronic media’: Centre urges Supreme Court||The central government on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to refrain from undertaking the exercise of laying down guidelines to regulate electronic media like television channels, stating that the field is already governed by laws made by Parliament and judgments delivered by the top court in the past.In an affidavit filed before the apex court on Thursday, the centre said that no further guidelines are required but in the event the court embarks upon the process, then it should first be undertaken with regard to digital media like web portals, YouTube channels, et. cetera., which the centre claimed has a faster reach and wider range of viewership in comparison to mainstream media.“This court may not undertake the exercise of laying down any further guidelines… it is desirable that if this court decides to undertake the exercise, it should first be undertaken with regard to digital media as there already exists sufficient framework and judicial pronouncements with regard to electronic media and print media,” it was submitted.Also read: ‘It may be a long winter’ - Singapore envoy amid India-China tension at LACThe affidavit was filed in the case against television (TV) channel Sudarshan News which was thrust into the limelight after it telecast a show called “Bindas Bol” relating to the entry of Muslims in civil services.On September 15, the top court had barred further telecast of the controversial programme after it took strong exception to the contents of the show observing that the first four episodes of the show gave an impression that it was being aired with the insidious objective of vilifying the Muslim community and to bring it into disrepute.The bench, which also comprised Justices KM Joseph and Indu Malhotra, had also expressed inclination to hold a detailed hearing to decide on the regulation of TV news channels and suggested the appointment of a committee of five distinguished citizens to frame standards for regulation of the electronic media.In its affidavit, the Centre submitted that no such exercise needs to be undertaken merely based on few episodes telecast by one channel, Sudarshan News.“Even if this court considers it appropriate to undertake the said exercise, there is no justification to confine this exercise only to mainstream electronic media. Digital media has faster reach from a wider range of viewership/readership and has the potential to become viral because of several electronic applications like Whatsapp, Twitter (and) Facebook,” the affidavit stated. The case will be taken up for hearing on Friday.Meanwhile, Sudarshan News also filed its response in the matter on Wednesday defending the programme and the use of the term “UPSC Jehad” in the programme.The Noida based channel maintained that it has no ill-will against any particular community or individual and does not oppose the selection of any meritorious candidate. The programme, it claimed, is intended to highlight the allegedly dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organization, Zakat Foundation, which supports and provides coaching to civil service aspirants.“Zakat Foundation has received funds from various terror-linked organizations. It is not that all contributors to the Zakat Foundation are terror-linked. However, some of the contributors are linked to organizations or are organizations that fund extremist groups. The funds received by the Zakat Foundation, in turn, are used to support aspirants for IAS, IPS or UPSC,” Sudarshan News submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/desist-from-regulating-electronic-media-centre-urges-supreme-court/story-ui90RktPPqVZ0ekNawmBfP.html
17-09-2020||India||Will levy user charge to redevelop railway stations, says Niti Aayog CEO||The Indian Railways will soon start levying a ‘user fees’ as part of train fares for redeveloping railway stations and modernising infrastructure for bringing in investment, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Thursday. The user development fees model will be used by the national transporter for the first time. User Development Fee (UDF) is part of the tax paid by air passengers. UDF is charged at various airports and the rate of UDF varies from airport to airport based on various factors. Railways plans to levy the user fees across nearly 700-1000 railway stations.“We are going to keep a very small amount for the user charge. We will issue a notification for the user charge for all stations including both who are getting redeveloped and those which are not. When the redevelopment of the stations gets completed the money will go to the concessionaires, till then that money will go to the railways for improving facilities across stations. It will be an affordable amount, but it is important to levy if we want to provide world class facilities similar to the airport developments. We want to upgrade all our major railway stations,” railway board CEO VK Yadav said.“We will not levy the charge across all our 7,000 stations but all major stations where the footfall of passengers is increasing over the next five years. It will be done in about 10-15% of all our stations where we expect the footfall to increase,” he added. This comes in the backdrop of the government’s plan to bring in private investment in the national carrier. The railways plans to redevelop 50 railway stations, and monetise its land. The redeveloped hubs will be called ‘Railopolis’, according to the railways. It will lease the land out for 60 years for commercial purposes.“We want railways to drive India’s growth story. In countries like Japan and South Korea the growth story was also driven by railway infrastructure. We are confident going forward railways will contribute 1-2% towards India’s growth,” Kant said. Apex policy think-tank Niti Aayog had, in October, pulled up the ministry of railways for delayed implementation of the Centre’s plan. Niti Aayog had recommended an empowered group of top bureaucrats to develop 50 stations on priority basis.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had in 2016 announced its plan of redeveloping 400 railway stations during its first tenure. As per the plan, the cost of station redevelopment project was to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the stations.The railway ministry also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.“The focus is Make in India, even the global companies that participate in this will have to follow the Make in India norms by the DPIIT. This will bring in manufacturing capacity in India. When Alstom and Bombardier can manufacture metro trains in India then why can’t trains be manufactured. Everything will set up in India,” Kant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-levy-user-charge-to-redevelop-railway-stations-says-niti-aayog-ceo/story-hOJsYLpiEg7MXDOPlcIdWI.html
17-09-2020||India||Nothing came to me on a silver platter, says Anangsha Biswas||Actor Anangsha Biswas feels that OTT platform has opened a new pathway for talented actors. “There are many actors like me who have talent as their only support and OTT has turned out to be our life-saving platform, offering several well crafted characters to play. Cinema making is a huge undertaking with a lot of money riding on it that’s why many producers think twice before investing on actors who are still in the process of carving a niche for themselves. Whereas, OTT show makers are readily taking chances on good actors who are still striving to make a mark,” said Anangsha over the phone. The ‘Mirzapur’ and ‘Hostages’ actor believes that the industry over the time has become more talent centric, “If you are talented you will get good work. If you are not, you won’t — it’s as simple as that.” On selection of roles, she said, “If my character is performance based rest does not matter to me. In ‘Mirzapur’ I had just four scenes and didn’t expect to get noticed amid stalwart actors. I took the risk expecting more from the second season. But, the kind of love Zareena got was literally amazing. It gave me maximum exposure.” For Anangsha size of the role has become is never a priority as long as it’s a strong storyline. “Nothing came to me on a silver platter. So, I had to take risks to move ahead else I wouldn’t have been where I am today. Whatever little I have achieved till day it has been my hard work and probably that is why I am able to express myself easily.” Though ‘Mirzapur’ was wrapped up in Varanasi but all her scenes were shot in Mumbai. However, this time Anangsha got an opportunity to shoot for a show in Lucknow, “This was my first visit to the city. I really like the architecture and monuments there. And when I got two days break, I travelled all across the place. Luckily, I also got to taste biryani, kebabs and other Awadhi cuisine.” Anangsha has another connection with city. She was launched by Sudhir Mishra in ‘Khoya Khoya Chand’ (2005) and then got her major break with his OTT debut directorial ‘Hostages’ and its second season in which Mishra is series director. “I was in top 16 of ‘Cinestar Ki Khoj’ (2014) where he was one of the judges. In 2010, I shifted to Mumbai from Kolkata and started with theatre. I did ‘Luv Shuv Chutney Tey Chicken Khurana,’ and then went to Australia for a year for acting studies.” Next I am going to shoot for a film with Saumitra Singh, director of ‘The Wallet.’ “Because of Covid situation I’m not taking too much work as I believe this year it’s more about survival than anything else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/nothing-came-to-me-on-a-silver-platter-says-anangsha-biswas/story-k8Kp3eBC6dooio9NdvVsTI.html

Learning and unlearning are two sides of a same coin for me. I always try to soak in maximum creativity that is happening in my surroundings,” said the ‘Ye Hai Mohabbatein,’ actor. Last seen in shows like, ‘Ek Veer Ki Ardaas Veera,’ ‘Bajirao,’ ‘Fixerr’ started his career being a fashion student and then a model. “After completing my course from NIFD Chandigarh, I took up modelling before designing fashion shows and trying photography.

Soon I decided to try acting and started auditioning before landing my first acting project. I love working in-front of the camera as well as behind, so undertook assisting for web show ‘Baarish,’ season 1 & 2. Now soon I have plans to direct a Punjabi film,” he said.Gagan is in Benares, UP, for a shoot of his upcoming OTT series.

17-09-2020||India||‘It may be a long winter’: Singapore envoy amid India-China tension at LAC||It is imperative for India and China to find an amicable solution to their border standoff as any flare-up of tensions could have far-reaching implications for post-Covid-19 recovery efforts across the region, Singapore’s new high commissioner Simon Wong Wie Kuen said on Thursday. Expressing concern at the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in his first interview to the Indian media after presenting his credentials last week, Wong acknowledged the two sides could be in for a “long winter” and that efforts to find a solution may not be easy, though there is no alternative to dialogue. The envoy also spoke on Singapore’s priorities in its economic relations with India, participation in New Delhi’s plans to forge resilient supply and value chains, and collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. Asked about the implications of the India-China standoff, Wong said there is a “stalemate and a stare-down situation”. He said, “It may be a long winter, it will not have an easy solution but I think the messages coming out from both sides are very calm and the operating principle is still trying to figure out something of a resolution through diplomatic means.” He added, “We are good friends of both India and China. The last thing we want is to have skirmishes grow bigger and bigger because now both sides are in a stare-down position and the troop levels of both sides are very high. We don’t want any untoward incidents happening because from the Covid-19 recovery point of view, if we have two big economic engines suffer as a result, the whole Asian economy will suffer for a prolonged period of time. “We don’t want to see that happen, we have been urging both sides to stay calm and find an amicable solution to it…But we are concerned about what’s happening in Ladakh in particular, in Pangong Tso. We hope calmer heads prevail.” Responding to a question on whether resolving the border issue will be a protracted process even if current tensions dissipate, the envoy said it is “always problematic [in] relations between…two humongous neighbours to resolve [things]”. He suggested “harsh negotiations” would be better than an exacerbation of tensions. “If you were to have harsh negotiations and you cross with words, I think it’s easier because it’s common practice, even in FTA negotiations – harsh, tough negotiation postures, but thereafter, when the deal is done, you shake hands and that’s it,” he said. “But the memory of 1962 is very, very strong because it was a military conflict…My humble advice is that both sides should think very carefully how they want to move forward and to be sure, both sides understand this very clearly...in the operating principle, both sides should sit down and talk and resolve this diplomatically,” he added. Amid the Covid-19 crisis, the world being at an “inflection point” and a very “acrimonious US-China relationship”, Singapore’s priorities for the relationship with India include enhanced trade and investments and collaboration in areas such as healthcare for developing vaccines, Wong said. Even during the Covid-19 crisis, Singapore committed around $2 billion of new investments into India, and it is also keen to work with India on moves to forge new supply and value chains, he said. “Because we came in early to India, that conversation of plugging India into our part of the world is continuing non-stop…Cumulatively, Singapore has $85 billion committed to India. On your side, you have close to $60 billion. It is an equal partnership and we have about 650 Singapore companies set up in India and about 8,500 Indian companies are set up in Singapore. That notion of supply chain security and supply chain rework is always in play,” Wong said. Wong said there will be “a competition of ideas” in the Indo-Pacific and Singapore endorses the Asean vision for the region – “which is to say we keep the waters around our region peaceful, the organisation should be inclusive and not exclusive, it should not be targeted at one or two particular countries, and the focus should be on economics, and less military”. The Indian preference, he noted, is to “have Quad, Quad-plus or trilaterals”. He added, “India is free to have conversations with like-minded parties which share the same interests...I feel that down the road, India should also have a conversation with Asean on the configuration of your ideas and the Asean ideas.” Wong also spoke on Singapore’s efforts to help foreign workers, including some 100,000 Indians, affected by the pandemic. Besides free medical facilities and testing, Singapore has provided grants to companies so that salaries are paid even when workers don’t go to work. However, as many businesses that hire foreign workers have closed down, they may be sent home and the “next step is for us to make sure that they are fairly compensated and if they intend to stay on, we will have to look for jobs for them”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-may-be-a-long-winter-singapore-envoy-amid-india-china-tension-at-lac/story-lcXqJjK0DT0moPAReplpWI.html

As per information provided by the missions, many people who have registered may no longer wish to return. Moreover, as per latest guidelines of Government of India, passengers are no longer required to register for Air Bubble flights,” he said.“Most people with compelling reasons have safely returned to their homes by air, land and sea. The exercise to bring back stranded Indians is ongoing under the Vande Bharat Mission,” he said.“Our Missions have assisted more than 62,000 Indian nationals in distress involving an expenditure of nearly Rs 22.5 crores from the Indian Community Welfare Fund,” he said.Responding to a separate question on the number of students and workers brought back under the Vande Bharat Mission, Muraleedharan said 56,630 students and 3,08,099 workers had been brought back.Asked about the details of the facilities being given to the workers brought back to the country, the minister said, “With the aim of making the best of our skilled workforce returning to the country due to the ongoing pandemic, the Government of India launched an initiative SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) to conduct a skill mapping exercise of the returning citizens under the Vande Bharat Mission.” SWADES, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of External Affairs, is aimed to create a database of qualified citizens based on their skill sets and experience to tap into and fulfil demand of Indian and foreign companies.This was done to facilitate reintegration of migrant workers into the labour market and promote effective employment opportunities, he said.“For facilitating employment opportunities, details of SWADES registrations have been integrated with Skill India’s ASEEM (Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping) portal which was launched on July 10, 2020,” he said.All data regarding Indians returning under Vande Bharat Mission was also shared with relevant state governments, on a real time basis, he said.Muraleedharan also asserted that there was no delay in bringing back workers who were stuck in various countries in the Gulf region. He said priority has been given to countries in the Gulf region for scheduling flights to bring back the stranded workers under the Vande Bharat Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-616-indians-abroad-infected-with-coronavirus-mea/story-6lJbazRTV1sKCnyUi1dkiJ.html
17-09-2020||India||3 militants, woman killed in encounter in Srinagar’s Batamaloo||Three militants and a woman were killed in an encounter in Batamaloo area of Srinagar on Thursday morning. A CRPF deputy commandant and another jawan were also injured in the encounter which was the seventh operation in the Srinagar city this year.Police and the CRPF launched an operation in the Firdousabad locality of Batamaloo early in the morning after they received a specific input about the presence of militants in a house, the police said. According to the police, militants opened fire on the search party which led to injuries to two CRPF personnel, including deputy commandant, who have been referred to the 92 Base Hospital. Three local terrorists were killed in the operation; they had joined militant ranks recently. Stone-pelting also broke out during the encounter and additional forces personnel were deployed in the area.Director-General of Police Dilbag Singh said that three militants were neutralized in the operation. ‘’Unfortunately, a woman also died in the cross-firing. We regret her killing.’’ The woman has been identified as Kounsar Jan of Batamaloo. The lady was hit in a lane as she was out to fetch bakery at the early hours.Also read: 23-year-old man detained by Sopore police found dead, magisterial probe orderedCRPF spokesman said that at about 0315 hours, the party zeroed in on the target house and upon finding the gate closed, a CRPF personnel, under command of Dy Commandant Rahul Mathur, scaled the wall and made an entry into the house from the rear.“As officer and his buddy started tactically searching the rooms of the house, one of the terrorists, who was hiding inside, suddenly opened fire on the party and officer received gunshot wound on his upper chest and abdomen. The injured officer retaliated the fire and gunned down the terrorist on the spot. The injured officer was evacuated to 92 Base Hospital of Army where he is in a critical condition.”The DGP said the militants killed in the operation were locals from south Kashmir, arms and ammunition were also recovered from them.He said the militants from other districts of South and north Kashmir keep attacking the security forces. “On August 14, they targeted our party and killed two policemen at Nowgam. Before that, they had killed two BSF men at Pandach on city outskirts. And then they made another attempt at Pantha Chowk where we lost a brave SoG man,”The DGP said that since the woman killed in the encounter had no links with militancy her body will be handed over to her family. He said in seven operations in Srinagar city this year 16 militants were killed. ‘’Five of them were residents of Srinagar.’’ He, however, termed the operation in which Hizbul Commander Junaid Sehrai was killed, the biggest success of this year.DGP Singh said that so far this year, the forces have conducted 72 operations in J&K. “This year has been successful for us compared to last year. We have killed 177 terrorists, 12 in Jammu and 165 in Kashmir. 22 terrorists from Pakistan were among those killed which shows the direct involvement of Pakistan.’’He said that there are large numbers of Pakistanis in the ranks of Jaish and Lashkar militant outfits. DGP Singh said that even if any militant wants to surrender during an exchange of fire they give him a chance and opportunity to do that. ‘’ There are many such examples when militants who wanted to surrender were given a chance.’’Singh said that many boys, after joining militancy, have returned in south Kashmir. ‘’Due to security reasons, we don’t mention about those cases, there are 20 such youths who have returned after joining the militant ranks.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-militants-woman-killed-in-encounter-in-srinagar-s-batamaloo/story-EPIhHxCrxPTF8W6qbrXI0H.html

17-09-2020||India||Vaccine-maker Moderna releases Covid-19 trial plan||Moderna Inc. released details of its plan for analyzing data from its Covid-19 vaccine trial, offering an unusual under-the-hood look at the study of a top vaccine candidate.In a statement ahead of an investor meeting the company is holding on Thursday, Moderna said the trial has now enrolled 25,296 of an expected 30,000 volunteers, and more than 10,000 have received two doses of the vaccine.While the broad outlines of major drug trials are available on a U.S. government website, details of how and when data-monitoring boards overseeing the trials plan to analyze data are often kept confidential by pharmaceutical companies.However, the unprecedented push to get a vaccine to market quickly has increased interest in those details. The analysis of findings and what the rules are for stopping a trial if there are encouraging early signals could determine how quickly a shot receives emergency authorization from U.S. regulators.The shares gained 2% to $70.20 in pre-market trading in New York. They’ve more than tripled since the beginning of the year.Moderna decided to release its full trial plan to create public confidence that it is doing everything it can to ensure a vaccine is safe and effective, said Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel.“We have been working nine months to try to stop this virus by getting a vaccine to market,” Bancel said in an interview. “We want to make sure the general public has trust in vaccines by being transparent.”Under the Moderna plan, a data monitoring board will take a preliminary look at the efficacy results after 53 participants have contracted the coronavirus, and again after 106 cases are reached. The final analysis will occur after 151 cases, according to slides from the investor meeting.Moderna’s plan is more conservative than the 32-case benchmark being used by Pfizer Inc. for its first preliminary analysis of its Covid-19 vaccine. Pfizer has said conclusive efficacy results are likely by the end of October.According to a slide being presented at the meeting, Moderna’s trial is only likely to generate clear positive results at the first analysis if it turns out to be very highly effective, reducing Covid-19 cases by 74% or more.If the vaccine turns out to be a more modest 60% effective, the trial might have to proceed to the final efficacy readout in order to generate clear results, according to the 135-page trial protocol.November DataIn the interview, Bancel said the most likely scenario was that Moderna’s vaccine could generate preliminary efficacy data in November. It is “technically possible” for Moderna to get results in October, but this is unlikely, he said.Bancel said “it is extremely unlikely” everyone in the country could get vaccinated by the end of the first quarter of 2021, as a Trump administration official suggested on Wednesday. All three of the most likely initial vaccines are based on newer technologies, which means that the companies have had to create new manufacturing capacity, he said.There will likely only be enough vaccines approved for every American who wants a shot by the second half of next year, according to Bancel.Unlike an AstraZeneca Plc trial that has been put on hold twice to investigate possible neurological adverse events, Moderna’s trial hasn’t had any pauses to probe potential safety problems, Bancel said.The AstraZeneca vaccine trial in the U.K. resumed after a safety review was completed, while another AstraZeneca trial in the U.S. remains on hold. Documents sent to participants in the U.K. say the symptoms probably weren’t related to the AstraZeneca shot.In an email, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman said it had “no update as of right now” on its U.S. trial design beyond details already available in the U.S. database, clinicaltrials.gov.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-maker-moderna-releases-covid-19-trial-plan/story-24s1oOUllfpMULEapmPCGK.html

I was kept separately from my brother. During custody, I was not feeling well. I told the policemen that there are CCTV cameras in our house and they can take the footage of the last month to see that nobody came to the house.” Also read: Why is Sikh soldier a bogeyman for Chinese army at LadakhDirector-General of Police Dilbag Singh said that probe has been ordered to know the facts. “Till then, we should not draw any conclusions.”Police spokesman said. “On Tuesday, at about 12:45 pm, an OGW (Over-Ground Worker) identified as Irfan Ahmad Dar of Sidiq colony, Sopore, was apprehended and two Chinese hand grenades were recovered from his possession.

17-09-2020||India||India-China flare-up could hurt post-Covid recovery efforts across the region: Singapore high commissioner||Singapore’s new high commissioner Simon Wong Wie Kuen has said it is imperative for India and China to find an amicable solution to their border standoff as the region is looking at the two countries to drive post-Covid-19 economy recovery efforts. In his first interview to the Indian media after presenting his credentials last week, Wong spoke on Singapore’s priorities in its economic relations with India, participation in New Delhi’s plans to forge resilient supply and value chains, and collaboration in the Indo-Pacific. Edited excerpts:As you begin your term in India, what items are at the top of your agenda, and what are your priorities for driving the relationship with India? We are caught in a very unusual situation. When I was assigned to India, the world was normal, there was no Covid-19, the world was at a stage where the US and China were still on fairly good terms. But all this changed very quickly in the beginning of this year. We have Covid-19, we have a very acrimonious US-China relationship. Coming to India during this time is challenging for us because the world order is probably at the inflection point, and big countries and small countries like us have to figure out where we want to land, how we are going to avoid when two big powers are at loggerheads. Coming to India is refreshing in a way, to see how India grapples with all these changes, plus you now have a border conflict with the Chinese. On the part of Singapore, how do I, in this larger context, navigate this relationship? First of all, the Singapore-India relationship is very frictionless, we don’t have a lot of baggage, we are very close friends and partners although India is a much larger country than Singapore. Indian leadership, people and businesses have seen us a very trusted partner and we too are an all-weather partner with India. Also Read: In coronavirus vaccine race, China inoculates thousands before trials are completedEven during Covid-19, investments are still coming in although not in numbers that we want. In the first eight months of the year, we have committed around $2 billion of new investments into India. CII [Confederation of Indian Industry] led a virtual delegation with six Singapore cabinet ministers on how to move commercial and business relations forward. In this gloomy situation, I dare say the Singapore-India relationship is in a bright area. I feel that despite all the difficulties, I am going to have a fruitful tenure in India because there are so many things for us to do. Will Singapore join India’s plans to create new and more resilient supply and value chains? For sure. Our first real big investments came into India in 1993, when India began to open up. Because we came in early to India, that conversation of plugging India into our part of the world is continuing non-stop. For the past 27 years, the investments across both countries are very big. Cumulatively, Singapore has $85 billion committed to India. On your side, you have close to $60 billion. It is an equal partnership and we have about 650 Singapore companies set up in India and about 8,500 Indian companies are set up in Singapore. That notion of supply chain security and supply chain rework is always in play. In Singapore’s belief, we feel this is perhaps the age of Asia, but we feel that in Asia, we shouldn’t have just one engine of growth, there should be several engines of growth. Singapore, being a small country, wants to partake in the push of all these engines going to the next level. We came in early to India, we want to partake in this exercise of growth in the Indian economy. What are Singapore’s plans for cooperating with India on Covid-19? What is the current status of Indian workers in Singapore? The pharmaceuticals sector is a high-value add sector in which India commands a niche, not only in manufacturing of vaccines and generic medicines but in research and development. Covid-19 suddenly pushed at least three or four Indian R&D companies into the limelight. Because of that, Singapore is very interested in collaboration, not just on the Covid-19 vaccine but perhaps on coronavirus vaccines, the more generic ones, and I think that’s a growth area. Both sides are in conversations already. Also Read: India’s economy likely to tank 9% due to Covid-19 distress: S&PWe feel that—as an immigrant society ourselves—we are very small and need foreign workers to help boost our economy. Foreign workers is a nebulous term, it could be people working in the shipyard, in construction business, in banks and IT industries. We feel we are indebted to foreign workers because they helped grow our economy. It is incumbent on us to take care of them. In Singapore, we had an outburst of virus infections in our [workers’] dormitories. The first thing that we did was isolation, it was rather harsh, to have everybody medically taken care of. It is free medical facilities and free testing and at the same time, we have given grants to companies so that salaries are paid even though the workers do not go to work. Now that we have flattened the curve two times in a row…workers are allowed to go back to work and then the grants will cease. We feel it is an obligation on the part of the government to help provide a safety net for our foreign workers. Having said that, the next point we worry about is because of Covid-19, many of the industries, businesses and shops that hire these foreign workers are challenged, they have closed down. Many of our food and beverage businesses and businesses related to hotels and travels, 40% of them will go under. As a result of that, foreign workers may be sent home because they are out of a job. The next step is for us to make sure that they are fairly compensated and if they intend to stay on, we will have to look for jobs for them. But at the end of the day, we see no difference between citizens and foreign workers. It has caused some unhappiness among the citizens, especially during these challenging times. As the region looks to post-Covid-19 recovery efforts, how do you view the India-China border standoff? Does Singapore have concerns about the situation? If I look at the situation at this moment in time, you have a stalemate and a stare-down situation...It may be a long winter, it will not have an easy solution but I think the messages coming out from both sides are very calm and the operating principle is still trying to figure out something of a resolution through diplomatic means. As a diplomat, my first instinct is that even if you disagree 100% between each other, you still need to sit down and talk because the talking process will calm things. We are good friends of both India and China. The last thing we want is to have skirmishes grow bigger and bigger because now both sides are in a stare-down position and the troop levels of both sides are very high. We don’t want any untoward incidents happening because from the Covid-19 recovery point of view, if we have two big economic engines suffer as a result, the whole Asian economy will suffer for a prolonged period of time. We don’t want to see that happen, we have been urging both sides to stay calm and find an amicable solution to it. Also Read: Vaccine by next year, but will take time to reach all: Harsh VardhanBut we are concerned about what’s happening in Ladakh in particular, in Pangong Tso. We hope calmer heads prevail. China’s border issues with other countries have sometimes taken decades to settle. In India, there are memories of the 1962 war. Even if the current tensions dissipate, do you think the border issue will linger on? I think it is always problematic [in] relations between neighbours, especially two humongous neighbours, to resolve [things] and from time to time, it will spike. Whether or not it will have long-term effects, it depends on how both sides resolve this problematic issue. If you were to have harsh negotiations and you cross with words, I think it’s easier because it’s common practice, even in FTA negotiations—harsh, tough negotiation postures, but thereafter, when the deal is done, you shake hands and that’s it. But the memory of 1962 is very, very strong because it was a military conflict. That will fundamentally, I think, change the perception of the relationship and the scars will be so much deeper. My humble advice is that both sides should think very carefully how they want to move forward and to be sure, both sides understand this very clearly...in the operating principle, both sides should sit down and talk and resolve this diplomatically. I think the Chinese side also wants this, the key now is what is going to happen in winter. I hope the lowering of the temperature will have cool heads prevail. How does Singapore perceive the increased activity with relation to the Indo-Pacific such as the trilateral meeting of India-France-Australia? If you read the story of the day, it is always with China in mind. You have had many papers and discussion points on the Indo-Pacific. You have the US version, the Indian version, the Asean version, which is largely an Indonesian suggestion, you have the Japanese version and, to some extent, the Australian version. All of these proposals on the table have different shades of colouring. Singapore, because we are part of Asean, we endorse the Asean version of it, which is to say we keep the waters around our region peaceful, the organisation should be inclusive and not exclusive, it should not be targeted at one or two particular countries, and the focus should be on economics, and less military. Also Read: No one can stop Army from patrolling: Rajnath to Rajya Sabha on China rowI think there’s going to be a competition of ideas. How the Indian version comes in—we take the 2018 speech [by Prime Minister Nrendra Modi] at the Shangrila Dialogue, because he set up the parameters of how India envisaged itself in the Indo-Pacific and I think a majority of elements of it are very similar to the Asian version. But in the actualisation of this idea, the Indian preference is to have Quad, Quad-plus or trilaterals. India is free to have conversations with like-minded parties which share same interests...I feel that down the road, India should also have a conversation with Asean on the configuration of your ideas and the Asean ideas. The more you talk to different interested parties, the more you understand where they’re coming from. It really depends on the shading. Now you have a border issue with China, so the shading tends to be more towards the anti-China side of the house but in politics, never say never. In the case of India, you are good friends with the US and Russia...I don’t think India will be so hot-tempered to say ‘I am going to cut off this relationship’...because the relationship is larger than that. I think we should also watch how Russia is positioning itself as a kind of informal mediator and informal channel for India and China to come to some kind of resolution. Do you think the India-China tensions will make it even more difficult for the Indian government to sell a concept such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to the people? I feel my Indian friends share their emotions very publicly, they are very binary. And they’re very vocal about it. In the situation with China, you can look at social media, newspapers, TV talk shows and the youth—they’re very vocal in opposition. You need this to pass and hopefully by winter, I pray it’s a very cold winter so you have fix or six months of freezing, then the rational mind comes back. RCEP is a hard sell, you have a minority of reformists in India who see the benefit of it. I see industrialists who are exporters, who are very pro-RCEP but in general the idea of a community of FTAs does not penetrate that deeply into Indian consciousness because India is so big…It’s going to be an emotional issue. Coming from a country like Singapore that survives on trade and sealing deals in FTAs, we kind of don’t understand why some other countries do not embrace FTAs but we understand where India is coming from. I can say with 100% assurance that the CECA between India and Singapore is mutually beneficial. Since the signing in 2005 and till now, India has had a [trade] surplus and never once did Singapore complain...the reason is because we see in a long-term relationship there will be times [when] I may have a surplus with you, you may have a surplus with me. I don’t even mind prolonged surpluses…It’s just that Indian products are so well made, we buy them. It’s the question of your ability to sell, if you have good products, people will buy them and the importing country will suffer a deficit. But we look long-term not only at trade imbalances, we look at mutual investments. Because we have such good trade relations, it enables businesspeople from both sides to look at our market and therefore, have more investments coming in...this is not an asymmetric relationship, we are thankful that India sees us as an equal from the eyes of trade and commerce. I think RCEP members are all in sync on welcoming India when India is ready to come back in. I think that’s key.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-is-very-interested-in-collaborating-with-india-on-coronavirus-vaccines/story-oDbo4UI0ompwKQdMlqkN9O.html

The twin announcements were followed by tweets by top BJP and government leaders to express their grief at the news.The first indication that there was something amiss came from Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu.Naidu spoke to the Karnataka government and the hospital and said that the newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP remains in critical condition.The hospital’s health bulletin came soon after.The BJP leader had taken oath as a Rajya Sabha MP on July 22 this year.Ashok Gasti was admitted to the hospital on September 2 and is reported to have been suffering from breathing problems for the last few days.Gasti, a lawyer, is credited with the expansion of the BJP in Raichur district of Karnataka.

Following distancing norms was the most important social vaccine against Covid-19 at the moment, he added.Vardhan was speaking at the Rajya Sabha wherein members raised various issues, including the availability and affordability of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Defending the government’s handling of Covid-19, Vardhan said that even before they found the first case in India, they had initiated steps to counter the pandemic.Also Read: No one can stop Army from patrolling: Rajnath to Rajya Sabha on China rowOn January 8, the matter was discussed with expert groups and on January 17, efforts were initiated towards detailed health preparedness and advisories were issued, he said. The first case was reported on January 20—a medical student who came from China. For that first case, 162 contacts were traced, he said. Vardhan also said the country had come a long way from the point when people on TV channels said there was a shortage of PPE kits, testing kits and masks; there were hundreds of labs across the country now, and no discrimination against any state.He added that when the pandemic broke out, even “advanced countries like United States of America were trying to learn about it”. Migrant labour faced difficulties, but the government tried to provide all facilities—64 lakh migrant labour were provided train and buses, he said.Also Read: Brief leaders on additional points of India-China conflict: Naidu to RajnathVardhan said clinical trials were being held for the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine and there were vaccine candidates that had reached phases I, II and III.“We hope that by the beginning of the next year we will get a vaccine. We are also coordinating with World Health Organization (WHO) and other bodies. We are among the few countries that have managed to isolate the virus. There are around 40,000 samples that are being studied,” he said.He, however, added that even after the vaccine is ready, it will not be immediately available to everyone.“We have to break the chain of transmission. The mask is our greatest protector. After the lockdown was eased, people felt the virus had been controlled. But we need to follow hygiene protocols, continue distancing and wear masks. The transmission is taking place because of our carelessness. We should consider wearing a mask and maintaining a two-yard distance from other people as the best social vaccine,” Vardhan said. Vardhan also said that compared to India, the number of cases as well as deaths in US and Brazil was much higher. He said even India’s recovery rate had risen. Only America carried out more tests than us, he said.He said the mortality rate at 1.64% is the lowest in the world and the government is targeting bringing it down to less than 1%. He said though the number of cases may have crossed 50 million, the number of active cases was less than 20%.Earlier, several opposition party leaders had raised questions on the government’s handling of the situation.Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the government had wasted “golden months in the fight to stop the spread of Covid-19”. He said the Congress party and its leaders were the among the first to apprise everyone about the tough challenge that was coming, he said.Azad, a former Union health minister, gave several suggestions, including setting up dedicated infectious disease hospitals rather than Covid-19 hospitals to avoid stigma. “We should start using the term physical distancing instead of social distancing,” he said.He also said that vaccines should be made available at affordable prices.“We must be ready for last-mile delivery. Advanced preparations should be made, unlike the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-by-next-year-but-will-take-time-to-reach-all-harsh-vardhan/story-4fzhvpDihioJ7y9fNtFhII.html

According to schedule issued by state election commissioner Manoj Kumar, booth-level officers (BLO) will visit each house to check voter list, from October 1.However, around 90% village heads and members of block development councils (BDC) and district panchayats from all districts in Agra zone might be debarred from contesting the elections. This is because new guidelines are being prepared for these polls, which were originally likely to be conducted in November-December but were deferred due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The panchayat elections are now likely to take place in April-May 2021.According to new guidelines, those villages heads and members of BDC and district panchayats, who fail to give details of expenditure from previous panchayat polls, would be debarred from contesting the upcoming polls. This also includes those who contested the elections but lost.According to Yogendra Kumar, ADM Finance and Revenue, around 90% candidates are yet to file these details.Also, there is a possibility of over 550 village head posts being cut. This is because 587 panchayats have been completely merged with urban areas, 680 have been merged partially. Of the 680 panchayats, wards of those with population below 1,000, might be merged in another panchayat.This has led to scrapping of 587 village head posts thus far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-panchayat-polls-2020-here-s-why-90-candidates-might-get-debarred/story-SKgq68Dtky2phsy8sdX5EL.html

If you agree, you may like to invite some leaders to your office to share additional information on the issue. Some officials can also come,” said Naidu after Singh read out his statement in Rajya Sabha on the issue. “They [political leaders] are all our own people. Everybody is interested in the country’s safety and security and they should also know the actual position.”Also Read: No one can stop our Army from patrolling: Rajnath to Rajya Sabha on China rowNaidu also lashed out at what he described as propaganda to show India is divided over the conflict. “As the chairman, I want to explain India’s culture is always of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam [the world is a family]. We have never attacked any country. This is a very sensitive issue. Our soldiers are at the frontier. Raksha Mantri [defence minister] has explained at length the situation. But there is propaganda running in international magazines that India is divided; it has major differences and all those useless comments.”Opposition parties have criticised the government for shying away from a discussion on the issue in Parliament. The defence ministry may brief floor leaders of different parties on efforts to normalise the situation along the border with China and reply to queries they may have on the subject.Also Read: India rejects Pak’s obsession with territorial aggrandisement supported by cross border terrorism: MEA“A senior minister called me to say that the government may think of a briefing for floor leaders of different parties on the India-China situation if they agree.

Though, the next of kin of police personnel, gram rakhis and forest guards were getting an insurance amount of Rs 10 lakh since early 2000, it had been stopped in 2017 after the state government stopped paying premium to insurance companies as the casualties of security forces declined considerably.However, next of kin of slain policemen were getting the non-insurance ex-gratia of Rs 10-20 lakh depending on their rank. While the families of slain gram rakhis were getting Rs 10 lakh, those of sub-inspector got Rs 16 lakh.The new ex-gratia announced by the state government would benefit the families of at least four policemen including the two from the special operations group, killed by the Maoists during an encounter on Kalahandi-Kandhamal border last week. It would also ensure that the polling personnel, who lost their lives to Maoist violence during last year’s Lok Sabha polls would get an ex-gratia amount of Rs 10 lakh.Also Read: Odisha CM urges top cop to be strict on Covid rulesHome department officials said the provision of Rs 10 lakh as insurance money was started as casualties among policemen in Maoist-affected areas increased after 2008. Between 2008 and 2020, Odisha police have lost 139 security personnel in the fight against the Maoists. The highest casualties came between 2008 and 2010 when 94 policemen were killed in the Maoist-affected districts of Malkangiri, Koraput and Rayagada. However, the state government stopped paying an annual premium of Rs 5 crore to insurance companies after 2017 as the casualties among policemen went down considerably--only 15 deaths reported among security forces since then.Also Read: Odisha to amend GST Act to make fraud in input tax credit non-bailableOdisha recently recommended that five districts in the state be dropped from the list of 15 Maoist-affected districts.

17-09-2020||India||No one can stop Army from patrolling: Rajnath to Rajya Sabha on China row||No power in the world can stop Indian forces from patrolling areas where they have traditionally done so, defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, adding that China has amassed troops on the border for which the Army had made appropriate counter-deployments.In a detailed statement on the situation in the Upper House, Singh said the recent action of the Chinese forces of amassing a large number of troops reflects a disregard for bilateral pacts, adding that the Indian forces were capable of dealing with any challenge. He, however, underlined that the differences can best be dealt with peacefully.Also read: Spike in severe cyclones, extremely heavy rain over India, Earth sciences ministry tells RSResponding to concerns expressed by members on the Chinese side obstructing Indian patrols, Singh said no change in the patrolling pattern would be allowed.“On patrolling pattern, I want to make clear that that is the reason behind the face-off. The patrolling pattern is traditional and well defined. No power in the world can stop our jawans from patrolling. If our soldiers have made sacrifices, this is the very reason for doing so. And there will be no changes in the patrolling pattern,” Singh said.Earlier, several members, including former defence minister A K Antony, had expressed concerns about Indian patrol not being allowed up to traditional points. Many members also said there should be restoration of status quo ante.In a detailed statement in the House, Singh underlined that while India was committed to peace, it was also firm on protecting its boundaries. The defence minister said it had been conveyed to the Chinese side that the situation at the boundary will also have an implication on other areas.Singh told the Upper House that the India-China boundary issue is unresolved. China believes the boundary issue is still unsettled, he said adding that it also does not recognize the customary line.Both countries discussed this in the 50s and the 60s but there was no solution. China has occupied 38,000 sq km of Indian land, Singh said.He said during discussions, China has also accepted that a peaceful solution is needed. But till now, there is no commonly delineated Line of actual control on India-China border areas, he added.“India believes bilateral relations and boundary question can be discussed. But the situation on LAC will definitely have an impact on the bilateral issues,” Singh said, adding that there is often a perception overlap in many places.Singh said that this year, from April, China increased the number and weaponry on the border. “Our army took necessary measuress. We have made clear that unilateral status quo is not accepted under any circumstances,” Singh said.He added that China had initiated a very violent face-off in Galwan. “Our soldiers responded and also inflicted losses on the transgressing side,” Singh said.The defence minister said it was made to clear that LAC must be respected by both sides and there should be no unilateral attempt to alter the status quo.“It is clear from Chinese actions that there is difference between what is being said and being done,” Singh added. He said it was clear from the actions at the south bank of the Pangong lake but the Indian Army had dealt with the attempts effectively. Chinese actions reflect a “disregard” for bilateral pacts, he added.These pacts have detailed norms to deal with face-offs. The violent conduct of Chinese forces is a violation of all norms, Singh said. “The Chinese side has accumulated a large number of troops and ammunition.Our forces have also done appropriate counter-deployments. The House should be assured that our forces are capable of dealing with this challenge. Amid Covid-19, there has been a fast deployment of our forces. That is also because the government has focused on development of border infrastructure,” the defence minister said.In the interest of the country, whatever tough steps need to be taken, will be taken, the defence minister said. Singh said the aggressive demeanour and amassing of troops on the border are issues which he had raised with his Chinese counterpart in Moscow.“It is true we are passing through a challenging phase in Ladakh. But also rest assured that our forces are capable of dealing with it,” he said.Emphasising that India believed that it was best to deal with differences peacefully, Singh said that it is always possible for one to start a war but not easy to end it. Pointing to the nation’s resolve in defending itself, Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself gone to Ladakh to encourage the jawans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-can-stop-our-army-from-patrolling-rajnath-to-rajya-sabha-on-china-row/story-Si46xVB6dIHmM0zXRlwOUK.html
17-09-2020||India||Why is Sikh soldier a bogeyman for Chinese army at Ladakh||Not far from the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline that has emerged as a key friction point between Indian and Chinese troops, the Chushul brigade headquarters mess still houses artefacts including a gold statue of the Laughing Buddha seized by the Sikh regiments more than a century ago.The soldiers were part of an eight-nation mission to neutralise China’s Boxer Rebellion at the turn of the last century, an uprising led by young farmers and workers against foreign influence. The British Army had brought in Sikh and Punjab regiments among others.The alliance troops moved into Beijing after the Boxer fighters threatened foreigners and kept 400 foreigners holed up in Beijing’s Foreign Legation Quarter. The siege lasted 55 days before 20,000 alliance troops reached Beijing and fought their way in. Nearly 8,000 of them belonged to the British Army from India, many of them Sikh and Punjab regiments. After the victory, according to an account by one Indian sepoy, the British army indulged in looting: French and Russian troops killed civilians and raped women.Regiments decorated for lifting Boxer Rebellion siege91 Punjab Regiment24 Punjab Regiment20 Brownlow’s Punjabis51 Sikh Regiment14 Sikh Regiment7 Rajput Regiment122 Rajputana Infantry Regiment4 Gorkha Regiment88 Carnatic Infantry Regiment6 Jat Light Infantry Regiment15 Cavalry Regiment2 Lancers Regiment130 Baluch Regiment and126 Baluch RegimentThe statue of the Laughing Buddha at the army mess in Chushul was one of the items brought back by the soldiers. A gilded bronze bell dating back to the 1368-1644 Ming dynasty - one of the missing 16 - looted by a British general, was eventually returned by the Indian Army to Beijing’s Temple of Heaven in 1995.In his seminal book, India’s China War, Australian journalist Neville Maxwell said the Chinese leadership used the humiliation suffered after the revolution to build a movement to restore the country. Maxwell also believed there was a link between this mindset and the 1962 war.An Indian army commander said this historical context could be a reason why the China’s People’s Liberation Army psy-ops focuses so much on the Punjabi, or Sikh soldiers.China’s PLA has installed loudspeakers at the friction points that spew its propaganda on the standoff, accuse New Delhi of escalating tensions to divert from domestic issues and even belt out Punjabi pop numbers aimed at the Indian soldiers deployed to counter PLA.India and China have held several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic level. The last one was at the level of external affairs minister S Jaishankar who had a two-hour-long meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow that helped ease tensions between the two countries. But there is no evidence yet that a resolution is round the corner.New Delhi is not impressed by the Chinese political rhetoric that India needs to disengage first, that the genesis of the present stand-off lies in August 5, 2019 nullification of article 370 and the redrawn Indian map or that, as the Chinese envoy Sun Weidong puts it, both sides need to meet halfway to restore peace at the border.India believes that China should restore status quo ante as prevailing on April 20 this year when the PLA parked itself closer to the Line of Actual Control, setting off a series of face-offs with Indian army patrol parties at several locations along the LAC in Ladakh and elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-sikh-soldier-a-bogeyman-for-chinese-army-at-ladakh/story-4FuLsEa991pKKEuafxmKcL.html

It also incorporates Sir Creek into Pakistani territory as well as parts of the erstwhile princely state of Junagadh.“On 4 August 2020, a so-called political map of Pakistan was unveiled by its Prime Minister making absurd assertions and laying untenable claims to territories in the Indian state of Gujarat and our Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh,” Muraleedharan said.“Government has rejected Pakistan’s obsession with territorial aggrandisement supported by cross-border terrorism.

He said that Indian troops gave befitting reply to the Chinese soldiers.“No one should have doubts about our determination to protect the country’s borders,” he said.Singh also listed the various agreements and common understanding which both India and China arrived at over the years. “But after 2003, China did not show the will to honour these agreements,” the defence minister said.He also paid tribute to the 20 soldiers killed in Galwan Valley clash with the Chinese soldiers on June 15.

Reports further claimed that the anti-drugs agency had prepared a list of 25 names from the industry who would be summoned for questioning.However, later, NCB deputy director KPS Malhotra clarified no Bollywood names have been listed to be summoned.“We have not prepared any Bollywood list.

17-09-2020||India||Election Commission compensates slain CRPF jawan’s wife after 18 years||When Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Ramesh Kumar died in the line of duty during the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir elections, Rs5 lakh was the least his widow, Pramila Devi, expected as the compensation she was entitled to. Devi never imagined it would take her 18 years and repeated reminders to get the compensation.“The soldier died due a grenade being thrown at the polling station where he was working during the 2002 elections in Doda district of eastern Jammu,” said an official familiar with the matter. The Commission unanimously ordered the transfer of Rs 20 lakh into Devi’s bank account after she had an email sent to him last month about the pending payment around two decades after Kumar played a part in ensuring what has been described among fairest electoral exercises in the erstwhile state. The elections ushered in an extended spell of peace in the region, where rigged polls in the 1980s are widely believed to have triggered a protracted insurgency. Also Read: J-K govt forms committees for panchayat, block development council bypollsDevi, in her email, said that her husband had died while battling the Lashkar-e-Taiba at a polling booth in Doda during the 2002 elections. He was 31 years old and belonged to Haryana. “The compensation that the Commission provides has not been given to us,” she wrote. “I had written to you in December as well to apprise you of the situation… I request you to kindly help me get the compensation that has been due for over 18 years.” Devi was barely 28 years old when her husband died and had two sons, aged seven and two. In 2002, she made ends meet on the pension provided by the CRPF, which was Rs 5,025 back then. A resident of Bhiwani, she told Hindustan Times, that they didn’t even have a house in those days. “We didn’t know that the Election Commission gives compensation,” said Devi. “We were watching a case on TV and decided to file an RTI last year. Once the confirmation came, I wrote to the chief election commissioner,” said Devi. “They first sent us Rs 5 lakh, and five days later sent 15 lakh,” Devi said. She now receives Rs 23,000 per month as pension from the CRPF. Her younger son, Aakash, is pursuing B.Tech. In the email dated August 10, Devi wrote to Arora that Jammu & Kashmir’s chief electoral officer did not respond to her reminders for the compensation. Devi was entitled to Rs 5 lakh in 2002, but the Commission ordered the Rs 20 lakh transfer citing “extenuating circumstances” of the case. The families in such cases are currently entitled to Rs 10 lakh through cheques. The Jammu and Kashmir CEO had written to the Commission after an inquiry was sent stating that no request for ex-gratia payment had been received from the family. Arora emailed Devi on August 26, and in a rare gesture apologised for the delay and thanked her for her husband’s sacrifice once the compensation was processed. He has also written to all state election commissions to assess if any such cases were still pending with them. “Although money cannot compensate for his loss, but I would like to apologise for the delay and assure you that your husband’s sacrifice will not be forgotten,” Arora wrote in his email. The Commission has also asked the chief electoral officers to create a digital database to track the settlements of such legacy and all future claims. “A stern view has been taken of the institutional failure and lack of sensitivity, bordering on apathy, on part of the administrative machinery, which failed to respect the memory of the departed,” Arora said in the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Also Read: 3 terrorists killed, woman dies in encounter in Srinagar’s BatamalooFor the Commission, however, processing the payment is not the end of the line. The EC has ordered an inquiry to probe whether any cases similar to that of Devi are still pending. Some states have asked for more time to submit the report, which has already been filed by 11 states on September 10. Officials said only two such cases were found related to Jammu & Kashmir and were being immediately addressed. The Election Commission is working out the modalities to ensure such payments are expedited, they added. “The idea is that once a death on duty is confirmed, the ECI [Election Commission of India] will directly transfer the compensation into the bank account of the next of kin if available,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

17-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Airlines offer schemes to boost passenger confidence||In their efforts to boost passenger confidence, airlines are introducing schemes to attract a higher footfall. IndiGo recently announced two free round-trip tickets to every millionth passenger. The country’s largest airline is the only one to come up with such a scheme. The airline said that it is flying one million passengers every fortnight across over 50 destinations. It also claimed that it receives 70,000 passenger bookings across 500 locations daily.William Boulter, chief commercial officer, IndiGo, said, “We are consistently working towards strengthening consumer confidence in air travel and, as a fruit of our labour, close to 3 million passengers have already chosen IndiGo for their journey post the lockdown.”Also Read: Airlines in India seek $1.5 billion in interest-free credit lineFormer defence pilot and aviation expert Vipul Saxena said, “This scheme will only be able attract passengers up to a certain extent. Passenger load will actually increase only once airfares come down.” This is not the first time that an airline has come up with a scheme to attract passengers. GoAir, IndiGo and Vistara, in July, had allowed passengers to book seats adjacent to theirs at a discounted price so as to feel safe, which came after aviation consultancies pointed out the need to build confidence among passengers to opt for air travel. GoAir has also tied up with an application (available on mobile phones) to connect passengers to doctors who could guide them about travel during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and on health precautions to be taken during their travel. In August, SpiceJet announced a five-day sale on its one-way ticket and offered tickets at Rs 899. The airline, however, was asked to stop the sale by aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).According to sources, airlines have been struggling to fly more than 60% of their total seat capacity after domestic flight operations resumed on May 25. Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: Aircraft (Amendment) Bill passed by Rajya SabhaAccording to a survey in June by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of the world’s airlines, there is a major problem in gaining passenger confidence now. Findings of the survey revealed that 60% of respondents in March had said that they would return to air travel in a couple of months. Focusing on the need to regain passengers confidence, IATA said that more than 50% of air travellers said that they would resume air travel only after at least six months. Whereas, 95% of the respondents said that they would return to air travel in a year. Industry experts unanimously said that beside a fear of the pandemic, mandatory quarantine is another factor that is keeping travellers away. Industry expert Mohan Ranganathan’s opinion, however, differed. He said, “When airlines are struggling to fly more than half of their total seat occupancy, how does an airline think that passengers will be ready to travel only for a couple of free tickets? Also, it is only applicable to every millionth passenger, which clearly means that it’s going to be like a lottery system. No educated person will fall for such a scheme.” A former DGCA official said, “Airlines need to increase their efforts for providing smooth and safe travel rather than coming up with such schemes. Not more than a handful of people will opt to fly for free tickets during this phase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-airlines-offer-schemes-to-boost-passenger-confidence/story-yGwHYhSSWo5PaMqUGxhwdN.html

Speaking in Rajya Sabha on day four of Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session, he pointed to the number of recoveries in the state. He also remarked that even the World Health Organisation (WHO) has praised efforts of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for bringing the situation in Dharavi under control.“My mother and brother are infected with Covid-19. Many people in Maharashtra are recovering also. Today, the situation in Dharavi is under control. WHO has appreciated efforts of BMC. I want to state these facts as some members here were criticising Maharashtra government yesterday,” Raut said in the Upper House.“I want to ask the members how did so many people recover? Kya log bhabhi ji ke papad kha karke theek ho gaye? This isn’t a political fight but a fight to save the lives of people,” Raut further said.The bhabhi ji ke papad jibe was in reference to Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal ‘s endorsement of ‘Bhabhiji Papad,’ which, he had said, would help create antibodies to combat the deadly virus. However, days later, the minister himself tested positive for Covid-19.Maharashtra has been the worst-affected state in the country since the early days of the pandemic. As of Wednesday, the state’s Covid-19 tally stood at over 1.12 million, of which nearly eight lakh people have recovered.With a record spike of 97,894 in the last 24 hours, India has thus far recorded a total of over 5.1 million cases of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-political-fight-sanjay-raut-hits-back-at-rajya-sabha-mps-for-criticising-maharashtra-s-handling-of-covid-19/story-yy6TPGjznABkCON2Dsi44H.html

Durga Puja, however, is still a month away. Thousands of people performed tarpan—a ritual offering prayers to departed ancestors on Mahalaya—at the ghats along River Hooghly. The police and civic officials had made arrangements and maintained strict vigil since the early hours to ensure that people wore masks and maintain social distance while performing the tarpan. “But as the gathering was huge, it was difficult to ensure that everyone wore masks and maintained social distance,” said a senior police officer who was present at one of the ghats. Also Read: Bengal govt moves green court NGT to allow Chhath puja at Kolkata lakeMeanwhile puja organisers in Kolkata have come up with a set of guidelines on how the week-long festival that starts around October 22 could be held amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The challenge will be huge, specially after what we saw in videos of tarpan that were circulating on social media on Thursday . Most people didn’t wear masks and there was hardly any social distancing,” said a puja organsier. The state government will hold a meeting with prominent puja organisers on September 25 to finalise crowd management plans and other aspects of the festival this year. “We have already come up with an informal list of dos and don’ts for the members to follow. That needs to be finalised,” said Saswata Bau, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab. Here is what you can expect this time 1. As the economy has been hit, organisers are slashing their budgets drastically. So expect a simple puja sans the grandeur and elaborate festivities 2. The height of pandal and idol will be smaller. This will ease sanitisation of the pandal and idol at least once a day. There will be special sanitisation facilities for visitors on Saptami, Astami and Nabami when the crowds peak. 3. Interior decorations will be kept at a minimum to avoid people gathering inside pandals. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has urged pandals should be airy and open. Not more than 25 people will be allowed at one time inside a pandal. 4. Long barricades will be placed at the entry gates so that queues can be formed which in turn would help maintain social distancing. Visitors will have to wear masks and sanitise their hands. 5. There will be minimum lighting so that people don’t gather only at night to see the elaborate lighting. 6. Food stalls will be erected with a gap of at least 3-4 feet between them. No one will be allowed to sit. Only takeaways will be allowed. 7. Rules of social distancing during rituals like sandhi puja, pushpanjali and sindur khela will have to be followed. Sliced fruits will not be allowed as bhog, whole fruits may be offered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-social-distancing-takes-a-backseat-during-tarpan-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-norms-for-durga-puja/story-EDMAEnxNaVbd7J2tshrvUK.html

Five cyclones had developed over the Arabian Sea last year. The normal is one cyclone per year since 1902, the ministry said. More intense cyclones over the Arabian Sea were reported last year, according to the MoES. In 2018, out of seven cyclones, six were of severe intensity; while last year out of eight, seven were severe.“The country has witnessed intense to very intense rainfall activity leading to flood scenarios in the recent past,” the note said. It added that 554 weather stations reported extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 cm, last year.It cited that out of 4,000 weather stations, 3,056 reported very heavy rainfall.The numbers were lower in 2018 and 2017, according to the MoES note. Also read: Glacier studies in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh flag stark climate change impactIn 2017, 261 stations had recorded extremely heavy rainfall and 1,824 stations had recorded very heavy rain. “There is an increasing trend in heavy and extremely heavy rainfall cases, which I have said in the past also. But there are no conclusions to be drawn from the three-year data. This has been happening for some time now. It doesn’t mean that every year cases of heavy or extremely heavy rainfall will be higher than the previous year,” said Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general India Meteorological Department (IMD).In reply to a question on several low-magnitude earthquakes in recent months, the MoES stated that 413 tremors have been recorded by the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) between March 1 and September 8. Out of 413 tremors, 11 were between 5 and 5.7 magnitude on the Richter scale, while 135 were of less than 3.The ministry has said there are no plans for establishing more number of Cyclone Warning Centres as the requirements of the entire coastal belt of the country is covered.“IMD has demonstrated its capability to provide early warning for cyclones with high precision and has earned accolades globally and nationally for very effective, state of art early warning system for monitoring and prediction of cyclones. The cyclone forecast accuracy has significantly improved in recent years as has been demonstrated during cyclones Phailin (2013), Hudhud (2014), Vardah (2016), Titli (2018), Fani and Bulbul (2019) and Amphan & Nisarga (2020). Due to this, in recent years, the loss of life has been drastically reduced, being limited to double digit figures only,” it has said.According to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region”, a report of the MoES released earlier this year, from 1950 onwards there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme heavy rainfall events over central India along with a decreasing trend in the moderate rain events.A study published in Nature journal in 2017 by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has concluded that three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India between 1950 and 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-severe-cyclones-extremely-heavy-rain-over-india-earth-sciences-ministry-to-rs/story-aAdGLkSOzspcR0KtClUlHP.html

Not just ICMR, other government departments such as Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), etc. have also been instrumental in scaling up the testing infrastructure, and that too at such a short span of time,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity. On average, India has been conducting one million tests daily to diagnose Covid-19 for the past three weeks, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests.

17-09-2020||India||Doctor is only a click away in Varanasi’s digital village||A doctor is just a click away for residents of Varanasi’s Gaura, the district’s first digital village with around 2,500 residents, thanks to the tele-consultation facility at its digital centre, allowing people to seek relief from non-emergency ailments without having to leave the confines of their hamlet.Take the case of Mala Devi Maurya, a Gaura homemaker in her early 50s, who battled anxiety from January to June. Relief came in July when she took expert advice via tele-consultation at the digital centre in the village after being prompted to do so by Sanjay Maurya, the digital village centre head.Helping Mala overcome her initial hesitation, Sanjay Maurya logged on to the digital village website https://www.digital-village.in/digital-health-services and selected an online physician for consultation.Mala told the doctor, “I suffered from anxiety and nervousness in January. I visited a doctor at a town nearby. The doctor prescribed medicines and advised me to rest. I took medicines for five days and got relief. But the anxiety and nervousness returned a few days later.”On the doctor’s instructions, Maurya measured Mala’s blood pressure and pulse rate. Thereafter, the doctor prescribed some medicines and she has felt much better ever since she started taking them regularly.“I was relieved. For the last two months, I have been fine. I got advice near my doorstep,” said Mala, confirming the gain.Tele-consultation is a boon for the locals because they get advice from experts at their village itself. The prescription slip reaches the digital account of the centre and a printout is given to the patient. Tele-consultation is a form of primary care, where the patient seeks the doctor’s advice at a digital village centre about non-emergency medical problems, which don’t require the doctor’s immediate visit to the location. It doesn’t replace face-to-face consultation when it is needed, but complements it.“In the last two months, around 40 people took advice from doctors through tele-consultation under the digital health service, which is part of the digital village programme,” Sanjay Maurya said.He added that the tele-consultation facility also provisioned for advice from experts in Ayurveda and homeopathy apart from allopathy. The centre also provides free medicines to patients and if a prescribed medicine is not available, then the patient is asked to purchase from a medical store.Also Read: UP to organise ‘one district one product’ international exhibitionSunita Maurya, another homemaker, had back aches for the last two years. She consulted a doctor through a digital centre around a month ago. At present, she is under-treatment.Sanjay Maurya said he told all 593 families in the village about tele-consultation and other facilities available at the digital centre, also known as CSC (common service centre).“If any patient cannot come to the digital centre, I, along with a multi-test portable machine, reach his/her house and connect them to a physician online. I note down the prescription given by the doctor and hand over the slip to the patient,” he explained.Also Read: Uttar Pradesh may fund religious travel of 1.5 crore labourers from stateLocals and people from adjoining villages also visit the centre to get Aadhaar cards made. Now, they don’t have to go to Varanasi or other towns for these works. Sanjay Maurya said the digital centre was a one-stop service solution for residents of the digital village and adjoining villages. It provides them with telemedicine, internet connectivity and other services. The centre also acts as a platform for imparting skill development training to the local youths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-is-only-a-click-away-in-varanasi-s-digital-village/story-ybkaEcdqMlrckPrBh7a9dO.html

The defence minister made a statement in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, where he said that tension at the border was bound to negatively affect bilateral relations between India and China.China had engaged in aggressive behaviour and sought to unilaterally change the status quo at the border, he told the lower house.“The amassing of the troops by China goes against our 1993 and 1996 agreements. Respecting and strictly observing the Line of Actual Control is the basis for peace and tranquillity in the border areas and explicitly recognised in both agreements. While our armed forces abide scrupulously by it, this has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side... In the recent incidents, this year, the violent conduct of Chinese forces has been in complete violation of all mutually agreed norms,” Singh said in Lok Sabha.“The House should have full confidence that our armed forces will always rise to the challenge and do us all proud,” he added.While he accused the Chinese of not honouring the existing border agreements and pacts between the two countries, China claimed on Wednesday that it was committed to maintaining peace. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the country has been honouring the agreements signed between China and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-to-answer-opposition-s-questions-on-china-in-parliament-today/story-OONraBROHrN5ni8Y5M8u3H.html

The deceased have been identified as Dinesh (35), Madhusudan Dhakar (22), Lotanti (25), Golma (15), Siyaram (55), Jyoti (13), Prembai (45), Urmila (30), Mansharam (30), Umabai (28) and Radhika (8). “Police have lodged an FIR under section 304A of the IPC against the boat owner,” Rathore said. Locals present on the riverbank began the rescue operation before government help reached the spot, said Kota superintendent of police Sharad Chaudhary. State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF) commandant Amrita Duhan said that a team of 42 personnel with three boats and diving equipment began the rescue operations. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressed grief over the accident. “I express condolences for the aggrieved families of deceased,” he said in a tweet. The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased from the CM Relief Fund. According to people present at the site of the incident, the boat also had some motorcycles on board. “There was panic and everyone moved to one side of the boat when a kid shouted that water was entering the boat. This led to imbalance,” said 62-year-old Ramprasad Dhakar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-feared-dead-as-boat-ferrying-over-40-capsizes-in-rajasthan-s-kota/story-4lmRpYjV4j8Xvicwx5OqVL.html

With the arrests, the CM said, the case of the attack and murder had been solved. Singh ordered the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the killings.Raina’s uncle, Ashok Kumar, a contractor, was killed while his son, Kaushal Kumar, succumbed to injuries on August 31 after the robbers attacked them. His aunt, Asha Rani, is battling for life at a hospital in critical condition while two others injured in the attack have recovered.Punjab police chief Dinkar Gupta said over 100 suspects were questioned before the three were arrested from a slum near the Pathankot Railway Station on Tuesday. He said rings, a gold chain, and ₹1,530 were recovered from the accused Sawan, Muhobbat, and Shahrukh Khan.The initial probe has revealed that the three are members of a gang involved in robberies in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab.Sawan, who is from Uttar Pradesh, has told the investigators they started on August 12 from Rajasthan’s Chirawa in an autorickshaw and bought items including a screwdriver from a hardware shop in Ludhiana before leaving for Pathankot.

17-09-2020||India||Tata emerges as lowest bidder for tender to construct new Parliament complex||Tata Projects Limited emerged as the lower of the two bidders for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex by quoting a bid of ₹861.90 crore when the financial bids for the project opened on Wednesday. Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Limited, which was the other bidder, quoted ₹865 crore for the project, according to the bid documents. According to the Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) tender, the estimated cost of construction for the new building is ₹889 crore. The two Mumbai-based construction companies submitted their financial bids after qualifying in the technical round for the tender. Tata Projects has emerged as the lowest bidder and is likely to bag the contract, a spokesperson for Tata Projects said. A spokesperson for L&T did not wish to comment. Three bidders qualified in the technical round but only two firms ended up submitting their financial bids. “Only three parties technically prequalified in the first round and only two have quoted their bids today. The firm that wins the contract will be issued a letter of award within a few days,” a senior government official said requesting anonymity.“We have to go through the due process of evaluation of the bids thoroughly and award a letter of contract only after that,” the second official said. The contract is likely to be awarded to the lowest bidder, the first official added. To be clear, in infrastructure projects, the firm is finalised only after it receives a letter of award which is a written confirmation that a tenderer has been successful and will be awarded a contract. It contains details of the amount of the award, the date of the award, and when the contract will be signed. The government had narrowed the list of choices for building a new Parliament complex to three Mumbai-based construction companies -- Larsen & Toubro Limited, Tata Projects Limited and Shapoorji Pallonji & Company Private Limited -- after disqualifying four other entities, Hindustan Times first reported on August 12. “The third firm, Shapoorji Pallonji & Company had submitted its Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) but it did not submit a financial bid today,” the second official quoted before, said. HT reached out to Shapoorji Pallonji group for a comment but could not get a response. In the technical round Mumbai-based construction and civil engineering company ITD Cementation India Limited, Hyderabad-headquartered NCC Limited, PSP Projects Limited of Ahmedabad, and Uttar Pradesh state government’s UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited were disqualified by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD).Based on an evaluation, CPWD disqualified the four companies for reasons including non-fulfilment of the criteria mentioned in the bid document.The tender laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work, such as having constructed an assembly hall with a minimum capacity of 1,000 people and a building with a basement, as well as ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth.The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship, the bid document said. The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled in stone masonry, carving, and fresco, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.Work on the new Parliament, a ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building, is expected to begin after the ongoing monsoon session, HT reported on September 15.India’s national emblem is likely to sit atop the new Parliament building, according to the latest design iteration prepared for the tendering process, replacing a spire that was there in an earlier version.The new Parliament building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tata-emerges-as-lowest-bidder-for-tender-to-construct-new-parliament-complex/story-OY2hYv5xCUd5JcEOJN0X3K.html

17-09-2020||India||SIT formed to ‘probe’ interfaith marriages in Kanpur||The Uttar Pradesh police have formed a nine-member Special Investigation Team to probe cases of interfaith marriages in Kanpur, inspector general Mohit Agarwal said. Agarwal said the SIT has been given 10 days to complete the probe after a woman’s family claimed she was a victim of “love jihad”.Radical Hindu groups have popularised the term “love jihad”, which they use to describe what they believe is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriage. In February, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy told Parliament the term “love jihad” is not defined under the laws and no such case has been reported by any central agency.The SIT probe has been ordered even as the woman recorded her statement in Delhi’s Tis Hazari court, saying she married on her own volition. The case fell flat but the Vishwa Hindu Parishad joined the family in staging a demonstration in Kidwai Nagar alleging a pattern in five interfaith marriages. As of now, the SIT has 15 such cases to look into.Agarwal said apart from tracing links between Muslims in such cases, the team would explore the conspiracy angle and look at whether the men were receiving overseas funding.Deen Dayal Gaur, a local VHP functionary, said, “They are a result of a well-hatched conspiracy to target the Hindu girls; most of them are minor as per our inputs.”The SIT is pursuing the case of a Muslim man, who allegedly adopted a Hindu identity, and allegedly abused a minor after renting a room in her house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-formed-to-probe-interfaith-marriages-in-kanpur/story-N8v7595aYJ7zdSi01zuagI.html
17-09-2020||India||May take decades to clean Ganga water, say experts||Namami Gange, the Central government’s ambitious project to clean the Ganga, seems to have delivered modest results, with the quality of river water from Rudraparayag in Uttarakhand to Uluberia in West Bengal having improved between 2014 and 2019, according to Jal Shakti ministry data, but experts say it will take decades before the water becomes fit for human consumption .The dissolved oxygen level, or the amount of oxygen available to living aquatic organisms, has improved at 27 locations and the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), the amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria while they decompose organic matter, and faecal coliform (FC) content, a measure of the suitability of water for consumption, has improved at 42 and 21 locations, respectively.The information was provided by the Jal Shakti ministry in response to a query by Kochi-based RTI applicant, K Govindan Nampoothiry. The ministry has provided the annual average of Ganga water quality on these three parameters, thereby discounting seasonal variations.After coming to power in May 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government the following month launched the Namami Ganga project with the objectives of reducing river pollution, and promoting its conservation and rejuvenation. Higher dissolved oxygen (the national standard is 5 milligrams per litre or more) shows whether water can sustain aquatic life. A lower BOD (the national standard is 3 milligrams per litre or less) shows there is less bacteria and other microorganisms in water. The faecal coliform (national standard less is than 2,500 coliform in 100 ml of water) indicates the amount of sewage in water. Jal Shakti ministry data shows that in past six years, the water quality of the river on these three parameters has improved marginally at most locations and at this pace, the authorities would take decades to make the river’s water fit for human consumption, experts said. “The progress so far has been slow. In six years, if Ganga’s water quality has improved by just 10-15%, it would take decades to clean the Ganga,” said BD Joshi, founder of the Indian Academy of Environmental Sciences, who has worked on the river for more than four decades.The Central government had initially fixed 2019 as the deadline to clean the river, but extended it to 2022 as the Namami Ganga Project (NGP) took off slowly. As of August 1, only 29% of the 154 sewage projects taken up had been completed. For the projects, the ministry has allocated ₹23,120 crore, according to government documents.A ministry official privy to the information about Namami Ganga said sewerage infrastructure projects were coming up in eight states — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Haryana, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh — through which the 2,525-km river flows. The 97 towns located on the main stem of the Ganga generate 2,953 million litres a day (MLD) of sewage. The available treatment capacity is only 1,794 MLD.The RTI reply showed the maximum improvement in Ganga water quality has taken place in the hills of Uttarakhand, primarily due to efforts made to contain the flow of human and animal sewage. Another reason for this could be that unlike in the plains, the flow of industrial waste in the hill is much less.“We have minimized flow of human sewage by building sewage treatment plants in towns and toilets for all those living close to river Ganga. Work is on for zero sewage into river Ganga in the state,” said Uttarakhand environment minister Harak Singh Rawat. The reply showed that as the river flows into the pilgrim centre of Haridwar in Uttarakhand, the water quality deteriorated and further fell in the downstream in the industrial town of Kanpur, where industrial waste still flows into the river. The water quality between Haridwar and Kanpur improved between 2014 and 2019 by 8-10%.The water quality was slightly better in Chapra and Patna because of the fresh flow of water from Ganga tributaries in Bihar such as Kosi and Gandak. But it again fell as the river entered West Bengal. The water quality in Bihar and West Bengal has improved by almost 30% between 2014 and 2019.Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said a bigger issue than improvement in water quality is the flow of the river.“If the flow of the river improves in all seasons, the water quality will improve significantly. But the reality is that the flow is decreasing and it will have huge implications for people living in the Ganga river basin even if water quality improves,” he said.Thakkar acknowledged that work has happened in building sewage and industrial affluent treatment plans. “The state pollution control boards need to ensure that plants don’t give false reports and work at their maximum capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-take-decades-to-clean-ganga-water-say-experts/story-jlafKgSUMi8h3EF6E9qQ6J.html
17-09-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh may fund religious travel of 1.5 crore labourers from state||Nearly 1.5 crore labourers, employed in about 6.5 lakh commercial establishments and 20,500 factories and workshops in Uttar Pradesh, could soon get to undertake religious trips, funded by the state government. The scheme is likely to be announced by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on November 10, the birth anniversary of Dattopant Thengadi, RSS ideologue who founded the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), a trade union organization, which acts as a pressure group to enforce pro-labour policies. UP’s labour welfare board chairman Sunil Bharala confirmed the plan and said the scheme - to be named after Swami Vivekananda would be the first of its kind - is aimed at ensuring that labourers not only get time off from their daily grind but are also able to acquaint themselves with the country’s rich cultural and religious diversity. “To my mind, there is no such scheme anywhere that allows labourers free travel and stay,” Bharala said. This is among the three schemes that the board is currently working on; the other two being a scheme to encourage children of labourers to take to sporting activities and another one that would seek to fund the cost of textbooks for the meritorious poor. “All of our schemes would be named after great personalities. For instance, the religious tourism scheme could be named after Swami Vivekananda, the textbook one after great litterateur Mahadevi Verma and the sporting one could be after former India cricketer and UP minister Chetan Chauhan, or late VHP leader Ashok Singhal or former RSS chief Rajju Bhaiya,” Bharala said. The initiative comes in the backdrop of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s recent Lucknow visit, during which he called upon the cadres to focus on migrants and labourers in urban areas, farmers in rural areas and environment. The board is also preparing a database of all labourers employed in various commercial outlets and factories. “We have set up a committee for the purpose. Once it’s done, we will have complete details of which labourer from which areas were working in which outlet or factory, their academic qualifications or inclinations, their skill sets. The information would help in identifying talent from the pool and engaging them in tasks that were more suited to their individual requirements,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-may-fund-religious-travel-of-1-5-crore-labourers-from-state/story-I2hliR4fEuKWOStL18HuzN.html

Pyare Mian had formed a fake society named E-Block Lakeview Enclave Welfare Society and committed fraud by collecting money from different people in the name of welfare, said Tarun Rathi, in-charge of the Shyamla Hills police station. “During the investigation, we found that the said society had eight members, including Raza Murad and three members of Mian’s family. We called Murad to register his statement on record. In his statement, Murad said he had no association with the society and his signature on the papers was forged. Murad also lodged a complaint with police on Wednesday against Mian for using his forged signature,” said Rathi. Talking to media persons outside the police station, Murad said, “I own a flat in Ansal plaza in Shyamla Hills area and am also a member of Lakeview Enclave Welfare Society but I didn’t know that there was a separate society of E-block. I don’t know Mian. Mian might have my photos with him because being an actor I meet with so many people without knowing them personally.” The police will register statements of other people whose names appear in the said society’s documents as members. If it is required, Mian will be booked for committing another fraud, said the police officer. Mian’s assistant Sweety Vishwakarma, 21, used to take girls from underprivileged families to Pyare Mian by luring them with housekeeping jobs in posh areas. Mian used to invite them in the parties, where he used to force the girl to consume alcohol and used to rape them, according to police. As many as six FIRs were lodged against Mian with Shahpura, Koh-e-fiza and Shyamla Hills police stations in Bhopal and Palasia police station in Indore under sections 366 (a) (procuration of minor girls), 376 (2) (n) (repeated rape), 120 b (criminal conspiracy), 420 (forgery) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 5/6 and 14 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and under relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of atrocities) Act, according to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-raza-murad-summoned-by-police-over-alleged-housing-society-fraud/story-m1Zp2OJUfp4mV8bv7xlzIJ.html
17-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How seriously does one take Dr Li-Meng Yan? And how seriously does one take the paper Unusual Features of the Sars-CoV2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of its Probable Synthetic Route, published by her and co-authors, under the aegis of the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation, New York, on September 14? As the title suggests, the paper claims the coronavirus was man-made, in a laboratory.The paper was uploaded on open-source research repository Zenodo, run by CERN, and was reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday (bit.ly/33uFyy4). It wasn’t as widely reported as Dr Yan’s comments in Loose Women, a segment of a TV show hosted by a UK TV channel, on which she pretty much said the same thing, albeit without any of the scientific arguments -- unsubstantiated ones -- presented in the paper.Here’s what that paper claimed:One, ZC45, a bat virus, or a closely related variant or mutant, bears a striking similarity with Sars-CoV2, as shown by genome sequencing, with a 94%-100% similarity of key viral proteins.The spike protein of Sars-CoV2 is essentially a trimer (essentially three parts) each of which has an S1 and S2 part with a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the two. Other research has already established that the human cellular enzyme furin cleaves, or breaks, the S1 and S2 unit at the cleavage site, and that the S1 unit then attaches to the ACE receptor, another protein found on the surface of most human cells. This binding then facilitates the entry of the viral protein into human cells. The virus’ ability to bind with the receptor, and the presence of the cleavage site that responds to a cannon human enzyme, are the reasons Covid-19 is as infective as it is.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBoth the furin cleavage site, and the binding ability of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor aren’t natural, the paper argued.In their preface to this scientific hypothesis, the authors also claim that the process of creating such a virus in a laboratory could take only six months. They ask for further research and investigation into the origin of the virus. Even if their hypothesis is subsequently proven erroneous, this is a recommendation that no can argue with — the origin of the virus needs to be investigated, not so much to assign blame (although there will be some that too), but to prepare for the next virus and the next pandemic.Dr Yan, currently in the US, where she fled to in late April, is a virologist who used to work at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health, and who has for long claimed that China knew of the virus and the fact that human-to-human transmission of the infection was happening, long before it let on. Her claims on the virus being man-made are more recent.Interestingly, a March paper in Nature titled The Proximal Origin of Sars-Cov2, authored by Kristian G Andersen of California’s Scripps Research Institute, argued, again picking on the same two distinctive features of Sars-CoV2, that the virus was natural. The viral protein showed a high “affinity” to bind with the receptor, they said, but this interaction wasn’t “ideal” or “optimal”. In plain English this meant that if anyone had set out to engineer the virus, they would have picked the “ideal” binding relation, not just another optimal one. The paper also said that there were other coronaviruses that had similar “cleavage sites” and that this wasn’t unique to Sars-CoV2.However, the two papers differ in one significant aspect. The one published in Nature said “the genetic data irrefutably show that Sars-CoV2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone”. Dr Yan’s said (again, without substantiation that) a “ genomic sequence analysis reveals that ZC45, or a closely related bat coronavirus, should be the backbone used for the creation of Sars-CoV2”.Also read| ‘Over 5,000 Indians died in West, East Asian countries amid Covid-19 pandemic’: Govt informs ParliamentDr Yan’s claims are also being seen through a political lens, with scientists in the US pointing out that the two non-profits that published the paper were linked to Steve Bannon, former Trump adviser and former executive chairman of the far-right Breitbart News, casting aspersions on the study’s findings.Clearly, only further research and investigation can shed light on the origin of the virus which has thus far infected 29,927,685 and killed 942,564 around the world. India ended Wednesday with 5,115,846 cases and 83,230 deaths.But as Vivek Wadhwa, a columnist for this paper, a top technology thinker, and distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program, said in a recent article in Foreign Policy: “If genetic engineering wasn’t behind this pandemic, it could very well unleash the next one.” That’s because, “genetic engineering — with all its potential for good and bad — has become democratised”, Wadhwa wrote.“Thanks to a technological revolution in genetic engineering, all the tools needed to create a virus have become so cheap, simple, and readily available that any rogue scientist or college-age biohacker can use them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ljd0yaGRoU81cx5ZnOIMIK.html
17-09-2020||India||Families can perform last rites of Covid-19 victims: Calcutta high court||Bodies of Covid-19 patients shall be handed over to relatives of the deceased for completion of last rites following safety precautions, ruled the Calcutta high court on Wednesday. The petitioner, Vineet Ruia, had told the court that bodies of Covid-19 patients were being “disposed of by the administration unceremoniously and in an undignified manner without showing even a resemblance of respect to the mortal remains of the dead person”. Families were not being allowed to perform last rites or see the bodies to pay their last respects, the petitioner had said. After hearing the plea, chief justice TB Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee laid down nine guidelines for the government to follow. The bodies shall be handed over to the families only if post mortem examination is not required, the judges said. They also said that the bodies have to be taken from hospitals to cremation or burial grounds without any stopover. In case there is nobody to claim a body, it should be cremated or buried with dignity at the state expense, the order said. In its order, the court said that after completion of hospital formalities, a body should be secured in a body bag, the face-end of which should be preferably transparent and the exterior of which should be sanitised to eliminate/minimise the risk of people carrying it getting infected. People handling the body should wear gloves and masks and PPE suits if possible, said the order, adding that the same rules would apply to the staff at the crematorium or burial ground. The hearse has to be sanitised too. The face-end of the body bag may be unzipped by the staff at the crematorium/burial ground “to allow the relatives to see the body for the last time,” said the order. “At that time, religious rituals, such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water, offering grains and such other last rites that do not require touching of the body should be allowed,” the judges said. Since the bodies are being handled by state government personnel following guidelines issued by the Union health ministry on March 15 and a notification by the state government on June 6, the court heard both the Centre and the state before passing the order on Wednesday. There have been nine hearings since June 5. The Centre was represented by three lawyers while the West Bengal government was represented by advocate general Kishore Dutta and three lawyers. The petitioner had also said that the state government was not properly recording deaths and was not announcing the names of deceased patients. The court observed that it was satisfied with the measures taken by the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/families-can-perform-last-rites-of-covid-19-victims-calcutta-high-court/story-6bFMMI1F9SZev9w8T6g61H.html
17-09-2020||India||‘Over 5,000 Indians died in West, East Asian countries amid Covid-19 pandemic’: Govt informs Parliament||More than 5,200 Indian nationals died in countries in West Asia and East Asia amid the Covid-19 pandemic between February and August, with the highest number of deaths recorded in Saudi Arabia, the government informed Parliament on Wednesday.In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said, “As per the information available with the ministry, during Covid-19 pandemic, from February 1 to August 15, 2020, 5,286 cases of deaths of Indian nationals were reported in the Gulf and East Asian countries.”It was not immediately clear from the reply how many of the deaths were due to Covid-19 infections. The questioner, Indian Union Muslim League’s MP K Navaskani, had sought the total number of deaths of Indian people in Gulf and East Asian countries during the pandemic.Also read: IMA publishes list of 382 doctors who died due to Covid-19The external affairs ministry facilitated the transportation of 1,807 bodies of Indian nationals from West Asian and East Asian countries, while the last rites were performed locally according to the wishes of families in some cases, Muraleedharan said.The highest number of deaths – 2,360 – were reported in Saudi Arabia, followed by the United Arab Emirates (1,441), Kuwait (694), Oman (336), Qatar (238), Bahrain (176), China (20) and Japan (14), according to figures provided by the minister.In response to another question, Muraleedharan said eight resident Indians were under quarantine in the UAE, while more than 6,000 Indians were stranded in Iran due to the pandemic.“In Iran, as per available information, there are over 6,000 Indian nationals, including about 1,100 pilgrims mainly from the Union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir and the state of Maharashtra, nearly 300 students primarily from Jammu and Kashmir, about 1,000 fishermen, including from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, and others who are on long-term stay in Iran for pursuing their livelihood and religious studies,” he said.The government made focussed efforts for the safe return of Indians stranded in Iran and as of March 16, a total of 389 Indians, including 205 pilgrims and 183 students, were repatriated in four batches on special flights of the Indian Air Force and Iranian airlines, he added.

Kapila Vatsyayan, the many splendoured titan in the field of arts, its scholarship, education and administration passed away on Wednesday of old-age complications. No one held as commanding a position in the arts in India over the last half century as Kapila Vatsyayan, who combined the highest and most unparalleled arts scholarship and institution-building experience.Born on December 25, 1928, to the Delhi-based Malik family, her mother Satyawati was a freedom fighter. It was a family comfortable with the arts at a time when few were. Her elder brother Keshav Malik, was an art critic and poet. She married renowned Hindi poet, SH Vatsyayan ‘Agyeya’, but the couple parted ways early. She was trained in kathak by Pandit Acchan Maharaj (father of Pandit Birju Maharaj), and in Manipuri by Guru Amobi Singh, who also taught her not to give aghat (hurt) to the earth. She followed this lesson religiously and lived her life lightly, sustainably, wearing handlooms and khadi at all times. She also learnt Bharatnatyam from Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai and Odissi from Surendranath Jena. Few know that she performed in the ballets (Kalidas, Kumar Sambhav and Braj Leela) at the National Dance Festival of 1954, which was one of the earliest initiatives organised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, whose Fellow she was to become in 1970 — a recognition for her lifetime contribution to the arts. She was made a Fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1995 and awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2011.An undergraduate student of Hindu College, Kapila Vatsyayan did her first Masters in English from Delhi University, her second Masters in Education from the University of Michigan, US, and her doctorate from Banaras Hindu University. She studied western ways of analysing movement by mastering the Laban notation system and was prized as a scholar both in the east and the west. In 1998, she was awarded by the Congress on Research in Dance for her Outstanding Contribution to Dance. The inside-outside view of dance that she possessed, allowed her to understand the spine of dance and many remember her explaining dance genres by the way the spine was held. Often called the grand matriarch of cultural research, she wove multiple art disciplines, authored many robustly researched, incisive and path-breaking books such as The Square and the Circle in Indian Art, Plural Cultures and Monolithic Structures, and The Natyashastra. One of the doctoral students she guided, Navina Jafa recalls how Vatsyayan could connect the dots between disciplines with such felicity. Most recently, she was leading the Asia project of the India International Centre, of which she was a lifetime trustee.She advised three prime ministers, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, on matters educational and cultural, in the foundational period of nation building. She represented India on UNESCO’s board. Well known is her role as founder of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts. Lesser known is her role in establishing the Central University of Tibetan Studies and the Sarnath Centre for Cultural Resources and Training. Even lesser known is the fact that she enjoyed cooking and even acted in a 1997 Hindi film called Swara Mandal. She leaves behind a void that appears impossible to fill.Arshiya Sethi has served as the creative head of programmes at the India Habitat Center. A well known authority on Indian performing arts, she was a recipient of the Fulbright - Nehru Post Doctoral fellowship||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kapila-vatsyayan-the-keeper-of-indian-art-culture-and-education/story-Zx74FVqwzCfO9EqzfmqijO.html
17-09-2020||India||Army digs in for a long winter at LAC||Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has decided to close the Srinagar-Zojila-Kargil-Leh axis for only 45 days this year because of snow, from an average of 95 days in the past and also strengthen all bridges on the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road to bear the load of tanks and truck-trailers by next month -- both aimed at keeping a key supply route open as the Indian Army prepares for a long winter in eastern Ladakh, potentially face-to-face with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China. Hindustan Times has learnt from top government authorities that BRO, which functions under the defence ministry, will keep the new Darcha-Padam-Nimu-Leh road clear of snow throughout December and January so that the military supply route is operational round-the-clock. The Narendra Modi government is now considering a shorter tunnel at Shinku La on Darcha-Padam axis so that the road can be snow-free round the year. Given that China is showing no signs of abiding by the July 5 agreement between the Special Representatives on boundary issues and the September 10 agreement between foreign ministers on total disengagement to restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian Army is rushing in supplies to eastern Ladakh, the site of a months-long military standoff. The Indian Army began planning and preparing for retaining troops at forward locations in Ladakh sector of the LAC some time ago after it became clear that the Chinese side had no intention of moving forward with the disengagement process at key friction points, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “We already have considerable experience from forward deployments on the Line of Control (LoC), even though the weather conditions may not be as harsh as the LAC, and on the Siachen glacier,” said one of the people cited above. Also read| Hindi speeches to Punjabi pop: PLA’s psy-ops at LAC“We also have built up experience over the decades on how to maintain a logistics chain for such forward locations during extreme weather conditions. We are prepared to hunker down for the winter but then we have been left with no other option,” the person added. The people further said the Chinese side has relatively less experience of operating at forward locations during winter months. Chinese troops usually move back from such locations during winter, when their patrolling too is less frequent than that of the Indian side, the people added. While the eastern Ladakh sector is usually guarded by some 20,000 to 30,000 troops, the latest reports suggest the deployment has more than doubled amid the standoff. BRO is ensuring that the 17,580-foot Chang La pass and 17,582-foot Khardung La, en route to the contested Pangong Lake, is kept snow-free throughout the year. With the aim of keeping India’s weapons deployment in eastern Ladakh at par with the PLA’s in occupied Aksai Chin, BRO is expected to strengthen all bridges and culverts leading to the “Class 70” bridge on DSDBO road by October 15. Class 70 means it can bear a load of 70 tonnes, which is more than the weight of a fully loaded tank trailer. In strategic terms, this means that in the worst-case scenario, the DSDBO road can be used to deploy T-90 tanks, infantry combat vehicles and surface-to-air missiles all along the LAC with Tibet in eastern Ladakh. While BRO is expected to validate the Darcha-Padam-Nimu-Leh axis for heavy vehicular traffic this month, intense discussions are underway within the defence ministry on the length and alignment of the tunnel under the 16,000-foot Shinku La. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) has been tasked with studying the shortest possible alignment for the tunnel so that it can be readied in the next four years. A majority of stakeholders, including the ministry of surface transport, are in favour of a shorter 4.5-km tunnel alignment on the current axis, rather than a 13-km alignment suggested by the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the defence ministry. The longer alignment will delay the project with a host of studies and detailed project reports needing to be completed. It has now been left to defence minister Rajnath Singh to take a final call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-digs-in-for-a-long-winter-at-lac/story-mDAnvzvOxlZDI6kOG1DnpI.html
17-09-2020||India||Delhi Police’s Umar Khalid investigation hinges on witnesses X and Y||They are identified in court documents only as X and Y -- two mystery witnesses Delhi Police claim have come forward to depose against activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Umar Khalid, who have been charged with involvement in the February communal riots in the Capital’s north-east district.X and Y, now in protective custody, made statements before metropolitan magistrate Fahad Uddin last month, claiming they were part of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, alongside Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage, a collective of women students) members and Jawaharlal Nehru University students Narwal and Kalita.A statement made before a judge is admissible evidence during trial, and the testimony of X and Y could form the mainstay of the state’s case against Narwal, Kalita and Khalid if the witnesses don’t turn hostile.Kalita and Narwal were arrested on May 24 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA, an anti-terror law, for alleged involvement in the late February Delhi riots, which started as a clash between anti-CAA and pro-CAA protestors before becoming a full-blown communal riot. They have both denied involvement in the riots, which left 53 people dead and around 400 injured.Also read: Delhi Police file charge sheet in riots conspiracy against 15 accusedPolice have charged at least 11 persons for orchestrating the riots, which include former AAP leader Tahir Hussain, and student activists Safoora Zargar and Meeran Haider. Khalid, a former JNU student leader, was arrested on Sunday night under UAPA. He, too, has denied involvement; and his lawyer has told the court. While Narwal and Kalita have been charged, Khalid is yet to be named in the charge sheet. Delhi Police has so far filed over 200 charge sheets in the riots case, identifying at least 21 people who allegedly conspired and orchestrated the violence. On Wednesday, it filed another charge sheet, naming 15 accused, including Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and politician Tahir Hussain. A statement of one of the accused persons arrested in the riots, which was attached in the charge sheet had the names of political leaders and academicians such as Sitaram Yechury and Yogendra Yadav, Apoorvanand and Jayati Ghosh, and has become controversial although police say they have not been charged or named as accused.At the same time, several people -- including politicians, civil society members and former IPS officers -- have criticised the police for the lack of police action against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra, who was seen giving an inflammatory speech in north-east Delhi a day before the violence broke out on February 24.Mishra, who denies all charges, on Monday released a video congratulating the police for arresting Khalid and “people like him”, and likened the riots with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.According to court papers seen by HT, Delhi Police found X and Y during their investigation of the riots and the two agreed to testify as witnesses for the state; they claimed to have observed Narwal, Kalita and Khalid closely during the alleged planning of the riots at the anti-CAA protest sites since January. .On August 14, the police approached the metropolitan magistrate at Karkardooma court requesting that the two main witnesses be placed in protective custody because they feared for their lives after making the statements against the three activists. In their application before the court, the police said that the two persons were witnesses to the planning of the riots.The police also attached to the application the cell phone locations of the two witnesses and matched them with those of Narwal, Kalita and Khalid to claim that X and Y had been at the same places in north-east Delhi as the three activists at different times since January.“They used code words within their group members to convey secret messages regarding further line of their protest/riot in front of common people. They also gave hate speeches at Jafrabad Metro Station and continuously were present there till last,” read the police’s submission on the three accused, quoting one of the witnesses.According to the police, the second witness, Y, said that in the last week of January, Khalid held a private meeting at the anti-CAA protesters’ makeshift office near the old bus stand in Seelampur during which he allegedly said “speeches were not sufficient now because the government was against Muslims”.Police have quoted Khalid’s alleged words: “Khoon bahana padega aise nahi chalega chakka jaam hi aakhri rasta hai hame sarkar ko ghutno ke bal laana hi hoga sanghiyon ki sarkar aise nahi maanegi. (Blood must be spilled. Road blockade is the last resort. We have to bring the government on its knees or else this right-wing government will not understand.)”HT contacted the lawyers of Kalita, Narwal and Khalid for their responses. Kalita and Narwal’s counsel refused to make comments and said they would respond before the court. Khalid’s counsel did not respond until Wednesday night. Also read: Delhi Police targeting CAA-NRC critics, says Umar Khalid in video recorded before arrestThe statement of the two witnesses may be admissible evidence, but the context and the meaning of the words allegedly used by Khalid and the veracity of the two witnesses can be contested during trial.Khalid’s arrest has also been criticised by politicians, activists and academicians as an attempt to muzzle anti-government voices. Advocate and social activist Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday said, “It is a conspiracy to let off those against whom unimpeachable evidence is available to show their involvement in these riots.”Nine retired Indian Police Service officers on Monday wrote to Delhi’s police commissioner SN Srivastava, saying they were “pained” at the police implicating anti-CAA protesters while “letting off the hook all those who instigated violence and are associated by the ruling party”. Though the letter did not mention any names, BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma were criticised at the time for speeches and slogans ahead of the Delhi elections in February.Khalid’s counsel Trideep Pais told the court on Monday that his client was against the Citizenship Amendment Act; he was unashamed of this fact, was not in Delhi at the time of the riots, and was not involved in any violence, the lawyer added. Narwal and Kalita have also told the court before that although they were prominent voices of the anti-CAA protests, the police’s allegations that they orchestrated the violence were false. Their counsel also told the court in case hearings that police did not possess any video or audio recording in which they are heard inciting violence.Delhi police officers did not offer to comment about the two witnesses. Senior police officers, who are authorised to be quoted, said they have already made their submission in court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-s-umar-khalid-investigation-hinges-on-witnesses-x-and-y/story-uZpNOte4S75SrWxp9N5huK.html
17-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt faces House heat on lockdown, migrants, cases||In the first substantive discussion on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Parliament on Wednesday, the Opposition questioned the government on its handling of the pandemic, the manner in which the lockdown was announced and managed, the slide in the economy, the suffering of migrant workers, and the Centre’s approach towards states in the battle against the disease.The opposition parties were responding to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement to Parliament on the pandemic, in which he outlined the government’s achievements in managing the disease, defended the lockdown, spoke of the low fatality rate in India in comparison to the world, and highlighted the improvement in the health care infrastructure.In a debate marked by almost all leaders seeking more time to express their views, Congress deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, who initiated the discussion, acknowledged that the pandemic was unprecedented and that scientific understanding of the disease was still evolving. The opposition leaders also hailed the role of the front line warriors against Covid-19.However, differences between the government and the Opposition on almost every element of the management of the pandemic was apparent.On the Centre’s preparation in the first few months of 2020 and the subsequent lockdown, Sharma said that the announcement was sudden – there was only a four-hour notice – leaving people stunned. He said there must be an examination of whether the government was prepared or not, and the costs and benefits of the exercise.Responding to the health minister’s remark that the lockdown prevented almost 1.4 to 2.9 million cases and 37,000-78,000 deaths, Sharma said: “This is a wide margin. What is the scientific basis for this conclusion? The day the lockdown was imposed, India had 600 cases. Today, as we speak, there are over 5 million cases and over 82,000 deaths. This is the true picture.”Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress alleged that through February and March, the government did not prepare adequately and got its guidelines on wearing masks wrong. Other opposition leaders, too, accused the government of squandering precious time in February — even though the first case in India was discovered on January 30 — and alleged that this was the case because the government was busy hosting US President Donald Trump. O’Brien called the lockdown announcement “Demonetisation 2.0”, while the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Jha said: “Was the lockdown an individual decision or a collective decision? If it was a collective decision of the Cabinet, what were the preparations?” In his intervention, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, however, defended the lockdown as well as the manner of the decision-making. He said that the Prime Minister, home minister, home secretary and cabinet secretary held 15 conversations with the states. “No chief minister said the lockdown should not have happened. During discussions on the Goods and Services Tax (GST), many parties used to agree internally based on consensus and then go out and do politics. This is the same hypocrisy at play. The Opposition shouldn’t do it. Many decisions were taken on the basis of inputs from the states.”On the subsequent impact of the lockdown, the Opposition centred its critique on the suffering of migrant workers. Sharma said that if the government had consulted states and told them to prepare down to the district and tehsil level, implement standard protocols, and track camps with migrant workers, the situation would have been different. He spoke of the images of Indian migrant workers walking home, published internationally, and called for a national database on migrant workers.Also read| ‘Over 5,000 Indians died in West, East Asian countries amid Covid-19 pandemic’: Govt informs ParliamentJha, who represents Bihar in the Upper House, a state which saw a high number of migrants returning home, said that while the upper middle class and middle class of the country thought they were fine, no one spared a thought for the poor and migrant workers. “Workers are not statistics. They are someone’s father, mother, daughter, son. I propose that we should all apologise to workers about whom we did not think, who we did not even talk about in the first two lockdowns and only woke up to their fate during the third lockdown.”RCP Singh of the Janata Dal (United) said that during the pandemic, workers from Bihar, who have been working and contributing to the development of other states, were “deserted”.The BJP’s Sahasrabuddhe strongly defended the government’s handling of the economic and humanitarian situation and said that its “integrated approach” was based on public participation; there was constant dialogue; there were a range of welfare programmes, including the extension of the distribution of free ration and cited examples from BJP-ruled states of efforts to assist migrant workers. An MP from Maharashtra, Sahasrabuddhe, however, spoke at length about the alleged mismanagement of the pandemic in that state.On the economy front, Tiruchi Siva of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) said: “The strictest lockdown was India’s. The lowest fiscal stimulus is India’s. The greatest GDP hit is India’s. The post-lockdown result is worse in India than anywhere else in the world.” On Centre-state relations, O’Brien pointed out that out of a public expenditure of ₹100 on health, ₹63 was spent by states and ₹37 by the Centre. “When things are going good, you want to take the credit. When things are tough, you talk about chief ministers... what was needed was picking up the best practices from all states... you need humility to know that we don’t know everything. You need humility to work with states.” O’ Brien, along with other opposition leaders, also criticised the government on the “opaqueness” of the PM-Cares fine.

17-09-2020||India||India joins Indian Ocean grouping against piracy as observer||India said on Wednesday it had joined the Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCOC), a grouping on maritime matters aimed at countering piracy, as an observer as part of efforts aimed at enhancing maritime security in the Indian Ocean region. The move to join the grouping followed a high-level virtual meeting held on August 26, the external affairs ministry said.The development comes at a time when India is shoring up its position in the Indian Ocean and nearby waters as part of its overall Indo-Pacific policy. India has signed reciprocal military logistics support agreements with Australia and Japan this year to increase interoperability with the navies of those countries.The DCOC, which aims to repress piracy and armed robbery against ships in the western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, was adopted on January 29, 2009, by the representatives of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Maldives, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania and Yemen. Comoros, Egypt, Eritrea, Jordan, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates signed on later, taking the total countries in the grouping to 20.Also read: Indian, Chinese NSAs to join BRICS meet on Thursday; no bilateral talks on cardsThe 18 member states are located in areas adjoining the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and the east coast of Africa and include island nations in the Indian Ocean. Besides India, the other observers in the grouping are Japan, Norway, the UK and the US.“As an observer at [DCOC], India looks forward to working together with... member states towards coordinating and contributing to enhanced maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region,” the external affairs ministry said.Under the code of conduct, the member states cooperate in countering piracy and armed robbery on the high seas and promoting the implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions. They also cooperate in the investigation, arrest and prosecution of persons suspected of having committed acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships, the interdiction and seizure of suspect ships, the rescue of ships and people subject to piracy and armed robbery, and the conduct of joint operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joins-indian-ocean-grouping-against-piracy-as-observer/story-ki47pyuwxJeZhk4Wzbxr9O.html

I have been repeatedly harping on this. DG Police must directly look into this and do the needful as being done throughout the state,” Patnaik said.Commissioner of police of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Sudhansu Sarangi said since April, more than 1.77 lakh people have been penalised over not wearing masks and for violating social distancing norms. In the last five days, around 10,000 people in the twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have been penalised, with the state pocketing Rs 32.4 lakh for violation of Covid-19 guidelines.“We are trying to enforce the guidelines despite 1,000 policemen in the two cities getting infected by the virus and four deaths. In Bhubaneswar, seven inspectors of police stations are currently down with Covid-19 while three ACPs and one additional DCP are infected. We cannot have policemen at every corner and much depends on voluntary compliance by people as economic activities have started. But we would increase our enforcement activities,” said Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/been-harping-on-it-odisha-cm-urges-top-cop-to-be-strict-on-covid-rules/story-A6FbjE2rqIwjnIL8SKcLFO.html
17-09-2020||India||Have reached agreement for Sputnik V trials, distribution in India, says Russia||Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday it has reached an agreement with pharmaceuticals major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for clinical trials and distribution of its experimental vaccine Sputnik V in India, a process that is yet to be cleared by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). The Sputnik V has yet to complete large scale clinical trials but was approved by the Russian government last month, becoming the first Covid-19 vaccine to be cleared for human use anywhere in the world. Scientists have, however, cautioned against use of any shot that has not passed full safety and efficacy checks. “Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF shall supply to Dr Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine,” the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in a statement. Indian officials said approvals will be given only after a thorough review. “We are yet to receive a formal application in this regard. And merely applying for approvals is not enough, clearances will be given only after experts of the subject concerned review the data thoroughly and are satisfied the with the results presented before us,” said a senior official privy to the matter in the DCGI office, asking not to be named. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe Sputnik V is among several vaccine candidates being considered by Indian authorities for the country. The director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, earlier said that a high-level government committee was looking into the data coming from Russia on its Covid-19 vaccine.“Russia has a good history as far as manufacturing vaccines is concerned; they make good vaccines so we presume this vaccine is good. They have published first study of 76 patients in the medical journal The Lancet which is showing good effectiveness and good antibody immunity generation. Because they have not yet complicated a phase 3 trial; they have only started a phase 3 trial, and for us here to do a phase 3 trial of a product from outside of the country has to go through the regular processes of clearances from the regulatory agencies India,” said Dr Bhargava.According to phase 1/2 trial data published in The Lancet journal earlier this month, the vaccine did not lead to side effects and triggered adequate immune response in 76 volunteers. But the results have been disputed by some groups of scientists, who have sought a review of the data, citing what they said were striking similarities between patients.The RDIF on Wednesday reiterated the vaccine is safe. “The Sputnik V vaccine, which is based on well-studied human adenoviral vector platform with proven safety, is undergoing clinical trials for the Coronavirus pandemic. Deliveries could potentially begin in late 2020 subject to completion of successful trials and registration of the vaccine by regulatory authorities in India,” a statement said. “We are pleased to partner with RDIF to bring the vaccine to India. The Phase I and II clinical trials have shown promising results. We will be conducting Phase-III trials in India to ensure safety and efficacy for the Indian population and to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. Sputnik V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against Covid- 19 in India,” said GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Also read: AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine trial in US remains on hold pending FDA reviewRussia’s envoy to India, Nikolay Kudashev, has held discussions with Indian officials in recent weeks on cooperation in the development of a vaccine, including joint development and production of Sputnik V.

The conditions include ‘extra care during screening, additional information [for] informed consent and close monitoring for similar events during the study follow-up’.The trials in India were paused last week after a trial subject in the United Kingdom developed an unexplained severe adverse reaction. On September 11, DCGI, Dr VG Somani, directed SII to pause recruitment of trial participants in India till all safety concerns were addressed. He asked the company to submit for clearances afresh after obtaining clearances from the data safety monitoring boards of both the UK and India.Also read: Have reached agreement for Sputnik V trials, distribution in India, says RussiaOn Saturday, Oxford University announced that the trial was being resumed. After carefully examining SII’s response, DCGI granted the approval to recommence the trial on Tuesday.

There’s a seven-day pause and after that they plan to begin Phase 3 trials with about 1,500 participants across 14 sites,” he had said during the Covid-19 media briefing on Tuesday.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, called the AZD1222, is being tested in the largest number of Indian volunteers yet. It has also been given to more volunteers across the world than some of the other front runners, making it the most watched vaccine candidates. SII, the largest vaccine maker in the world, got DCGI’s permission on August 2 to conduct Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in India. The pharma company also has a production deal for 1 billion doses for low and middle income countries, 300 million of which will be delivered by the end of 2020.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimps and genetically modified. The first dose of the vaccine as part of the phase 2 human trials to check its efficacy began at Bharatiya Vidyapeeth Deemed University Medical College and Hospital in Pune last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-gets-dcgi-approval-to-resume-vaccine-trials/story-KXlVZtQPpWZzKDUsCAuqQK.html
17-09-2020||India||Special CBI court orders criminal cases in Rajasthan hotel sale||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Jodhpur ordered the registration of criminal cases against former Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, former disinvestment secretary Pradeep Baijal and three other people on Wednesday in connection with a case of alleged corruption in the sale of a government-run hotel in 2002.The special CBI judge, Pooran Kumar Sharma, also ordered that the hotel in question -- the Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur -- be handed over to the state government. The hotel -- earlier run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation -- was sold to the Bharat Hotels Limited, which now runs the Lalit group of hotels, in 2002.The judge’s orders came while hearing a closure report by CBI in the case of alleged loss of Rs 244 crore to the government by the sale of the hotel. The CBI report said that there wasn’t evidence to launch prosecution against the accused in the disinvestment process.But the court disagreed and even criticised the federal agency for presenting a closure report in the case. “Prima facie, it appears that the then minister Arun Shourie and then secretary Pradeep Baijal misused their offices and caused a loss of Rs 244 crore to the central government in the deal,” the court said.“The CBI is a reputed agency of the country; closure report by it despite facts pointing towards criminality is a cause of concern,” judge Sharma said .The three other people accused in the case are Ashish Guha, then managing director of investment firm Lazard India Limited, Kantilal Karamsey Vikamsey, then head of valuation firm Kanti Karamsey & Co, and Jyotsna Suri, chairperson and managing director of Bharat Hotels Limited. The court ordered they be booked under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and section 13 (1) D of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court said that they should be summoned through arrest warrants. The date of the summons would be known once the warrants are issued. None of the accused were available for comment despite attempts. They were not represented in the court by any lawyer. The court directed the district collector of Udaipur to take over the hotel immediately.“We have enforced the court’s order,” said Udaipur collector Chetan Dewda. General manager of the hotel, Devendra Singh Parihar, said he was not authorised to talk to media. The CBI registered first information report (FIR) on August 13, 2014 on the basis of a preliminary inquiry that alleged that Baijal abused his official position and entered into a criminal conspiracy in the disinvestment of Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel. According to the FIR, the hotel and land on which it was built was initially valued at Rs 252 crore. But it was finally disinvested for Rs 7.52 crore.The CBI FIR said that Kantilal Karamsey Vikamsey re-evaluated the property and claimed it fell in red zone, where any construction is banned, and a lake and a high tension wire made the property unattractive.But after its investigation into the FIR, the CBI filed a closure report before the court and said it didn’t have enough evidence to prosecute the accused. “The CBI has not got any direct evidence to initiate prosecution against the accused,” the CBI said in the closure report.But the court did not accept this contention. “The unknown officers and private persons indulged in this conspiracy from 1999 to 2002 to cause loss of money to the government,” the court said. “The value of the land was evaluated at Rs 45 per square yard. Even a spoon in the hotel would be costlier than that,” the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-orders-criminal-cases-in-raj-hotel-sale/story-AOlqlk81HmD8yLfaOlCyZP.html
17-09-2020||India||Bill to bring cooperative banks under RBI lens gets House nod||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to bring cooperative banks under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to protect depositors’ interests.The legislation empowers the central bank to regulate only the banking business of cooperatives and it is not applicable to a primary agricultural credit society or a cooperative society providing finance for development of the farm sector, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the House. .The Bill is not to “undermine” the importance of cooperatives, she said. “But, if a cooperative is performing banking functions, there is a need to regulate it... so that it functions professionally,” she said, replying to queries raised by members of the House. The amendments do not affect existing powers of the state registrars of cooperative societies under state cooperative laws.Depositors in Mumbai-based Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC) and Bengaluru-based Sri Guru Raghavendra Cooperative Bank have in recent months faced distress because of problems confronted by the banks. While 430 cooperative banks faced liquidation in the last two decades, not a single commercial bank, whose depositors are protected by the Banking Regulation Act, have had to be liquidated, Sitharaman said.Cooperative banks comprise urban cooperative banks (UCBs) and rural cooperative banks (RCBs). Total amount of deposits in all UCBs as of March 31, 2019 totalled Rs 484,315.85 crore and at RCBs Rs.5,05,859.16 crore.The legislation also enables a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation of a banking entity for protect the interests of depositors without resorting to moratorium that freeze withdrawals by depositors. The Bill replaces an ordinance that was promulgated in pursuance of the government’s commitment “to ensure safety of depositors across banks” by the President on June 26.Sitharaman said the government was compelled to come out with an ordinance during the lockdown period because the condition of some cooperative banks was “grave” and there was “uncertainty” over the resumption of normal legislative business due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government had tabled the Bill in Parliament in March, but it could not be enacted because of the pandemic. “During the budget session in March, we introduced this bill in order to have the amendments brought in so that depositors’ interest will be taken care of. But unfortunately, during the budget session, we could not have this bill passed,” Sitharaman said. Moving the Bill for passage by the House on Wednesday, Sitharaman said the financial health of several cooperative banks was becoming “very delicate”. She said that 277 urban cooperative banks were reporting losses and 105 cooperative banks were unable to meet the minimum capital requirements.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said: “Cooperative banks have been under severe criticisms with rising scams, especially involving small retail depositors. State governments and their respective regulatory boards have not been able to keep up the monitoring mechanisms efficiently over these institutions. The government was waiting for an opportune moment to bring them under the purview of RBI and the timing couldn’t have been better.”“Capital adequacy ratios of most of these banks are concerning and the present regulatory structure does not make the restructuring of these institutions practically feasible. The Bill strikes the right chord and has given a mechanism to restructure these banks and also significantly improves their regulatory oversight by a competent and efficient regulator, the RBI. This move should certainly improve the confidence in the cooperative banks and the interests of all the stakeholders would be protected in the long run,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-bring-cooperative-banks-under-rbi-lens-gets-house-nod/story-kA3tEhfXrjFlOXrsz42GpK.html
17-09-2020||India||Centre for timely disposal of cases against legislators||The Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it supported the timebound disposal of criminal cases against sitting and former legislators, and stressed that all such matters must reach their “logical conclusion”.The statement -- made by solicitor general Tushar Mehta to a three-judge bench headed by justice NV Ramana -- came after a report submitted by a court-appointed amicus curiae in a public interest litigation (PIL) matter showed that 2,556 legislators from Parliament and state assemblies were involved in about 4,442 pending criminal cases across the country.In addition to these cases,the report by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria suggested 175 other pending cases fell under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act and 14 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against serving and former lawmakers across various courts.Of the total cases, the report said that 413 are punishable with life imprisonment and 174 sitting MPs/MLAs are accused in them. In 52 cases, high courts have stayed trials.Hansaria was appointed the amicus after a PIL filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Upadhyay demanded the fast-tracking of trials against politicians, and life bans from contesting elections on those who were convicted.“Principally, the central government is of the view that all cases against elected representatives must be concluded in a timebound manner. If there is a stay order by any high court, the same should be directed to be decided within one month. But if any central investigating agency is not proceeding with the case without any stay order in place, we will take it up at our end and file a report. All trials must reach their logical conclusion,” Mehta told the bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy.The bench asked Mehta for details of cases probed by central agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), and sought to know their status.“In some cases it is noted that CBI, ED register a first information report (FIR) and thereafter there is no enquiry or prosecution. The sword is kept hanging on the accused and even arrest warrants are not issued,” the bench observed.While a response from the court is still pending on the issue of a bar on contesting elections, the court reserved orders on the limited question of steps needed to expedite trials.Hansaria said in his report that there are only 12 special courts in the country to exclusively handle cases against legislators, gave a district-wise split of pending criminal cases in the country, and suggested a slew of measure for speedy trials.These included asking the chief justices of the high courts to create a blueprint for establishing more such courts; trials to be concluded within a year with priority to cases involving sitting legislators over those involving former legislators; no adjournment except in rare and exceptional circumstances; and fixed two-year tenures for judicial officers heading these special courts.Mehta told the court that the burden of establishing additional special courts should not rest on the Centre, which is releasing funds to states for judicial infrastructure. The bench remarked, “Are you (Centre) serious in completing trial in a timebound manner. Then all these concerns are minor issues. We are reserving orders and giving liberty to chief justices of high courts to submit a blueprint on how many courts are needed. We will direct states to furnish utilisation certificate on the Central funds sanctioned to them for the constructing additional courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-for-timely-disposal-of-cases-against-legislators/story-EIVmQhCdKtTAQNqU3OqhkO.html
17-09-2020||India||Indian, Chinese NSAs to join Brics meet; bilateral talks unlikely||India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is set to join his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi for a virtual meeting of the NSAs of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping on Thursday against the backdrop of the border standoff. The 10th meeting of the NSAs of the grouping is part of a series of events being hosted by Russia, the current chair of Brics. This will be the fourth time this month that top Indian and Chinese leaders have been part of multilateral meetings hosted by Russia, following a virtual meeting of Brics’ foreign ministers, and meetings of the defence and foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Moscow. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that as in the case of the Brics’ foreign ministers meeting on September 4, there will be no scope for bilateral discussions between the Indian and Chinese NSAs at Friday’s meeting. “There will be statements by the NSAs and discussions on the items on the agenda, which has already been decided. Besides, the Brics grouping has no scope for takig up bilateral matters,” one of the people cited above said. On 17 September, the Russian Chairmanship will hold the 10th Meeting of BRICS National Security Advisors. According to a statement issued by Russia, the Brics NSAs meeting is expected to discuss “threats and challenges to national security”. “The meeting agenda comprises of challenges and threats to global, regional and national security in today’s world,” the statement said. It added that the event will take place via video conference and Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian federation, will represent Moscow at the meeting. Though both India and China have made it clear that they don’t want any third party mediation on the months-long border standoff that has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low, Russia has pushed the two sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. The meetings of the defence and foreign ministers of the SCO in Moscow facilitated meetings on the sidelines between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. The two foreign ministers agreed on a five-point roadmap to address the tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) but there has been little progress on the disengagement and de-escalation efforts on the ground, mainly because of China not pulling back its troops from friction points. Tensions have been exacerbated by China’s provocative military manoeuvres on the south bank of Pangong Lake since August 29-30 and Indian troops are now preparing to remain deployed at forward positions through the harsh winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-nsas-to-join-brics-meet-bilateral-talks-unlikely/story-c8FMa4Q24Ev0G3sA55j7YP.html
17-09-2020||India||Nearly 5 custodial deaths daily in 2019-20, MHA tells Lok Sabha||Almost five persons died daily in custody in India in 2019-2020, according to data shared by the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) with Parliament on Tuesday. The total number of people killed either in police custody or jails between April 1, 2019 and March 31 was 1,697. Of this, 1,584 died in judicial custody and 113 in police custody. The most deaths in judicial custody, 400, were reported from Uttar Pradesh (UP) while the most in police custody, 14, were reported from Madhya Pradesh (MP). Tamil Nadu (TN) and Gujarat recorded 12 deaths each in police custody. Police are often accused of high-handedness in India while dealing with people taken into custody. Tamil Nadu Police is already under the scanner for the killing of P Jeyaraj (58) and his son Benicks (37) inside a police station in Tuticorin on June 22. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating the case. MHA informed the Lok Sabha that while UP recorded maximum deaths (400) in judicial custody -- this usually includes deaths inside a jail or while taking an accused to a court -- the second-highest number of such deaths was reported from MP (143). This was followed by West Bengal (115), Bihar (105), Punjab (93) and Maharashtra (91). The ministry hasn’t provided reasons for the deaths in police or judicial custody but government officials, who didn’t wish to be named, said the causes usually include illness, gang wars, suicides, or torture by the police or jail staff. Experts say the data doesn’t reflect reality. Senior lawyer and founder of Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) Colin Gonsalves said: “These custodial deaths are not even a third of actual deaths. What they (police) do is that when a person dies, they take him to the hospital and then show on paper that he died inside the hospital. They make doctors write ‘died in hospital’ in the report”. Raja Bagga, programme officer at Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), said: “The government data t doesn’t give exact reasons for deaths in many instances. For example, in certain deaths, the National Crimes Record Bureau (NCRB) records the reason as ‘other’. We asked NCRB not to classify any deaths as such. There is a need to analyse in detail why these 1,700 odd deaths are taking place in police and judicial custody.” Apart from deaths in custody, there were a total of 112 police encounters as well reported from various states between April 2019 and March, according to the MHA’s reply in Parliament on Tuesday. Chhattisgarh recorded highest number (39), while Uttar Pradesh, saw 26 encounters. Government data reveals that there are a total of 1,350 prisons across the country, which have a cumulative capacity to lodge 4,03,739 prisoners. But almost all the jails are overcrowded, the data revealed. Currently, there are 4,78,600 inmates lodged in all the prisons. UP’s 72 jails have the highest number of inmates at 1,01,297, while the capacity is 60,340. In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, union minister of state (home affairs) G Kishan Reddy said that the Centre has issued an advisory on July 13 to all the states and UTs requesting them to sensitise and direct all functionaries of the state, district and below level to follow and adhere to law of the land and the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on custodial deaths, and to act firmly against any abuse of law in respect of custodial deaths. He added that members, special rapporteurs and senior officers from NHRC carry out periodic visits to various jails to evaluate the living conditions and make recommendations for better protection of human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-5-custodial-deaths-daily-in-2019-20-mha-tells-ls/story-uXc55KZcJ1atKZGi6sdZFL.html
17-09-2020||India||Hindi speeches to Punjabi pop: PLA’s psy-ops at LAC||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has started using some interesting weapons against Indian troops along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh -- Punjabi pop in the north bank of Pangong Tso, and Hindi speeches on how Indian troops were being deployed in harsh conditions at the whims of politicians. After the Indian Army outflanked PLA on Rezang La- Rechin La ridgeline south of Pangong Tso on August 29-30 and repositioned its troops to dominate the heights of Finger 4 spur on the north bank of the lake, the Chinese Army first tried to flex its military muscle by moving in tanks and infantry combat vehicles. Rather than be cowed by the PLA, the Indian Army made it clear that there would be retaliation if the red line was breached on either banks.While the Indian Army was not amused by Chinese military tactics, military commanders rolled in mirth after PLA troops on Finger 4 starting belting out Punjabi numbers to soften up the adversary into lowering its guard on the fiercely contested mountainous spur. If the north bank of Pangong Tso was jiving to Punjabi songs on PLA loudspeakers, a similar battery of loudspeakers were deployed by the Red Army at their Moldo Garrison in Chushul sector to remind the Indian troops of what the Chinese termed the folly of their political masters.On the southern banks of Pangong Tso, the Chinese loudspeakers told Indian troops in chaste Hindi about the futility of being deployed at these heights in winter season on the whims of Indian politicians back in Delhi. The idea seemed to be to bring down the morale of Indian troops and sow discord among soldiers that they do not always get hot meals and comfortable lodging. A snowy winter lies ahead of troops on LAC.Also read: Army digs in for a long winter at LACAccording to a former Indian Army chief, PLA used the same loudspeaker tactics in the 1962 skirmishes in the western and eastern sectors as well during the 1967 Nathu La skirmish. “But the Indian troops were foxed about the Punjabi songs on Finger 4. Maybe, the PLA thought that troops from Punjab were holding on to the higher heights of Finger 4 feature,” added this person, who is familiar with what is happening along LAC, and asked not to be named. While the Red Army is using psy-ops at Pangong Tso against the Indian Army, a Chinese Communist party mouthpiece has also been tweeting its heart out to remind the Indian political leadership about the loss of face in 1962, the need for India to revive its economy , and check the rampant spread of coronavirus in India without mentioning that the virus originated in Wuhan. The propaganda site also describes the Modi government’s tough stance on Ladakh as a tactic to divert attention from domestic strife.There is a school of thought that Chinese Communist party general secretary Xi Jinping initiated PLA’s aggression in Ladakh as a way to divert attention from several local issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindi-speeches-to-punjabi-pop-pla-s-psy-ops-at-lac/story-cs3pGsfqR4Ysk7DT8AokyM.html
17-09-2020||India||Troops prepare to dig in for winter amid standoff||The Indian military has ramped up efforts to move equipment and supplies such as winter clothing and mountaineering gear to forward locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector as troops prepare to dig in for the winter amid the standoff with China. The efforts to ferry thousands of tonnes of supplies for troops deployed along the LAC have acquired urgency as road connectivity is expected to be reduced significantly once weather conditions worsen by the end of September. As temperatures plummet and snowfall begins, most roads will be closed and forward army posts will be completely dependent on supplies brought in by helicopters and mules. Airlift: The Indian Air Force’s (IAF) massive C-17 Globemaster and Il-76 heavy lift aircraft have been making sorties to the airfield at Leh, located at a height of more than 10,500 feet, bringing in more troops, equipment and supplies. Though the C-17 can carry a maximum payload of up to 77 tonnes and the Il-76 about 40 tonnes, the aircraft have to operate with lower payloads at airfields such as the one at Leh because of the rarified atmosphere, people familiar with developments said.

The final five of 15 Chinooks ordered by India from the US were delivered just before the Covid-19 lockdown in March and are now playing a key role in ferrying troops and gear to forward locations. Footage aired on television news channels on Wednesday showed soldiers forming human chains to move supplies from the heavy lift aircraft to the Chinooks so that they could be speedily moved to troops deployed on the LAC. Light helicopters such as the Dhruv can also be used for evacuating personnel in medical emergencies. Army convoys: Footage shared on social media on Wednesday showed long convoys of army trucks ferrying fuel and other supplies to posts along the LAC. Since snow blocks mountain passes into the Ladakh region for at least four months during winter, Indian military planners have moved more than 150,000 tonnes of materials into the region, Reuters reported. “All the supplies that we need have already been pushed to wherever they are required,” said Maj Gen Arvind Kapoor, chief of staff of the Indian Army’s 14 Corps. The supplies: Among the equipment being moved to Ladakh sector are winter clothing, snow boots, mountaineering equipment, special tents, sleeping bags, heaters, fuel and high-calorie rations. The people cited above said efforts are underway to ensure there are adequate stocks of such essential equipment and gear for several months at logistics depots at places such as Leh, from where they can be rapidly moved by helicopters and army convoys to forward locations according to the needs on the ground. With temperatures expected to plunge as low as minus 40 degrees to minus 50 degrees Celsius during winter and wind speeds of more than 40 kmph at high altitudes, the tents and double-layered sleeping bags will play a key role in forward locations. The equipment displayed for reporters at Leh included lightweight winter clothing made of synthetic materials with three layers of protection, insulated snow boots and mountaineering gear. At a fuel, oil and lubricant depot near Leh, a hillside was covered with clusters of green drums, according to Reuters. The fuel is needed for both vehicles and heating equipment. At storage facilities at another supply depot, boxes of rations, including pistachios, instant noodles and curries, stood in large piles. Though the high altitudes often play havoc with appetites, experts believe soldiers need to consume at least 4,000 calories each day to function efficiently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-prepare-to-dig-in-for-winter-amid-standoff/story-Wtn44Z99ZWuRywNtN1xOGN.html
17-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha to debate NEP, GST, economy, environment on Parliament floor||The Union government on Wednesday agreed to debates demanded in Parliament on four key topics by the Opposition -- the Goods and Services Tax (GST), jobs and the economy, the national education policy (NEP) and the draft environment impact assessment norms -- at a special meeting with select political leaders.Chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, the meeting was attended by representatives of the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, and Communist Party of India (Marxist). Congress leaders said a second meeting would be held on Friday or Saturday, in which the India-China military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the eastern Ladakh sector may be raised. A Congress leader who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity: “We will first hear Rajnath Singh’s statement and then decide our next course of action.” Singh told the leaders he would make a statement on the India-China border issue at 12 noon in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, but the government has not been in favour of an open debate on the issue citing the sensitivities on the ground as Indian and Chinese soldiers face-off against each other at several friction points in the region.Wednesday’s meeting was a rare instance of the BJP brass reaching out to opposition parties to come to an agreement on contentious issues. While government managers dial individual opposition leaders regularly, such a meeting has taken place after a long hiatus. In November 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then ministers Arun Jaitley and M Venkaiah Naidu met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh to find a way for the passage of the GST bill. Opposition parties also assured support for seven ordinances. but demanded that the three farm-related bills and banking regulation amendments be sent to select panels for a review. Government managers did not agree.  Congress leaders were keen on a debate on economy and job losses and the party’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Jairam Ramesh, a former environment minister, pressed for a debate on the environment.Also read| Covid-19: Govt faces House heat on lockdown, migrants, casesThe draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) norms contain contentious clauses, including one pertaining to the regularisation of infrastructure projects that violated the EIA Notification, 2006, by starting construction before environmental clearance or by expanding their capacity. The draft also proposes a shortening of the time for public hearings, which offer people affected by projects the opportunity to understand them and give their consent for them.Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien was keen for a discussion on GST in the backdrop of the a projected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the states’ share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue this financial year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. DMK leader Tiruchi Siva insisted on a debate on the new national education policy, which has recommended primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities in India, creating a single higher-education regulator, and easier board examinations. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-run Tamil Nadu government has declared it would prefer a two-language formula and oppose a three-language formula proposed in the education policy. The state has also told the Centre that it wants to continue the current 10+2+3 system of education and would not accept the proposed 5+3+3+4 system. Government managers initially proposed a combined debate on the GST and the economy in the meeting, to which Opposition leaders pointed out that GST was an issue related to the federal structure and should not be linked to the larger economy. O’Brien’s calling-attention motion, which entails a reply by the minister, on the subject is likely to be discussed on September 18. O’Brien also accused the government of “robbing” 18 hours of the opposition’s time by scrapping the daily Question Hour and not allocating enough time for discussions. “Rajnath Singh heard us patiently and said time management will be improved,” said O’Brien. SP’s Ramgopal Yadav advised the government not to bring the three farm-related ordinances: The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 and the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020.Many experts have hailed the new laws that the government says seek to improve the farmers’ lot, but opposition parties and farmers’ organizations have alleged that they would be beneficial only to corporate houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-oppn-to-debate-4-key-issues-in-house/story-yrxzzmg8nPzcTfUt2xlQuJ.html
17-09-2020||India||32-year-old sets up fake websites selling high-end phones, cheats 2,500||A 32-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly using fake websites to cheat people by offering inexpensive mobile phones on equated monthly instalments (EMIs), accepting advances paid into bank accounts and not delivering the devices, the police said.Two of his associates are on the run.Jitender Singh, who has a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) degree, told the police that he and his associates had duped more than 2,500 people across the country, said deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena. Two mobile phones have been seized from Singh, who was arrested when.“We are verifying his claims of cheating over 2,500 people. The bank accounts that the racketeers used are being examined to ascertain the money transactions related to the scam. As of now, we have arrested Singh in one case that was being investigated by our district’s cyber cell team since early this year,” the officer.An investigating officer said an initial analysis of one bank account reflected four or five deposits by people for cellphones. “We will approach the depositors to know whether they had filed any police complaints regarding the cheating. Singh has told us that his gang used to dupe two or three persons daily,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.DCP Meena said that the racketeers used to create fake websites on which they sold inexpensively priced cellphones at easy EMIs. After duping a certain number of people, they used to deactivate the website and shift its domain name to avoid demands for return of money or delivery of the phones.“They used to take only small amount -- between Rs 1,999 and Rs. 7,999 -- depending on the price of the phones, so that the victims do not approach the police even after being duped. Also, they only took money through virtual payment address (VPA) mechanisms to make the transaction’s detection difficult,” said Meena.On January 9, a man named Irfan Pathan filed a case at the Govindpuri police station in Delhi, saying he had come across a website in December that offered cellphones that were cheaper than market prices and on EMIs.“An executive of the website tricked him into depositing R 5,998 in three instalments through a virtual payment address.However, after taking the money the fraudsters neither delivered the phone nor returned the amount. They deactivated the website and all the contact numbers. Thereafter, Pathan filed a case,” said Meena.During the probe, the police collected details of the phone numbers that were linked to the website and used to contact Pathan as well. The call details of one phone number revealed that it was registered with an e-commerce payment system site and a bank account in the name of Rajat Shukla.Details of the VPA used by the gang were obtained from the National Payments Corporation of India. It was found that the VPA was registered with Shukla’s bank account, through which the money were transferred to another account in the name of Jitender Singh, said officer Meena.“We arrested Singh from his home in Ghaziabad and seized two cellphones used in the crime. Singh disclosed that Shukla and Praveen Kumar were his partners in crime,” said Meena, adding that the police were conducting raids to catch the other two suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/32-year-old-sets-up-fake-websites-selling-high-end-phones-cheats-2-500/story-SX1wkcdGK0Qdh9s5318dTP.html

Doctors suffer four times mortality of ordinary citizens and private practitioners suffer eight times mortality on the same scale.”  “To feign that this information doesn’t merit the attention of the nation is abominable. If the government doesn’t maintain the statistics of the total number of doctors and healthcare workers infected by Covid- 19 and the statistics of how many of them sacrificed their life due to the pandemic, it loses the moral authority to administer the Epidemic Act 1897 and the Disaster Management Act.”  “This also exposes the hypocrisy of calling them corona warriors on one hand and denying them and their families the status and benefits of martyrdom,” the IMA stated.Publishing a list of 382 doctors who died in the Covid-19 pandemic, along with their addresses, it said, “We demand they be acknowledged and treated as martyrs.” Their families and children deserve solace and solatium from the government, the IMA stressed.“The IMA also commends to the government they seek such data from the representatives of nurses and other healthcare workers,” the statement said.The doctors’ body said it had shared with the health ministry hundreds of  suggestions and feedback during this national health emergency.“The Prime Minister deemed it fit to invite the national president of IMA to a meeting to share the concerns and seek suggestions and cooperation. The suo moto statement of the health minister preferred to ignore the national dimension of the war against Covid-19,” it said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-publishes-list-of-382-doctors-who-died-due-to-covid-19-demands-they-be-treated-as-martyrs/story-hX0ELsr0LXk8UnBFQ0kIvJ.html

This will be the fourth time this month that top Indian and Chinese leaders have been part of multilateral meetings hosted by Russia, following a virtual meeting of BRICS’ foreign ministers, and meetings of the defence and foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Moscow.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that as in the case of the BRICS’ foreign ministers meeting on September 4, there will be no scope for bilateral discussions between the Indian and Chinese NSAs during the meeting.Also read: Rajnath Singh to make statement on LAC in Rajya Sabha tomorrow“There will be statements by the NSAs and discussions on the items on the agenda which has already been decided. Besides, the BRICS grouping has no scope for taking up bilateral matters,” one of the people cited above said.On 17 September, the Russian chairmanship will hold the 10th Meeting of BRICS National Security Advisors.According to a statement issued by Russia, the BRICS NSAs meeting is expected to discuss “threats and challenges to national security”.“The meeting’s agenda comprises of challenges and threats to global, regional and national security in today’s world,” the statement said. It added that the event will take place via video conference and Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, will represent Moscow at the meeting.Though both India and China have made it clear that they don’t want any third party mediation on the months-long border standoff that has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low, Russia has pushed the two sides to resolve their differences through dialogue. The meetings of the defence and foreign ministers of the SCO in Moscow facilitated meetings on the sidelines between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. The two foreign ministers agreed on a five-point roadmap to address the tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) but there has been little progress on the disengagement and de-escalation efforts on the ground, mainly because of China not pulling back its troops from friction points.Tensions have been exacerbated by China’s provocative military manoeuvres on the south bank of Pangong Tso since August 29-30 and Indian troops are now preparing to remain deployed at forward positions through the harsh winter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-nsas-to-join-brics-meet-on-friday-no-bilateral-talks-on-cards/story-DeRxVwwypmTXVpoN4dkFzL.html
17-09-2020||India||Delhi Riots: What former police commissioner Neeraj Kumar says on Umar Khalid and Kapil Mishra||Former commissioner of Delhi Police Neeraj Kumar supported Delhi police’s investigation into the violence that took place in northeast Delhi in February this year. On Wednesday, the Delhi Police named fifteen people in the charge sheet, accusing them of orchestrating the riots that killed at least 53 people and injured hundreds.On Tuesday, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava wrote to veteran cop Julio Ribeiro, explaining to him that the investigation was being carried out without any discrimination based on caste or religion, and was backed by documentary and scientific evidence.Watch | Why Delhi police didn’t act against Kapil Mishra Former Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar believes Delhi Police is right and here is what he says.* A lot of the points have already been explained by the police commissioner in his letter to Julio Ribeiro, said Neeraj Kumar. “But nonetheless, I am better placed than many of my colleagues who are expressing their anguish.* “On the basis of limited inputs I have, I know that Delhi Police has come up with some technical evidence. It is not based on some heresy,” the former police chief said.* Neeraj Kumar said the planning happened in a large scale. People were meeting at various places in Northeast Delhi, Kumar said. “There is lot of evidence not only against Umar Khalid, but also against members who are already arrested,” Neeraj Kumar said.* “Some people have gone to the Delhi High Court urging direction to the Delhi Police to take action against Kapil Mishra. The issue is subjudice. I don’t want to defend Kapil Mishra. But I am giving a perspective. What he said didn’t incite riots,” Kumar said.* Umar Khalid has not been made an accused just for his Amravati speech where he asked people to come out in protest during US president Donald Trump’s visit to India. Evidence against him are far more. His speech forms only a small portion of the body of the evidence that Delhi Police have, Neeraj Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-what-former-police-commissioner-neeraj-kumar-says-on-umar-khalid-and-kapil-mishra/story-B3C1Cs020ZWKIHZmk3OQ5I.html
17-09-2020||India||China belts out Punjabi numbers for Indian soldiers at Ladakh. It is a ‘62 trick||Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu in his famous book “Art of War” wrote way back in 6th century BC that the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. It is to his credit that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Communist party mouthpieces use the same weapons of psychological warfare against the Indian troops deployed in Ladakh and India even today.After the Indian Army outflanked the PLA on Rezang La- Rechin La ridgeline south of Pangong Tso on August 29-30 and repositioned its troops to dominate the heights of Finger 4 spur on the north bank of the lake, the Chinese Army first tried to militarily muscle the adversary by moving in tanks and infantry combat vehicles. Rather than be cowed by the PLA strength, the Indian Army made it clear that there would be retaliation if the red line is breached on either banks.While the Indian Army was not amused by Chinese military tactics, the military commanders rolled up in mirth after PLA troops on Finger 4 starting belting out Punjabi numbers to soften up the adversary into lowering their guard on the fiercely contested mountainous spur. If the north bank of Pangong Tso was jiving to Punjabi songs on PLA loudspeakers, a battery of loudspeakers were deployed by the Red Army at their Moldo Garrison in Chushul sector to remind the Indian troops of, what they claim, is the folly of their political masters.Also Watch | Ladakh: Watch how Army, IAF are boosting troops, supplies amid China tensionAlso Read: Road to Daulat Beg Oldi for tanks to be ready by Oct 15 as army preps for Ladakh winterOn the southern banks of Pangong Tso, the Chinese loudspeakers told Indian troops in chaste Hindi about the futility of being deployed at these heights in winter season on the whims and fancies of Indian politicians back in Delhi. The whole idea of PLA is to pull down the morale of Indian troops and create dissatisfaction among the soldiers that they do not always get hot steaming meals and logistics. A snowy winter also lies ahead.According to a former Indian Army chief, the PLA used the same loudspeaker tactics in 1962 skirmishes in the western and eastern sectors as well during the 1967 Nathu La skirmish. “But the Indian troops were foxed about the Punjabi songs on Finger 4. Maybe, the PLA thought that troops from Punjab were holding on to the higher heights of Finger 4 feature,” said the former army chief.While the Red Army is using psy-ops at Pangong Tso against the Indian Army, a Chinese Communist party mouthpiece has also been tweeting its heart out to remind the Indian political leadership about the loss of face in 1962, the need for India to recover its economy that, it says, has sunk to abysmal depth and to check the rampant spread of coronavirus in India without mentioning that the virus originated in Wuhan. The propaganda paper and its online site also describes the Modi government’s tough stance on the Ladakh friction as a tactic to divert attention from domestic strife.Incidentally, the same holds true for Chinese Communist party general secretary Xi Jinping who initiated PLA aggression in Ladakh to divert attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-bombards-indian-soldiers-with-propaganda-via-loudspeakers-tells-them-to-blame-modi/story-9JIbg3SU5T6F2WNBpefIiO.html
17-09-2020||Editorials||A White paper on Covid-19||Parliament has finally held a debate on the most pressing issue of contemporary times — the public health and economic challenge posed by Covid-19. Health minister Harsh Vardhan first offered a statement, where he outlined the government’s efforts to tackle the pandemic, the improvement in the health infrastructure, the gains because of the lockdown, the low death rate in India, the medical efforts underway, and the need for constant caution. In response, many Opposition leaders questioned the government’s assessment and critiqued the lack of initial preparation, the management of the lockdown, the economic contraction and the distress caused to migrant workers, and the rising case count in the country. While the pandemic is still ravaging lives and livelihoods, the debate itself is a good first step in evaluating how India has fared so far. Three points emerge from it. On the lockdown, the Centre continues to believe it did the right thing — the Opposition believes that even if the lockdown was necessary, the four-hour notice was inadequate and caused panic, and the government did not take into account the distress it would cause. On the economy, while the government argues it has taken major steps to tackle distress through a stimulus and welfare measures, the Opposition believes that these steps have been inadequate. As Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Member of Parliament, Tiruchi Sivá, said, India had the most stringent lockdown, the weakest stimulus, and has the hardest-hit GDP. On Centre-state coordination, while the former claims that there was regular consultation and decisions were taken based on inputs from states, the Opposition believes that the Centre has taken credit for the good, while putting the blame on states, especially those ruled by non-Bharatiya Janata Party forces, when the going is tough. This divergence is not just a matter of theoretical debate — it has had, and continues to have real policy implications (and human and economic costs) on the management of the pandemic. Given that it has been close to six months since the lockdown, it is perhaps a good time for the government to come up with a White Paper on India’s Covid-19 record. This should highlight the unprecedented nature of the challenge and the steps that the government has taken. But it should also look at the gaps — in terms of India’s public health systems, weak social security safety net, and the persistent challenge in protecting both lives and livelihoods. This will help both current policymaking and serve as a historical record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-white-paper-on-covid-19/story-Si4Q4lolhN9Gty66inysmI.html
17-09-2020||Editorials||On biodiversity, a global failure||The world has failed to achieve even one of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets signed by 170 countries and regions through the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), says the latest Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 (GBO-5) report released on Tuesday. The conservation targets, which aim to protect the world’s imperiled flora and fauna, were formulated in Japan in 2010. The convention is currently ironing out its post-2020 framework, which will be adopted at its next meeting in Kunming, China, in 2021. The new framework will create a new set of targets to remedy the Aichi goals’ failures, and turn things around.National governments failed to meet the CBD goals despite an earlier warning from United Nations that one million species could disappear within decades, widening the Holocene extinction: The planet’s sixth mass extinction event, driven by human activity. They failed because of two reasons. One, most countries struggled to balance conservation with the needs of their growing populations and economy (it is the same policy dilemma that is hobbling the fight against the climate crisis). And two, positive conservation steps were upended by perverse incentives which enable destruction — for instance, fossil fuels need mining and overfishing destroys coral reefs, all of which has an impact on preservation. The GBO-5 comes out at a crucial time when, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the world is being forced to rethink its development objectives and its relationship with nature. Business-as-usual will only plunge the globe into deeper crises, given the complex interdependence of all elements in nature. A stronger CBD framework must push national governments to act and avoid a natural catastrophe that can endanger human lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-biodiversity-a-global-failure/story-ZvaMn3nLa8zH02XdbCLkxJ.html
