Over the last few years, the government has launched initiatives for farmers and the agriculture sector, including a ₹6,685-crore scheme for the formation of 10,000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs); the one-of-its kind ₹1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF); the national Agriculture Export Policy; and the disbursal of more than ₹90,000 crore of direct benefit to farmers under PM-KISAN. Now, with The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, we have created the foundation to build a world-class agriculture ecosystem that will benefit farmers, consumers, wholesalers, processors, and start-ups.There are some who believe that these reforms will result in the end of procurement at minimum support price (MSP), closure of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), and loss of farmers’ land to corporates. I would like to assure that whether it is MSP or APMCs, all existing systems will continue. We have laid down stringent safeguards to secure farmers from any malpractices. The reforms will introduce competition and efficiency and improve these systems, as well as create freedom and choice for farmers.A FPO, which is an aggregation of farmers, provides higher bargaining power to farmers and helps them realise benefits from economies of scale. AIF and the market reforms have now provided additional enablers and opened up new opportunities for FPOs. They can invest in farm equipment and infrastructure and build forward market linkages by entering into agreements with agribusinesses. This will improve access to advisory, technology, and investment, aligning variety mix and quality as per market demand, and ensuring higher incomes. One of the best examples of a successful FPO is Maharashtra’s Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Limited. At least 8,000 marginal farmers are registered under FPO, which exports more than 16,000 tonnes of grapes every season. It helps farmers enter into MoUs with leading FMCG companies and access high-tech infrastructure. With improved market linkages, we will also see a shift in what our farmers produce. For a long time now, India has been self-sufficient in many crops, including rice and wheat. An increase in understanding of market demand and trends, through direct engagement with agribusinesses, will enable farmers to grow crops with higher market value and reduce dependency on imports. For example, due to low domestic production, India imports more than $10 billion worth of edible oils. Similarly, we are seeing an increasing demand for healthy foods such as kiwi and avocado in cities; this is primarily served by imports. With reforms, investments can come in and farmers will be able to gather the market intelligence to diversify crop mix, increase domestic productivity to substitute imported crops, and lead India to complete self-sufficiency.The reforms will also provide an opportunity to agribusinesses to build consistent supply and standardised variety by direct procurement from farmers, run their operations more efficiently, and boost export volumes and share of food processing. This will also help eliminate other system inefficiencies such as high intermediary and logistics costs. For example, at least 1,000 seed potato farmers in Punjab, northern Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh have benefited from an increase of 10%-30% in productivity and 35% margin above cost under agreement with Technico Agri Sciences Limited (a subsidiary of ITC). There are thousands of examples of agribusinesses working with farmers leading to higher farmer income and development of agribusinesses. Beyond the investment in traditional agribusinesses, market reforms will drive innovation in the sector and allow new business models to evolve. Different businesses such as farm management services, quality grading and assaying centres, Grade-A warehousing companies, digital marketplaces, are nascent but growing. Innovative business models will attract more investor money and can achieve scale and improve productivity; improvement in post-harvest management will reduce wastage; and digital marketplaces will increase reach and market linkages.Market reforms will also drive private capital formation in the sector and give a boost to the rural economy. Capital formation in agriculture and allied industries has been stagnant with less than 2% CAGR over the last five years and private sector investments are further declining due to gaps in access. With the new market reforms, we will see growth in private sector investment across the value chain. This will create new jobs in allied sectors such as logistics service providers, warehouse operators and processing unit staff. We will also see multi-generational agriculture jobs — children of farmworkers can now aspire to become FPO CEOs or managers for procurement and marketing, without having to go to cities for such opportunities. India is at the cusp of a new frontier in agriculture growth and development — one that farmers, businesses, government and consumers will build together. Different government initiatives have been leading us down this path, and with the passing of the two Acts, we are now well-poised to make the vision of doubling farmer income, building India as the food basket of the world, and providing livelihoods in the agriculture and allied sectors a reality.Rajnath Singh is defence minister and has served as agriculture minister The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/creating-a-new-farm-ecosystem/story-g9GgDPlruF77QkPzz6vhwJ.html
20-09-2020||News||For marriage ‘equality’ that is truly equal||Since January, a petition challenging the applicability of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, to heterosexuals has been pending in the Kerala High Court. The petitioners are two gay men — 35-year-old Nikesh PP and 31-year-old Sonu MS —who had a wedding ceremony in the parking lot of a temple in 2018, and then petitioned the court to have their marriage legally solemnised under the secular law that came into existence to facilitate marriages between inter-faith and inter-caste couples who didn’t want to marry under religious personal laws.On September 8, another petition was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking recognition of gay marriages within the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, by intersex rights activist Gopi Shankar, the founder of lesbian collective Sakhi, Giti Thadani, transgender rights activist G Oorvasi and writer Abhijit Iyer Mitra. Their petition states that Section 5 of the Act did not specify that marriage must be between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman, but instead refers to marriage between “two Hindus”. The petition invoked Articles 14 (equality), 21 (life and personal liberty), and 25 (freedom of religion), arguing that the right to marry was thus part of the fundamental rights of Hindu LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) couples.But there is much more to the issue of marriage equality than seeking it for only for Hindu LGBT persons.How one chooses to demand change — and for whom — is crucial. For one, calling it same-sex marriage is trans-exclusionary, because not every trans person identifies within the binary gender formulation. Hence, same-sex points to gay or lesbian couples, but excludes transmen, transwomen and other gender queer identities. The exclusion is egregious because even the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, passed in December 2019, does not touch upon transgender persons’ right to marry. Marriage equality, at a bare minimum, must allow consenting adults to enter into this form of partnership, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, across castes and religions. But that’s just one part of it.At the heart of the debate on granting marriage equality to LGBTI people (the I stands for inter-sex) people is a fundamental contradiction between the right to choose one’s partner and the reality that in the social contract of marriage in India, individual choice is often insignificant, and individual autonomy non-existent. The right to individual autonomy with respect to choosing a partner has been read into constitutional articles by the Supreme Court in path-breaking judgments such as the Hadiya case. Here, the court protected the right of Hadiya, an adult woman who converted from Hinduism to Islam, and wished to remain married to Shafin Jahan, a choice that was opposed by her father, who moved the Kerala High Court to regain control over his “child”. Countless other inter-caste, inter-religious and intra-gotra couples have faced violence, and even been murdered. This has a stifling effect on the freedom to choose one’s partner. In fact, the architect of the Indian Constitution, BR Ambedkar had pointed out decades ago, “As long as caste in India exists, Hindus will hardly intermarry or have any social intercourse with outsiders...”The feminist movement has critiqued the unequal power structures within the institution of marriage, which the courts have tried to balance through judgments over decades. The inequality written into the institution is both a function of social norms as well as regressive legislation, such as the non-criminalisation of marital rape and the failure of the executive to right this wrong. That women’s consent is considered unimportant in heterosexual marriages is our cue that marriage equality is more than a debate about making it legal for LGBTI people.Perhaps a more radical solution needs to be imagined: A partnership of equals in a format that empowers individuals whether straight or queer, married or in live-in relationships, to form contracts that they choose, whether of property or insurance or to avail tax benefits, and where religion, caste and gender identity are irrelevant.It also cannot continue to be left to the courts to do the duty of the executive. The State must step up to its responsibility in guaranteeing constitutional rights, ensuring that a free choice to enter egalitarian legal partnerships is granted, upheld and protected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/for-marriage-equality-that-is-truly-equal/story-DpIlyrUMQFXrXV3I610TOL.html
20-09-2020||City||After cleanest month since 2015, Capital’s air begins downward slide into long winter||New Delhi: After a month in which Delhi saw its cleanest air in five years, air pollution has seen an uptick in the national capital over the past few weeks. With monsoon drawing to a close and little possibility of more rainfall this month, the air quality may deteriorate further by the end of this month, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Unlike August, when the air quality was in the ‘good’ category for four days, and ‘satisfactory’ for the remaining 27, the air this month has mostly remained in the ‘moderate’ category.August was the cleanest month on record since 2015, from when air quality index (AQI) records in the city have been maintained.An AQI reading of 0-50 is considered ‘good’ (minimal health risk), 51-100 is ‘satisfactory’ (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is ‘moderate’ (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease).Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that the AQI this month slipped to ‘moderate’ category on September 5, with a value of 101. It improved to ‘satisfactory’ for a few days before again falling into ‘moderate’ on September 9, a zone it has remained in so far.On Sunday, Delhi’s overall AQI was 148, in the ‘moderate’ zone, as per the CPCB’s 4pm bulletin, up from 118 the previous day.“The spell of clean air days may almost be over now, as meteorological conditions are changing. The monsoon is set to withdraw by September-end, after which calm winds blow across the northwestern region that are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre “Pollutants suspended in the air that were till last month being washed away by the rain and winds are likely to persist, in the absence of any such weather activity,” he added.He added that while August received the most rainfall in at least 10 years, September, which usually sees good showers every year, has not received adequate rainfall this year and will not be able to cover the deficit for this month. “The monsoon trough this month has remained mostly in the hilly regions. Only three days of light rain were recorded this month — on September 5,6 and 8. There is a system forming in the Bay of Bengal, which is likely to induce light rain or thundershowers on September 22-23, but even that will not be able to cover the deficit for this month,” Srivastava said.The Safdarjung observatory, which is representative of Delhi’s weather, has a rain deficit of 78% so far this month.Another IMD scientist, who did not wish to be named, said industrial and vehicular pollution was almost zero during the lockdown months. Then in July and August, even with curbs being eased in phases, good and continuous spells of rain kept the air quality in check. “Now, from the end of the month, the weather will slowly transition to calmer winds and a decrease in temperature neither of which are favourable for pollutants to disperse. Besides, it is also the time when stubble burning in neighbouring states begins, which adds to the pollution load,” the scientist said.The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) is scheduled to meet the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) next week to discuss an action plan to curb pollution in the major ‘hot spots’ across the city.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had, last week, asked all agencies to submit a winter action plan by September 21. The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), put in place to deal with various levels of pollution, is enforced in Delhi and the National Capital Region from mid-October.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said air quality has seen a downward trend, with changes in meteorological factors. “Over the last five months, the clean air we saw was a combination of low emissions because of the lockdown and good rainfall in the entire northwest region. The overall pollution levels were low because of the impact of clean air in the whole region. This, however, is changing now and the government has to ensure implementation of stringent measures to curb the pollution levels from deteriorating this winter,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-cleanest-month-since-2015-capital-s-air-begins-downward-slide-into-long-winter/story-tkvvAwI3iPa29QCvCZZcLJ.html

The accused, Bablu Yadav, 29, had hit the deceased on the head with a stone slab over a monetary dispute. Yadav’s associate is still wanted in the case and police are looking for him. According to police, Yadav came to Mumbai in 2006 and started working as a carpenter. The victim, Mukesh Gupta, 30, also from UP, started working with Yadav as a carpenter, said senior inspector Avinash Dharmadhikari of Dongri police station. Yadav got a small contract at an apartment in Dongri where Gupta and the absconding accused were also working. The incident occurred on September 15 when an argument took place between Yadav and Gupta. Yadav along with the absconding accused hit a stone slab on Gupta’s head and fled, added Dharmadhikari. The Dongri police got information about the incident and rushed to the spot. They found Gupta lying in a pool of blood and rushed him to JJ Hospital where he was declared dead. “During the inquiry, police learnt that Yadav and Gupta had disputes over the distribution of money from the carpentry work,” added Dharmadhikari. A police team went to UP and found out that Yadav had gone to Nepal. Police convinced his family to ask him to return from Nepal. As soon as he came back, Mumbai Police nabbed him and brought him to Mumbai on Sunday. He was produced in court and was remanded in police custody till September 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-accused-of-killing-employee-in-dongri-arrested-by-mumbai-police-from-uttar-pradesh/story-DvrXx66mSoj5SXSjjWkCAJ.html

They said two men entered the store and asked him to show engagement rings and the jeweller took out one tray and presented six rings. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said one of them told him that he is getting engaged and wanted to choose a heavy gold ring. “The shopkeeper weighed the ring and before a price was fixed, the third suspect entered the shop and took the jeweller at gunpoint, after which the fourth suspect entered,” he said.The police said that CCTV grab purportedly shows that the fourth suspect jumped above the glass table of the counter and grabbed the shopkeeper. He was purportedly seen struggling and raised an alarm, but due to the glass door which was closed, the noise could not pass, they added. Moreover, the shop is located on a busy road. The three suspects picked three to four jewellery trays from the display counter and rushed towards the car which was parked outside, said the police.Sangwan said the ring that one of the suspects had chosen weighed seven grams and had asked him to pack it before the third and fourth suspects entered the shop.Rajbeer Verma, the victim, said this is the first such experience he has faced at his shop. “I had heard similar incidents taking place in markets and read about them in newspapers but this was a shocking and disturbing incident and I am still under trauma. My family is equally worried for my safety,” he said. Police have recovered CCTV footage from seven spots including from the shop, officers said, adding that they are trying to identify the robbers on the basis of the Maruti Swift Dzire car they had used, and are gathering evidence. The shop is 21-years-old and the owner had installed the CCTV camera recently, said the police. The suspects had visited the shop earlier also while conducting recce, they added.Sangwan said the registration number of the car turned out to be fake and as per CCTV footage recovered, the suspects fled towards Sector 15 and later on to the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. The shop’s name is Mussaddilal jewellers, located at Roshanpura in the Sadar Bazar area. During the attack, Verma, who owns the shop, sustained minor injuries as the suspects thrashed him; one of them had caught hold of him and slapped him several times, the police said. He even fell twice and got hurt by the table of the shop, officers added.Sangwan said the suspects had conducted a recce of the market area several times before targeting the shop, adding that they were familiar with all routes and lanes of the market. “We suspect others may be involved who were keeping a close watch on the shop while the four robbed Verma,” said Sangwan.A case under section 392 (Robbery), 34 (common intentions) and sections of the Arms Act was registered at City police station against unidentified persons on Saturday after recording the statement of the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-jewellery-store-robbed-of-items-worth-13-lakh-at-gunpoint-in-sadar-bazar/story-gegvzti82sWsrI0lcwMRMJ.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||GRP returns stolen goods worth ₹2.13 crore to local train commuters in Mumbai||The Government Railway Police (GRP) has returned goods worth ₹21,359,310 which were stolen from commuters travelling on local trains across Mumbai. GRP commissioner Ravindra Sengaonkar said that when he took charge in May 2019, around 14,566 cases of theft in trains were solved but the stolen goods which were recovered had not been returned. “The officers had recovered the stolen booty from the accused but had not returned it to their rightful owners due to glitches such as wrong address or delay in claiming the property from the magistrate courts etc,” said Sengaonkar. He then instructed all GRP units to speed up the process to find addresses of victims and to return their property. The order saw GRP units swing into action to trace addresses. Between April to September this year, GRP officers have returned 787 grams of gold, six laptops, 1,067 mobile phones and ₹1,547,000 in cash. “According to the instructions, during lockdown many people have lost their jobs and hence they could use the money or gold that we have under our possession,” said Bhaskar Pawar, inspector, Borivli GRP. Pawar said with the help of social media they have tracked down addresses of commuters who stay in other states as well as people who have shifted since their property was stolen. GRP officers said till August, 4,018 cases were pending. “But we have tracked down addresses of 3,518 victims and will return their property by September 30. We will ensure that we return property of the remaining 500 cases soon,” said a GRP officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/grp-returns-stolen-goods-worth-2-13-crore-to-local-train-commuters-in-mumbai/story-7F81R3NBo5kPSK5r8G0qpN.html

The accused, while claiming that he had been wrongly implicated in the case, produced before the court the WhatsApp messages in which the 17-year-old girl’s mother had threatened to lodge a rape case against him if he refused to marry her daughter. The court was convinced and granted bail to the accused man. The accused, Tushar Jadhav, is a Diva resident, who works as a ward boy at Nair Hospital. On August 19, he was arrested on charges of raping the minor. Jadhav allegedly befriended the girl in October last year at Nair Hospital and later alledly raped her two months later and then again in February this year at Dadar Chowpatty on the pretext of marrying her. The police booked him on charges of rape under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Advocates Sunil Pandey and AS More, who represented Jadhav, in their written submissions to the court stated that the accused was “trapped” as he has a government job. The girl’s friend had threatened to implicate him in a false case, while the teenager’s mother had threatened to register a rape case on him if he did not marry her daughter. The advocates submitted that their client had secured chat records supporting these claims and placed them before the court. They also pointed out that the first information report (FIR) was lodged after a six-month delay. “The girl had lodged a similar complaint against another boy in the past and this is pure abuse of law,” claimed Pandey. The prosecution had opposed bail for the accused. However, the court observed that the possibility of the accused being implicated could not be ruled out and that no purpose would be served in keeping the accused behind the bars. He was granted bail against a surety of ₹25,000 on the condition that he would not leave the state without prior permission and would not go near the girl or harm the victim or the witnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sessions-court-in-mumbai-grants-bail-to-23-year-old-man-accused-in-teen-s-rape-case/story-sZ9ooDEGxAoJ9j6MtfsrGJ.html

The boy had complained of breathlessness and cough, following which the family physician thought that it could be Covid-19 and asked for few tests. However, chest CT scan confirmed a large tumour of 16cm x 14cm x 12cm size in his right lung. The patient was then admitted to Wockhardt Hospital at Mira Road for tumour removal surgery.Dr Upendra Bhalerao, cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon at Wockhardt Hospital, said the cystic tumour was growing with age and became as big as a football, thus compressing his right bronchus, trachea and adjoining chambers of heart, which in turn led to breathing problems and cough. He added that the tumour was completely removed by thoracotomy without removing any part of his lung. It was found that it was a very rare benign tumour. The patient’s father said, “My son was facing breathlessness and cough, but we were not able to understand the reason behind it. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were delaying a visit to the hospital. But we were shocked when we learnt about the massive size of the tumour. Now my son has been given a new lease of life. He will soon be discharged from the hospital and lead a normal life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-5-kg-lung-tumour-removed-from-mumbai-teen-at-mira-road-hospital/story-GhKYP1r4dnjprXkyk3Y3xL.html

The scholarship exam was conducted across the state on February 16. While results of the exam are usually declared in a couple of months, this year there is no word on when it would be out.“It has been over seven months now and students are eagerly awaiting their results. There is no word from the department on this. If there is a delay, the least we expect is an announcement in this regard,” said the parent of an aspirant from the city. The scholarship exam is conducted in February every year by the Maharashtra State Council of Examination. An official from the education department said the delay was owing to staff shortage due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown. “Due to the lockdown, staffers were not able to scan the answer sheets in time, and hence there is a delay. However, the work of evaluation is almost over and the results should be declared soon,” said a senior official from the department. This year, the scholarship question papers were marred with errors. The mistakes included spelling mistakes, typo errors, translation mistakes etc. The council had later released answer keys for all the papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seven-months-on-maharashtra-education-department-yet-to-declare-scholarship-results/story-MAOrRIUziDNJYirIcko95I.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Dharavi crosses 3,000 Covid cases: BMC data||The number of Covid-19 cases in the densely populated Dharavi, one of India’s largest slums, has crossed the 3,000 mark, with its total at 3,033 on Sunday. Of them, 2,590 have been discharged. The slum, which has seen a rise in cases in the past 10 days, recorded 15 new cases on Sunday. In August, Dharavi had reported 229 Covid-19 cases, compared to 243 until September 19. The congested slums had reported 75 cases between September 1 and 10, while the corresponding figure between September 11 and 19 stands at 168. However, Covid-19-related deaths have gone down on a month-on-month basis there. A total of 288 deaths have been reported in Dharavi until September 14, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) latest data. The maximum number of deaths in Dharavi due to the infection was reported in May. Data showed that the slum cluster reported 69 deaths in April, 161 in May, 33 in June, 10 in July, 13 in August and two until September 14. Dharavi falls in G-North ward of BMC, which also covers Dadar and Mahim. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G-North ward, said, “The number of Covid-19-related deaths has come down. The improved case fatality rate (CFR) suggests that we have been able to detect the viral infection among patients in the initial stages. We are also conducting free testing camps.” He added: “The rise in cases is because of increased testing and unlocking.

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Nobody’s baby: Authorities wash hands of 5 parks at Dera Bassi and Zirakpur, developed at a cost of Rs3 crore||Five years back Rs 3 crore was spent by the municipal councils of Dera Bassi, Zirakpur and the Greater Municipal Area Development Authority (GMADA) on five environment cum nature parks developed by the forest department, but today these are all but ruined due to neglect and apathy.Shockingly, local bodies are not releasing funds to the forest department for the parks as there is absolutely no clarity on which body has to maintain them.According to the forest department, a memorandum of understanding has been signed with the municipal councils (MC) of both Zirakpur and Dera Bassi and the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to provide funds for maintenance.No money has been released as yet, department officials say.“We have signed an agreement with all the three bodies that they will give us the funds for maintenance, but despite writing several letters and sending reminders, we have not got anything. We are still managing maintenance work with help of NGOs and other resources,” said Guramanpreet Singh, divisional forest officer, Mohali.Not aware of agreementCommenting on the matter, Dera Bassi MC executive officer (EO) Jagjit Singh said he was not aware of any agreement with the forest department.Similarly, the EO of Zirakpur MC, Sandeep Tewari, said he could not locate any file of agreement with the department.However, he admitted that the parks were in a bad shape.All five parks were developed on around 80 acres of forest land at Bir Dandrala, Bag Rahatwala and Mauja Madhopur in Dera Bassi and at Peer Muchhalla and Bhabat in Zirakpur. At Peer Muchhalla, GMADA spent around Rs 1.5 crore; for three Dera Bassi parks, the MC spent around Rs 2 crore and for the Bhabat Park MC Zirakpur spent about Rs 1 crore.As work began on the properties, species of trees, herbs and shrubs were planted enthusiastically and tracks laid out for walkers and joggers. Shelters, solar lights, benches, bird houses, parking lots and makeshift toilets were also added.Infrastructure in a shamblesNow, however, most of the lights don’t work. The benches are broken and weeds have overtaken most areas.Locals also allege that antisocial elements find the parks a safe haven.Sukhdev Choudhary, president, joint action committee, Residents’ Welfare Association Zirakpur said it was sad that authorities were not aware of the agreement with the forest department. “These parks have become a safe haven for drug peddlers for the past couple of years. We have even given a memorandum to SDM, Dera Bassi, but nothing has happened so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nobody-s-baby-authorities-wash-hands-off-5-parks-at-dera-bassi-and-zirakpur-developed-for-rs3-crore/story-Bc6nLUQI1NYQitGtyDyGaK.html

The police have invoked section 3 of OSA that defines punishment for Spying.The accused has been identified as Mukesh Singh, 31, a second-year LLB student and a resident of Bhimwadi, Wadala.On September 17, at around 4pm Singh, who was riding a two-wheeler with a friend who was sitting pillion, was caught at the Wadala bridge during a nakabandi as he was not wearing a mask, did not have a driving license and was roaming out without any important work, despite the lockdown.The police took him to Wadala police station to book him for the breach of laws. “While police were busy doing the formalities, Singh allegedly started filming the police procedures using his phone. A policeman caught him in the act and in the presence of two Panchas seized his cell phone and found a recorded video clip of the police station,” the police complaint states.Singh was then booked under sections 3 (spying) of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 besides section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code and sections 3 r/w 181 (driving without a valid driving licence) of Motor Vehicle Act. The complainant is a constable Shantaram Khade who was on the Nakabandi duty.Singh however, was not arrested and allowed to go home after he was served with a notice.Ganesh Shinde, deputy commissioner of police (Port zone) confirmed the development and said that the police have registered a case under OSA against the accused as he was supposed to not film police procedures which can involve secrets things. Further investigation in the case is on.Former IPS officer and advocate YP Singh said that making a video at the police station is not a crime as it’s a public place. “If the police have registered a case under the Offical Secrets Act against someone for video graphing the police station or police procedures then it’s a misuse of the law. That person can file a case against the police. Concerned policemen can be prosecuted for filing a false case. The person can file a case against the police under section 211 of the Indian Penal Code and can even demand civil compensation,” YP Singh said.When called the accused Singh, his phone was switched off and could not be reached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/law-student-booked-under-official-secrets-act-for-making-video-inside-police-station-in-mumbai/story-Fk5nESnLahF9nmJ6RufsnI.html
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||15% teacher’s posts lying vacant in Chandigarh govt schools: Pokhriyal in Lok Sabha||About 15% posts of teachers of all cadres, including junior basic training (JBT) teachers, trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and others, are lying vacant in Chandigarh schools, revealed the data provided by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in the Lok Sabha on a question regarding such vacancies in various states and UTs. There are 5,797 sanctioned posts of teachers in Chandigarh of which 872 are vacant. The national average is 17.1%. Among the UTs, Chandigarh has the fifth highest percentage of vacancies. While addressing the issue, education minister Pokhriyal said, “The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and vacancies arise after they retire.” President of joint action committee of government schoolteachers of Chandigarh, Bhag Singh Kairon, said, “The number of vacancies has increased over the years as the age of retirement has been fixed at 58 for teachers and no extension is given. After 1992, not even a single regularised post graduate teacher has been appointed, so if the number of vacancies rises further, students will have to suffer.”UT Cadre of Education Employees’ Union head Swarn Singh Kamboj said, “Although teachers were recruited in 2009 and 2015, the rate is not high enough as compared to the teachers retiring. Many more teachers are set to retire at the end of this month. The education department has to make a new recruitment for each teacher that retires. Teachers get burdened with extra duties if there aren’t enough of them.”Assuring a prompt action, director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, “We have recently appointed around 800 teachers under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The appointment of post graduate teachers is also in the pipeline and we would soon be recruiting such teachers after a period of around 30 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/15-teaching-posts-lying-vacant-in-chandigarh-govt-schools-pokhriyal-in-lok-sabha/story-8nQOPJNx6fCvDZKK55NGhL.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Amid Covid, 6 teachers ask V-C to postpone PUTA poll, others oppose call||Several Panjab University (PU) faculty members have in a letter urged vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar to ensure that the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) elections are postponed due to the steep rise in Covid-19 cases in the city.Six teachers have written to the V-C and registrar asking for delayed elections of office bearers of the PU’s teachers’ body, scheduled for September 25 and 26.To observe safety rules during the pandemic, the polls in which more than 600 faculty members are eligible to vote, will be staggered.In their letter, the six lecturers urged the university administration to intervene in the matter as the elections were being held “physically”. V-C can ‘intervene’They said that the large number of teachers had been concerned about the matter and wanted the polls delayed. “It is expected that the University should interfere as PUTA is recognised by the authorities of Panjab University and not registered under any legal act to allow the concerned teacher any other redressal. So the whole responsibility in case of any lapse falls on Panjab University,” reads the letter.Dr Priyatosh Sharma, one of the signatories, said, “Many teachers are of the view that they will not vote if the elections are being held amid the pandemic. Many persons have been infected on campus in the recent past and we are witnessing a rise in Covid-19 positive cases in city.”Staggered electionsHowever, according to the strategy chalked out by the returning officer for the polls, voting will be carried out at two venues, the English auditorium and the evening auditorium. Different departments will be given one of the four time slots – starting from 8.30am to 11.30am and going up to 3.30pm to 5pm to prevent overcrowding.Attempts to derail PUTAHowever, many faculty members are against the postponement request, with the team led by Mritunjay Kumar and Amarjit Singh Naura, contesting the polls, alleging in a statement that a “campaign” was underway to cancel the elections and efforts made to render the body dysfunctional. “We appeal to the community to discourage all those who have sided with the authorities to derail PUTA elections 2020 and ensure that maximum voting takes place,” the team members said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-covid-6-teachers-ask-v-c-to-postpone-puta-poll-others-oppose-call/story-7FaQbBPogTd2sTZcWIPCjJ.html

The municipal corporation (MC) had handed over the construction work to the railways after building a retaining wall, following which the railways filled the approach slabs in the first week of September.Railways’ contractor Gurdeep Singh said the base surface was laid on Saturday, and the process of laying the top layers will be completed in four days.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu last week had announced that the project will be completed by Gandhi Jayanti on October 2.The railways is expected to take another week to complete the construction of the damaged bridge, following which MC will complete work on the approach road.Conceived in 2016, the project to repair a damaged portion of the bridge (which leads to Bharat Nagar Chowk) stayed in limbo for two years as the railways refused to pool in money for it.After MC handed over Rs 24.3 crore to the railways, construction finally began in 2018, with a deadline of June 30, 2019. But since then, it missed four deadlines – December 2019, March 2020, June, August 15 and September 15.This year, the project was mostly delayed due to the closure of bitumen plants amid the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/railways-starts-laying-road-on-jagraon-bridge-in-ludhiana/story-u3Ds9SLGHuPRolM5pNxLlI.html

The PEC senate members are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the flexibility in curriculum for the engineering students. The proposal is in its preliminary stage. PEC is likely to offer humanities and social sciences courses with a choice of five to six subjects to its engineering students of the December batch. However, the subjects have yet to be finalised.PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi said, “We are of the view that there should be flexibility in curriculum for the engineering students. In the upcoming meeting of the senate, structure of the courses will be discussed.”Multidisciplinary subjects are being introduced in line with the provision of new education policy. However, PEC would need the approval from its governing bodies before introducing such courses. The proposal will be discussed with all stakeholders, including the department and institution heads, and the view of faculty of other institutes will also be taken so that only beneficial courses are introduced. PEC is even planning to hire two to three faculty members for the multidisciplinary courses from the internal budget of the institute as no extra funds will be available this time.PEC offers eight BTech courses and 14 MTech courses to over 3,000 students. This has come at a time when the deemed to be university is gearing up for its centenary celebrations next year and preparing a proposal to get the status of a centrally funded institute, such as Indian Institutes of Technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pec-senate-meet-structure-of-upcoming-multidisciplinary-courses-to-be-discussed/story-gF4zJRQSTmUroixTkN8A1M.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Passing of two farm bills in Rajya Sabha triggers protests in Ludhiana||The passing of two contentious farm bills in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday spurred protests by farmers in various parts of the district. Farmers organisations in Samrala, Khanna and Jodhan also burnt the effigies of the central government while raising slogans against the legislations – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.In Samrala, farmers took out a mock funeral procession to condemn the government’s alleged anti-farmer moves. Members of various Bhartiya Kisan Unions displayed anti-farmer bills and anti-government slogans at the entrance of various villages. “Jehra kisana naal kharu ohi pinda which varu (Only those who stand by farmers will be allowed to enter the villages),” read the slogans. “Farmers are witnessing overwhelming support from all sections of society. Sportsmen, art and cultural organisations and various NGOs have also stood in our support. Besides, even farmer organisations from the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states are united with us in our cause,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal). Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal), said, “As many as 31 unions have united to oppose the bills. Several business organisations have also backed our bandh call for September25.” ‘Sunny Deol should resign’Lakhowal demanded that following the lead of Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Gurdaspur MP Sunny Deol should also resign to support the farmers. “Deol’s statement that the ordinances were a boon for the farmers is highly condemnable. He was projected as the son of a farmer ahead of the elections, which helped him defeat senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar. Now, he has forgotten that it was farmers who backed him in the 2019 elections. Despite hailing from a farming background, Deol has failed to understand the pain of farmers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/passing-of-two-farm-bills-in-rajya-sabha-triggers-protests-in-ludhiana/story-oiqGEViLCHvLnMRLJWcxIN.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana cricket body polls to be held on October 11||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) in a recent judgement ruled that elections to the Ludhiana District Cricket Association (LDCA) will be conducted on October 11. The polls, which are being conducted after 17 years, will be held under the supervision of former HC chief justice Virender Jain.Former Punjab Ranji captain Inderjit Singh Malhi and other state and national cricketers had filed a petition in the HC in 2018 demanding that LDCA polls be held. They said the polls should be held according to the stipulations laid down by the Lodha Committee and as approved by the Supreme Court. However, the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) argued that the recommendations were not binding on district cricket associations. The PCA also told the court that a retired Punjab or Haryana election commissioner would be more befitting to be an observer than the Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC).The petitioners, however, observed that the DC is the ex-officio chairperson of the LDCA and a non-voting member. They further argued that the LDCA will not have to pay the DC. However, the PCA said it preferred to pay for an observer.After hearing detailed arguments, the HC appointed the former chief justice as observer and ruled that any objections by any party during the polls will be decided on by the observer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-cricket-body-polls-to-be-held-on-october-11/story-sfcucJjAAWKJXSt5Kx3S8H.html

Last year, six schools from the district had sent in innovative ideas. Only 142 of 14,637 schools in Punjab have sent nominations this year. A district-wise nomination list shared by the department of science and technology with the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) shows that while nominations were received from 16 districts, six districts did not send in any innovative idea. To ensure that majority students from Classes 6 to 12 send nominations for the award, the SCERT director has written to all district education officers (secondary) and school principals to ask science and mathematics teachers to guide students and send in nominations before September 30. Those selected will be awarded ₹10,000 for their projects and will be asked to participate at district, state and national level exhibitions. There are 536 middle, high and senior secondary schools and 80 CBSE-affiliated schools in the district.District education officer (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur said, “Students from our district participate in all competitions. I have directed teachers to ensure maximum students pitch innovative ideas for this award.”Schools can register themselves on http://www.inspireawards-dst.gov.in and can email inspire@nifindia.org in case of queries.What is Inspire Awards-MANAK? It is an initiative to foster a culture of innovation and creative thinking among school students to address societal needs through science and technology. The objective is to expose talented students to science at an early age (10-15 years or Standard 6-10) and help towards building a critical human resource pool for strengthening and expanding science and technology system and increase the research and development base. The target is to get original technological ideas and innovations rooted in science and societal applications that solve daily life problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-ludhiana-schools-sent-nominations-for-inspire-awards-manak-this-year/story-E78AJyMb9jtlx5WzZZTfXN.html

20-09-2020||City||Politicos oppose partial reopening of schools in J&K amid grim Covid statistics||The J&K administration’s decision to re-open schools for senior students amid the sudden spike in Covid cases and deaths in the union territory has drawn flak from the political quarters.The decision has come at a time when the health infrastructure has nearly collapsed in the UT, especially in Jammu district, due to the massive surge in virus cases.Political parties, including the BJP, have said the move could be disastrous.Former minister and senior Congress leader Raman Bhalla has asked the administration to review its decision to reopen schools amid the surge in Covid-19 cases and high mortality rate.“There is widespread resentment against the school education department. Parents are aghast and many believe the decision is not only idiotic but will prove extremely dangerous. What is the logic of opening schools when every day more than 1,500 people are testing positive for Covid-19. How can we put the life of our children at risk,” asked Bhalla.“Expecting school children to adhere to social distancing and follow safety protocols when top officers and doctors too are falling prey to the deadly virus, is nothing but idiocy,” added Bhalla.J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina said, “Though the government has taken all preventive measures like face masks, sanitisers and social distancing, people are apprehensive because Covid infection is spreading rapidly. I too feel the situation is not apt for reopening schools.”“In the absence of healthcare facilities in Jammu, people are not getting proper treatment, and opening schools at such a stage will be hazardous and amount to risking the safety of children. The government should act responsibly and postpone the same,” said National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana.However, principal secretary school education Dr Asgar Hassan Samoon said, “Centre has issued certain guidelines and therefore schools are being re-opened only for senior students of classes 9 to 12, that too, for consultation with teachers. Only 50 percent of the teachers have been mobilised.”Samoon informed that everything was being done in strict accordance with the guidelines issued by the Union home and health ministries, adding, “It is a voluntary exercise. The students who feel they need in-person lessons from teachers can visit their schools. Online education will continue as before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/politicos-oppose-partial-reopening-of-schools-in-j-k-amid-grim-covid-statistics/story-qOirTLE10vfNQ62mcX8DTK.html

SPPU had earlier issued online forms to final year students to choose their preferred mode of examination- online or offline- wherein 85 per cent of students chose the online mode and rest opted for offline. This 15 per cent makes up around 50,000 students, who have opted for the offline mode of examination and hence, SPPU identified these centres. “For offline mode, the exams will be conducted through Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) exam method. We have accordingly identified 50 centres which are affiliated colleges with SPPU in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar district wherein these exams will be conducted. Students will have to choose a nearby centre to appear for the exam and soon we are going to issue online forms for it. All the colleges and centres are been given necessary instructions to conduct the exams with utmost safety of the students,” said SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar. Of the total 50,000 students appearing through offline mode of examination, 22,000 students are located in Pune district. The others are from various districts who can choose their nearest examination centres. Students, however, still prefer cancellation of exams or giving exams through assignments. “Most of the students who are studying at SPPU or any other affiliated colleges come from outside Pune and from across Maharashtra. As students are from rural areas and their economic condition is weak, they do not have electronic gadgets and can’t afford to travel back to Pune to give exams. SPPU should think of other options like giving subject-wise assignments to students and evaluate their marks on the basis of the assignment. In both the cases, online and offline students specially from the rural areas are suffering a lot,” said Kamlakar Shete, a final year student. The written exams will start from October 1 and for the backlog students exams it will be held from October 1 to 9 while for regular students, the written exams will be held between October 10 to 30. Both these exams will be of 50 marks with multiple choice questions (MCQ) for a duration of one hour. The detailed stream and subject-wise schedule of the examination will be declared soon by the SPPU examination department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-identifies-50-centres-for-conducting-offline-exams/story-cH2jST7UiyVmjK4s93imJI.html

It meant that all the staff and officers posted at a prison would not be able to go out for a month. “Even the jail staff who lived in nearby quarters were not allowed to go home fearing he/she may bring the contagion in the prison. The staff was on rotation every month,” the officer said. After this, restrictions were imposed for new prisoners.

Till date over 14,000 testing (RT-PCR) of prisoners have been done,” the officer added.Other measures such as encouraging prisoners for Yoga and exercise and enhancing nutritional value of the food given to prisoners to boost their immunity, were also taken, the officer said.Statistics till September 19, 2020Prisoners:Tests done - 14,252Covid positive - 2,011Recovered - 1,616Death - 06Staff:Tests done - 2,507Covid positive prisoners - 416Recovered - 358Death - 04||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-cases-among-prisoners-in-maharashtra-jails-breaches-2-000-mark-no-fatalities-since-six-weeks/story-TFabLhL1KmRjJEXXFCDI4H.html
20-09-2020||Lucknow||UP govt mulling ordinance to check forcible religious conversions||The Uttar Pradesh government is mulling to promulgate an ordinance to check ‘forcible, coerced and allurement-induced religious conversions, including ones in the name of love’, said a senior state government official.The government has already studied in detail the proposal for the ordinance pending with it as the UP Law Commission had submitted a draft legislation ‘Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019’.The proposal is once again attracting attention after the Kanpur police recently set up an SIT (Special Investigation Team) to look into reports of ‘love jihad’ in the Kanpur area.“I understand some work has gone into it at the government level,” said UP Law Commission chairman justice Aditya Nath Mittal on Friday. He had submitted the 268-page report, along with the draft legislation, to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on November 21, 2019 after working nearly six months on it.Justice Mittal’s report, along with draft legislation, suggests provisions for punishment in cases of forcible, coerced, allured religious conversions and the power to the civil court to declare a marriage null and void if it was solemnised for religious conversion as its primary purpose.It also suggests making a provision for a person to submit a declaration to the district magistrate, a month before his/her conversion and a similar declaration from the priest (pujari, maulvi, priest) about the execution of that conversion.Justice Mittal, in November 21 last, had said that in December 2017, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had suggested a new law for preventing forcible conversion and that any re-conversion should not be considered an offence. After that, the commission worked on the report.Justice Mittal had then said: “We submitted the report and the draft bill of the Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2019 to the CM. The report is against the forced, coerced, fraudulent, allured conversion and not against any willful conversions.”The report, including the draft legislation, was prepared after researching pre and post-independence laws in India and the neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.It said states like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand had made special laws to ban conversions by force, fraud, marriage or allurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-mulling-ordinance-to-check-forcible-religious-conversions/story-JIQMx4rSviFvptoZTaCHWP.html

It will be of the same size as that of the Babri mosque. The shape of the mosque may be completely different from that of other mosques. It may be square-shaped like the Kaaba Sharif in Mecca, as hinted by architect SM Akhtar.” To a question on whether the mosque will have no domes or minarets like the Kaaba Sharif, Hussain said it could be a possibility.He said the architect has been given a free hand in this regard.“The mosque will not be named Babri Masjid. It will not be named after any king or emperor. My personal opinion is that it should be called the Dhannipur Masjid,” Hussain said.He also informed that the trust is making its portal so that people can donate for the mosque and the museum, hospital and research centre which will be built inside the complex. Write-ups by national and international Islamic scholars will also appear on the portal.He said some work on the portal is yet to be completed and hence, donation is yet to begin.The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board has formed the IICF, a trust, for the construction of the mosque on a five-acre plot.The state government has allotted the five-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque on the directive of the apex court.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by “kar sevaks”, who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mosque-in-ayodhya-may-be-square-shaped-like-kaaba-trust-official/story-ci94DyISaJa9MzIkigsZdN.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||SAD took ‘U-turn’ on agriculture sector reforms Bills: Punjab Minister||Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Minister BB Ashu on Sunday took a dig at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for taking a “U-turn” on the agriculture sector reforms Bills, adding that their MPs should oppose the Bills in Rajya Sabha and put a united front.He accused Akali Dal of changing their position on the Bills after “realising the seriousness of the matter.”“I salute the power of farmers that made Akali Dal take U-turn and stand in their support. They were advocating ordinances but today they have realised the seriousness of the matter. Their MPs should oppose the Bills in Rajya Sabha and put united front,” the Minister told ANI.This came after SAD leader Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday had said there can be no talks with the Centre until agriculture bills are taken back.“We will go to Punjab now, where party leaders and workers will hold a meeting. Since Shiromani Akali Dal is a party of farmers, we will struggle. There can be no talks with the Centre till the bills are taken back,” Badal had said.Dubbing the SAD chief’s sudden U-turn on the farm ordinances as a cheap gimmick to hoodwink the farming community, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday dared Sukhbir Singh Badal, to quit the BJP-led Centre to prove his party’s sincerity in the matter.Rajya Sabha on Sunday passed the Farmers’ and Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, amid protests by Opposition MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-took-u-turn-on-agriculture-sector-reforms-bills-punjab-minister/story-CkvF0Uk4ptAUK8P1aCtSHL.html
20-09-2020||Pune||Many hsg societies come under PMC’s micro-containment zones||Slums in Pune are now slowly unlocking from the Covid-19 threat and housing societies are new micro-containment zones, according to the Pune municipal corporation (PMC). Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Friday announced new micro-containment zones in 15 regional ward offices and announced a total of 71 micro-containment zones, most of these are housing societies. Earlier, slum pockets had maximum number of Covid-19 cases and were usually locked down as containment zones. However, the last two announcements by the PMC on containment zones has seen many housing societies featuring in the list. The data projects how new Covid-19 positive cases are emerging from housing societies. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sandeep Khardekar, said, “After the city started unlocking, many residents started stepping out of their homes. The PMC had been reporting maximum number of cases from the slum areas in the first phase of the pandemic, however, over the last few weeks, housing societies are reporting a number of positive cases. Many of them prefer to get admitted to private hospitals, but there are not many bed available at private hospitals.”Some housing societies under containment zones:Dhole Patil ward office- Pam Guru Society on BT Kawade road, Laxmi Terrace Society.Dhankavdi- Sahakarnagar ward office- Chandrangan Society, Silver Park Society areas, Telco Colony lane one to seven in Ambegaon, Panchwati Housing SocietyBibvewadi ward office- Mukundnagar area, Gangadham, Vardhmanpura, Isha Emrald society areasYerawada Kalas ward office- Madhuban Society to Malwadi eastern partGhole road ward office- Asha Co-operative housing society on Senapati Bapat roadAhmednagar road- VadgaonSheri ward office- Gera Skyies Society area, Brahma Suncity society areas, Kumar Prime VeraSinhgad ward office- Mango Nest society, Suncity, Manikbaug areaWarje Karvenagar areas- Hingne Home colonyKothrud Bavdhan ward area- Shree Ram Colony, Gadhwe Colony, Vatsalya Nagari, Kumbre Township area.Micro-containment zones: June 2: 63 June 16: 73 June: 24: 74 July 1: 109 July 23: 87 August 1: 75 September 3: 74 September 19: 71||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/many-hsg-societies-come-under-pmc-s-micro-containment-zones/story-W6bccn64qth4Sq4fhArmjO.html
20-09-2020||Pune||PMC claims 15 lakh contacts traced, patients share different story||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has disclosed in its recent report that about 15 lakh contacts of index cases have been traced and screened since March 9, when the first Covid-19 case was reported. These 15 lakh contacts are of index cases which were tracked to break the chain of further infection, claimed the PMC report even as the city’s tally has continued to surge. The PMC claims that it has traced over 15 lakh contacts till 16 September of which four lakh are high-risk contacts, which includes family members mostly or those who might have come in close contact with the person, and remaining 11 lakh were low-risk contacts. A total of 768 teams are on the field doing this work. The average contact tracing is about 12.39 contacts for every index Covid-19 positive person. While the PMC has failed to reach out to contacts in some cases, the lack of communication from private labs and citizens’ resistance to disclose information is proving to be a major hurdle, said public representatives. Vrunda B lives in Katraj and tested positive on August 24. She was contacted by PMC almost 15 days later, when she had completed her home quarantine period, enquiring who had come in contact with her. As she was asymptomatic, Vrunda B was isolated at home after completing due process of filing up a form. Vrunda B said, “I got a call from the civic body after 15 days when I had completed my home isolation period. Before being isolated at home, we completed all the necessary formalities, but were still not contacted by the PMC.” Deepali Yakkundi, a resident of Warje, said, “My child, husband and I tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday morning and as of Saturday night, I have not got any call from the civic body seeking details of those who came in contact with my family. I got my test done from a private lab, but the information has been updated on the Aarogya Setu app which means that the data has been sent to PMC, but we have not got any call from the civic body.” While contact tracing helps health authorities break the chain of the infection, any delay or laxity leads to further spread of the virus. NCP councillor Yogesh Sasane from Hadapsar said that the poor contact tracing mechanism is due to lack of cooperation by private labs. “PMC usually contacts the patient as soon as the report comes and then checks all the places he or she visited in the last eight days or the people they met. The problem comes when the reports reaches late or doesn’t reach the PMC at all. The private labs hide information as requested by the patient which puts many people at risk,” said Sasane. However, in some cases the PMC has been able to gain brownie points in efficiently contacting the person. Rahul Sangoi, a businessman tested positive on September 7 and he said that he got multiple calls from the PMC commissioner’s office, the local ward office and the nearby hospital to check for all the people he might have come in contact in the last eight days. He said, “I also got follow up calls regarding my health daily. My family was also tested.” Vaishali Jadhav, PMC officer responsible for contact tracing, said, “There is a lack of response from people whenever they are contacted. They simply say they have not gone out anywhere in the past one week. In the initial days, they did provide the information, but now the situation is different. Even during the door-to-door survey, they hide information about symptoms. The stigma is so much that some doctors are also being partial towards patients or encouraging such a behaviour. All this leads to poor contact tracing. Also, private labs do not provide information on time. We have sent them show cause notices for late reporting.” Contact Tracing as of September 16 Total Contacts traced: 15, 43, 181 Total High risk contacts: 4, 14, 417 Total Low risk contacts: 11, 28, 764 Average contact tracing: 12.39 Total Teams of field: 768||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-claims-15-lakh-contacts-traced-patients-share-different-story/story-g75iPpCJTq2CD7DGz2Yh8L.html

Prasad has asked Dr NR Biswas, director, IGIMS to send him a proposal for a technological upgrade of various super-specialty departments of the institute. He said though the state government was competent, the Centre would assist in IGIMS’ upgrade push.Also Read: Ahead of elections, Bihar gets six V-Cs, seven P-VCsPrasad said the IVF centre, which he inaugurated on Sunday through a video conference, should become a state-of-the-art facility. He said the public is aware of the fact that infertility is no longer incurable. The centre would offer in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) facility of a woman’s egg and a man’s sperm in a laboratory Petri dish. It would also offer intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) facility, for those having low sperm count and other complications, where IVF is not successful, said Dr Kalpana Singh, additional professor and head of the department of reproductive medicine, IGIMS.The estimated cost for IVF (in vitro fertilisation) is Rs 30,000 and that for ICSI (intra cytoplasmic sperm injection) is Rs 35,000, excluding the cost of drugs, which may go up to Rs 50,000, depending on the patient’s age. In private clinics, the total cost varies and could go beyond Rs 1.5 lakh, while at IGIMS the procedure would incur an expense of less than Rs 1 lakh, she added. Prasad, who represents Patna Sahib constituency in the Lok Sabha, had contributed Rs 1 crore from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for the construction of the two-storied building of the IVF centre. This is the first such government-run facility in Bihar.

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers buying 20,000 tractors a year; experts say encourage cooperatives||Ten lakh farmers in Punjab, one-third (33%) or 3.6 lakh small scale agriculturists among them, bought 20,000 new tractors every year, on average since 2016, data available with the Punjab state transport department shows. Small farmers own less than 5 acre. The cost of a tractor starts from ₹6 lakh, going up to ₹12 lakh. The numbers bought were 19,210 in 2016; 20,327 in 2017; 19,700 in 2018 and 13,645 till September 2020. Experts claim tractors were being bought for residue management machines; social reasons; due to lower tractor availability with co-operative societies and attractive offers being offered on purchase. State agriculture department director Sutantar Kumar Arri said, “The need of the farmers has changed. When we are providing heavy machines for residue management, naturally to deal them they requires big tractors, which is the main reason of buying new tractors. We have conveyed to the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to make new machines compatible with old tractors so that farmers do not bear the extra burden.” Punjab Agricultural University principal economist Sukhpal Singh said of small farmers, 1 lakh small farmers owned tractors. “Of the small farmers who owned tractors, the maximum were under debt or were the ones who have committed suicide. Secondly, they helped the rest of their 2 lakh small farmers in the profession. Smaller farmers faced unfavourable market terms and lower profit.” He added that to prevent their suicide, at least half of the state’s villages must have tractors in co-operative societies.”Punjab co-operative department registrar Vikas Garg said, “The state has 3,500 co-operative societies with just 1,200 tractors with societies. We have been increasing the number of tractors as per demand, with the majority added over the past 2-3 years.” Iqbal Singh, employee of a tractor agency in Moga district, said, “Farmers preferred heavy horsepower tractors, claiming that at least 50-60hp was needed to deal with the new equipment, especially related to stubble burning.” PAU professor, Sarabjeet Singh said social reasons prompted farmers, as they copied other richer farmers. Agricultural expert Ramandeep Singh Mann the state government needed to frame a policy or encourage co-operatives. “There are mainly social reasons behind farmers buying tractors,” he claimed. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said newer machines, especially for crop residue management, required heavy horsepower tractors. “Banks and financial institutions have made loans easy. They are giving Rs 6 lakh loan to a farmer, who owns just two acres. Surplus machinery is not a good trend. Farmer unions need to think about it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-buying-20-000-tractors-a-year-experts-say-encourage-cooperatives/story-wCc6nAX8SO73T0cwLn0b6K.html

20-09-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Silver linings on a dark pandemic cloud as Pune residents look at ‘new normal’ living||Jumbo facilities can be built in a month, not medical staff We have realised that years of ignoring health infrastructure has led to the present situation of hospital bed shortage and inadequate medical facilities. The coronavirus situation has shown us our priorities, and that is definitely a major silver lining. We should have spent at least 6-5 per cent of our GDP (gross domestic product) as opposed to only 1-2 per cent which we’ve been spending all these years. The pandemic has exposed the health infrastructure which was on a ventilator all these years. Rural medical facilities should be boosted now because we have realised their importance. The pandemic taught us to invest in medical manpower and health infrastructure. We are now also talking about Indian Medical Service like the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS), which will be run by doctors who have administrative expertise. Disaster management is now looked at seriously. Hopefully, now more attention will be paid to opening more medical colleges and colleges for nurses and paramedics. The government and, most importantly, the people realised that although a jumbo facility can be made in less than a month, the experts cannot be created overnight to run those facilities. Officers who ran health departments now know the difference between an oxygen bed and a normal bed, and ICU with and without ventilators. Residents are questioning the administration for their health requirements which were not happening earlier. Sanitation workers and Asha workers who have worked tirelessly all these years are finally earning the respect they truly deserve. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, who are paid Rs 30 daily, were generally ignored for the work they do. The pandemic exposed the impartiality with respect to salaries. Sanitation workers are not respected as much as doctors and police personnel. Dr Sanjay Patil Opportunity to ramp up public transport The silver lining right now appears to be that people are talking about using bicycles and enhancing public transport. It would be the real silver lining when it actually happens. The road fatalities and accidents have gone down drastically in this pandemic, but this is a temporary change until we take this conversation ahead. The reduced number of accidents shows that too many vehicles on the roads are the real reason of loss of lives among pedestrians and two-wheelers. The government must use this time to ramp up the public transport system. The reason why people hesitate to use public transport is that it is not reliable. If the civic body provides a reliable option, which is possible now, then people will definitely use public transport. A bus that makes six trips can make eight if traffic is less, thereby reducing congestion and crowded buses. It will also increase the income for the civic body. Reduced private vehicles mean no traffic, lesser accidents, lesser fatalities, less pollution and also boosting public transport which is currently on the verge of a permanent breakdown. People are also talking about using bicycles. Such conversations are a silver lining, and if they could become a reality in near future then nothing like it. Ranjit Gadgil A boon for the environment People have definitely started realising that if given a chance nature will always heal itself. A lot of industries, especially IT companies, have realised that work from home is a culture now which reduces congestion and traffic going in and out of IT hubs like Hinjewadi which was a major trouble for people living there. This also means reduced air pollution, sound pollution and dust pollution which has a direct impact on health. It looks like it will be a permanent change. As temporary good news, people will cut down on fuel consumption caused by unnecessary travelling, weekend and leisure outing in cars and bikes. Water pollution has gone down which was caused due to industries, but obviously this is a temporary change. Tree cutting for many projects, which are now looked at as “unnecessary”, has also saved the environment. Also, another interesting conversation that came out in this pandemic is the loneliness that animals in the zoo might face when they are under “lockdown” for the rest of their lives. Many people did pick up this conversation which was not being talked about earlier. It may not be a major change, but the conversation will likely drive to a change for these animals. Vivek Velankar Focus on hygiene, a welcome change The pandemic has shown us how personal hygiene is important. Simple things like washing your hands for 20 seconds or respiratory hygiene or even public hygiene and cleanliness was not considered important, but now everyone in the family is concerned about it. Whenever I go home from the office, my parents tell me to go straight to the bathroom and get a bath; even my bags and shoes are sanitised. While the fear may seem a bit paranoid, but the fact remains that in this situation only germ-phobic and introvert people are safe. Being extra cautious will only help instead of being careless. I know so many people who were least bothered about this and were later found to be infected. Small things like avoiding touching any surface in public places, be it lift buttons or even our own private vehicles which may have come in contact with so many people. Everyone is a suspected Covid-19 patient now and so personal hygiene is the only vaccine we have as of now. Rahul Bhagat Got some much-needed family time Although I do miss playing with my friends without masks, I have realised that I get more time to play because I save time on travelling to school in the school bus. I also get to spend more time with my family. Even though they are working at home, I can go and talk to anyone anytime I want. I can discuss whatever I feel like which wasn’t possible earlier because my schedule was so tight-packed from school early morning to tuitions and homework. My mom is always at home even though she is working. We take a break every now and then to play some indoor games. I have learnt so many things during this time. I also looked at some old pictures of my mom’s childhood which we got when we cleaned the house together.

20-09-2020||Pune||Post unlocking, surge in anti-corruption cases in Maharashtra||Even as the anti-corruption cases in Maharashtra have gone down during the Covid-19 lockdown period, the tally has increased after reopening post July. This, according to officials, is a result of more and more people stepping out while the economic activity also slowly returning to normalcy.During the month of April, when the state and centre imposed a stringent lockdown, a meagre seven cases were lodged compared to 58 in 2019. Similarly, in May 2020 as many as 30 cases were lodged and 43 arrests took place compared with 76 cases and 106 arrests last year. In June 2020, when curbs were partially lifted, the total number of cases rose to 64 with 87 persons arrests by officials of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). This was followed by 56 cases in July including 78 arrests, 48 cases and 58 arrests in August and 32 cases along with 45 arrests in September till 17th. The statistics reveal that the two lockdown months of April and May saw a reduction of 88 per cent and 61 per cent in Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) cases compared to the similar period in 2019. In June 2019, 80 cases were lodged with 103 arrests with 77 cases including 104 arrests in July, 55 cases and 79 arrests in August and 41 cases and 65 arrests in September last year. From January 1 to September 17, the anti-corruption agency has lodged an aggregate of 435 cases and arrested 498 persons compared with 623 cases and 847 arrests in 2019. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has said that the number of aggregate cases in the state in 2020 have gone down by an average of 30 per cent when compared to 2019. Pune region was at the top of the list of eight ACB divisions between Jan 1 till Sept 17 with as many as 106 cases lodged across the division wherein 153 accused have been arrested. Following the Pune division is the Nagpur division with 71 cases while the third position is occupied by Nashik with 64 cases. According to Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) superintendent of police (Pune) Rajesh Bansode, with offices reopening and people stepping out in a large number, the tally has seen a rise. “During Covid-19 lockdown, there was a less number of working staff everywhere including in the ACB office. So naturally, the cases came down,” said Bansode. The officials arrested by the ACB have been attached to the government departments like revenue, municipal councils, revenue department, police, excise department, zilla parishad, sales tax, education department, prisons, forests and public health department. Besides, other lesser known government departments have also come under the anti-corruption radar of the agency. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has jurisdiction over entire Maharashtra including Mumbai, and its officers exercise the powers and functions and have the privileges of police officers throughout the state. However, for the purpose of administrative convenience, the bureau is divided into eight ranges ACB bureausGreater Mumbai unit - Greater MumbaiThane unit - Thane, Navi Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad-Alibaugh, Ratnagiri and SindhudurgNashik unit - Nashik, Dhule, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon and NandurbarPune unit - Pune, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and SangliNagpur unit - Nagpur, Bhandara, Wardha, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and GondiaAurangabad unit - Aurangabad, Beed, Osmanabad and JalnaNanded unit - Nanded, Parbhani, Latur and HingoliAmaravati unit -Amaravati, Akola, Buldhana, Yavatmal and Washim||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/post-unlocking-surge-in-anti-corruption-cases-in-maharashtra/story-47V58o3XicOmk5xN9mlJfO.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers gear up to block highways amid heavy police deployment||Farmers have started gathering at designated spots following a call to block national and state highways on Sunday to protest against three ordinances of the Union government they label as ‘anti farmer’.Most of the protesters are arriving at the venues on tractor trailers, motorcycles and cars ahead of the schedule beginning at 12 noon and likely to continue up to 3pm.Farmer leaders earlier marshalled protesters, asking them to assemble at the venues in large numbers.According to initial reports, farmer unions will focus on the northern districts of Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Karnal and Kaithal with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni leading the agitation in Yamunanagar by blocking the NH344, near the Milk Majra toll plaza.Charuni has uploaded several video messages on social media urging farmers not to get misled by the government and join the protest.Fake news being spread: Charuni“News is being spread that the national highways will not be blocked. This news is fake and I appeal to the farmers to block all national and state highways, besides Chandigarh-Delhi (NH-44),” Charuni told his supporters in a video message on Sunday morning.However, according to reports received, farmers will not block NH44.Following instructions by the state home department the district administrations has also ensured heavy police deployment to allow traffic to move smoothly on highways.Arrangements made to divert trafficTalking to Hindustan Times, Yamunanagar superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal said, “Our priority will be to convince the farmers and we will request them not to block the highways, but if they do so then we have made arrangements to divert traffic so that commuters do not face problems.”Even as Kurukshetra remained a hot-spot for the farmers, the Haryana government faced flak for a lathicharge on protesters on September 10.Arrangements have been made this time round to ensure such incidents are not repeated, sources have said.Kurukshetra SP Astha Modi said seven points had been identified in the district where farmers were likely to hold protests and block traffic, but the district police had made elaborate arrangements to divert traffic and ensure that the agitation remained peaceful.“We have also planed to divert traffic on NH44 from Pipli to avoid traffic jams as there were reports of protests by a political party in Ambala,” Modi added.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, meanwhile, appealed to farmers to not block the highways. He also invited farmer leaders for talks. In a statement issued late on Saturday night, Khattar said everyone had the right to express views, but maintaining peace in the state was also the prime duty of any government.He said the farm ordinances were entirely in the interest of farmers and it was unfortunate to see the opposition parties blatantly politicising the issue to achieve their vested interests.Farmer leaders, however, said they were not invited for talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-gear-up-to-block-highways-amid-heavy-police-deployment/story-NI7kY9KxoWxDXCuVe2SgRM.html

The campaign was launched last year in a bid to rein in the number of dengue cases and deaths.The participants, including Kerjriwal, pledged that they would devote 10 minutes at 10 am every Sunday for 10 weeks to inspect their homes for stagnant water and clean it to avoid breeding of Aedes mosquitoes and prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases.In 2015, Delhi had recorded 15,867 cases of dengue and 60 deaths. The national capital had recorded 2,036 cases and two deaths last year, according to the data shared by the Delhi government.The CM urged religious organisations, cultural groups and resident welfare associations (RWA) to endorse the campaign.BS Vohra, the president of an umbrella group of RWAs in east Delhi, said, “We shall endorse this campaign. It significantly contributes in creating awareness about fighting dengue. The government should consider launching another campaign to create more awareness about sanitation, social distancing, respiratory etiquettes etc; because of a recent spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-urges-delhi-residents-to-join-anti-dengue-campaign/story-vDcmut18Y0pL313fWSecKJ.html
20-09-2020||Delhi||Announcement of new Delhi BJP team likely by end of September||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is likely to announce its new state team by the end of this month. While the state unit has partially announced its new team in the first week of September with the appointments of district and ward-level in-charge, the announcement of the state-level team was deferred.With other political parties starting preparations for the municipal elections, senior BJP leaders are of the opinion that the work at the grassroot level must start early. The BJP, which has been in power in all the three municipal corporations for the past 13 years, has been under attack from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over its performance.

Former Delhi BJP president and northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari’s tenure—Tiwari was appointed the state chief in December 2016—was extended due to the assembly elections earlier this year, and later due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While the current state unit chief Adesh Gupta took charge in June, he couldn’t announce his team due to the outbreak of the pandemic. In September, Gupta announced the appointment of district and ward-level in-charges. A senior BJP leader said, “Now that he has tested positive for Covid, the process will get further delayed. The new state team is likely to be announced by the end of this month.”Also Read: Election Commission staffer tests positive for Covid-19 in DelhiThe biggest challenge for the BJP, which was limited to single-digit seats in the recent assembly elections, is to regain the lost ground. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 62 seats while BJP got just eight seats in the elections held earlier this year.While the BJP has been out of power in the Delhi assembly, the saffron party has been ruling the three civic bodies for 13 years. Despite perceived anti-incumbency sentiments in 2017, the party won 184 seats, 46 seats more than it had won in 2012, in the three municipal elections.Another senior leader said, “We need to start an aggressive campaign at the earliest. Though we started the dengue awareness campaign in August, the AAP-led Delhi government has started its own campaign. We will have to counter it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/announcement-of-new-delhi-bjp-team-likely-by-end-of-september/story-vfstF7r8LGK8Sw4qC09iiJ.html

The government has been receiving several suggestions for a new name.On Saturday, veteran of Agra’s tourism trade and former president of Tourism Guild of Agra Arun Dang recommended renaming the museum to Agra Museum, and not confine it to any specific dynasty or individual. On Friday, Akhil Bhartiya Jaat Mahasabha demanded the museum be renamed after Maharaja Surajmal, because he and his son Raja Ratan Singh had ruled Agra in the eighteenth century. Also Read: Agra hotels set to welcome tourists as Taj Mahal reopens from September 21Meanwhile, Agra Development Foundation has distanced itself from the renaming controversy, but has demanded that museum should be capable of drawing the attention of tourists. “The museum should host live shows of classical, folk dances, Krishna Leela. Agra’s crafts, including zardozi, sculpture and carpets, should find a place in the museum. There can be miniature models of historical monuments and temples in the region,” KC Jain, the secretary of Agra Development Foundation, suggested. “An auditorium where shows canvas the rich cultural of the heritage city, which was once the capital of the Mughal empire, should be planned. Wax statues of those who have cast their impression in making Agra what it is, should be there too. Sur Sarovar, Chambal sanctuary, Taj nature walk, Bateshwar, etc. could be highlighted,” suggested Jain. “Tourists should be allowed to watch live exhibitions of craft, including inlay work on marble, carpet-making, zardozi-making, glass toy-making, etc. Tourists can also gain knowledge about Agra’s petha and the footwear industry. We can highlight lesser known monuments here so that tourists stay longer to view these sites,” said Pooran Dawar, the president of Agra Development Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-government-receives-suggestions-to-rename-agra-s-mughal-museum/story-IkxV0DhbJcJ549qaFrLr7L.html

The accused was arrested following a DNA test result confirming his involvement in the crime, said police. The arrest was made more than two months after the girl was murdered on July 8 by her father fearing social stigma. The case came to light a day later on July 9, when the girl’s mother-- who lives separately from the victim’s father-- filed a complaint alleging foul play in her daughter’s sudden death. During the probe, police had exhumed the girl’s body and sent it for post-mortem examination which confirmed her pregnancy and murder. Later, her father was arrested for murdering her on July 25 but the police was yet to arrest the rape accused. It had collected DNA samples of four suspects for testing and the results were received on Friday. Prahlad Kumar, police inspector investigating the case said, “The accused was the one, whose samples matched. He was then arrested on Saturday under IPC and Juvenile Justice Act for rape, as at the time of the crime, he was a minor.”Kumar said the accused was later presented before the local court on Saturday evening which then sent him to a juvenile correctional facility in Haridwar.“During questioning, he told police that the girl was known to her and often used to visit his house for studies during which he raped her and got her pregnant,” said Kumar.The minor girl lived with her grandparents in the village as both her parents used to live separately in two different nearby villages.

Congress leader Bunty Patel, with 20 others, was booked under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on a complaint lodged by Chaurai, Chhindwara SDM CP Patel on Friday late night, while the name of former Congress MLA Chaudhary Gambhir Singh, who was also participated in the protest, was added on Saturday, said Vivek Agrawal, superintendent of police, Chhindwara. District administration invoked NSA against Congress leader Bunty Patel, who was already facing more than eight criminal cases for voluntarily causing hurt, riots and others, the SP said. The police officer added that Patel attacked the SDM and blackened his face. “Bunty Patel, who claims to be a leader of farmers, had come to gherao the SDM office in Chaurai with others, demanding compensation for flood-affected people on Friday.

20-09-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Left’s tie-up talks with RJD hit, CPI-ML fumes over a ‘raw deal’||The proposed alliance of left parties with the RJD-led grand alliance (GA) in Bihar ahead of state assembly polls has run into rough weather, with the state’s major left party, the CPI- ML(Liberation), now preparing to contest alone.Reliable sources said the CPI-ML leadership was peeved after the RJD offered it only seven to eight seats as against 53 seats it had sought. The party currently has three MLAs, having got 1.5% of the total votes polled in the 2015 assembly polls. “The number of seats offered to us is minuscule and not at all acceptable. We have asked the RJD for a rethink on its offer. But we are now geared up to fight alone in over 53 seats. In case RJD responds positively in coming few days, we will think of adjustment. The ball is in RJD’s court,” CPI- ML(Liberation) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said on Saturday. He said his party had initiated talks with RJD for a broader left unity to defeat the BJP-JD(U) combine. One reason for talks between the two parties falling is that RJD rejected ML’s claim on seats like Ara and Phulwari which the former had won in 2015. “In 2015 polls, RJD was in alliance with JD(U). In 2020, it is contesting with different partners. The 2015 formula of seat adjustment cannot be the criteria for 2020,” Bhattarcharya said. The ML general secretary said his party has a strong cadre base in central Bihar, Mithilanchal, Siwan-Gopalganj and Seemanchal, but RJD was ignoring ground realities. Also read: EC looks at NEET, JEE to prepare for Bihar polls“In the 2019 parliamentary polls, ML had extended support to GA candidates, including RJD candidate, in four places where they polled more than 4 lakh votes. But in rest of the seats, GA candidates fared poorly. Wasn’t it the votes of ML that counted,” he asked. The other two main left parties in Bihar, CPI and CPI-M, are still hopeful of a tie-up with the RJD-led GA but rued the talks were stretching too long. The two parties together are angling for over 50 seats.“We won 26 out of 52 seats we got in 1995 in alliance with RJD . We have given our list of seats to RJD. Our talks with RJD so far is positive,” said Ram Naresh Pandey, CPI state secretary. CPM state secretary Awadesh Kumar said his party would take decision after holding further talks with RJD in coming days. Social scientist Rakesh Tiwary said the GA would suffer a big blow in its attempt to form a larger rainbow coalition against the NDA if ML doesn’t join. “ML is a cadre based party and its support is crucial in many pockets to consolidate secular votes. But it looks an ML-RJD alliance is hard to come by as both have remained opposed to each other for long,” he said. In Siwan, for instance, ML relentlessly fought against incarcerated Siwan strongman and former MP Mohammed Shahabuddin for years. State president of RJD Jagdanand Singh could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-left-s-tie-up-talks-with-rjd-hit-cpi-ml-fumes-over-a-raw-deal/story-clTAnU36noUc2c1wB8lKZP.html
20-09-2020||Lucknow||Heritage receives a blow at Chhota Imambada gate in Lucknow||The Nawabi-era architectural design of the centrally protected Chhota Imambada’s gate has been changed by the local police while carrying out restoration work of the police outpost located within the gate itself, according to officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Hussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) and heritage enthusiasts. For his part, IP Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Chowk area, under which the police outpost comes, said, “The matter is in their knowledge. We have ordered a probe into it.” Nevertheless, officials of ASI, HAT, which owns the structure, and heritage enthusiasts call it a case of extreme illegality and brazen violation of the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) (AMASR) Act, 2010. The Act strictly prohibits construction or renovation within a 100- metre area of a protected monument. “It’s a purely illegal act. We have served notice on the police station to stop the work immediately,” said Manoj Saxena, deputy superintending archaeologist, Lucknow Circle, ASI. Also, the restoration of the police outpost, locally known as Satkhanda police chowki, is in violation of the high court’s order, directing HAT to fund and ASI to ensure restoration of the same gate. Officials with HAT said the illegality first came to light early this week when a group of masons was found busy demolishing the shade of the gate to pave the way for a new one to suit their own requirement and design. “By the time, we got the information and rushed to the spot, the entire shade, all made up of red lakhauri bricks, was demolished by masons. On enquiring, they simply responded that ‘Chowki prabhari sahib ka adesh hai (It is the police outpost in-charge’s order)’,” an official of HAT told HT. The team discovered that it was not the only illegality. “We also found that the interior of the chowki had all changed. In place of old lakhauri walls, there were new cement walls,” the official added. When the officials objected to the illegality, police personnel assured them that they would stop the work immediately and apply for permission for the same, according to officials. “But overnight, they re-started construction work and completed the structure. They got it painted so that it gels with the remaining structure,” the official further said. “Chowki in-charge of Satkhanda chowki that is located in the gate itself is carrying out the restoration of the police outpost, illegally. Also, they are changing the design of the gate to which I strongly objected and got the work stopped,” stated the letter of the property supervisor, HAT, to the city magistrate, who is the secretary of the trust that was formed by King Mohammed Ali Shah in 1839 to meet the religious and charitable needs of the community and to maintain the Nawabi-era structures owned by the trust. Sushil Pratap Singh, city magistrate and secretary of HAT, said, “I am unaware of this illegality. If this is so, we would serve notice and will initiate maximum action against the erring person.” Officials with the trust said that the police outpost was established in the 1990s to maintain law and order in the area, which was very sensitive due to sectarian disputes. Since then, the police outpost had become a permanent feature of the gate. Officials also called it a contempt of the high court order as the matter of restoration of the same gate was pending with the court. Restoration work of the gate was started in 2014 following an order of the Allahabad high court. In compliance with the high court order passed on May 12, 2014, a meeting of officials of the district administration, ASI and directorate of archaeology, UP, was held under the chairmanship of the then principal secretary, department of culture, UP, on May 17, 2014 and it was directed that the restoration work of the eastern gate of Chhota Imambada would be done by ASI and would be funded by HAT. The HC order was an outcome of a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by S Mohammed Haider, a corporate lawyer and heritage activist, who had approached the court in 2013. In the PIL, Haider had sought the court’s intervention for ensuring repair, maintenance and removal of encroachment within the premises of the monuments. The gate’s restoration, however, is still pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/heritage-receives-a-blow-at-chhota-imambada-gate-in-lucknow/story-SO2ePeMpdBcrH6emrLMyTK.html
20-09-2020||Patna||CBI uses new section to oppose Lalu Prasad’s bail||The Central Bureau of Investigation has said that Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad’s sentences in fodder scam cases are not meant to run concurrently as it cited a new section of the law to oppose the Bihar politician’s plea for bail.The agency said Prasad’s conviction falls under Section 427(1), which refers to a case when a person’s sentence runs after one ends. This would effectively lengthen the period of sentence. Prasad, while currently out on bail, has been convicted in six cases related to misappropriation of public funds, each of which have varying sentences. The former Union minister recently sought bail in one of these cases, in which he has been sentenced to five years in prison, saying that he is eligible since he has completed half of the sentence duration. In one of the other cases, with a 3.5 year sentence, he has been given bail on this ground.Citing Section 427(1) would mean that Prasad’s cumulative sentence stretches to 27.5 years, instead of the maximum that has been awarded in one of these cases: 14 years. Prasad’s advocate Prabhat Kumar said, “The court, in last hearing on September 11, had not appreciated CBI’s argument saying that it was a premature stage to raise such contention. The court said the issue would be decided in final hearing of pending appeal petitions.” He added that Prasad’s bail application would next be heard on October 9.Kumar said that fodder scam involves nearly 200 convicts, most whom are involved in many cases. “Some of the accused suppliers were convicted in more than 25 cases and got different terms of imprisonment. If an individual’s total sentence is taken into account, it may be over 100 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/cbi-uses-new-section-to-oppose-lalu-prasad-s-bail/story-GSD8sOOM6HsmcgGodP62SL.html

Speaking to reporters at his residence on Saturday, Vij said that it is the right of every citizen to protest, but “I appeal to all farmer unions to not block the National Highways, in any way.” “The country is going through a pandemic. There are ambulances or people taking Covid positive patients and many are out to buy medicines. So I appeal to farmers to not hamper their way on the highways,” said Vij. Escalating his attack on the opposition parties, Vij said that these parties act as “demons to obstruct good works.” He also said that the Congress party had promised these bills in its manifesto and is instead protesting now. On being asked about SAD’s exit from the union cabinet, Vij said, “Badals are doing their own politics but they should answer why they didn’t leave the cabinet when it (bill) was first presented. Now, when the same bill was presented in the Lok Sabha, they have started playing their time-bound politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vij-appeals-to-farmers-to-not-block-highways-takes-a-dig-at-badals/story-2fT9u8EUDP3OfpupBkATRL.html

Speaking at a function in Sonepat, Nadda said the opposition parties are provoking farmers for agitation in the name of minimum support price (MSP).“I want to make it clear that MSP will stay and these three bills will give another option to farmers to sell their produce outside the mandis. We are not going to scrap the mandi system. If farmers get good price outside, why will they go to mandis. And if the prices are low outside, they will sell their produce on MSP in mandis. We have just given two options to farmers by introducing these bills,” he added.Slamming the Congress, the BJP national president said his party has done what the opposition party had promised in its manifesto.“Modi had brought good days for farmers in Gujarat and now he is implementing the same formula for all farmers across the country,” Nadda added.He also took part in a blood donation camp at Sonepat and distributed spectacles to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/msp-to-stay-new-bills-will-only-help-farmers-nadda/story-uBGXBpzsTlWWbdGPkgGqyK.html

20-09-2020||Mumbai||Rs 137 cr: Amount Navi Mumbai civic body has spent to tackle Covid-19||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), which detected its first Covid-19 case on March 13, has spent Rs 137 cr so far to tackle the pandemic. It has sought an additional Rs 251 cr from the state government to increase the facilities.From having just one single hospital, the Vashi General Hospital, for tackling Covid patients to having 10 Covid care facilities and reserved hospital beds for Covid, NMMC has come a long way.NMMC has 35,364 positive cases till date. Around 3,565 are active while 790 deaths have been reported. Till now 1,70,575 people have undergone Covid-19 test, of which 67,071 people are RTPCR test and 103,504, rapid antigen test.Abhijit Bangar, NMMC commissioner, said, “With the increasing number of cases, we have faced scarcity of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, with over 40 per cent ICU beds occupied by patients from cities like Thane, Kalyan and Raigad.“Our focus is to increase the ICU beds and also beds with ventilators. Till now, the state government has provided us Rs 10 cr during the pandemic. We have requested for Rs 251 cr more. Currently, the NMMC is using funds from its own coffers. If needed, we will also procure the budget of other heads for health because right now the priority is to handle the Covid situation.”Navi Mumbai has increased contact tracing and testing that has helped bring the doubling rate of the positive COVID cases to 42 days. “Isolation of positive patients and timely treatment has brought down the mortality rate from 3.3% to 2.19% while the recovery rate has gone up from 50 per cent to 87 per cent. Attempts are on to bring down the mortality rate further. Management of containment area enforcement is very crucial as many people have now started taking the pandemic very lightly. Hence, we have planned Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) for which we will hire around 100 ex-army men to keep a check on people flouting norms and penalise them,” Bangar said.Additional Commissioner of NMMC, Sujata Dhole, said, “We have been increasing the facilities as per the rise in cases and need of the hour. By March end, the total number of cases was still in two digits and the facilities we had were the Vashi General Hospital and Swami Vivekananda Multipurpose Hall at Sector 14 in Vashi. In April, we had acquired India Bulls flats in Panvel and by May, we started using them.”By April end, the doubling rate of the positive cases changed from 11 days to six days. Keeping the chances of spread in mind, NMMC had increased the capacity of isolation centres.After acquiring 3,000 flats at India Bulls, the civic body kept increasing the smaller facilities in Koparkhairane, Airoli, Belapur, Nerul and Vashi. “On August 3, we entered a MOU with DY Patil hospital for ICU beds. On September 10, we started three more facilities in Turbhe, Airoli and Turbhe,” AMC Dhole added. From July end, the average daily cases reported crossed 300 and by August end, it crossed 400.Navi Mumbai activist Anarjit Chauhan said that NMMC has failed in providing adequate beds to the patients. He said, “As far as RT-PCR testing is concerned, NMMC is doing a good job but I am against the rapid antigen test. It is a test that even US government doesn’t recommend. It is nothing but wastage of tax payer’s money. Now, NMMC has started door to door rapid tests and it is a huge waste of time, resources and money. The staff involved in the antigen test could be very well assigned to do something productive.” He claimed to get quite frequent calls from people to help them arrange the beds. “Private hospitals do not want patients via government quota and are waiting for a direct patient who will pay their hefty bill. There have been so many violations by private hospitals in terms of overcharging and denying beds but not many has been penalised yet. The private hospitals are not even implementing the government schemes for the Covid treatment that they should be. NMMC should look into the black marketing of private hospitals more stringently,” Chauhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rs-137-cr-amount-navi-mumbai-civic-body-has-spent-to-tackle-covid-19/story-TN6fqJ6RD3lDQGc4VGz7qM.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||12,000-15,000 persons tested at Thane station for Covid, causes chaos||The mismanagement of the antigen testing centres set up at the Thane Railway Station to test every arriving passenger has led to a complete chaos at the premises over the last ten days.Migrants arriving in long-distance trains have to wait in long queues with no social distancing norms followed to get tested. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has set up four antigen testing counters at the railway station, which are insufficient to test the large crowd gathering at the station.A TMC officer requesting anonymity said, “On an average, there are two to three long-distance trains that arrive daily at Thane station. The total number of passengers in these trains are anywhere between 12,000 and 15,000 daily. We test each of these passengers. Although it is time consuming, we ensure they get their reports and those tested positive are taken to the Covid Care Centres at Kharegaon or Bhayanderpada.”Dinesh Chauhan, migrant worker from Patna who arrived at Thane Railway Station on Tuesday, expressed that there were so many people waiting for the test at the same time that it becomes difficult to maintain social distancing.Chauhan, who works in a construction company, added, “Even after taking down all personal details including contact address and numbers, they do not let us go until the reports have arrived. It is very tiring after travelling for more than 24 hours to wait for almost two hours to get tested, and again wait for half-an-hour to 45 minutes till the reports arrived.”Shankar Kumar, 42, a resident of Murshidabad in West Bengal who returned to Thane on Friday, said, “We had to wait for more than an hour in a queue to get tested, after which we were asked to wait till the reports came. There was hardly enough space to maintain social distancing. Even in the train we were made to sit at a distance between each other, but over a period of time people started moving around and there was hardly any social distancing. Although I was tested negative, I came to know that one of the co-passengers whom I had spotted in the same compartment has tested positive. I am worried now and will have to strictly follow isolation for a few days even if it means no income.”Medical workers at the railway station are also overworked. “We have to ensure that those who have tested do not flee, some even end up giving wrong addresses, making it difficult to trace them. In order to ensure that social distancing was maintained, we have to indulge in crowd management as well. While testing, we have to ensure we put the samples in the right vials and proper details of the passengers are also noted,” said a medical volunteer who is at the antigen testing counter at Thane railway station.Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC, said, “We expect people to cooperate and follow social distancing rules. We have already started levying a fine for those who are not following these rules. We do not have adequate manpower to manage the crowd. People need to follow the mandatory wearing masks, social distancing and hand sanitisation, and learn to live with Covid.“Most of our medical staff are focused on the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ survey as every team requires someone from a medical background. Moreover, we have to ensure that our current practices of having fever clinics and other testing centres are not disturbed. With more screening, we need an additional number of fever clinics as well,” added Sharma.Meanwhile, twelve officers working at the station to test the migrants, although asymptomatic, have tested positive. “Twelve of my staff working near the station area are positive despite taking various measures. They are under isolation and we have to manage alternative staff for Covid duty. This is added pressure. We are short-staffed yet trying our best to control the pandemic,” added Sharma. Sources claim that 150 to 200 migrants at the station test positive on a daily basis and this was the main reason for increase in the number of cases in Thane.A senior TMC official claimed, “Overall positivity of Thane city on a daily basis is hovering between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. However, the positivity rate of those coming from the station is more than 10 per cent. We do not wish to create an insider-outsider divide within the city as all those who come from other states are essential labourers who contribute to the progress of the city. Moreover, this is a small number when compared to the many that travel by road into the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-000-15-000-persons-tested-at-thane-station-for-covid-causes-chaos/story-8EeieqpGRapdCbwnZkunAL.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||4 held in connection with murder at Morbe dam near Panvel||Two days after the body of a woman was found in a dam at Morbe village of Panvel, Panvel Taluka police have arrested four accused in connection with her murder.On September 16, a decomposed body of a woman was found at Morbe dam. “The body was completely decomposed and the face was beyond recognition. There was no missing person’s complaint registered anywhere. With the help of the bangles she was wearing and a tattoo on her hand, she was identified as a 27-year-old woman from Akurli who stayed with her seven-year-old daughter,” senior police inspector Ashok Rajput from Panvel Taluka police station said.On investigation, it was revealed that she was in a relationship with Shashikant Patil (32) from Koproli village. “We found that from the day the body was found in the dam, the accused had fled the village,” Rajput said. With the help of technical evidence, three accused were nabbed from a hotel in Satara while the fourth accused was later arrested from Panvel.Apart from Patil, the other arrested accused have been identified as Ravi Thakur (23), Akshay Panchal (25) and Nilesh Phadke (29).An year ago, the deceased had lent Rs 2 lakh to Patil, which he had not returned. The lady had now started asking the money back, leading to many fights between them. “The deceased had abused Patil, irking irked him and he wanted to take revenge. Hence, he got his friends into confidence by offering alcohol and planned to kill her,” Rajput said.On September 9, Patil, Thakur and Panchal went to her residence and asked her to get into Patil’s car. Since she knew them, she got into the car and then they slit her throat with a knife. The trio then undressed her and tied the whole body with an iron wire and rope. The body was then tied into a 48kg weighing cement block and drowned into the dam.According to the police, the accused thought that the fishes might eat the body and hence undressed her. The fourth accused, Panchal, had helped the accused to flee the village and was arrested later from Panvel.The daughter of the deceased was also with the accused. The accused ran away with the victim’s daughter after the murder.“ All the accused have been kept in police custody till September 25,” Rajput said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-held-in-connection-with-murder-at-morbe-dam-near-panvel/story-aVPIFGZlCfkHv2vs7wpj3J.html

20-09-2020||Mumbai||New traffic signals in place of 18-year defunct ones in Kalyan-Dombivli||Almost 18 years after the old signals in the twin cities became defunct, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) finally started installation of new traffic signals.However, work is going at snail’s pace as the KDMC, which had earlier claimed to install 10 signals by April, has till date installed only five.Moreover, commuters claimed that none of these five signals has been installed at any of the major junctions, which were supposed to be taken on priority basis.The KDMC first installed signals in the twin cities two decades ago. However, none of these signals were maintained and became defunct.Under the smart city project, the civic body has installed signals at five locations in Kalyan, while 15 more are on the cards in the coming months. The signals, however, have not started functioning full time and the work of synchronisation of these signals is under way.Suraj Pawse, 39, a commuter who takes Durgadi Chowk daily to connect to Bhiwandi for work, said, “I can see signals installed at some of the chowks that are not that congested compared to the Durgadi Chowk, Patripool, Subhash Chowk in Kalyan (W). Priority should be given to such spots that are badly congested most of the times.”Presently, installation work at Prem Auto Chowk, Adharwadi, Khadakpada and Sandip Hotel Chowk in Kalyan (W) and Chakki Naka in Kalyan (E) is done, while inspection work is under way.  The five signals are presently being operated under trial basis. Their full-fledged operations will be done after nod from the traffic police. More signals, CCTVs on cards Tarun Juneja, executive engineer, KDMC, said, “The work of installing the signals is under way in full swing at different locations. We have already installed them in five prime locations while the rest of the signals will be installed soon. We will also take up the work of installation of signals in the congested areas. The signals here were not fitted earlier as a few infrastructure projects were being carried out in these areas.”Along with the signals, the civic body will also install CCTV cameras at these prime locations.  “One of the major reasons to have both signals and CCTV cameras installed is to not only control the traffic movement but also keep a track on the crime and traffic violations in the city,” said Juneja.The contractor for the work was appointed in February this year. The civic body claimed that it will finish the installation of all the signals by January 2021.Further, the signals will be maintained by the contractor for five years and the cost of the entire project is estimated at Rs125 crore.The CCTV footages will be monitored by the KDMC officials in an office set up at their headquarters and police headquarters in Kalyan through integrated control command centre.   “While the installation at five locations is completed, these signals will start functioning once the traffic police give their nod,” added Juneja.In a survey initiated jointly by the Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL), KDMC officials and the traffic police last year, the officials identified 20 traffic junctions for the installation of traffic signals and 300 locations where they have plans to install a total 870 CCTV cameras.Dilip Ugale, assistant commissioner of traffic police, Ulhasnagar, and presently also in-charge for Kalyan traffic unit, said, “A meeting was scheduled last Friday but was cancelled. Hence, the operation of the installed signals was not finalised. We will finalise it soon. Those signals that are fully installed and finalised will be operated in the city for traffic management. The signals will definitely help improving the traffic situation in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-traffic-signals-in-place-of-18-year-defunct-ones-in-kalyan-dombivli/story-1oDTXNgrDV5dW7VWb0qCrK.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||39-year-old social worker comes to rescue of 30-plus students in Ulhasnagar hamlet||More than 30 students from a small hamlet in Ulhasnagar with no access to the new digital mode of learning are no more devoid of education for the last two months. Thanks to a good Samaritan in Ulhasnagar, these students are now being given quality education minus the electronic gadgets.Since March, schools have gone digital, adapting to online learning to reach out to the students who cannot attend school. However, not all children have access to smartphones and WiFi.It’s the same story for the 30-plus students from a small hamlet Asele Pada in Ulhasnagar, for whom education stopped until Sunil Ahire, a 39-year-old social worker took matters in his own hands. He started teaching the students, whose parents work as domestic help, vegetable vendors, daily wagers or auto rickshaw drivers, in his free time to ensure they get the education they deserve.Ahire said, “Parents of these children mostly go out to work taking their phones along. Thus, there is no access to online education to these children. I work with an NGO and do most of my work from home due to lockdown. I came to know about these children missing out on online classes. So, instead of sitting at home, I decided to teach them.”Ahire, who has a Masters in Sociology, expressed that it was difficult to convince the students to come to him or trust him.“The students are from Classes 5 to 7, from semi-English and Marathi-medium schools. Most of them who joined my classes are girls as boys were still unwilling to give up their free time to studies.”He took the first lecture in the open to attract other children to his classes. Two days later, seeing these classes, a villager offered them his house as he was leaving for his native. This made it easier for Ahire, as he could take classes even in heavy rains. Ahire watches online sessions of each of the children and then teach them according to their syllabus.The parents are elated since their children started learning again. Sachin Lokhande, 36, an electrician from the village, leaves house early in the morning and returns late at night. He said, “I have two daughters. The elder one is in Class 7 and the other in Class 4. I am the only one using a smart phone. Hence, both used to skip online school. However, for the last two months, Ahire had started teaching my girls and we are happy that they are seeking education.”Maya Sawant, 26, who has three daughters, was also facing the same issue. Her husband is into furniture business and is out most days. “The only smart phone we have is with my husband. All the three girls had online sessions at same or different times. With no phone, they were missing their classes. Now, they’ve started attending Ahire’s classes and we are happy they spend time studying,” added Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/39-year-old-social-worker-comes-to-rescue-of-30-plus-students-in-ulhasnagar-hamlet/story-p42By8YrldqzYMvWFRivFP.html
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||No long-term care home in Chandigarh for adults with mental health problems||“I am a cancer survivor and the mother of an adult with mental illness. In June 2020, my husband passed away due to cancer. I spend sleepless nights worrying about my son’s future after I am gone,” says a senior resident of the city. Her son cannot live independently. In a city with an ageing population, many emerging voices are demanding community (group) homes with long-term assisted living for persons with mental health issues. Surprisingly, despite having provisions for sheltered accommodation in the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, the union territory (UT) has no such facility. At least 70 city-based residents have written over a hundred emails and letters. Some have met the UT administrator and adviser, but have received only ‘sympathy and assurances’ in return, they say. “We live in a soulless city,” says a 62-year-old man (name withheld) who is looking after his ailing mother and autistic son. “He is 29 years old, but mentally he is only 14. He needs a little hand-holding. Someone has to take care of his medicines, meals, cleanliness and help with daily chores,” says the father. Administration needs to be ‘more sensitive’ An 80-year-old man who is the only caregiver to his son with bipolar and obsessive compulsive personality disorders, recounts his attempts over the last 20 years to make the UT administration “more sensitive” to the needs of the mentally ill. He has met three UT administrators and asked for setting up of care homes. “They sympathise but do nothing,” he rues. Dr Sandeep Grover, professor, psychiatric department, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, stresses on the need for a group home. The Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 has provision of half-way homes, sheltered accommodation and supported accommodation under rights of persons with mental illness, he adds. “We need long-term stay homes for persons who have improved from mental illness or those who are not very sick but have some residual symptoms,” Dr Grover adds. Referring to a survey he helped conduct on the need for long-term stay homes, Grover says, “A majority of psychiatrists (participating in the survey) agreed. If we look at the data, then 20% to 30% persons with severe mental illness require such facilities.” However, the administration requires a policy on the matter, he says. On progress made so far, Dr Simmi Waraich, Chandigarh based consultant psychiatrist, says, “We met the UT administrator on April 10, 2019, and the UT adviser the next day. Both assured us of a satisfactory solution. Then in July 2019, the adviser asked us to submit a list of potential beneficiaries of group homes and a list of over 70 caregivers was submitted to the director, social welfare, Chandigarh, but nothing has been done.” Referring to assisted living facilities in Bengaluru, where an NGO is providing short- and long-term stay homes to persons with mental illness, Waraich adds,. “We have none in this part of the region. Chandigarh can set an example.” In January 2019, a city based social worker with others even filed a PIL in the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking directions for UT to make a policy on group homes. “A group home is a large house where a few persons with mental illness live together like a therapeutic community or an extended family.All that the administration has to do is provide a home (like an old-age-home) with the facility of psychosocial workers to assist the mentally challenged with their daily chores and monitor their physical and mental health,” he says.No land available: UT adviser Commenting on the matter, UT adviser Manoj Parida says, “In Chandigarh, we have no land. Also, it’s not that easy to plan. I have met these families, but their requirements vary. One needs at least six acres of land.” However, Parida says plans are being made to convert a Cheshire home into a group home. “Maybe in the next two to three months we will shift handicapped persons from there,” he adds. No plans on duration of stay have been made, he says On suggestions of some elderly parents that the Indira Holiday Home in Sector 24 be earmarked for ‘sheltered accommodation,’ Parida says it is for the governor (UT administrator) to decide what to do with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-long-term-care-home-in-chandigarh-for-adults-with-mental-health-problems/story-olqhFWrk0FXd180JfCfahK.html

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Teacher’s murder: Accused husband had not paid sons’ school fees since April, reveals Probe||The 42-year-old man, who has been accused of murdering his wife, has not paid the school fees of his two sons since April, police investigation revealed. The cops are now trying to ascertain if the fee default was due to financial issues or Covid-19 crisis. Mandeep Singh, a fine arts teacher, is absconding since his wife Jyoti Rani, 40, was found dead at their house in Sector 23 on Tuesday night. She used to teach at the government school in Karsan, Ram Darbar. The couple’s sons, aged 13 and nine, studied in Classes 8 and 3 at a private school in Sector 33. As per the school authorities, fees of both the students used to be paid well in advance before April. “The eldest son had been studying here for the last 11 years, while the younger one was with us since 2014. This was for the first time that their school fee was not paid,” said Vikrant Suri, principal of Tender Heart School. The school has now come forward to offer free education to both the boys in wake of the tragedy that struck the family. “We have written to the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) about the offer to ensure the studies of these kids do not suffer. The school has decided to offer free education to them till Class 10,” the principal said, adding that the 13-year-old was a “very good chess player”. Younger son yet to be tracedThe younger son of the couple has not been traced so far, while his brother’s custody has been handed over to their grandparents. “We are looking into the bank details of the family. Some people have suggested that Mandeep was in debt, but we are yet to verify it,” said Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vineet Kumar. ‘Had been saving money through kitty schemes’The investigations so far have revealed that Mandeep had been investing in committees by paying monthly instalments. As per the police, on September 14 too, before leaving the city with his sons, Mandeep had paid ₹10,000 towards a monthly kitty to a colleague in Sector 35. The police said there had been no transaction from his account since September 15, when he last used his debit card at two petrol pumps for refueling before driving towards Kharar. Case so far Decomposed body of Jyoti Rani was found wrapped in a blanket on a blood-stained bed at her government accommodation in Sector 23 on Tuesday by a police team from Ludhiana, which had come knocking at her house to drop her elder son. The police are yet to trace Mandeep Singh and his nine-year-old son, who was in the car when he pushed his 13-year-old son in Neelon canal on the night of September 14. He is now with his paternal grandfather Surmukh Singh, who came down from Fatehgarh Sahib after the murder was reported. A case under sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC has been registered against Mandeep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/teacher-s-murder-accused-husband-had-not-paid-sons-school-fees-since-april-reveals-probe/story-oR6m5gshEYdOH7sJmO3DON.html

20-09-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||Mohali’s top brass struggles to battle Covid The Covid pandemic has Mohali’s top brass on its toes, literally. With the number of cases crossing 8,000 in the district, both deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan and additional DC Aashika Jain are holding back-to-back meetings with senior health officials to bring the number down. From giving directions to private hospitals to making arrangements and ensuring aggressive testing, early detection and treatment, the officers have warned people of stringent action against those spreading rumours. Regular directions are being given to people to wear masks and maintain social distancing. After HC quashes online election diktat, bar council digs in its heels Even as the Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed the online election diktat of the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana in the two states and Chandigarh, the council is not ready to give in. It all started with the high court bar association refusing to follow the bar council’s notification on holding elections. This led the council to replace the election committee. The matter reached the high court on the judicial side and election notification was set aside. However, it appears the council is not ready to give in so soon. Hours after the notification was quashed, the council put two senior advocates of the high court on notice on complaints alleging that their cases were not defended properly by the duo. Some say the senior advocates association played a key role in getting the notification quashed. Incidentally, the bar association was represented by the two senior advocates. Press meet in Covid times leaves many surprised Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, a press conference convened by Vineet Kumar, the officiating SSP of Chandigarh, at the Sector 39 police station left many surprised. The SSP announced the arrest of four vehicle thieves, including two garbage collectors, by a police team led by inspector Amanjot Singh, the station house officer. The few mediapersons in attendance wondered why take a risk of holding a press meet to announce the recovery of nine stolen two-wheelers. The UT police have not held a press conference since the Covid-19 outbreak even in cases of murder and arrest of gangsters. Press statements suffice. Students send consent slips without parents’ knowledge As students in Chandigarh have been asked to provide consent slips from their parents for coming to school for guidance from Monday, it was found that many students of government schools sent the consent from their parents’ phone without informing them about it. A teacher of a government school said that many schools were now calling the parents of the students to verify that they have given the consent. On Monday, a printed copy of the consent form with the parents’ signature will be required for students to enter school. Students and teachers from micro-containment zones won’t be allowed to attend school. No printing of calendars, diaries at PGI Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has circulated an office memorandum by the central government suggesting that there should be no activity regarding printing of calendars, diaries, desktop calendars or festival greeting cards. They have been suggested to adopt innovative means such as digital or online methods for such activities. The printing of a coffee table book has also been banned and appropriate use of e-books has been encouraged. No syndicate meeting at PU in two months Thought it’s a tradition at Panjab University to hold a meeting of the syndicate every month, the apex executive body did not meet in August and September due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the vice-chancellor convened an online syndicate meeting on two consecutive days last week but the members did not attend it, saying the meeting should held in person, not online.

The term of the students’ council ended on May 31, 2020. After this, other student organisations raised the issue that the office bearers should not continue using their official positions.The issue was also raised in the syndicate meeting in July and members were of the view that student representation should be maintained even if elections are not held.A committee has also been formed to look into legal possibilities of extension of term. However, the committee hasn’t met so far.A syndicate member, on condition of anonymity, said, “The session has already started and there are several concerns regarding the extension of term for the students’ council.”Chetan Chaudhary whose term as PUCSC president ended on May 31, said, “All our office-bearers have requested the authorities to extend the term of the students’ body elected last year. Since all students are currently at home, this becomes an imperative since it acts as a bridge between students and authorities.”“The matter has been discussed by the syndicate as well, but it seems that the varsity is in no mood to give us an extension. This means there will be no student representation,” said Rahul Kumar, vice president of PUCSC, 2019.PU’s dean students’ welfare (DSW), SK Tomar, said, “We have not received any communication from the university authorities regarding the matter so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-yet-to-decide-on-extension-of-term-for-students-body/story-CWQHxHm6tmcjlmGFHWZmOK.html

20-09-2020||Mumbai||Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Viraat sets sail one last time||Three years after it was decommissioned in 2017, INS Viraat set off on its final journey on Saturday, when it was towed out of Mumbai to be taken to the ship-breaking yard at Alang in Gujarat. Over the past three years, there have been numerous attempts to convert the historic naval vessel into a museum, but none of these came to fruition. INS Viraat was the longest-serving aircraft carrier in the world, having served both the British Royal Navy and the Indian Navy in its tenure. Some of its commanding officers, including admirals Madhvendra Singh, Arun Prakash, NK Verma and DK Joshi, have gone on to become chiefs of naval staff in the Indian Navy. Last month, during an auction conducted by the Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited, INS Viraat was bought by Shree Ram Group for Rs 38.54 crore. Chairman of Shree Ram Group, Mukesh Patel said INS Viraat was expected to reach Alang around September 22. “We expect to generate around 15,000 tonnes of scrap from INS Viraat and the scrap will be sold to several steel rolling mills across the country,” said Patel. “I will be personally saluting the ship once it arrives at our yard before it is dismantled,” he added, saying the ship holds “a special place” because of its rich history. Previously, the state governments of both Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh had expressed interest in turning the ship into a museum. However, no formal proposal was submitted. In July 2019, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for defence Shripad Naik had said, “INS Viraat could not be handed over to any state government because of non-receipt of a self-sustaining financially complete proposal. Thus, in view of considerations of safety, security etc, a decision to scrap INS Viraat has been taken in due consultation with Indian Navy.” INS Viraat was decommissioned on March 6, 2017. When the commissioning pendant of the longest-serving aircraft carrier was lowered, it was an emotional moment for many veterans in India and the United Kingdom who had served on the carrier. On Saturday, as INS Viraat set off on its last journey, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajeev Chandrasekhar wrote on Twitter, “I want to try one last attempt to save #INSViraat Flag of India. Wud Reliance, TATA, Adani, Wipro, HCL, Mahindra, Uday Kotak, Poonawalla, Tech companies like Infosys consider contributing to a trust to preserve our history? I rqst my media friends to amplify this appeal.” Among those who have campaigned to save INS Viraat in the past are veterans of the UK’s Royal Navy, who served on the carrier when it was HMS Hermes (1959-1984). Last year, former member of the European parliament David Campbell Bannerman had written to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to request an intervention to postpone the auction. “Our plan would be to turn the ship back into INS Viraat form for key weeks in the United Kingdom so that the large Indian diaspora can attend events on board,” Bannerman had told HT, saying he was prepared to pay 5 million pounds but had received no response from Indian authorities. Commissioned into the UK’s Royal Navy in November, 1959 as HMS Hermes, the aircraft carrier had served for 27 years, including in the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982, before being decommissioned in 1984. India bought the vessel and rechristened it INS Viraat. It was commissioned into the Indian Navy on May 12, 1987 and became the flagship of the Navy. Four Naval air squadrons in operated out of the aircraft carrier to undertake anti-submarine, search-and-rescue, and other necessary operations. Soon after it was commissioned, INS Viraat saw active operations as part of Operation Jupiter in July 1989, as part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka after the Indo-Sri Lankan accord broke down. INS Viraat was last deployed in February 2016, in the International Fleet Review in Viskhakapatnam. The aircraft carrier sailed under her own power for the last time from Mumbai to Kochi in July 2016. In October 2016, she was towed out of Kochi and returned to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indian-navy-s-aircraft-carrier-ins-viraat-sets-sail-one-last-time/story-4FMeY1QrY5XBsWLXFP5v4O.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams: Teachers write to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, want 100% attendance rule revoked||A day after the state department of higher and technical education released a government resolution (GR) making 100% attendance compulsory for teaching and non-teaching staff of colleges in view of the final-year exams next month, several teacher groups have sought chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and the Centre’s intervention into the issue. Many have also demanded that the GR be withdrawn with immediate effect.“The GR is in complete contradiction to the state government order (Mission Begin Again) dated August 31 and exhibits a disconnect with the grim reality of surge in Covid-19 cases in the state at present,” a statement by the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU), from the letter addressed to Thackeray, read. It further mentioned how enforcing 100% attendance will violate the directives of the state disaster management authority to avoid bringing everyone back to work in educational institutes. BUCTU also highlighted how the idea of holding exams online was to ensure the safety of all stakeholders. “With the present surge in Covid-19 cases, implementation of this GR will lead to a serious compromise of health and life of staff that will ultimately adversely affect the smooth functioning of examinations,” the letter read.An official from the department of higher and technical education said that the GR is meant only for those who will have key roles in conducting the online examination. He further stated that clarity on this GR will be announced on Monday.The GR on Friday called for complete attendance in a bid to ensure that colleges are able to conduct the online exams and declare all the results in the first week of November. “Exams in the state will be conducted between October 1 and 31 and results are required to be announced by the first week of November. This will require a large amount of manpower. To complete the challenging task, 100% attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff is required henceforth,” stated the GR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-teachers-write-to-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-want-100-attendance-rule-revoked/story-GUi1VW5RBgEOpB0pimwbVO.html
20-09-2020||City||Covid impact: Mohali MC’s losses mount to ₹13 crore in five months||Already reeling due to a deficit budget, the fund-starved Mohali municipal corporation has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 13 crore in the past five months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a major setback to MC, the Punjab local bodies department had imposed a cut of Rs 141 crore in its budget for 2020-21 earlier this year. Against the proposal of Rs 268 crore, which the civic body forwarded in February, the local bodies department had approved only Rs 127 crore.Every month, Mohali MC spends Rs 5 crore on paying salaries, power bills, fuel charges and maintaining city’s sanitation. With the pandemic affecting its income, the civic body is now left with only Rs 15 crore to meet its expenses for the remainder of the financial year. Revenue curtailedWhile it expected to earn Rs 10 crore in lieu of octroi, a duty levied on various goods entering Mohali, the civic body got just Rs 5 crore from the state government. A major blow came in the form of unipole advertisers’ refusal to pay the Rs 5-crore fee for five months. They instead wrote to the civic body seeking a waiver, citing no revenue earned. MC has referred the case to the local bodies department for approval. There are 102 unipoles set up by six companies in the city. Besides, neither the Rs 25-lakh rent nor the tehbazaari fee (licence to squat and sell goods in a particular location) that generally amounts to Rs 5 lakh per month has been collected by MC for the past five months. No duties, challans collected Other losses incurred include additional excise duty of Rs 1 crore; fee of around Rs 15 lakh from road cuts, which is required to lay sewer and water pipes; challan fee of polythene, which is around Rs 8 lakh; and building application fee, which comes to around Rs 25 lakh for five months. On account of property tax, residents have so far paid just Rs 7 crore against an estimated Rs 25 crore, and water bill payments come to around Rs 8 lakh instead of Rs 25 lakh. MC commissioner Kamal Kishore Garg said, “It is a nationwide crisis and Mohali MC has also suffered a huge loss. We got some funds on account of octroi, but suffered a major loss in terms of advertisement fee, which is around Rs 5 crore. Public dealing has begun, so we are hopeful of some recovery.” 200 tenders await allotment Meanwhile, more than 200 tenders of development works worth Rs 30 crore have not been allotted for the past one year. These projects pertain to development of parks, laying of paver blocks and footpaths, re-carpeting of roads and installing outdoor gyms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-mohali-mc-s-losses-mount-to-13-crore-in-five-months/story-abDPUIpBrRFfYqxXo7OJcJ.html
20-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees record rise in Covid-19 recoveries||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count on Saturday reached 1,188,015 after 21,907 more cases were reported, the 13th day of over 20,000 fresh infections. The active cases, however, came down to 2,97,480 as 23,501 recoveries, highest in a day, were reported in the past 24 hours. This works out to 25.04% of total cases reported so far. The total number of recoveries recorded till date are 8,57,933.The state has also crossed the 32,000 mark of Covid-19 casualties after 425 deaths were reported on Saturday. The death toll stands at 32,216.Maharashtra’s struggle to control Covid-19 cases is becoming tougher with a surge in cases since the ease of lockdown restrictions from June 3. The free movement of people allowed the infection to spread to rural areas. Consequently, the contribution of rural areas to the daily caseload has started increasing and is around 47%.Of the total 21,907 cases recorded on Saturday, 10,300 were from rural areas of the state. This ratio is likely to increase in the coming days. On July 3, only 19% or 1,211 cases of the total 6,364 cases were from rural areas.“There is no doubt that the removal of restrictions has led this situation and the spike in cases will continue for a few more weeks. Festivals, too, have played a role in it. We, too, had anticipated growth in cases and thus a conscious decision of giving graded relaxations was taken. The current surge is because cases are increasing rapidly in rural parts, which is concerning,” said a senior health official. The state has recorded over 3,96,790 cases in 19 days of this month and its average per day cases went up to 20,883.“Unlocking has brought us in this situation, but everything is still under control as a large number of people are also being recovered. There is also no shortage of beds and oxygen,” state health minister Rajesh Tope told HT.“It is difficult to say when the state is going to hit the curve. As the state has adopted ‘My family My responsibility’ initiative the cases are likely to increase but this will help us in early detection as our concern is to reduce the number of deaths and we are making all efforts to bring down the case fatality rate,” he added.High number of casualties continues to be a concern for the state authorities as it is still the highest in the country. To bring it down, the state has launched a door-to-door survey under the ‘My family My responsibility’ initiative. It aims to check 2.25 crore families for symptoms of Influenza Like Illness (ILI), Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and co-morbidities. The idea is to effectively curtail the spread with necessary care and also reduce the number of Covid-19 casualties.Figures show that the state’s contribution in total Covid casualties is around 37.62% with 85,619 deaths reported across the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 2.77% on Saturday and comes at third position after Punjab and Gujarat. The CFR of Punjab and Gujarat were 2.92% (with 2,708 deaths) and 2.73% (with 3,286 deaths) on Friday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Mumbai recorded 2,211 new Covid cases, taking the case tally to 1,82,203. Of them, active cases are 30,639.The city toll reached 8,425 with 50 deaths on Saturday.Pune city has contributed second highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,745 cases, taking its tally to 139,907, while Nagpur city becomes the third-highest contributor with 1,569 cases pushing its case count to 47,908.Pune district also recorded 1,366 cases and the collective count of Pune in the daily caseload was 3,111 cases.Besides, the major hotspots from the state are Nashik city, Pimpri-Chinchwad city, Satara district, Ahmednagar district, Sangli district, Jalgaon district and Solapur district where fresh cases recorded were 1,141, 919, 767, 744, 662, 597 and 538 respectively.It has conducted 92,802 tests on Saturday and the total number of tests conducted till date are 5,786,147.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-record-rise-in-covid-19-recoveries/story-GZM9opbQqimGJchzVManEN.html
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Residents head uphills as Himachal opens its borders||Travellers from tricity made a beeline for Himachal Pradesh soon after the state opened its borders for outsiders. At least 35,000 vehicles crossed the Chandimandir toll plaza on Saturday, while the figure was 34,300 a day before. “The number of vehicles crossing the toll plaza has increased as compared to the last week. About a week back, we roughly had about 30,000 vehicles crossing the toll per day,” shared an official at the plaza. Another summer retreat for travel enthusiasts — Morni — remained out of bounds as the Panchkula administration had on September 15 closed the hill station for outsiders on weekends to prevent ‘obstruction, injury and annoyance’ to locals due to regular traffic congestions being witnessed there lately. The ban has, however, been revoked. The closure also forced many to head to Himachal for a break. ‘Cash payment of toll plaza causes congestion’Long queues were seen at the Chandimandir toll plaza as about 17,000 vehicles that crossed the barrier had FASTag, while the remaining ones opted for cash payments. The toll official said, “The long queues are the result of people still opting to pay by cash.” Most of those headed uphills had planned a day trip, while a few sought to spend the weekend there. “We are driving up to Kasauli just to enjoy the weather. It is almost after six months that we have moved out. We will be back by midnight,” said Balinder Singh, a resident of Sector 21, Chandigarh. “What could be better than visiting the hills to break the monotony and recharge yourself,” said Manpreet Kaur, an IT professional from Panchkula, who was on her way to Barog with her friends. Restriction on traffic to Morni lifted Panchkula DCP Mohit Handa on Saturday withdrew the order of restricting the traffic movement to Morni. As per the order issued in the evening, DCP Handa said, “In light of opening of the tourist traffic at the borders of HP, the order issued on September 15 was reviewed and keeping in mind the overall public interest the said order stands withdrawn with immediate effect.” However SHOs have been directed to continue patrolling and surveillance in Morni and adjoining areas of Panchkula to maintain smooth flow of traffic and law and order situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-head-uphills-as-himachal-opens-its-borders/story-EvWktniOoHofgQ19JgrSXI.html
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER to start antigen testing at emergency wards||Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has decided to conduct rapid antigen testing on patients reporting to emergency wards to detect Covid-19 cases at the early stage.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said that around 5,000 antigen kits have been ordered for carrying out the tests. Around 10 to 12% of patients admitted to emergency wards of the institute have tested positive so far.A team of experts deputed by the central government had also suggested that to avoid intermingling of Covid-19 patients with others in the emergency area, the PGIMER administration should introduce antigen testing.“The turnover time of testing in emergency wards is more than 12 to 18 hours, resulting in intermingling of positive patients with others. So, rapid antigen testing should be done to prevent this,” the team suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgi-to-start-antigen-testing-at-emergency-wards/story-0bQaKW2prAMNiZTUhu9XxI.html

20-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 cases surge, but 32% beds vacant in Mumbai||Even as Covid-19 cases in Mumbai have risen rapidly over the past couple of weeks, there is no shortage of beds for coronavirus patients in the city. Around 32% of the 17,534 beds in hospitals and Covid-19 quarantine centres in Mumbai are currently unoccupied, while the active cases in the city have risen to 34,259 on Friday. Of the vacant beds, maximum are in municipal hospitals. The primary reason for this being Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal’s decision in June to allot beds in civic hospital only after beds in private hospitals were occupied. In August, Chahal also directed all ward officers to fill up beds at jumbo Covid-19 facilities first, before allotting beds at civic hospitals. On Friday, 30% of Mumbai’s 14,559 hospital beds were vacant; 11% of its 1,786 intensive care unit (ICU) beds had no occupant; 32% of its 8,805 oxygen beds were free; and 10% of its 1,119 ventilator beds were unoccupied. Moreover, 38% of the 2,928 Covid Care Centre (CCC2) beds, used to quarantine asymptomatic patients, were also lying empty. This translates to Mumbai having 4,505 vacant hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, 203 ICU beds, 2,886 oxygen beds, and 114 ventilator beds. The city also has 12 paediatric ICUs of which six were vacant, and 22 neo-natal ICUs of which seven were unoccupied as on Friday. Of the 185 beds for cancer and dialysis Covid-19 patients, 67 were not taken. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMumbai also has 144 reserve CCC2 facilities with a bed capacity of 18,397, which can be activated at any time as per need.According to civic officials, Mumbai has not fallen short of beds owing to many asymptomatic patients choosing home quarantine. Currently, 71% of the active patients in the city are asymptomatic, 24% are symptomatic and 4% are critical. “More patients are asymptomatic, and as more cases are coming from high-rises, these patients opt for quarantining themselves at home. BMC has allowed that as long as they have a separate room and an independent toilet in the house,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department.Dharavi crosses 3,000 coronavirus cases Meanwhile, Covid-19 case count in Dharavi crossed the 3,000 mark on Saturday, with 25 fresh cases. On September 11, Dharavi had reported 33 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest after 55 days. Following this, on September 14, Dharavi reported 23 new cases. As on Saturday, Dharavi has 160 active Covid-19 cases and its tally stands at 3,018. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, with jurisdiction over Dharavi, said, “There are a number of reasons why cases in Dharavi have been increasing. Among them is considerable easing of lockdown, and as businesses in Dharavi are reopening, many migrant labourers are returning. Also, business owners are urging their employees, and employers such as families who hire house helps are urging their employees to get tested before returning to work.” Also read: Herd immunity unviable, Covid-19 vaccine the only solutionMumbai on Saturday recorded 2,211 new Covid-19 cases and 59 fatalities.

Asked that the Bihar AIMIM president recently met RJD leaders reportedly for an electoral tie-up but the Lalu Prasad headed party did not give it any weight, Owaisi said “the meetings were not as you are guessing.” After gaining a toehold in thr Bihar politics by winning an assembly seat in the muslims dominated Kisanganj constituency early this year, AIMIM is trying to increase its footprint in the state by planning to contest some seats in Seemanchal areas having sizeable minorities population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/owaisi-forms-separate-anti-bjp-front-for-bihar-polls/story-QpuF6Hz0xKF9tMyyA4g8EP.html
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Care home needed for adults with mental health issues||The Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 has provision of half-way homes, sheltered accommodation and supported accommodation under rights of persons with mental illness.Surprisingly, however, a Smart City like Chandigarh does not have community homes offering long-term assisted living for persons with mental health issues.The city also has a large population of retirees, and some senior citizens are caregivers and parents of adults with mental health issues. Their concerns about the future of their children are valid. What if they are too ill to offer care? What happens to their children when they die?A number of persons, including seniors, have been making representations to the administration for setting up long-term care homes, but the powers that be have yet to act.Dr BK (Simmi) Waraich, MD, consultant psychiatrist with a Mohali based private hospital, had in a letter to the Punjab governor and UT administrator, on April 2019, referred to a meeting with him and reiterated the need to set up such a home. “The character of Chandigarh would be maintained and it would provide much needed sustenance to people who deserve to live with dignity and grace integrated into our society,” she had said.Such a home also had to cater to different socio-economic needs of persons with mental illnesses, Waraich had stressed.A year has passed since then, but even though a note was made of the governor receiving her letter, nothing has moved.The administration has said it is looking into the matter, but getting land and other facilities for such a project could be a problem.What the UT needs to do is assess properties not generating enough revenues and see if these could be put to good use. Paid facilities can be provided with retired nursing and housekeeping staff hired to take care of residents’ needs. Regular skills training, counselling and other services can be provided to enable them to live healthy and productive lives.QUESTION: CARING CITYDoes UT need care homes for adults with mental health problems?The city does not have care homes for adults with mental health problem? How can such facilities be run and maintained in the city?

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Don’t dare the devil in times of coronavirus!||Peek-a-boo! My long lost friend was at the door, materialising from anywhere, just like olden times, to give me a surprise. The apathy of corona times had hit me, but she seemed oblivious to the dangers that lurked. In normal circumstances, I would have rushed to embrace her, but here I stood frozen, flustered, and quite taken aback by her presence. I almost hated myself for being so cold and felt guilty that perhaps I was overreacting to the threat of the pandemic. To my relief, better sense prevailed upon her, as she was wearing a mask, and she did not try to come close.Corona had arrived with a bang in our lives, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Millions fell like a pack of cards. The Covid warriors fought tooth and nail, putting their health and lives at stake to save others. The whole world saluted their tireless efforts. Several months of lockdown had engendered a feeling of restlessness. This gave rise to a new breed of combatants whose fight was not against coronavirus, but against anyone who stopped them from doing what they wanted to. Those daredevils were living on a two-week cyclic schedule, playing hide and seek with the virus and taking their chances. They were freely mingling in groups, and posting deeds of their bravado on all social platforms. They believed that the infection could not come from close friends and family members. The virus must have felt even more insulted by their devil-may-care attitude than it would have done during the lockdown.My friend, like many others, had also “let go”. The increasing numbers were bothering her too, but what troubled her more was the thought of staying confined indoors. She had stopped watching the news, and she jested, “This lockdown has given me a trampoline head. Now all the facts and figures conveniently bounce off my senses.”In the same breath, she asked me why I had been hiding. To this, I answered that I was keeping my distance so that I did not go around helping the virus do its job of infecting people. Nodding in amusement she called me paranoid and invited me for a little tour of the city: “Come with me,” she continued, “the markets are bustling, people are dining out, and the salons have opened. What’s stopping you?”I too was undergoing a severe bout of frustration in not being able to move around freely. What stopped me was the fact that with each passing day, the number of cases was rising, especially in India. Community spread was rampant, and we were inching towards the peak.I could see that the only reason why the markets had been allowed to reopen was to boost the dwindling economy, and not because the fear of infection had diminished.The fact that I could be a carrier and pass on the infection to others even though I did not have the symptoms was scary. So, by restraining myself, I was doing a service unto others.It was the travesty of times that my friend and I fell on either side of the argument. I empathised with her and gently told her that this was a battle we could not afford to lose, so we had better not get into one. It was in our own interest to play safe, and stay safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-don-t-dare-the-devil-in-times-of-coronavirus/story-CYlPkHr0SoOyz0aCzvV82N.html
20-09-2020||City||Opposition making false statements on farm bills: Haryana education minister||Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal said on Saturday that the opposition parties were making false statements to mislead the farmers, a day before they are set to launch a statewide protest against three farm ordinances. Addressing a press conference in Jagadhri, Kanwar Pal said under these laws, farmers will be able to sell their produce directly to the buyers that will minimise the involvement of middlemen and would improve the farmers’ standard of living. “Passage of these three new laws will open doors for more investments. The agriculture sector will be modernised, which will increase the income of crores of farmers. The mandi system and MSP will remain intact and no change has been made on these two fronts. Supply of quality seeds will be ensured to farmers and they will be protected in a transparent manner,” Kanwar Pal, who is also Jagadhri MLA, said. He said, “The mentality of the Congress is that of the Britishers and they cannot see the farmers azaad (free). All Congress leaders, including Randeep Singh Surjewala, are making unsuccessful attempts to mislead farmers by making false statements. This is the same party where former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda distributed cheques of ₹2 and ₹3 in the name of compensation to the farmers. The BJP government, whenever there was any natural calamity, distributed compensation worth thousands of crores.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/opposition-making-false-statements-on-farm-bills-haryana-education-minister/story-KueT84DNRMEi7ILfQ2ueGL.html
20-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Last 2,000 Covid-19 cases reported in just eight days||Ghaziabad: Ghaziabad district added its previous 2,000 Covid-19 cases in just eight days – the fastest spike of the infection here so far, according to state government data.Saturday saw 132 new Covid-19 cases added, taking the district’s total tally to 12,153. The district added 1,000 cases between September 10 and 14, and another 1,000 between September 14 and September 18, as per the data.The district reported its first case of the infection on March 5, and it took 110 days to reach the 1,000-mark from there, recording an average of around 9 cases a day.It took Ghaziabad district five days to go from 9,000 to 10,000 cases — the previous highest spike.District officials said the spike was due to increased testing, as well as norms being relaxed over the past few days. “There has been a rise in new cases over the past fortnight, due to many more activities being allowed,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Besides, increased testing is also resulting in more cases. The cases in September have been averaging about 180-200 per day. But in the past two-three days, we have experienced some decline. It could be temporary,” he added. According to the records of the Ghaziabad district health department, the average per day testing from August 1 to August 18 was about 3,048 tests while a total of 54,877 tests were conducted. During the same period in September, the average daily tests stood at 3,579 while the overall tests from September 1 to September 18 were 64,429. The official records state that the 3,686 cases added in September so far account for about 30.33% of the total cases here.Experts said the spike is likely to continue in the coming days. “A rise in cases has been observed since the past fortnight and the trend is likely to continue. It is vital that strict enforcement of containment zones, contact tracing and surveillance activities should continue to have an effective control over the Covid-19 pandemic. People must not lower their guard and must adhere to health protocols,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Meanwhile, the district administration said that with the rise in number of cases, they have also beefed up surveillance activities. “There are seven types of surveillance teams who are taking up different types of activity of tracing suspect cases and getting them tested. The seven teams are also monitored by as many teams who are stationed at the integrated command and control centre. We are focussed in enforcing the containment activities and ensuring early detection, early referral and speedy treatment of positive cases,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The seven types of teams are those which are taking up door-to-door surveys in containment zones, those surveying households across the district and led by booth level officers, two different set of teams taking up special surveys in the city and rural areas and other teams who are focussed on surveillance of old aged persons and pregnant women. According to the records of the district administration, the seven teams have so far completed a survey of 28,204,86 households in different rounds and identified 14,466 suspected cases which have so far resulted in 1,544 Covid-19 positive cases..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-last-2-000-covid-19-cases-reported-in-just-eight-days/story-yfE7D1OLXcusXT3h46WqtL.html
20-09-2020||Delhi||Task force reviews plan to curb pollution in Delhi-NCR||PK Mishra, Principal secretary to the Prime Minister, has asked Delhi government to ensure that local sources of air pollution such as open burning of waste, road and construction and demolition dust and industrial emissions are managed carefully ahead of winter before air pollution peaks, according to a statement issued by environment ministry on Saturday.At a high-level task force meeting on Friday, Mishra also called for plans for air pollution hot spots. The meeting was attended by chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, secretaries of different departments including ministries of environment, agriculture, road, petroleum and the Central Pollution Control Board. The task force was constituted to improve the air quality in National Capital Region of Delhi.The Delhi government did not respond to HT’s queries regarding the meeting. Mishra said emphasis should be laid on deployment of teams for control of open burning of waste, IT-enabled monitoring of mechanical road sweepers, improvement in utilisation of construction and demolition waste and site specific implementation of action plan for identified hot spots. It was decided that similar site-specific plans will be implemented in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.He said the measures should be implemented well before the onset of severe air conditions and focus should be on compliance of emission norms by industries.Mishra noted that the incidence of stubble burning has reduced by more than 50% in last two years and the number of “good” air quality index days have gone up. It was observed that after recent inclusion of residue-based power and fuel plants under priority sector lending by Reserve Bank of India, both state and central governments should jointly work out action plans for rapid deployment of such units. Measures related to diversification of crop and strengthening of supply chains were also discussed.Mishra stressed that teams should be deployed in Punjab, Haryana and UP to ensure that no stubble burning takes place. These states will need to provide appropriate incentives especially in the relevant districts.“We have to enforce the rules but enforcement becomes a challenge if systems are not in place. We have to do capacity system audits to understand what kind of waste generation and management is happening. Small scale industrial units, unauthorised industrial units will have to be monitored for the kind of fuel they are burning. Learnings from the lockdown will also have to be systematically implemented. For example, work from home can give us clues to develop a systemic approach of reducing the need for travel,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. Delhi recorded moderate AQI at 118 on Saturday.Delhi has recorded “moderate” air quality days consecutively since September 9. The city had recorded four “good” and 27 “satisfactory” air days in August with air quality not falling to moderate levels even once.But meteorological and air quality scientists said the season is changing gradually leading to meteorological conditions that are unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/task-force-reviews-plan-to-curb-pollution-in-delhi-ncr/story-eVuCmQD1X3CxJKHLSmzXxM.html
20-09-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: 500+ ICU beds added in private hospitals, says Satyendar Jain||In a week, over 500 intensive care unit (ICU) beds have been added in Delhi’s private sector hospitals for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19), health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday, even as the Capital added 4,071 cases of the infection. He also said that the case positivity rate in the city would see a further downward trend in the coming days, on the back of the governments efforts to scale up Covid-19 tests in the Capital.“In the next two or three days, the number of beds will go up further. ICU beds are being increased in the government hospitals as well, and we are monitoring the capacity of all the hospitals regularly. Over 8,000 beds earmarked Covid-19 beds are still vacant, and we will increase the count further if necessary,” he said. “Not many actually need beds with ventilators. As the number of ICU beds go up, ventilator beds will slowly free up,” Jain added. As on Saturday evening, according to the state government’s Delhi Corona website, 15,323 beds in Delhi’s government and private hospitals are earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Of these, 7,025, or 45.8%, beds were occupied. Over 2,900 ICU beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients, and 66.6% currently occupied. With the government scaling up testing for Covid-19 from the first week of September, Delhi has added over 4,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day except one, since September 9 . However, the cumulative test positivity rate — the number of positive cases of the total number of people tested in the city so far — dipped below 10% on Friday, the health minister said. “The cumulative positivity rate of all cases reported dropped below 10% for the first time on Thursday . So far, the positivity rate is 9.83%, earlier this was between 11 and 12%. The case fatality ratio (fraction of people who die among those tested positive) stands at 0.69% in the last 10 days, and 2.05% for all deaths so far,” Jain said. Delhi has so far seen 4,945 people die of the disease.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicJain also said the proportion of the gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests looks skewed because Delhi government has scaled up testing massively. Over the last week, just over 17.5% of all tests conducted in the city were done using the RT-PCR method.“Show me one case in Delhi where a person wanted to get tested but could not get it. Even if they want RT-PCR test they can get it. But for surveillance in people without symptoms, rapid antigen tests can be done in bulk. The testing guidelines have also been revised to remove the need for doctors’ prescriptions,” the minister said. “We increased the number of tests over the last 10 to 12 days, and have seen a downward trend in positivity rate in the last two days. The impact will be visible in the coming week,” he added. When asked whether there was community transmission in Delhi, he said, “Community transmission is a technical term, but with so many cases being reported from Delhi and other parts of the country, community transmission should have been accepted. But, it is only the centre and scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) who can say so, however the infection is spreading in the community.” “What we have learnt and what WHO (World Health Organization) defines as community transmission is a case for which authorities are not able to trace the contact from where they got the infection. And we are getting such cases. So the answer is fairly obvious. But, discussing this makes no sense now. The objective has to be to control further spread of the infection and reduce morbidity and mortality because of it,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor, department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/500-icu-beds-added-in-pvt-hospitals-jain/story-WJUFBAqTLe6An1d9Pl5u5N.html
20-09-2020||World||Trump averts TikTok ban in US with his ‘blessing’ for Oracle deal||President Donald Trump averted a ban on downloads and upgrades for American users of TikTok that was scheduled to go into effect on Sunday, saying he has given his “blessing” to a tentative deal in which US companies Oracle and Walmart will acquire a minority stake in the Chinese video-sharing app. “I can say that I have given the deal my blessing,” Trump told reporters announcing the deal, adding that he had “approved the deal in concept”.Oracle and Walmart will acquire 12.5% and 7.5% respectively in a new company, which will be incorporated possibly in Texas and will be called TikTok Global. ByteDance, the Chinese parent company will continue, to hold a stake in the new entity.But Oracle and Walmart said in a joint statement that the new entity will be majority-owned by American investors. Four American companies already own 60% of ByteDance.TikTok Global will be an independent American company, headquartered in the US, with four Americans out of the five-member Board of Directors, the companies added in their statement.The new entity will create more than 25,000 new jobs in the US and will pay more than $5 billion in new tax dollars to the US treasury, which, Trump said, will go towards funding education. “We’re going to be setting up a very large fund toward the education of American youth.”TikTok said it was “pleased” to confirm a deal had been reached to resolve the Trump administration’s “security concerns and settles questions around TikTok’s future in the US.”TikTok faced a ban on new downloads and upgrades for American users from Sunday night, along with WeChat, another Chinese social media app. The restriction on TikTok were extended by the commerce department, but the ban on downloads of WeChat and financial transactions will go into effect as scheduled.The Trump administration has said these Chinese companies pose a national security threat for the US.It argued that the Chinese government has access to data collected on American users and could use them to potentially “track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage”.With the new entity, data on Americans will be stored locally. “All the TikTok technology will be in possession of TikTok Global, and comply with US laws and privacy regulations. Data privacy for 100 million American TikTok users will be quickly established by moving all American data to Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud data centres, the most secure cloud data centres in the world,” Oracle and Walmart said in their joint statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-averts-tiktok-ban-in-us-with-his-blessing-for-oracle-deal/story-4Xf5TFIeycFHdEvVNugrOK.html
20-09-2020||World||More than 2 dozen people, groups involved in Iran’s arms programs to be sanctioned: Report||The United States on Monday will sanction more than two dozen people and entities involved in Iran’s nuclear, missile and conventional arms programs, a senior US official said, putting teeth behind UN sanctions on Tehran that Washington argues have resumed despite the opposition of allies and adversaries.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide detailed evidence regarding either assertion.The new sanctions fit into US President Donald Trump’s effort to limit Iran’s regional influence and come a week after US-brokered deals for the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize ties with Israel, pacts that may coalesce a wider coalition against Iran while appealing to pro-Israel US voters ahead of the Nov. 3 election.The new sanctions also put European allies, China and Russia on notice that while their inclination may be to ignore the US drive to maintain the UN sanctions on Iran, companies based in their nations would feel the bite for violating them.A major part of the new US push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms that was previously reported by Reuters and will also be unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday, the official said.The Trump administration suspects Iran of seeking nuclear weapons - something Tehran denies - and Monday’s punitive steps are the latest in a series seeking to stymie Iran’s atomic program, which US ally Israel views as an existential threat.“Iran is clearly doing everything it can to keep in existence a virtual turnkey capability to get back into the weaponization business at a moment’s notice should it choose to do so,” the US official told Reuters.The official argued Iran wants a nuclear weapons capability and the means to deliver it despite the 2015 deal that sought to prevent this by restraining Iran’s atomic program in return for access to the world market.In May 2018, Trump abandoned that agreement to the dismay of the other parties - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - and restored US sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.Iran, in turn, has gradually breached the central limits in that deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including on the size of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium as well as the level of purity to which it was allowed to enrich uranium.“Because of Iran’s provocative nuclear escalation, it could have sufficient fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of this year,” the official said without elaborating except to say this was based on “the totality” of information available to the United States, including from the IAEA.The Vienna-based agency has said Iran only began significantly breaching the 2015 deal’s limits after the US withdrawal and it is still enriching uranium only up to 4.5%, well below the 20% it had achieved before that agreement, let alone the roughly 90% purity that is considered weapons-grade, suitable for an atomic bomb.“Iran and North Korea have resumed cooperation on a long-range missile project, including the transfer of critical parts,” he added, declining to say when such joint work first began, stopped, and then started again.Asked to comment on the impending new US sanctions and the US official’s other statements, a spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations dismissed them as propaganda and said they would further isolate the United States. “The US’ ‘maximum pressure’ show, which includes new propaganda measures almost every week, has clearly failed miserably, and announcing new measures will not change this fact,” the mission’s spokesman, Alireza Miryousefi, told Reuters in an email. “The entire world understands that these are a part of (the) next US election campaign, and they are ignoring the US’ preposterous claims at the UN today. It will only make (the) US more isolated in world affairs,” he said.The White House declined comment in advance of Monday’s announcements.‘Snap back’ of UN sanctions?The US official confirmed Trump will issue an executive order that would allow the United States to punish those who buy or sell conventional arms to Iran with secondary sanctions, depriving them of access to the US market. The proximate cause for this US action is the impending expiration of a UN arms embargo on Iran and to warn foreign actors - US entities are already barred from such trade - that if they buy or sell arms to Iran they will face US sanctions.Under the 2015 nuclear deal the UN conventional arms embargo is set to expire on Oct. 18.The United States says it has triggered a “snap back,” or resumption, of virtually all UN sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, to come into effect at 8 p.m. on Saturday/0000 GMT on Sunday.Other parties to the nuclear deal and most UN Security Council members have said they do not believe the United States has the right to reimpose the UN sanctions and that the US move has no legal effect.On Friday, Britain, France and Germany told the Security Council that UN sanctions relief for Iran - agreed under the 2015 nuclear deal - would continue beyond Sunday, despite Washington’s assertion.In letters to the Security Council on Saturday, China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun and Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia both described the US move as “illegitimate” and said the UN sanctions relief for Iran would continue.Also on Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council he cannot act on the US declaration that UN sanctions had been reimposed because it was not clear whether they had snapped back. “It is not for the Secretary-General to proceed as if no such uncertainty exists,” he said.Targets include Iran’s nuclear, missile, arms groupsThe new executive order will define conventional weapons broadly as any item with a potential military use, meaning it could cover such things as speed boats that Iran retrofits to harass vessels in international waters, the US official told Reuters.It would also apply to conventional circuit boards that can be used in ballistic missile guidance systems, he added.The more than two dozen targets to be hit with sanctions on Monday include those involved in Iran’s conventional arms, nuclear and missile programs, the official said, saying some of the targets are already sanctioned under other US programs.That could prompt criticism that the US move is redundant and designed for public relations purposes to look tough on Iran, a charge critics have made about past US sanctions actions.Among the targets will be Iran’s “most nefarious arms organizations,” about a dozen senior officials, scientists and experts from Iran’s nuclear complex, members of a procurement network that supplies military-grade dual-use goods for Iran’s missile program, and several senior officials involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program, the US official said.The official declined to name the targets, saying this would be made public on Monday, and stressed that the United States wants to deter foreign companies from dealing with them even if their governments believe this is legally permitted.“You might have a split in some countries where a foreign government may claim that the UN sanctions don’t snap back but their banks and companies will abide by US sanctions because they want to make sure they are not a future target,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-2-dozen-people-groups-involved-in-iran-s-arms-programs-to-be-sanctioned-report/story-mCpp35RhcEFy0LAOlsXvbL.html
20-09-2020||World||Ban on TikTok delayed in US as Trump approves Oracle’s bid||Donald Trump gave his blessing to Oracle Corp.’s bid for the American operations of TikTok, putting the popular video-sharing app on course to escape a US ban imposed as part of his pressure campaign against China.“I approved the deal in concept,” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”The new company, which will be called TikTok Global, has agreed to funnel $5 billion in new tax dollars to the US and set up a new education fund, which Trump said would satisfy his demand that the government receive a payment from the deal. “They’re going to be setting up a very large fund,” he said. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for.”Oracle plans to take a 12.5% stake in the new TikTok Global, while Walmart Inc. said it has tentatively agreed to buy 7.5% of the entity. Walmart’s Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will serve on TikTok Global’s board of directors, the retailer said in a statement. Four of the five board seats will be filled by Americans, according to the statement.TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for the app, according to a person familiar with the matter. Oracle and Walmart would pay a combined $12 billion for their stakes if they agree to that asking price. The final valuation had not been set as the parties worked out the equity structure and measures for data security, the person said. Terms are still in flux and the proposed valuation could still change.US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo characterized Bytedance’s proposed role as similar to a “passive shareholder.” The Chinese company would have “no decision-making authority, no ability to peer into” what the US company is doing, he said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”The TikTok deal was forced by a pair of bans Trump issued in August over concerns that ByteDance posed a national security risk, thrusting the video-sharing app into the center of the president’s confrontation with Beijing.Shortly after Trump signaled his approval, the Commerce Department on Saturday delayed by a week a ban that would have forced Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pull the TikTok video app from their US app stores on Sunday.Trump is ramping up pressure on Chinese-owned apps in the weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential elections, citing national security concerns about the data US citizens provide to them and the potential for Beijing to use them for spying. The president is trailing his opponent Joe Biden in polls and has sought to portray himself as tougher on Beijing than the Democrat.TikTok said in a statement that it was “pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the US administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the US”The company confirmed Oracle will host all its US data and secure its computer systems. Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud fully isolates running applications and responds to security threats autonomously, according to the statement, which eliminates the risk of foreign governments spying on American users or trying to influence them with disinformation.“Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud,” said Oracle CEO Safra Catz in a statement. “We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users.”Oracle will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.‘Real’ FirewallThe deal, if approved, ensures “that no American’s data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don’t want it,” Pompeo said.“We will ensure that that firewall is real, that the protection is serious, that the data resides in places that aren’t connected to the Chinese information system,” he said.TikTok Global, together with Oracle, SIG, General Atlantic, Sequoia, Walmart and Coatue will create an educational initiative to develop and deliver an online video curriculum driven by artificial intelligence, according to the statement.TikTok said it’s working with Walmart on a commercial partnership and said that it will take part in a TikTok Global financing round along with Oracle before an initial public offering in which the investors can take as much as a 20% cumulative stake in the company.TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. TikTok will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world. The company will also pay more than $5 billion in new tax dollars to the Treasury, according to the statement.To sweeten the deal for Trump, TikTok promised to hire an additional 15,000 jobs, more than the 10,000 positions the company already pledged to fill earlier this year. It’s unclear if there’s a timeline to achieve that target, or guarantees that it will follow through. Facebook Inc., the largest US social media company, employed about 45,000 people in 2019, while Twitter Inc. employed only 4,900, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Proponents of the deal told the Trump administration that the new company would be controlled by American investors by counting the passive stakes of existing shareholders in TikTok’s Chinese parent, people familiar with the matter said. Although ByteDance will have an 80% stake in the new company, existing US investors hold a 40% stake in ByteDance. That tallies up to 53% ownership by US companies and investors -- although that doesn’t entail majority control or voter rights, the people said.TikTok Global, which will be an independent company, will hold an initial public offering in less than 12 months and the stock will be listed on a US exchange, according to the statement. After going public, US ownership of TikTok Global will increase and continue to grow over time, it added.While the Chinese government must now sign off on the transaction for it to go forward, as of earlier this week, ByteDance was growing increasingly confident that the proposal would pass muster with Chinese regulators, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Early reaction from Chinese state media appeared positive. “This scheme is still unfair, but it avoids the worst result, that TikTok is shut down or sold to a US company completely,” wrote Hu Xijin, the influential editor in chief of China’s state-owned Global Times.Under the terms of the agreement reached early in the week, ByteDance would retain a majority of TikTok’s assets and control over the algorithm, with Oracle and other US investors taking minority stakes.Trump seemed to contradict that on Saturday. “It will have nothing to do with China, it’ll be totally secure, that’ll be part of the deal,” he said. “All of the control is Walmart and Oracle, two great American companies.”Trump spoke with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and Walmart’s McMillon on Friday, telling them he still expected the US government to receive a cash payment as part of the transaction, according to people familiar with the matter. They agreed to the educational donation as a way to satisfy Trump’s demand, one of the people said. ByteDance first heard about the $5 billion education fund from news reports, a company spokeswoman said.The deal came together last weekend, the result of high-level negotiations between ByteDance, Oracle and top Trump administration officials after ByteDance rejected a bid from Microsoft Corp. and Walmart to buy the US TikTok service outright.Beijing has signaled it would greenlight a deal as long as ByteDance doesn’t have to transfer the artificial intelligence algorithms that drive TikTok’s service, Bloomberg has reported.The Treasury Department said the deal is subject to a security agreement that requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius. The term sheet that’s been negotiated between Cfius and the companies will now have to be formalized in a document that details the mechanics for implementing the terms of the deal.That document would likely include requirements related to the establishment of the new company, arrangements governing its relationship with ByteDance, whether an IPO is part of the deal, whether ByteDance will have to divest its entire stake in the IPO and what would happen if for some reason the IPO doesn’t occur, said Aimen Mir, a lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury.In a video posted on TikTok with the caption #WeAreTikTok and we are here to stay, interim head of TikTok Vanessa Pappas thanked users for “sticking by us,” she said. “We’re here for the long run.” In the comments below, users said they were happy that the ongoing drama around the ban would subside. “This on and off situation is working on my nerves,” said @iamdavante, who has 4.1 million followers on the video app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-tiktok-delayed-in-us-as-trump-approves-oracle-s-bid/story-UZl7Vp4ozIqTvC93PSzl3M.html
20-09-2020||World||Paytm alleges arm-twisting by Google||Home grown digital financial services firm Paytm on Sunday charged internet giant Google of “arm-twisting” and forcing it to roll back a UPI cashback campaign which is legal in India. Google said that offering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of Google Play gambling policies and in case of repeat violation its may even terminate Google Play developer accounts. Paytm in a blog alleged that Google Pay has been running similar cricket-based promotions “but a different set of rules apply to Google’s own apps”.Google had blocked Paytm on its Play store following a policy update on September 18, ahead of the IPL cricket tournament, to disallow apps that support any unregulated gambling but restored the mobile app after a few hours after it rolled back the campaign.Paytm said that it was forced to comply with Google’s mandate to remove the UPI cashback and scratch cards campaign to get re-listed on the Android Play Store.“Offering both is legal in India, and cashback was being given following all rules and regulations set by the government,” Paytm said.When contacted, a Google spokesperson said that offering cashbacks and vouchers alone do not constitute a violation of our Google Play gambling policies. The spokesperson said that last week Google reiterated Play Store gambling policies which bars online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting, “including daily fantasy sports in India”.“We enforce our policies very thoughtfully to provide a safe and secure experience for consumers, while also giving developers the platform and tools they need to build sustainable businesses. In the case of repeated policy violations, we may take more serious action which may include terminating Google Play Developer accounts. Our policies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently,” Google spokesperson said.Paytm said that its gaming subsidiary, Paytm First Games can conveniently do a paid promotion on Google-owned YouTube but it is not allowed to do the same advertisement on the Paytm app as per Google Policy.“We have been prompt and responsible in solving Google’s concerns and comply with their directions. Google’s recent action on the delisting of the Paytm app because of a UPI cashback campaign is unjustified. We reiterate that our cashback campaign was within guidelines, and there was no violation,” Paytm said.It added that as a country India should not beholden to such tech giants. The digital payments firm alleged that it was “arm-twisted” by the search engine major to comply with its biased app Play Store policies “that are meant to artificially create Google’s market dominance.” Paytm in the blog said that Google Pay has started its Tez Shots Campaign which clearly says, “Score Runs to earn assured rewards worth up to Rs 1 lakh” at the beginning of this cricket season itself.The Tez Shots participants who qualify for a lucky draw through which they get assured tickets up to Rs 1 lakh with any qualifying payment, Paytm said in a blog.“Presumably, such cashback campaigns of Google Pay are not in breach of play store policies, or maybe they are, but a different set of rules apply to Google’s own apps,” the digital payments firm said.Paytm said that it launched a campaign on September 11 where users could collect cricket stickers and scratch cards to earn UPI cashback.The offer was applicable on recharges, utility payments, UPI money transfers, and adding money to wallet and on September 18 at 11:30 AM, the company received the first email from Google Play Support informing that the Paytm Android app had been delisted.Vijay Shekhar Sharma-run digital payments firm alleged that it was not given any opportunity to respond to their concerns or put forth views.“We maintain that our promotional campaign was within guidelines, and there was no violation. It was also not related to gambling in any manner whatsoever,” Paytm added its blog.Paytm said the Google Play Support team had written to them on three occasions--on August 20, August 28 and on September 1, with some concerns on a separate matter of Paytm First Games’ promotion through the Paytm app for some alleged previous “policy violations”.“While we strenuously disagreed with the allegation that we are breaching the policy (and we disagree with the policy itself too), we immediately complied with the diktat that barred us from promoting our gaming subsidiary,” it stated in the blog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paytm-alleges-arm-twisting-by-google/story-KpPzW4sJS4y4UVS92LGl0N.html

The passengers were earlier on an India Express flight.Hong Kong recorded the highest number of new infections in almost a month. One-third of the 23 new cases were in people who had recently travelled from India, according to the Centre for Health Protection. Only four local infections were reported.Hong Kong had banned flights operated by Air India in August too. These flights were part of the Vande Bharat Mission.The Vande Bharat Mission started in early May to evacuate Indians stranded abroad due to travel restrictions in wake of Covid-19 pandemic.A passenger from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if he or she has a Covid-19 negative certificate from a test done 72 hours prior to the journey, according to the rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July.Air India Express flights were suspended for 24 hours on Friday by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) for bringing two passengers with Covid-positive certificates on August 28 and September 4.As per the UAE government rules, each passenger travelling from India is required to bring an original Covid-negative certificate from the RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-bans-air-india-flights-says-one-third-of-23-new-cases-recently-travelled-from-india/story-0X0d8LMsOYZmQ3nSkTdW2L.html
20-09-2020||World||Ahead of crucial FATF meet, Pakistan continues to treat 21 dreaded terrorists as VIPs||In a big revelation exposing the double standards of Pakistan, the country, despite the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sword hanging over its head, continues to harbour terrorists and is giving VIP treatment to many of them including underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and Pakistan-based Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terrorist Ranjeet Singh Neeta. Sources said that the international community is concerned about the hypocrisy of Pakistan which is pretending to take action against terrorists but is funding them.According to the sources, the Pakistan government is giving VIP security to 21 dreaded terrorists including those sanctioned last month.According to the list accessed by ANI, the terrorists given VIP treatment include underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, Wadhwa Singh, Chief of Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), Indian Mujahideen (IM) chief, Riyaz Bhatkal, terrorist Mirza Shadab Baig and Afif Hassan Siddibapa.Many of these terrorists are those who are wanted in India. Pakistan is giving them asylum.India has repeatedly exposed Pakistan who is sponsoring the terrorist groups and training and arming them to wage war against IndiaFrom last few weeks, experts believe that the Pakistan government is creating an illusion that it is acting against terrorist groups to prevent the wrath of Paris based watchdog FATF. Last month, Pakistan had imposed more restrictions on 88 leaders and members of terrorist groups, in compliance with the new list, issued by the United Nations Security Council. Hafiz Saeed Ahmad of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Mohammad Masood Azhar of JeM and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Ibrahim are on the list.According to the details, the government has also seized the bank accounts and properties of the terrorists in the country. They have also been banned from travelling aboard, Ary News reported.Though Pakistan has claimed that it is taking actions against the terrorist groups, however, there are no details of how many actions have been implemented.Islamabad is racing against time to escape the FATF’s blacklist and clearing its name from the grey list.Pakistan is in the grey list since June 2018 and the government was given a final warning in February to complete the remaining action points by June 2020. The FATF extended the June deadline to September due to the spread of coronavirus that disrupted the FATF plenary meetings.The country is facing the difficult task of clearing its name from the FATF grey list. Pakistan is making attempts to avoid a demotion from the FATF grey list to the blacklist during the upcoming October plenary meeting. While Pakistan tries to showcase its ‘efforts’ in combating terrorism, there have been reports from Afghanistan giving ample evidence of the presence of Pakistani terrorists on its land.In recent weeks, Pakistan has been trying to paint a picture that it has started the reforms including the passing of bills in order to prevent blacklisting by the FATF.In late July, Pakistan Financial Monitoring Unit Director-General Lubna Farooq told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the country is yet to comply with 13 conditions out of the 27-point Action Plan of the FATF including curbing terror financing, enforcement of the laws against the proscribed organisations and improving the legal systems.

Reports said experts are quite concerned about Covishield, developed by Oxford University and Astrazeneca as not much is known about the trials.What does the blueprint say?* It says that the goal is to develop a vaccine with 50 per cent effectiveness, as mandated by the Food and Drug Administration.* There will have to be 150 people ill with confirmed coronavirus among participants who were vaccinated or received placebo shots.* A safety board will perform an early analysis after there have been just 75 cases.* When the vaccine will be found 50 per cent effective, it will apply to the government for early release of the vaccine for emergency use.Also Read | AstraZeneca’s trial illnesses may not be due to Covid-19 shot, says Oxford UniversityReleasing the blueprint of a vaccine under research is believed to be unusual as several other rival companies are also racing to develop an effective Covid-19 vaccine. But Moderna, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, all three pharma companies have released their blueprints detailing how they are proceeding with the trials.Controversy over Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccineOn September 8, Astrazeneca confirmed that it has stopped trials on September 6 after two participants reported illness. It refused to divulge any further information regarding the illness. The trials running in other countries were also stopped. After the UK authorities announced that the illness reported was not related to the vaccine shot, Astrazeneca resumed its trial. However, the United States has not yet permitted the resumption of Oxford vaccine trial. What we know so far about illness reportedly prompted by Astrazeneca vaccine shots?According to New York Times, one participant developed spinal cord inflammation after receiving one shot of the vaccine. Later, it was found that the volunteer had a “previously undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis”.Third-phase trial in India likely to begin tomorrowThe final phase of human clinical trial of Oxford-Astrazeneca’s Covishield will begin at the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune next week, after Drugs Controller General of India gave Serum Institute of India (SII) a go-ahead to continue its trial. “The phase-III trial of ‘Covishield’ vaccine will begin at Sassoon hospital from next week. It is likely to start on Monday. Some volunteers have already come forward for the trial. Around 150 to 200 volunteers will be administered the vaccine candidate dose,” Dr Muralidhar Tambe, dean of Sassoon General Hospital, told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-vaccine-with-50-per-cent-effectiveness-astrazeneca-releases-111-page-covid-19-vaccine-trial-blueprint-all-you-need-to-know/story-cF3IU1I3wHnMyZKNeIokkN.html
20-09-2020||World||Why Thai protesters are challenging the monarchy||Since a longstanding taboo on criticising Thailand’s monarchy was broken by protesters in early August, their rallies in Bangkok have got increasingly bold in criticising King Maha Vajiralongkorn and demanding change. HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?Anti-government protests emerged last year after courts banned the most vocal party opposing the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.After a pause during measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, protests resumed in mid-July - pushing for Prayuth’s removal, a new constitution and an end to the harassment of activists.Some protesters went further with a list of 10 demands to reform the monarchy.Protesters say they do not seek to end the monarchy, only reform it, but conservatives are horrified by such attacks on an institution the constitution says is “enthroned in a position of revered worship”.Prayuth has said that while protests should be allowed, criticising the monarchy goes too far.WHAT DOES THE PALACE SAY?The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests and the demands for reform despite repeated requests.WHAT REFORMS DO THE PROTESTERS WANT?Not all protesters demand reform of the monarchy, with some saying such calls are counterproductive, but the size of the weekend demonstrations showed the scale of support.Protesters want to reverse a 2017 increase in the king’s constitutional powers, made the year after he succeeded his widely revered late father King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Pro-democracy activists say Thailand is backtracking on the constitutional monarchy established when absolute royal rule ended in 1932. They say the monarchy is too close to the army and argue that this has undermined democracy.Protesters also seek the scrapping of lese majeste laws against insulting the king. They want the king to relinquish the personal control he took over a palace fortune estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and some units of the army.WHY ELSE ARE THEY UNHAPPY?Protesters complain that the king endorsed Prayuth’s premiership after elections last year that opposition figures say were engineered to keep his hands on power. Prayuth, who as army chief led a 2014 coup, says the election was fair.Protesters have voiced anger that the king spends so much of his time in Europe.They have also challenged the spending of the Palace and lifestyle of the king, who has been married four times and last year took a royal consort.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLAQUE?Protesters cemented a brass plaque on the Sanam Luang - or Royal Field - near the Grand Palace. The plaque proclaims that Thailand belongs to the people not the monarch.It resembles one commemorating the end of absolute monarchy removed without explanation from outside one of the royal palaces in 2017, the year after Vajiralongkorn took the throne, and replaced by one with a pro-monarchist slogan.WHAT DO THE LESE MAJESTE LAWS MEAN?The Thai monarchy is protected by Section 112 of the country’s Penal Code, which says whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent shall be jailed for three to 15 years.In June, Prayuth said the law was no longer being applied because of “His Majesty’s mercy”. The Royal Palace has never commented on this. Rights groups say opponents of the government - including more than a dozen of the protest leaders - have recently been charged under other laws such as those against sedition and computer crimes.The government has said it does not target opponents but it is the responsibility of police to uphold the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-thai-protesters-are-challenging-the-monarchy/story-EPy6F97e19wxLC7s3xk3NI.html
20-09-2020||World||Pak army a state above the state, says Nawaz Sharif as Oppn unites against military leaders||Pakistan’s major opposition parties on Sunday demanded an end to interference by the country’s military leaders in politics, with former premier Nawaz Sharif saying the army has gone from a ‘state within a state’ to a ‘state above the state’.For most of Pakistan’s history, there has been either a military dictator at the helm of affairs or, when there was an elected government, a parallel government was being run by the military, Sharif said in a hard-hitting speech to the conference which was attended by leaders of nearly all major opposition parties. The PML-N leader addressed the All Parties Conference, organised by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan Peoples Party, via video link from London where he is undergoing medical treatment. Significantly, some parts of the proceedings of the conference were censored on most local TV channels. The military’s interference has reached a point where, from being a state within a state, it was now a state above the state, Sharif said. “This is the root cause of all our problems.” “Our struggle isn’t against (Prime Minister) Imran Khan but with the forces that have installed his illegitimate government to power,” said Sharif. While political leaders were consistently victimised in the name of accountability, army dictators got away despite subverting the Constitution and committing all sorts of crimes, he added.In contrast, he said, there were no accountability proceedings against army generals and gave the example of Asim Saleem Bajwa, a retired general and now head of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority, whose undeclared holdings were exposed by the media but no action was taken.“We want elected leaders to run the affairs of the country, to manage the economy and to decide on the foreign policy.” said Sharif. The former PM said that under the Imran Khan government, Pakistan has become internationally isolated. “The Indian government took advantage of the weak and incompetent government to swallow Kashmir,” he alleged, adding, “even Pakistan’s friends did not stand by it when it protested.” Sharif asked whose agenda foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was working on when he attacked Saudi Arabia and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. He was referring to the minister’s comments attacking the Saudi leadership of OIC over what he called its ‘dilly-dallying’ on the Kashmir issue, which led to souring of relations with Riyadh.“When we pointed out that our friendly countries were warning us about our involvement in external issues which was being done at the behest of the military, we were attacked and it was turned into a scandal,” Sharif noted. Now, Pakistan has to deal with the shame of trying to meet targets set by platforms like the FATF, he said, referring to Financial Action Task Force, the global watchdog on money laundering and terror financing.Sharif said the country’s economy had crashed, inflation is up while the Pakistani rupee is at a historic low and economic growth had significantly fallen. He warned his audience that in such a situation, “when the economy is weak, the country will be unable to defend itself from external aggression.”Sharif demanded accountability of Khan’s own assets, the overseas assets of his sister and of those close to the prime minister who had benefited from the sugar shortage in the country.He said that state interference in public life in Pakistan had increased manifold. He lamented attacks on the media and the harassment of journalists. “The policy to divide and rule has been extended from politicians to the media, lawyers, industrialists and even the judiciary.” Sharif called for the supremacy of parliament and the sanctity of the vote.Earlier, while welcoming the participants to the conference, former president Asif Ali Zardari of PPP said the witch hunt being conducted by the present government against politicians should end. “They have even dragged the womenfolk of our families into these false cases,” he said.Bilawal Bhutto Zardari told the conference the time has come for a united opposition platform to fight the selected government of prime minister Imran Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-parties-unite-to-decry-military-s-state-above-state/story-6a0jTfeYC6cSpnhQ8IhFLN.html
20-09-2020||World||Facebook neutral, non-partisan, its India chief says defending handling of hate speeches||Facebook India Head Ajit Mohan has defended the handling of alleged hate speeches by members of the ruling BJP, saying the platform has remained true to its design of being neutral and non-partisan and acted based on inputs from various teams. In an interview with PTI, Mohan rejected charges of Facebook India’s decisions being influenced by political leanings of individuals, saying the process followed at the platform is designed to ensure no one person can influence outcomes, let alone take any unilateral decisions. “The content policy of team that is at the centre of all the enforcement decisions (on hate speeches) is separate and independent in India from the public policy team (that handles government relations),” he said. “It’s designed for independence.” And the content management team is guided by only community standards. “And enforcement of that has to be objective, has to be non-partisan and neutral. I think that goes to the heart of how the platform has been designed from day one,” he asserted. Individuals can have “points of views” or “leanings”, the “system is designed to make sure no one person can influence the outcomes,” he said. “And so the answer is yes,” he said replying to a question on whether Facebook is a non-partisan and politically neutral entity. The comments come amid a political storm over a report published in the Wall Street Journal last month, alleging the social media giant ignored extremist posts by ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in order to protect its business interests in India. According to the report, Facebook deleted anti-Muslim posts by BJP’s Telangana MLA T Raja Singh and three other Hindu nationalists only after being questioned by the paper. Facebook’s head of public policy Ankhi Das, the report said citing company employees, had opposed the deletion of the posts despite being flagged internally as breaching standards. Facebook earlier this month banned the 42-year-old Telangana MLA, categorising him as a “dangerous individual”. Mohan said there are no limits to respectable standard for free speech within and outside the company. While there are people from multiple political leanings and backgrounds in the company, Facebook values people of experience in government or in public service. “But at the same time, I think it is important to call out to you that the content policy of a team that is at the centre of all of these enforcement decisions is separate and independent in India from the public policy team here. It’s designed for independence. So the public policy team that engages with government, for example, central and state governments, is a part of my team. That is separate from the content policy team which is part of the global team,” he said. “So, I think the point is while people can have points of view, they can have leanings, the system is designed to make sure no one person can influence the outcomes, let alone have any unilateral decision making power on this aspect. The separation in India context tells you how design is meant for independence,” he said. Mohan said the content moderation is largely done through automated systems and human reviewers. In dealing with complex issues such as designating individuals, especially elected officials, the content policy team comes into play. “The public policy team does seek inputs from multiple functions and disciplines and teams including public policy team in India. That is not interference. That is the process, that is being designed to have enough local context from the local team,” he said. “But finally the decision that is taken is not taken by the public policy team.” “So you have the opportunity in certain cases like designation, from multiple local and international teams, to provide a point of view that is by design. But it is not for them to take any unilateral decision. That still goes through the content policy team,” he said. Facebook has over 300 million users in India, while its associate WhatsApp is the leader in messaging with over 400 million users. In April this year, Facebook invested USD 5.7 billion to buy a 9.9 per cent stake in Jio Platforms, the digital arm of energy-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd owned by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. Mohan said Facebook has an impartial approach to dealing with content and that this is governed strongly by its community standards. These policies are enforced globally without regard to anyone’s political position, party affiliation or religious and cultural beliefs, he emphasised. “That is the basis and enforcement of that has to be objective, has to be non-partisan and neutral. I think that goes to the heart of how the platform has been designed from day one. It goes to the heart of something all of us embrace, that we have to be neutral, we have to be non-partisan,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-neutral-non-partisan-its-india-chief-says-defending-handling-of-hate-speeches/story-4eeR7RMxJeLKZBzOiwiABJ.html
20-09-2020||World||Thai protesters challenge monarchy as huge protests escalate||Openly challenging the monarchy of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, thousands of protesters marched in Bangkok on Sunday to present demands that include a call for reforms to curb his powers.Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailand’s palace and military-dominated establishment, breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy - which is illegal under lese majeste laws.The Royal Palace was not immediately available for comment. The king, who spends much of his time in Europe, is not in Thailand now.The marchers were blocked by hundreds of unarmed police manning crowd control barriers.Protest leaders declared victory after handing police a letter detailing their demands. Phakphong Phongphetra, head of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, said on a video broadcast from the scene that the letter would be handed to police headquarters to decide how to proceed.“Our greatest victory in the two days is showing that ordinary people like us can send a letter to royals,” Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak, told the crowd before it dispersed. At the biggest demonstration in years, tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday cheered calls for reform of the monarchy as well as for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution and elections.SYMBOLIC PLAQUE Shortly after sunrise on Sunday, protesters cemented a plaque near the Grand Palace in Bangkok in the area known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field.It reads, “At this place the people have expressed their will: that this country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarch as they have deceived us.”Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said police would not use violence against protesters and it was up to the police to determine and prosecute any illegal speech. Bangkok authorities would need to determine whether the plaque is illegal and if it is it would need to be removed, Bangkok’s deputy police chief Piya Tawichai told reporters.Far from all Thais support the new plaque, which resembles one that had commemorated the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 and which was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017, after Vajiralongkorn took the throne.Prominent right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom said the actions of the protesters were inappropriate and that the king was above politics.“It didn’t achieve anything,” he told Reuters. “These actions are symbolically against the king, but the king is not an opponent.” Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally “enthroned in a position of revered worship”.Protests that began on university campuses have drawn increasing numbers of older people. That includes red shirt followers of ousted populist prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who had clashed for years with pro-establishment yellow shirts before Prayuth seized power in 2014.“The new generation is achieving what their parents and grandparents didn’t dare. I’m very proud of that,” said Somporn Outsa, 50, a red shirt veteran. “We still respect the monarchy, but it should be under the constitution.”Protesters say the constitution gives the king too much power and that it was engineered to allow Prayuth to keep power after elections last year. He says that vote was fair.The next protest is scheduled for Thursday. Protest leaders called on Thais to take Oct. 14 off work to show their support for change.“Radical change is hard in Thailand, but the movement has at least kept the momentum going,” said Titipol Phakdeewanich, dean of political science at Ubon Ratchathani University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-protesters-challenge-monarchy-as-huge-protests-escalate/story-OftXBrhURGJV2O7caDDAWI.html
20-09-2020||World||Italians vote in 7 regional contests shaped by pandemic||Italians in seven regions headed to the polls Sunday for two days of voting shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic.Voters were required to wear masks and maintain social distancing as they cast ballots in regional contests originally scheduled for the spring but delayed due to the pandemic. Italy’s outbreak has claimed more than 35,600 lives — the second-worst confirmed death toll in Europe after Britain — and stricken 296,500 people since February.For the first time, voters over 65 will have preferential access and will be guided to the front of any line by volunteers from Italy’s civil protection agency.Once inside, voters may lower their masks just long enough to confirm their identity against voting cards and ID documents. And in a change, voters leaving the voting booths will place the ballots inside the boxes themselves, instead of turning them over to poll workers.Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia of the right-wing League party is expected to win his third mandate handily after helping Veneto avoid the worst of the pandemic through targeted testing early on and protocols that took the pressure off intensive care wards.In the region of 5 million people centered around Venice, confirmed virus deaths have numbered 2,158, compared with 16,917 in Lombardy, the epicenter of Italy’s epidemic with a population of 10 million.The other races are considered a test of the strength of the right-wing opposition, led by League leader Matteo Salvini, against the ruling parties of the 5-Star Movement and the Democratic Party. The toughest contest is expected in Tuscany, where Salvini is betting his candidate can oust the Democratic Party from the left-wing stronghold.Regional leadership is also being decided in Liguria, Le Marche, Campania, Puglia and Valle d’Aosta. Mayoral races also were being held in 1,000 towns and cities.Despite the complications presented by coronavirus, analysts are projecting a strong turnout, as the pandemic emphasized the significance of local and regional leadership. In Italy, health care is administered at a regional level.Regional presidents “are quite powerful and people understand this,’‘ said Cristina Fasone, a professor at Rome’s LUISS University. “I think even more so after we experienced the first months of the pandemic.’‘ Italians also are voting on a referendum to reduce the number of national lawmakers, backed by the 5-Star Movement, which has made reforming Italy’s often moribund institutions a central political plank. The move would cut lower house lawmakers from 630 to 400 and those in the Senate from 315 to 200. The 5-Stars, which have the most members of any party in the lower house after the 2018 election, say the move will save 500 million euros ($580 million) each five-year legislative period.Most parties back the constitutional reform, which has already been passed by parliament but without the two-thirds majority that would have avoided a referendum. Still, many top political voices say they are voting ‘‘no’‘ as the move would reduce regional representation.Polls will close at 3 p.m. on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italians-vote-in-7-regional-contests-shaped-by-pandemic/story-KnQA6l1rd2INGp65AWoYQP.html
20-09-2020||World||TikTok owner seeking $60 billion valuation in US deal||China’s ByteDance Ltd. is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok as Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. take stakes in the short-video app’s business to address US security concerns, according to a person familiar with the matter.Oracle and Walmart have rights to buy 12.5% and 7.5% respectively of a newly established TikTok Global under an agreement that won the approval of President Donald Trump, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private negotiations. The two companies would pay a combined $12 billion for their stakes if they agree to that asking price.The final valuation had not been set as the parties worked out the equity structure and measures for data security, the person said. Terms are still in flux and the proposed valuation could still change. Beijing also has yet to approve the deal, though regulators are said to favor any transaction in which ByteDance maintains control of its valuable recommendation algorithms and other proprietary technology.ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok when Trump threatened to ban the app in the US over national security concerns. After Microsoft Corp. made a proposal for a full buyout of the service, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle’s offering in which the Chinese parent will maintain a solid majority stake.“I approved the deal in concept,” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”ByteDance and Oracle representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The valuation for TikTok has been a looming question as Washington and Beijing escalated their rhetoric over the negotiations. The service for the US market alone has been estimated to be worth $20 billion to $50 billion, or even more. Snap Inc., for context, trades at a $35 billion valuation.ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company, is the most valuable private startup in the world at $140 billion, according to market researcher CB Insights. The TikTok Global deal does not include the app’s China twin, Douyin, which has become an enormous hit in its own right.ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the app’s operations in the US and the rest of the world excluding China. Venture firms, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, may also acquire equity in the new business.Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of TikTok Global. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. It will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world.TikTok Global intends to hold an initial public offering within 12 months, Oracle and Walmart said. And Trump said Saturday he wants $5 billion from companies creating a new US-based TikTok venture directed toward teaching American children “the real history of our country.”Oracle will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter. The US software giant has given reassurances it can protect TikTok user data from foreign influence.“Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud,” CEO Safra Catz said in a statement. “We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-owner-seeking-60-billion-valuation-in-us-deal/story-EJF7MbbRofs7vefOmkI9GN.html
20-09-2020||World||Covid-19 is putting Britain’s next industrial revolution on ice||In the country that pioneered the world’s first industrial revolution in the 18th century, its latest one is looking very much on hold.The global shift toward robotics and artificial intelligence across advanced economies is currently in a go-slow phase in the UK -- where both Covid-19 and Brexit have hampered progress.That threatens to harm Britain’s competitiveness against rival economies which are already retooling more aggressively to be more productive. It could also mean greater long-term pain in the UK labor market, delaying the inevitable adjustment for workers who need to retrain as jobs in industries from manufacturing to retail become obsolete.“Eventually, businesses will have to automate because it is just cheaper and better -- better for employees as well,” said Tera Allas, director of research and economics at McKinsey. “In sectors that are competitive, either we automate them and we continue to be competitive, or someone else automates them and we ship in those goods from some other country.”Britain has long been a somewhat slow mover in the so-called “fourth industrial revolution” harnessing the potential of robots and artificial intelligence. That was the conclusion of a report by lawmakers last year calling on the government to develop a strategy to accelerate that shift.In manufacturing, for example, the UK has just 89 robots per 10,000 workers, compared to over 900 in Singapore, according to the International Federation of Robotics. That’s the lowest level of any major economy.One reason for that is subdued investment provoked by Brexit uncertainty and the redefining of Britain’s trading relationship with the European Union.The transition in place when the UK did finally leave the EU in January provided some encouragement -- with spending intentions on plants and machinery rising to a two-year high, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey. Robot orders reached the highest since 2012, another study showed.But then Covid struck. Business investment plunged more than 30% as a nationwide lockdown shuttered firms, kept employees out of workplaces and broke international supply chains.Not enough actionSince then, the virus has created a new incentive for businesses to shift away from human employment, and find more reliable workers and processes that can’t succumb to illness.But that has yet to translate into new orders for Brian Palmer, the chief executive officer of Tharsus. His company creates and commercializes robots for clients such as online grocery giant Ocado Group Plc and jet-engine maker Rolls Royce Holdings Plc.“People are still trying to figure out what this new normal looks like,” he said. “There’s more interest, but is there investment and action? Not yet.”Such news might come as a faint relief for millions of UK employees already facing the threat of layoffs as government wage support winds down. The advent of automation and robotics has long been a specter hanging over labor markets that could displace as much as 50% of the global workforce, Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said in 2018.That respite may not last forever. In a survey of European business leaders by EY, more than 80% said the shift to automation technology will probably accelerate because of the pandemic.“It is now just much more expensive to employ people because you have to worry about social distancing, you have to worry about safety equipment, you have to worry about testing and tracing,” said McKinsey’s Allas. “Covid itself has massively changed the playing field between capital and labor.”Guildhawk, a company which provides translation and content management systems for companies like KPMG and Hitachi, is confident that Britain’s fourth industrial revolution won’t stay on hold for long. The company has unveiled two new products since the coronavirus struck -- including one which automates the process of checking and correcting large volumes of translated text.“Now we can see what technology can do for us, people are really pushing forward,” said founder Jurga Zilinskiene. “Instead of looking at tech as some kind of monster to take away your job, now the tech is the hero.”Still, the risk if businesses don’t respond to the shifting landscape is that the UK will lag further behind peers when it comes sowing the seeds of future growth by adopting technology to boost poor productivity.That could not only delay the labor market’s adjustment to the new reality, but also curtail work prospects for future generations of employees.“The UK have missed the opportunities to invest in automation over a long time,” said Susanne Bieller, general secretary of the IFR. “If you don’t use robots, why would you create the skills around them?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-is-putting-britain-s-next-industrial-revolution-on-ice/story-8MsHwDx0o6fA75eGXrcRGP.html
20-09-2020||World||Banksy’s Show Me the Monet to go on sale next month||Auction house Sotheby’s on Friday announced it would offer British street artist Banksy’s well-known tribute to Claude Monet for an estimated £3-5 million at a live-stream auction next month. The anonymous artist’s 2005 painting, Show Me the Monet, is a satirical variation of the legendary French painter Monet’s 1899 masterpiece, Bridge Over a Pond of Water Lilies. In his signature style, Banksy has converted the impressionist artwork into a commentary on modern times by artfully introducing in the painting discarded supermarket trolleys and a traffic cone floating under the arched bridge. “Banksy shines a light on society’s disregard for the environment in favour of consumerism,” Sotheby’s said on its Instagram account. The painting will be auctioned for an estimated £3-5 million on October 21 in London, according to the auction house’s website. It is a part of The Contemporary Art Evening Auction, which is set to “bring together works by some of the most engaging artists of the 20th and 21st centuries” through a live-stream auction event. Also Read: Banksy’s latest graffiti in London’s Underground rail is inspired by Covid-19Show Me the Monet was first displayed 15 years ago as part of Banksy’s gallery exhibition titled Crude Oil: A Gallery of Re-mixed Masterpieces, Vandalism and Vermin. The series was a remix of masterpieces, including Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers, where Banksy’s version showed wilted flowers in a vase, and Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe, whose subject Banksy replaced with superstar model Kate Moss. The maverick exhibition also included 200 rats that roamed freely at the venue. Sotheby’s hailed the influential graffiti artist on its website, observing that Banksy’s work is marked by “dark humour, satire and political commentary” and has turned him into a “mainstream phenomenon”. In 2010, Banksy had made it to the Time magazine list of the world’s 100 most influential people. Last year, Banksy’s 2009 artwork Devolved Parliament, which mocked the British House of Commons by depicting it as an assembly of chimpanzees, had sold for a staggering £9.9 million - a record for the elusive artist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/banksy-s-show-me-the-monet-to-go-on-sale-next-month/story-MqHPOU5uaViArhj9EcLV1N.html
20-09-2020||World||Sweden spared surge of coronavirus cases but many questions remain||A train pulls into the Odenplan subway station in central Stockholm, where morning commuters without masks get off or board before settling in to read their smartphones.Whether on trains or trams, in supermarkets or shopping malls — places where face masks are commonly worn in much of the world — Swedes go about their lives without them.When most of Europe locked down their populations early in the pandemic by closing schools, restaurants, gyms and even borders, Swedes kept enjoying many freedoms.The relatively low-key strategy captured the world’s attention, but at the same time it coincided with a per capita death rate that was much higher than in other Nordic countries.Now, as infection numbers surge again in much of Europe, the country of 10 million people has some of the lowest numbers of new coronavirus cases -- and only 14 virus patients in intensive care.Whether Sweden’s strategy is succeeding, however, is still very uncertain.Its health authorities, and in particular chief epidemiologist Dr. Anders Tegnell, keep repeating a familiar warning: It’s too early to tell, and all countries are in a different phase of the pandemic.That has not stopped a World Health Organization Europe official from saying the continent could learn broader lessons from Sweden that could help the virus battle elsewhere.“We must recognize that Sweden, at the moment, has avoided the increase that has been seen in some of the other countries in western Europe,” WHO Europe’s senior emergency officer, Catherine Smallwood, said Thursday. “I think there are lessons for that. We will be very keen on working and hearing more from the Swedish approach.”According to the European Center for Disease Control, Sweden has reported 30.3 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days, compared with 292.2 in Spain, 172.1 in France, 61.8 in the U.K. and 69.2 in Denmark, all of which imposed strict lockdowns early in the pandemic.Overall, Sweden has 88,237 reported infections and 5,864 fatalities from the virus, or 57.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants since the beginning of the crisis.The way Sweden’s strategy was viewed outside the country seems to depend largely on what stage of the pandemic the observer was experiencing at the time. Initially, many abroad were incredulous at images of Swedes dining with friends in restaurants or sipping cocktails on the Stockholm waterfront. Some were envious that Swedish businesses were not forced to close.Then came shock as the virus ripped through the country’s nursing homes and hospices.By mid-April, more than 100 deaths were reported each day in Sweden, while mortality rates were falling elsewhere in Europe.Today, as fears of a second wave grow across Europe, it’s fashionable to praise Sweden, with reporters from France, the UK and elsewhere traveling to Stockholm to ask about its success.But a Swedish government commission investigating the handling of the pandemic will, undoubtedly, have hard questions to answer: Did authorities wait too long to limit access to nursing homes, where about half of the deaths occurred? Were they too slow to provide personal protective equipment to staff in those homes when shortcomings in the elderly care sector had long been known? Why did it take so long to set up wide-scale testing?Tegnell also refuses to rule out a second wave of coronavirus infections in Sweden. A particular concern is the return of students to high schools for the first time since March.“We need to be very careful and find the first sign that something is going on so that we can do as much as possible to prevent it from escalating,” he told The Associated Press.Localized outbreaks are expected, but rather than fight them with nationwide rules, officials plan to use targeted actions based on testing, contact-tracing and isolating patients rapidly.“It’s very important that we have quick and local response to hit down the virus without making restrictions for the whole country,” Health Minister Lena Hallengren said last week.From the beginning, health officials argued that Sweden was pursuing a sustainable approach toward the virus that the population could adopt — for years, if necessary. “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” became a slogan repeated by ministers at every opportunity, given that neither a vaccine nor a cure yet exist.While the rest of the world watched with envy at the freedoms that Swedes enjoyed amid lockdowns elsewhere, there were not as many as people have assumed. Gatherings were capped at 50, and congregating at bars was banned.Most of the changes involved voluntary actions by citizens, rather than rules imposed by the government.This trust given to the population to shoulder personal responsibility in the pandemic puts Sweden at odds with most other countries that used coercive measures such as fines to force compliance.This is often attributed to a Swedish model of governance, where large public authorities comprised of experts develop and recommend measures that the smaller ministries are expected to follow. In other words, the people trust the experts and scientists to develop reasonable policies, and the government trusts the people to follow the guidelines.Swedes were asked to work from home when possible and maintain a social distance, and most willingly complied. While people now ride public transportation without masks, there are also far fewer people commuting than before.Unlike most European countries that have mandated wearing face masks in public spaces, Sweden does not recommend their broad use, and people largely follow that recommendation.Health officials say face masks used outside health care facilities by untrained personnel can provide a false sense of safety that could see sick people leave home and ignore social distancing. Instead, they believe simple but nonnegotiable guidelines provide clear rules that can stay in place for long periods of time: staying home when showing symptoms of Covid-19, maintaining good hand hygiene and keeping social distancing.In a country the size of California with only a quarter of that state’s population of 41 million, and with low levels of transmission, most Swedes believe wearing masks makes little sense.Carol Rosengard, 61, who runs a center for disabled youth, has seen people wear masks improperly or take them off to smoke a cigarette or drink water.“That’s not how they should be handled,” Rosengard said, explaining her support for not imposing face mask rules on the population.That view is echoed by Hallengren, the health minister, who doesn’t totally dismiss the effectiveness of masks and sees their usefulness in cases of severe local outbreaks. At the same time, she rejects blanket rules for the entire country.“People will not wear masks for years,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-spared-surge-of-coronavirus-cases-but-many-questions-remain/story-yhPCWCoSk0ADaGE31hiGIP.html
20-09-2020||World||Threat of lethal autumn looms in Europe after Covid-19 reprieve||As vacations and parties fed a late-summer surge of Covid-19 in Europe, there’s been one reassuring constant: a lower death toll. The latest numbers out of the continent’s hardest-hit countries show the relief may only be temporary.The virus has started spreading in older populations again, according to data from France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK In France, its prevalence among those aged 75 or over more than doubled in the past three weeks.The shift could be a tipping point as Europe faces another wave of the virus. Rising cases among the elderly, more reports of nursing-home clusters and the number of deaths edging upward are “major warning signs,” France’s public health agency said in a report on Thursday.“We have a very serious situation unfolding,” said Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said. For the first time, he wore a mask at the press conference on Thursday. “The September case numbers should serve as a wakeup call for all of us.”A 75-year-old is 220 times more likely to die of a coronavirus infection than her 27-year-old granddaughter, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In France, Health Minister Olivier Veran pointed to what he called a worrying increase in the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care. More infections among the oldest people means there will probably be even more hospitalizations and deaths in coming weeks, French authorities said. Because people who are sick usually take a few weeks to get worse, there’s a time lag before new infections begin to cause a shift in mortality rates.‘Most fragile’Veran appealed directly to French seniors, asking them to better protect themselves by cutting back on the number of people they see every day because they are “the most fragile in the face of Covid.”Data from Italy points the same way. The median age of diagnosed cases rose to 41 in the week ended Sept. 13, up from 30 a few weeks ago. The report noted that the virus is now circulating “even among people of a more advanced age.”Even in Germany, which has managed to hold its seven-day rate of infections to a low level of about 11.5 cases per 100,000 residents -- about one-seventh the rate of France -- outbreaks seeded by travelers have begun to spread to nursing homes.Kaufbeuren, a small town in Bavaria, is a case in point. The virus first popped up only sporadically in people who had just returned from trips, Mayor Stefan Bosse said in a video statement earlier this month. “That has now unfortunately changed,” Bosse said. First a single worker at a local senior citizens’ home tested positive. By this week, the virus spread to some 30 residents and staff, according to the Robert Koch Institute.Authorities must find a way to protect old people without locking them away, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday. “We are reinforcing the rules,” Macron said, including making sure nursing home staff are tested. “We know that isolation and solitude are bad for old people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threat-of-lethal-autumn-looms-in-europe-after-covid-19-reprieve/story-Eko6LiIJ2AAkZxAWayaoUL.html

But the U.S. moves have united partners like the U.K., France and Germany with Russia and China, who have sought to salvage the accord. That has left the U.S. isolated on the UN Security Council, with most nations saying America has no authority to demand the return of international sanctions since it’s no longer a party to the agreement.The U.S. says that the broader Security Council resolution that enshrined the accord doesn’t require it to still be in the agreement, and that all of the United Nations resolutions on Iran that were in place before the accord -- from a ban on arm deals to restrictions on the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile activity and its nuclear enrichment -- should have gone back into effect on Saturday.The U.S. expects all UN member states to comply with their obligations to implement sanctions, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement late Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-uk-germany-reject-us-call-to-return-iran-sanctions/story-NuwRc0Ag3BdEsFI7wp0rPK.html
20-09-2020||World||Mira Nair’s A Suitable Boy to be first-ever TV series to close Toronto Film Fest||In an unusual year, the Toronto International Film Festival concludes on Sunday with an unusual choice: Its closing night presentation isn’t a movie, but the TV series A Suitable Boy, adapted by Indian-origin director Mira Nair from Vikram Seth’s classic novel.The screening spans six hours, covering the entire series produced for BBC, with two intermissions of 20-minutes each for those attending in person. Nair said she was “delighted” when TIFF chose to make this the first-ever TV project to close the festival in its 45-year history. Nair said this was the only format to do justice to Seth’s monumental work: “A Suitable Boy cannot be a two-and-a-half hour film, it should not be. It should be at least six hours, in the way I’ve tried to do it but it could be even longer.”While the novel was first published in 1993, many of its themes remain relevant, including that of communal faultlines. In fact, Nair took the original “distillation” of the novel and “brought a lot of politics back from the story of the novel” rather than making it just one about the protagonist Lata having to choose from among three suitors. “I love that part of it, but it was important for me to see Lata almost as the new India. So, as the country moved towards its first election, Lata moves towards finding herself.” The novel is set in the period right after Independence and syncretic culture is the foundation of the series.“I did really want to hold a mirror in a way to the young of today to see what we were, even though we had just come out of the trauma of Partition,” she said.There was a “depth of relationships that today are really being threatened just by the politicisation of it all,” she said.Nair has already been feted at TIFF this year with the Tribute Award, along with actors Kate Winslet, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and director Chloe Zhao. Tanya Maniktala, who plays Lata, was chosen as one of TIFF’s Rising Stars. Of casting the young actor in the pivotal role, Nair said that other than her hypnotic eyes and amazing smile, she had the kind of “fluttery innocence” that was difficult to find among young women these days.The author has two meaningful words for the director about the series – “Thank you,” Nair said of Seth’s reaction. “I don’t speak for him, but I think he’s very satisfied.”New York-based Nair was unable to make it in person for the closing night screening due to ongoing restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The series has been acquired by Netflix and Nair said she is hopeful it will be available to an Indian audience “very soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mira-nair-s-a-suitable-boy-to-be-first-ever-tv-series-to-close-toronto-film-fest/story-oaKGt4pCgJHNNjkfBf4y8K.html
20-09-2020||World||Tropical storm Beta spurs hurricane worries for Texas||An exceptionally busy Atlantic hurricane season was churning along Saturday as the Texas coast prepared for a tropical storm that could strengthen into a hurricane before breaching its shores in the week ahead.Both the city of Galveston and Galveston County on Saturday issued voluntary evacuation orders ahead of Tropical Storm Beta, as did the city of Seabrook to the north of Galveston.Mayor Pro Tem Craig Brown said in a statement that high tides and up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of expected rainfall would leave roads impassable, especially along the city’s west end and low-lying areas.Also read: As Laura makes landfall in Louisiana, a look at other tropical storms heading towards MexicoCounty Judge Mark Henry said during a Saturday news conference that his concern is also based on rising waters creating a storm surge and that a mandatory evacuation is not expected.“If you can survive in your home for three or four days without power and electricity, which we’re not even sure that’s going to happen, you’re OK,” Henry said. “If it’s uncomfortable or you need life support equipment, maybe go somewhere else.”Tropical Storm Beta was brewing in the Gulf of Mexico, 235 miles (375 kilometers) southeast of Galveston, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.The system could approach hurricane strength as it approaches Texas on Monday, officials said. Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning from Port Aransas, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana. A storm surge warning was issued from Port Aransas, Texas, to Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana.If Beta makes landfall in Texas, it would be the ninth named storm to make landfall in the continental US in 2020, tying a record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.In Lake Charles, Louisiana, where thousands of people remain without power more than three weeks after Hurricane Laura slammed into the coast, there are concerns that Beta could super-soak the region once again. Up to 20 inches of rain (15 centimeters) is possible in some parts of the area, Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Lake Charles, said in a Saturday briefing.Also read: From Nisarga to Amphan: How do tropical cyclones form“A lot of people have been saying, ‘Is this going to be like Harvey? Is this going to be like Imelda?’“ Jones said. “We’re not talking about rainfall totals yet that are on the orders of magnitude that we saw with that.” Imelda, which struck southeast Texas in 2019, was one of the wettest cyclones on record. Harvey — which dumped more than 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain on Houston in 2017.However, if the storm ends up moving a bit slower than what’s being forecast now, rainfall totals could be even higher than 20 inches, Jones said.“Harvey was a very specific and unique event, but we are talking about the same idea in terms of very heavy, heavy rainfall,” he said.Beta had maximum sustained winds at 60 mph (95 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 2 mph (4 kph) Saturday night.Forecasters were predicting up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of storm surge along parts of the Texas coast that included Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Galveston Bay and more. Wind, heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions were also expected with the storm.Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.Meanwhile, Hurricane Teddy remained a powerful hurricane Saturday, with maximum sustained winds at 115 mph (185 kph) and moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Teddy was centered 405 miles (655 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda less than a week after Hurricane Paulette made landfall in the wealthy British territory.A tropical storm warning was in effect for Bermuda. Large swells from Teddy were forecast to impact the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas and Bermuda, and were expected to impact the US East Coast.Parts of the Alabama coast and Florida Panhandle were still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Sally, which roared ashore on Wednesday. At least two deaths were blamed on the system. Roughly 82,300 were still without power in the Florida Panhandle on Saturday. Gulf Power said 95% of its customers in hardest hit Escambia and Santa Rosa counties will have power restored by the end of the day Tuesday.Meanwhile, residents in Springfield were warned to avoid contact with standing water after 5,000 gallons (about 19,000 liters) of raw sewage spilled into Lake Martin, according to county health officials.The Salvation Army was distributing roughly 10,000 meals Saturday at 10 locations throughout the Panhandle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-beta-spurs-hurricane-worries-for-texas/story-2pqATynSRoQ6Gr8E9xbSJM.html
20-09-2020||World||Ricin found in White House originated in Canada: Police||A letter containing the deadly poison ricin that was mailed to the White House may have originated in Canada, Canadian law enforcement has said.Canadian authorities are working with their US counterparts on the investigation. The material was addressed to US President Donald Trump. The envelope was intercepted at a government facility that screens mail addressed to the White House and Trump, a US official said.A preliminary investigation indicated it tested positive for ricin, a poison found naturally in castor beans, the official said.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is cooperating in this investigation with US authorities, the media outlet Global News reported.It quoted a spokesperson for RCMP as saying that “initial information” from the investigation “suggests that the letter originated in Canada.”The identity of the sender has not been revealed as yet. A spokesperson for Bill Blair, Canada’s minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, also confirmed that there were “concerning reports of packages containing ricin directed toward US federal government sites.” Investigators in both countries are “working closely” on the matter, the spokesperson added.This is not the first time that the deadly poison was sent to US presidents or top American officials.A US Navy veteran was arrested in 2018 and confessed to sending envelopes to Trump and members of his administration that contained the substance from which ricin is derived.Authorities said at the time that William Clyde Allen III sent the envelopes with ground castor beans to the president, FBI Director Christopher Wray, along with then-defence secretary Jim Mattis, then-CIA director Gina Haspel, top naval officer Adm John Richardson and then-Air Force secretary Heather Wilson. The letters were intercepted, and no one was hurt.In 2014, a Mississippi man was sentenced to 25 years in prison after sending letters dusted with ricin to President Barack Obama and other officials.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ricin-found-in-white-house-originated-in-canada-police/story-oSua1661F6cdFaeaFe53pM.html
20-09-2020||World||Trump says he intends to name a woman as US Supreme Court judge||President Donald Trump has said he intends to name a woman as his nominee to replace late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and will make an announcement next week.“It will be a woman — a very talented, very brilliant woman,” Trump said at an election rally in North Carolina on Saturday. “We haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list.”The president first spoke of picking a woman for the seat left vacant by the passing of Ginsburg while talking to reporters before departing for the rally. Asked if he would pick a woman, he said he could. “I could see, most likely, it would be a woman, yeah. I think I can say that it would be a woman. I would - if somebody were to ask me now, I would say that a woman would be in first place, yes.”He also said in a response to another question he expects to announce his pick next week .Female judges reportedly in his shortlist include Amy Coney Barrett, a judge on the Seventh Court of Appeals (similar to Indian high courts). He had interviewed her in 2018 when considering a nominee to replace Stephen Kennedy. He went with Brett Kavanaugh instead.Trump had then also considered Amul Thapar, an Indian-American judge on the Sixth Court of Appeal. He had made it to the last four. His name shot to the group of front-runners earlier Saturday, to replace Ginsburg. But his chances now seem diminished with the president announcing he will pick a woman.Whoever Trump picks eventually will face a bruising confirmation process in the Senate, with fierce opposition expected from Democrats. They want the seat to be filled by the next president, whoever wins the November 3 elections,  as Republicans had argued in 2016 to block President Barack Obama’s pick for a vacancy in the court.Republicans face opposition from some of their own senators as well, which will make the confirmation tricky. With a 53-47 majority, they cannot afford to lose four senators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-intends-to-name-a-woman-as-us-supreme-court-judge/story-yHIZkQCvulhNpxBBdmi6KI.html

Second lockdown in UK?In a further measure announced late Saturday, he said that from September 28 people will be legally obliged to self-isolate if they test positive or are told to by the National Health Service (NHS) tracing programme.“The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they’re at risk of passing on coronavirus,” Johnson said in a statement.“And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.”Currently people who have symptoms or test positive are asked to self-isolate for 10 days. Those who live with someone who either has symptoms or tests positive must self-isolate for 14 days.The new fines will start at £1,000 -- in line with breaking quarantine after international travel -- and rise to £10,000 for repeat offences and the worst breaches, including businesses that threaten self-isolating staff with redundancy, officials said.Also read: ‘This is a big moment:’ UK government cautions on coronavirusIn an incentive to get people to comply, those on low incomes will be able to claim an extra lump sum of £500 if they are unable to work from home during their isolation.“While most people are doing their absolute level best to comply with the rules, I don’t want to see a situation where people don’t feel they are financially able to self-isolate,” Johnson said.Almost 42,000 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Britain, the worst death toll from the pandemic in Europe.After a summer lull, cases are rising rapidly again and Johnson warned on Friday of a second wave.“We are seeing it in France, in Spain, across Europe -- it has been absolutely, I’m afraid, inevitable we were going to see it in this country,” he said.New rules limiting social gatherings to six people from different households came into effect this week, and local measures have been introduced across the country.But Johnson has expressed his reluctance to introduce another nationwide lockdown and some of his Conservative lawmakers are increasingly vocal in condemning current restrictions.In London on Saturday, anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in Trafalgar Square. Police said 32 people were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-000-fine-for-breaking-covid-19-rules-in-england/story-gOwhW94Jqt84pHhp6TFa3N.html
20-09-2020||World||Former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner dies at 91||John Turner, a Liberal party politician who served stints as Canada’s justice and finance ministers before a very brief turn as the country’s 17th prime minister, has died at age 91, his family reported Saturday.Marc Kealey, a former aide speaking on behalf of Turner’s relatives as a family friend, said Turner died peacefully in his sleep at home in Toronto on Friday night.Turner failed to live up to the great expectations of his early career, serving as prime minister for just 79 days in 1988 after a difficult, decades-long climb to the top job.A track star, Turner graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1949, winning a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University. After studying law, he went to Paris to work on a doctorate at the Sorbonne.The young lawyer caused a stir when he danced with Princess Margaret at a party in 1959, giving rise to speculation that the two would become a couple. The two remained friends for life.Turner moved to Montreal to practice law but was lured into politics in 1962.As justice minister in Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s Cabinet from 1968 to 1972, Turner proposed a national legal aid system — an issue close to his heart — and created the Federal Court, among other reforms.He defended the decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion in the 1960s He was named finance minister in 1972 and held the job for three turbulent years, marked by high unemployment and high rates of inflation.As Liberal party leader and Canada’s new prime minister, he decisively lost the 1988 federal election to Brian Mulroney over the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, which Turner vehemently opposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-canadian-prime-minister-john-turner-dies-at-91/story-a3ibo3dzm167rIdKBsFh9L.html

20-09-2020||World||White House receives envelope containing poison ricin: Official||Federal officials intercepted an envelope addressed to the White House that contained the poison ricin, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The letter was intercepted at a government facility that screens mail addressed to the White House and President Donald Trump, the official said. A preliminary investigation indicated it tested positive for ricin, a poison found naturally in castor beans, the official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal investigators were working to determine where the enveloped originated and who mailed it. The FBI, the Secret Service and the US Postal Inspection Service were leading the investigation. In a statement, the FBI said agents were working to investigate “a suspicious letter received at a US government mail facility” and that there is “no known threat to public safety.” A Navy veteran was arrested in 2018 and confessed to sending envelopes to Trump and members of his administration that contained the substance from which ricin is derived. Authorities said the man, William Clyde Allen III, sent the envelopes with ground castor beans to the president, FBI Director Christopher Wray, along with then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, then-CIA Director Gina Haspel, Adm. John Richardson, who at the time was the Navy’s top officer, and then-Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. The letters were intercepted, and no one was hurt. In 2014, a Mississippi man was sentenced to 25 years in prison after sending letters dusted with ricin to President Barack Obama and other officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/envelope-addressed-to-white-house-contained-poison-ricin-official/story-SfCmLXtKXcSFj5XGnMferL.html

20-09-2020||World||Donald Trump says he expects to nominate Ginsburg replacement next week||President Donald Trump said he expects to nominate a replacement for the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court next week and that he’ll likely select a woman.“I’ll be making my choice soon,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House on Saturday for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “We’ll have a nominee very soon.”He said that choosing a woman “would certainly be appropriate” to replace Ginsburg, and complimented two Appeals Court judges said to be on his shortlist, Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa.Barrett is “very highly respected,” he said. He said Lagoa is an “extraordinary person” and “Hispanic.”Both are Trump appointments to the circuit courts and are on a list of more than 40 potential Supreme Court picks he issued earlier this month.Trump said it “would be very good” if the Senate confirmed his choice before the Nov. 3 election and that he expects the process “is going to move very quickly, actually.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a statement Friday less than two hours after Ginsburg’s death was announced promised Trump’s nominee would get a vote, but he gave no timetable for when that would be.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Saturday he’s had multiple conversations with McConnell about the confirmation.“We talked about the Supreme Court process and what to expect from the Senate,” Meadows said. “The discussion was more directed at process than individual persons.”Many of Trump’s allies, conservative activists and Republican aides believe there’s not enough time for a confirmation vote before the Nov. 3 election, people familiar with the matter said.That raises the specter of a handful of defeated, lame-duck senators voting on Trump’s choice for a lifetime appointment to the court, even if the president also loses re-election.If that happens, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, told colleagues in a conference call Saturday, “then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table.”Some Democratic activists are already advocating for Joe Biden, if he’s elected president, to expand the Supreme Court with new justices who would dilute the current conservative majority.McConnell could call a vote anytime he is certain of having at least 50 senators supporting confirmation. With 53 Republicans in the 100-member Senate, McConnell can afford to lose three senators and still confirm Trump’s pick with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote.The question may be whether whether a pre-election vote is not only practical but politically viable.At least seven incumbent Republican senators face tough re-election contests, and a pending fight over a pivotal Supreme Court seat could energize the party’s voting base, though it also risks motivating Democrats.Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican facing a difficult re-election contest this year, on Saturday became the first Republican to declare that a new justice should be selected by the winner of the presidential election.“In fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the president or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the president who is elected on November 3rd,” she said in a statement.On Friday, before the announcement of Ginsburg’s death, GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski, who isn’t up for re-election until 2022, told Alaska Public Radio that if there were a vacancy on the court this year she wouldn’t vote to confirm a nominee before the election.Republican senators will be under tremendous pressure in a tight election year from anti-abortion groups and evangelicals to take what could be their last chance to overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that made abortion legal.North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents in 2020, tweeted out a statement saying he would vote for Trump’s still-unnamed pick, sight unseen. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, another endangered Republican on the ballot, also tweeted that the Senate should vote on Trump’s nomination.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that considers court nominees, tweeted Saturday that he would support Trump “in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg.” Graham also is up for re-election and is facing a surprisingly strong challenge.Trump has pressed GOP senators to line up behind him.“We’re now, right now we’re here, and we have an obligation to the voters. It’s a very simple thing,” he said. “That’s now the way I read it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-expects-to-nominate-ginsburg-replacement-next-week/story-U5R99YSpdpOPqPuLprMZTK.html
20-09-2020||World||As Covid-19 cases rise, UK eyes more curbs||The Boris Johnson government is considering imposing another nationwide lockdown after the UK reported a fresh surge of Covid-19 cases - 4,322 infections were recorded on Friday - with experts and ministers huddled in meetings over the weekend amid growing ire over steps taken to stop the spread of the virus.Johnson admitted major challenges in providing tests and saw a second wave coming after similar spikes in cases were reported in other European countries as well. Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson said the UK is facing a “perfect storm” due to the easing of some of the curbs.Prime Minister Johnson said, “We are now seeing a second wave coming in. We’ve seen it in France, in Spain, across Europe. It’s been absolutely inevitable, I’m afraid, that we would see it in this country.“We want to keep the schools open - that’s going to happen. And we’ll try and keep all parts of the economy open, as far as we possibly can. I don’t think anybody wants to go into a second lockdown.”Johnson added, “Clearly, when you look at what is happening, you’ve got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday. We’ll be looking at the local lockdowns we’ve got in large parts of the country now and see what we can do to intensify things.”New measures that could mean another lockdown are due to be announced on Monday or Tuesday.Canada: Two opposition leaders go into self-isolation less than a week before parliament reconvenesIn Canada, two opposition leaders have gone into self-isolation less than a week before parliament reconvenes as the country witnessed a resurgence in cases that may signal the arrival of a second wave. Erin O’Toole of Conservative Party has gone into self-isolation after a member his staff tested positive.

20-09-2020||World||Girls are quitting school to work in coronavirus-battered rural Asia||One of the first cutbacks that many poor families consider during tough financial times is education for their daughters. During the pandemic with in-class learning shuttered, some girls in rural areas of Asia countries are being pushed to drop out.Lina, an 11th-grade student in Cambodia who dreamed of obtaining an accounting degree, is among them. Her parents want her to leave school and find work to help the family pay down its debt. Lina’s story was shared with Bloomberg by Room to Read, a non-profit organization that promotes literacy and gender equality in developing countries. The group changed her name to shield her identity.To determine the impact of the virus outbreak on girls’ education, Room to Read conducted a survey of 28,000 girls in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Vietnam. It found that 42% of girls surveyed reported a decline in their family’s income during the Covid-19 pandemic and that one in two girls surveyed was at risk of dropping out.“When families can’t afford school and have to choose, they will often send boys,” said John Wood, founder of Room to Read. Financial hardships and cultural stereotypes about gender roles play a major part in keeping girls in less-developed countries from completing their education, he said.Although the full scope of the problem isn’t yet clear because many schools remain closed for in-person classes, groups that promote girls’ education including the World Bank and the United Nations’ agency UNICEF are closely monitoring the situation worldwide.“More disadvantaged families are going to have particular struggles because of the economic impact. This will make it particularly difficult for them to send their children to school,” said Toby Linden, the World Bank’s education practice manager for East Asia and Pacific. “One of the lessons from the pandemic is the important role the families have in supporting their children’s education.”The pandemic has decimated jobs and reduced household income, threatening to drag as many as 100 million people into extreme poverty. As many as 20 million more secondary school-aged girls could be out of school globally, according to the Malala Fund, a non-profit organization that promotes girls’ education. In the Asia Pacific region, that would add to the 35 million girls and boys already not in school.This is expected to exacerbate the education deficit for girls in poorer countries, where the rate of female secondary school enrollment was low before the pandemic. It risks setting back years of progress for girls’ education and gender equality in some of the world’s poorest nations.The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa showed how devastating a loss of income was to girls’ education. Poorer families needed their children to make money during the crisis, and children who found work were rarely encouraged to return to school when it reopened.The female education deficit is one of the key factors hindering women’s workforce participation and their wages. An extra year of secondary school education for girls can increase their future earnings by as much as 20%. Barriers that prevent girls from completing 12 years of education and limited learning opportunities cost countries as much as $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings.“The worrying trend is that the reopening of schools doesn’t automatically mean that all children will be back in schools,” said Francisco Benavides, regional education adviser at UNICEF East Asia and Pacific. “The pandemic has a high economic impact for the region. If girls don’t have access to learning opportunities, it’s very likely that the families and society will be less able to adapt to economic shock.”Educating girls also has been shown to lead to greater gender equality. For example, in Thailand, women hold 32% of senior management roles, compared with an average of 27% globally, according to Grant Thornton data published in 2020. They make up 24% of chief executives and 43% of chief financial officers. Although Thailand is an outlier, it shows what can be achieved when women are educated.Though other countries in the region also have made progress in girls’ education in past decades, the virus means the region “will be going backward several years,” according to Benavides. “We’ll lose progress. The spillover effect will be massive because it may also impact the generation after this one. It can take us so many years to get back to where we were before. This won’t help the Asian economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/girls-are-quitting-school-to-work-in-coronavirus-battered-rural-asia/story-yGCWJ0yhTu6Jau5Cd9gkYJ.html
20-09-2020||World||Donald Trump says he’s approved Oracle deal for US TikTok||Donald Trump approved Oracle Corp.’s bid for the U.S. operations of TikTok “in concept,” a deal forced by the president’s orders last month declaring the popular video-sharing app a national security threat.“I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too, ” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C. “I approved the deal in concept.”The new company, which will be called TikTok Global, has agreed to donate $5 billion to an education fund, which Trump said would satisfy his demand that the government receive a payment from the deal. “They’re going to be setting up a very large fund,” he said. “That’s their contribution that I’ve been asking for.”Under terms of the deal, Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. will control 20% of the new TikTok Global, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, already investors in TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd., are also expected to take stakes in the new company, the person said.TikTok said in a statement that it was “pleased that the proposal by TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart will resolve the security concerns of the US administration and settle questions around TikTok’s future in the U.S.”The company confirmed Oracle will host all its US data and secure its computer systems. TikTok said it is working with Walmart on a commercial partnership and it, along with Oracle, will take part in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round in which they can take as much as a 20% cumulative stake in the company.The deal was forced by a pair of bans Trump issued in August citing national concerns over TikTok’s Chinese ownership. The Commerce Department on Saturday delayed by a week a ban that would have forced Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pull the TikTok video app from their U.S. app stores on Sunday.TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. TikTok will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world.To sweeten the deal for Trump, TikTok promised to hire an additional 15,000 jobs more than the 10,000 positions the company already pledged to fill earlier this year. It’s unclear if there’s a timeline to achieve that target, or any guarantees that it will follow through. Facebook Inc., the largest U.S. social media company, employed about 45,000 people in 2019, while Twitter Inc. employed only 4,900, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Trump is ramping up pressure on Chinese-owned apps in the weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential elections, citing national security concerns about the data US citizens provide to them and the potential for Beijing to use them for spying. The president is trailing his opponent Joe Biden in polls and has sought to portray himself as tougher on Beijing than the Democrat.While the Chinese government must now sign off on the transaction for it to go forward, as of earlier this week, ByteDance was growing increasingly confident that the proposal would pass muster with Chinese regulators, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.Under the terms of the agreement reached early in the week, ByteDance would retain a majority of TikTok’s assets and control over the algorithm, with Oracle and other US investors taking minority stakes.Trump seemed to contradict that on Saturday. “It will have nothing to do with China, it’ll be totally secure, that’ll be part of the deal,” he said. “All of the control is Walmart and Oracle, two great American companies.”Trump spoke with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon on Friday, telling them he still expected the US government to receive a cash payment as part of the transaction, according to people familiar with the matter. They agreed to the educational donation as a way to satisfy Trump’s demand, one of the people said.The new US company intends to hold an initial public offering in about a year, according to people familiar with the matter. TikTok plans to use the proceeds from the listing for the $5 billion educational grant, one of the people said.Oracle will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.The deal came together last weekend, the result of high-level negotiations between ByteDance, Oracle and top Trump administration officials after ByteDance rejected a bid from Microsoft Corp. and Walmart to buy the US TikTok service outright.Beijing has signaled it would greenlight a deal as long as ByteDance doesn’t have to transfer the artificial intelligence algorithms that drive TikTok’s service, Bloomberg has reported.The Treasury Department said the deal is subject to a security agreement that requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius. The term sheet that’s been negotiated between Cfius and the companies will now have to be formalized in a document that details the mechanics for implementing the terms of the deal.That document would likely include requirements related to the establishment of the new company, arrangements governing its relationship with ByteDance, whether an IPO is part of the deal, whether ByteDance will have to divest its entire stake in the IPO and what would happen if for some reason the IPO doesn’t occur, said Aimen Mir, a lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-s-approved-oracle-deal-for-us-tiktok/story-sFneM4bVksAMAEgAYHk17J.html

20-09-2020||World||Joe Biden has no plans to release potential court picks||Democratic nominee Joe Biden has no plans to release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a campaign official said Saturday.Biden had come under pressure after the Friday death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to publish a list of people he might pick for the high court vacancy given the opportunity. The former vice president has only committed to nominating a Black woman to the court if he faced a vacancy as president.President Donald Trump said Saturday he expects to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg next week and it would likely be a woman. He complimented two appeals court judges said to be on his short list, Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa.Biden said late Friday that whoever wins the November 3rd election should be the one to fill the vacancy left by Ginsburg, while most Republicans have insisted the decision is up to Trump.Trump had released a list of potential nominees even before Ginsburg’s death, seeking to distract from campaign-season criticism over his response to the coronavirus pandemic.Just before Ginsburg’s death was announced, Biden was asked about naming potential Cabinet officials or justices before the election.“We’re going through that now with the transition committee of the people who I might choose,” Biden told reporters after a campaign stop in Duluth, Minnesota on Friday. “There’s a lot of incredibly qualified people. What I want to make sure I do is keep the commitment that my government, assuming I win, my Cabinet and the White House looks like the country.”When pressured into whether he would release any names before the election, Biden said, “No, I don’t think so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-has-no-plans-to-release-potential-court-picks/story-aMpBv4icmcb42JRwQPwAdL.html
20-09-2020||World||US says all UN sanctions on Iran restored, but world yawns||The Trump administration declared Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been restored, a move most of the rest of the world rejects as illegal and sets the stage for an ugly showdown at the world body ahead of its annual General Assembly.The administration said that its triggering of the “snapback” mechanism in the UN Security Council resolution that enshrined the 2015 Iran nuclear deal had taken effect at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. That is 30 days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified the council that Iran was in “significant non-performance” with its obligations under the accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.“The United States took this decisive action because, in addition to Iran’s failure to perform its JCPOA commitments, the Security Council failed to extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which had been in place for 13 years,” Pompeo said in a statement released at precisely 8 p.m.“In accordance with our rights ... we initiated the snapback process to restore virtually all previously terminated UN sanctions, including the arms embargo,” he said. “The world will be safer as a result.”The White House plans to issue an executive order on Monday spelling out how the US will enforce the restored sanctions, and the State and Treasury departments are expected to outline how foreign individuals and businesses will be penalized for violations.“The United States expects all UN, member states to fully comply with their obligations to implement these measures,” Pompeo said. “If UN, member states fail to fulfill their obligations to implement these sanctions, the United States is prepared to use our domestic authorities to impose consequences for those failures and ensure that Iran does not reap the benefits of UN-prohibited activity.”But the US move faces stiff opposition from the other members of the Security Council who have vowed to ignore it. They say the US lost legal standing to invoke snapback when President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed American sanctions on Iran. The US argues it retains the right to do it as an original participant in the deal and a member of the council.Even before the US declaration, fellow Security Council members said the declaration had no legal force, calling into question the ability to enforce snapback. Snapback means that international sanctions eased or lifted by the nuclear deal are reimposed and must be enforced by UN member states, including hitting Iran with penalties for uranium enrichment to any level, ballistic missile activity and buying or selling conventional weapons.Those bans were either removed or set to expire under the terms of the deal in which Iran was granted billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program.China and Russia have been particularly adamant in rejecting the US position, but US allies have not been shy either. In a letter sent Friday to the president of the Security Council, Britain, France and Germany — the three European participants who remain committed to the deal — said the US announcement “is incapable of having legal effect and so cannot bring in to effect the procedure.”“It flows from this that any decisions and actions which would be taken based on this procedure or on its possible outcome would also be incapable of having any legal effect,” they wrote. Thus, the three countries said, the sanctions relief provided by the nuclear deal will remain in place.US officials have talked tough about their intentions to ensure the sanctions are enforced, but it remains unclear how the administration will respond to being ignored, particularly by its European allies, which have pledged to keep the nuclear deal alive. A wholesale rejection of the US position could push the administration, which has already withdrawn from multiple UN agencies, organizations and treaties, further away from the international community.In the midst of a heated campaign for reelection, Trump plans to address Iran in a speech to the General Assembly’s annual high-level meeting on Tuesday. Officials say he will also touch on his brokering of agreements for Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize relations in part to solidify a regional bulwark against Iran.And, as he seeks to demonstrate statesmanlike credentials ahead of the election, Trump has injected another element of uncertainty into the mix by threatening to retaliate “1,000 times” harder against Iran if it attacks US personnel overseas.Iran earlier Saturday warned that it may still strike US interests to avenge the death of a top Iranian general in an American airstrike earlier this year. But the head of the country’s Revolutionary Guard Corps mocked a report that it was plotting to assassinate the US ambassador to South Africa, saying Iran’s response would target people directly or indirectly involved in the general’s death.Amid uncertainty over that, the other 14 members of the Security Council and all but about five of the UN‘s 195 member states say the US lost its legal standing to act on sanctions when Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord more than two years ago.Pompeo traveled to the United Nations on Aug. 20 to formally notify the Security Council that the US was triggering snapback because Iran is not complying with the nuclear deal. He dismissed suggestions that the administration was engaged in anything legally questionable or even controversial.He has said the snapback mechanism was the “one thing that the previous administration got right” in the nuclear deal that Trump has denounced as the worst deal ever negotiated. Yet, aside from Israel and the Gulf Arab states, almost no country in the world agrees with the US.Trump administration officials have been attacking the 2015 nuclear deal for years. They say it is fatally flawed because certain restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity gradually expire and will allow the country to eventually develop atomic weapons.The immediate concern of the US has been the indefinite extension of the arms embargo that would otherwise expire on Oct. 18. The Security Council rejected a US effort to extend the embargo in a lopsided vote which saw the United States get support from only one country, the Dominican Republic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-all-un-sanctions-on-iran-restored-but-world-yawns/story-I7x7pspfJsMngkLnemvHHP.html
20-09-2020||World||Homes burned as winds push California fire into desert floor||Strong afternoon winds intensified a wildfire burning for nearly two weeks in mountains northeast of Los Angeles, prompting authorities to issue new evacuation orders Saturday for desert communities that lost some homes a day earlier.Meanwhile, officials were investigating the death of a firefighter on the lines of another Southern California wildfire that erupted earlier this month from a smoke-generating pyrotechnic device used by a couple to reveal their baby’s gender.The death occurred Thursday in San Bernardino National Forest as crews battled the El Dorado Fire about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, the U.S. Forest Service said in a statement.Also read: California wildfire smoke blankets parts of CanadaIn northern Los Angeles County, firefighters focused on protecting homes Saturday as increasingly erratic winds pushed the Bobcat Fire toward foothill communities in the Antelope Valley after churning all the way across the San Gabriel Mountains. An evacuation order was issued Saturday for all residents in that zone as the fire burned toward Wrightwood, a mountain community of 4,000, said fire spokesman Andrew Mitchell.The fire grew to 142 square miles (368 square kilometers) on Saturday when winds pushed the flames into Juniper Hills.Some residents fled as blowing embers sparked spot fires, hitting some homes but sparing others. Bridget Lensing feared her family’s house was lost on Friday after seeing on Twitter that a neighbor’s house three doors down went up in flames.The house stood when she made her way back Saturday afternoon but her neighbors’ houses in the remote community were burned to the ground.“Everything around us is gone,” she said.The extent of the destruction in the area about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of downtown LA wasn’t immediately clear. But, Los Angeles County park officials said the blaze destroyed the nature center at Devil’s Punchbowl Natural Area, a geological wonder that attracts some 130,000 visitors per year.No injuries were reported.On the south side of the Bobcat Fire, firefighters continued to protect Mount Wilson, which overlooks greater Los Angeles and has a historic observatory founded more than a century ago and numerous broadcast antennas serving Southern California.Also read: Thousands of firefighters battle US West Coast blazes amid ‘overwhelming’ ruinThe fire that started Sept. 6 had already doubled in size over the last week. It is 15% contained.Officials said the fire has been challenging because it is burning in areas that have not burned in decades, and because the firestorms across California have limited resources. There were about 1,660 firefighters on the lines.The name of the firefighter killed in the nearby El Dorado Fire was being withheld until family members are notified. The body was escorted down the mountain in a procession of first-responder vehicles. No other information was released about the circumstances of the death.A statement from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said it was the 26th death involving wildfires besieging the state.A new blaze sparked by a vehicle that caught fire was growing in wilderness outside Palm Springs.To the north, a fire burning for nearly a month in Sequoia National Forest roared to life again Friday and prompted evacuation orders for the central California mountain communities of Silver City and Mineral King.More than 7,900 wildfires have burned more than 5,468 square miles (14,164 square kilometers) in California this year, including many since a mid-August barrage of dry lightning ignited parched vegetation.The El Dorado Fire has burned more than 34 square miles (89 square kilometers) and was 59% contained, with 10 buildings destroyed and six damaged.Cal Fire said earlier this month that the El Dorado Fire was ignited Sept. 5 when a couple, their young children and someone there to record video staged the baby gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains.The device was set off in a field and quickly ignited dry grass. The couple frantically tried to use bottled water to extinguish the flames and called 911.Authorities have not released the identities of the couple, who could face criminal charges and be held liable for the cost of fighting the fire.Throughout the Northwest, firefighters welcomed cooler weather and rain, as well as much-improved air quality and visibility that would allow some to survey fire activity with drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/homes-burned-as-winds-push-california-fire-into-desert-floor/story-eNqmgiypNciLlLnpE9MpBN.html
20-09-2020||World||Ruth Bader Ginsburg, liberal jurist and American feminist icon, dies||Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg moved slowly.When court was in session, she often had her head down, sometimes leading visitors to think she was asleep. She once acknowledged that she did occasionally nod off. But it was a mistake to equate her gait and gaze with frailty, for Ginsburg showed over and over a steely resilience in the face of personal loss and health problems that made the diminutive New Yorker a towering women’s rights champion and forceful presence at the court over 27 years.Ginsburg, affectionately known as the Notorious RBG, died on Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer in Washington at 87.But even as large crowds of mourners gathered outside the Supreme Court to pay tribute to the liberal jurist, battle lines were forming. Her death has added new weight to the November 3 election, potentially giving President Trump a chance to expand the court’s conservative majority to 6-3 at a time of a gaping political divide in America.Supreme Court appointments require Senate confirmation, and Trump’s fellow Republicans control the chamber, holding 53 seats of the 100 seats. Democrats lack the votes to block any Trump nominee unless some Republican senators join them. Early on Saturday, Trump urged the Republican-run Senate to consider “without delay” his upcoming nomination to fill the Supreme Court seat. “We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay!” he wrote in a tweet. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said any vote should come after the election. “Voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider,” Biden said. The impending clash over the vacant seat — when to fill it and with whom — is sure to significantly affect the stretch run of the presidential race, further stirring passions in a nation already reeling from the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people, left millions unemployed and heightened partisan tensions and anger.For liberals who considered Ginsburg a heroine, the grief they have expressed over her death was tinged with fear over what happens next. Conservative activists for years have sought to get enough votes on the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalised abortion nationwide. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to appoint justices who would overturn that landmark decision. In her final years on the court, Ginsburg was the unquestioned leader of the liberal justices, as outspoken in dissent as she was cautious in earlier years.Ginsburg was outspoken in her condemnations of President Trump, a man she criticised for his “ego” and whose impact on the court she said she did not “even want to contemplate”.Just a few days before her death, Ginsburg dictated the statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,” US media reported. In 2019, doctors treated Ginsburg with radiation for a tumour on her pancreas. She maintained an active schedule even during the three weeks of radiation. When she revealed a recurrence of her cancer in July 2020, this time with lesions on her liver that were treated with chemotherapy every two weeks, Ginsburg said she remained “fully able” to continue as a justice.Her determination was perhaps most evident on the day the court met for the final time in June 2010. Her husband had died a day earlier, and her children told her their father would want her to go to work. The justices filed into the courtroom that Monday, and Ginsburg was there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-liberal-jurist-and-american-feminist-icon-dies/story-0Fv97Zl8ieUWxVKqV6xufK.html

Thapar’s name was on the US president’s shortlist to replace justice Stephen Kennedy in 2018, but he eventually picked Brett Kavanaugh. Thapar, 51, is a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump thanked former Senate leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, for removing a rule that required 60 votes to confirm a nominee. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. All presidential nominations to certain federal positions must be confirmed or rejected by the Senate.Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell has already indicated that he is ready to start the process, saying in a statement that Trump’s nominee will get a vote.

20-09-2020||World||Trump touts ‘fantastic’ TikTok deal with Walmart and Oracle||Donald Trump on Saturday touted a “fantastic” deal that could see Oracle and Walmart become the US tech partners for TikTok, which the president is seeking to ban over security concerns.“I think it’s going to be a fantastic deal,” Trump said. “I have given the deal my blessing. If they get it done that’s great, if they don’t that’s okay too.”The United States on Friday ordered a ban on downloads of the wildly popular Chinese-owned video app, escalating a fight with Beijing over technology.TikTok users could keep accessing the service through November 12, a timeframe that potentially allows for a tie-up between TikTok -- owned by China’s ByteDance -- and a US company to safeguard data for the app to allay Washington’s security concerns.With Trump facing a tough re-election campaign, US officials have described the measures as essential to safeguard against potential Chinese espionage through the platforms.But in response China’s Commerce Ministry on Saturday condemned what it called US “bullying,” saying it violated international trade norms and that there was no evidence of any security threat, shortly before launching a mechanism that would allow it to sanction foreign companies.Trump critics have said that while TikTok’s security risks were unclear, the sweeping ban raises concerns about the government’s ability to regulate free expression.The ban ramps up the battle with Beijing over technology, which some analysts say is based more on competitive than security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-touts-fantastic-tiktok-deal-with-walmart-and-oracle/story-CuY3gELgd5gWe55sx5mxoI.html

20-09-2020||World||Kamala Harris has ‘totally run away’ from Indian-Americans, says Donald Trump’s son||US President Donald Trump’s son Eric has alleged that Senator Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate, has “totally run away” from the Indian-American community. Harris, 55, is the first-ever black, African-American and Indian-origin person to have been nominated by a major political party as its vice-presidential candidate. Eric Trump, the second son of the president, charged Harris of not associating herself with the community at an event in Atlanta early this week at the formal launch of Indian Voices for Trump, wherein he accused the opposition Democratic Party of coming under the influence of the radical left.Also read: Trump’s son Eric agrees to sit for questioning in New York probe, after the election “You just look at Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris is of Indian descent and she’s totally run away from the community,” Eric said in his address to the Indian Voices for Trump. “I think the Indian community knows that. And you know, she’s not going around saying that she’s of Indian descent. In fact, she’s going around saying the exact opposite,” Eric said, urging the Indian-American community to support and re-elect his father as against the Opposition Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Harris. “You look at what this party stands for. You look at what the radical left stands for the lack of organised religion. They want to go after businesses. They want to increase taxes in ways that have never been thought possible. And you have so many business owners in this room right now. “Look at this latest plan to increase taxes by USD 4 trillion… 82 per cent of people, which is pretty much every taxpayer... mean, all things that would absolutely tank the economy,” he said. Indian-Americans have traditionally been supporters of the Democratic Party. However, Trump, with his intensive outreach, has made a big dent into this traditional vote bank, according to a recent survey. According to the survey released by Indiaspora and Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Data early this week, 66 per cent Indian-Americans currently favour Biden and 28 per cent favour Trump while six per cent were undecided. Notably in the 2016 presidential election, 77 per cent voted for former US secretary Hillary Clinton, and 16 per cent for Trump. In 2012, as many as 84 per cent Indian-Americans voted for Barack Obama.Also read: Indian-Americans represent ‘best of America’, says Donald Trump’s son Al Mason, co-chair of Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee, who was the first to report about this trend, said that the results of his survey in battleground states show that as many as 50 per cent of potential Indian-American voters, the vast majority of whom traditionally have voted for Democrats in the past presidential elections, will defect from the Democratic Party and vote for Trump in 2020. The nomination of Harris as the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate has generated enthusiasm in the Indian-American community. However, many members of the community have expressed their apprehensions over several of her policies and that of the Biden campaign. Harris in her speeches, including her historic address at the Democratic National Convention, rarely forgets to mention the deep influence that her Indian mother Shyamala Harris had on her life and how her upbringing prepared her for the role she is seeking today. The vice presidential candidate in her social media posts has also talked about the deep influence on her of India’s freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi that was based on the philosophy of non-violence, peace and truth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-has-totally-run-away-from-indian-americans-says-donald-trump-s-son/story-ndz4ZpCvcFVogzqEgeUFAJ.html
20-09-2020||India||Ahead of Uttarakhand assembly session, speaker Premchand Aggarwal tests positive for Covid-19||Three days ahead of the assembly session, Uttarakhand speaker Premchand Aggarwal has tested positive for Covid-19 in the antigen test on Sunday afternoon. This comes a day after the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Indira Hridayesh tested positive for coronavirus. “I tested positive for Covid-19 through an antigen test on Sunday afternoon. Doctors have advised me to stay at home as I do not have symptoms. I will be in home isolation and in constant touch with my doctors,” Aggarwal said. When asked whether he would be virtually joining the three day assembly session scheduled from September 23, Aggarwal said, “The assembly session will take place as scheduled, even if I am not able to join through any online mode. The deputy speaker will handle the assembly proceedings.” Meanwhile, politics heated up in Uttarakhand after Congress leader and leader of opposition Hriyadesh alleged that the government had failed in handling the Covid-19 epidemic after she was allegedly not given a bed for treatment at a top private hospital in Dehradun. Sumit Hridayesh, her son, said, “Even after waiting for over four hours, my mother was not given a bed at a top private hospital in Dehradun. On Saturday, we shifted her from Susheela Tiwari Hospital in Haldwani to Dehradun, but she was not given a bed even after calls from the state assembly speaker and the cabinet ministers. She is now being treated at a private hospital in Gurgaon.” Reacting to the allegations levelled by the leader of opposition, Bipin Kainthola, state BJP spokesperson said, “Coronavirus does not infect people looking at who is a VIP or not. Congress leaders should not politicise this matter, the government is doing everything possible to give the best possible treatment to people during the time of this epidemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-uttarakhand-assembly-session-speaker-premchand-aggarwal-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-qeEQJWpmINq1VhrGtTyL7H.html
20-09-2020||India||1.67 million people in J&K given domicile certificates: Centre||As many as 1.67 million people in Jammu and Kashmir have been given domicile certificates so far, the government told the Lok Sabha on Sunday. In his reply to a written question, union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said that according to information provided by the Jammu and Kashmir administration, a total of 21,13,879 people had applied for domicile certificates. A total of 16,79,520 people were given the certificates, he said, adding altogether 1,21,630 applications had been rejected for not providing the required documents. He said the Rule 5 of the Jammu and Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure) Rules, 2020, mandates certain documents which are to be attached with an application. As per the registration records maintained with the Provincial Rehabilitation Officer (PRO), Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 6,565 families were registered as displaced families from the Chhamb Niabat area during the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971. For the displaced families of 1971, agricultural land at the rate of 4 acres (irrigated) or 6 acres (un-irrigated) was allotted, Reddy said, adding a cash compensation of Rs 7,500 per family was also paid. He said that due to the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947, a total of 31,619 families got displaced from Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK), out of which 26,319 families got registered and settled in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. A total of 5,300 families, who were initially registered with the PRO, Jammu and Kashmir, subsequently moved to other parts of the country, the minister added. In reply to another question, he said there are no restrictions on movement of any individual, including the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Based on inputs received from the law enforcement agencies in view of the prevailing security situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Reddy said the movement of some individuals, who are under protection, got restricted to ensure their safety and security after the nullification of Article 370 a year ago. The Article conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir, which has been divided into Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh.“At present, there are no restrictions on movement but for the security advisories to maintain the law and order situation and no person is under house arrest in Jammu and Kashmir for reasons not related to public health guidelines,” he said. The minister said there are no restrictions on the movement of any individual, including PDP leaders. “Considering the law and order and security situation of a particular area, it is imperative that prior intimation is given by the protected persons regarding their movements etc.,” Reddy said. To another written question, Reddy said internet restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir are in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India. “The internet services are already available in Kashmir on fixed line and that too without any speed restrictions as well as 2G speed mobile data services are also operational since January 24, 2020. Restrictions on accessing social media sites have also been lifted from March onwards,” he said. “The 2G mobile internet speed is not an impediment in Covid control measures including dissemination of information to general public as well as health workers. E-learning apps and education and e-learning websites of the government are accessible over 2G internet for downloading e-books and other study material,” added Reddy. He said high-speed 4G mobile data services have started in Ganderbal and Udhampur districts of the Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-67mn-people-in-j-k-given-domicile-certificates-centre/story-HTyO5NZ5Q5Ywtjdw0Ie6VL.html
20-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand Assembly curtailed to one day, no question hour||After Uttarakhand assembly Speaker, leader of Opposition and many MLAs tested positive for Covid-19, the Business Advisory Committee of the legislative assembly, which met here on Sunday evening, decided to curtail the assembly session from three days to one day, with no question hour. The three-day assembly session was scheduled to start from September 23. Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and MLA from Haridwar said during the meeting it was decided that as many MLAs and Speaker of the House have tested positive and cases in the state are soaring, the three-day session be curtailed to one day with no question hour. Kaushik said arrangements have also been made for virtual participation of the MLAs in the assembly proceedings if they don’t want to attend the session physically. “We have made arrangements for the virtual participation from the districts through NIC (National Informatics Centre). The aim is to ensure the safety of the MLAs at a time when the Covid cases are spiking in the state and many legislators have already tested positive, including the Speaker”, he said. Kaushik said in case of MLAs who will be attending the session physically, they will have to go through the RT-PCR test first. “In 71-member assembly, we have made arrangements for ensuring social distancing during the one-day session. In the main assembly hall, 30 MLAs can attend the session. Ten MLAs can attend the session from the gallery while 30 MLAs can attend the session from hall number 107 where arrangements for virtual participation have been made,” he said. “Also, 18 to 19 ordinances that have been promulgated by the state government, would be tabled in the House for approval,” he said. Raghunath Singh Chauhan, deputy speaker of the Uttarakhand assembly said during the meeting Congress MLAs said they would seek adjournment motions so that debate could be held on four important issues that include unemployment, law and order situation, Covid pandemic and inflation in the state. Speaker Premchand Aggarwal tested positive for Covid-19 in the antigen test on Sunday afternoon, a day after the leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh tested positive for the virus. Uttarakhand has so far reported over 40,000 Covid-19 positive cases and a death toll of 478. On Saturday, the state recorded the biggest single-day spike in fresh Covid-19 cases with 2,078 cases, taking the positivity rate in the state to over 7 %.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-assembly-curtailed-to-one-day-no-question-hour/story-YBywXiDH2kmzDNmm1C3qCM.html
20-09-2020||India||Critics cite crucial loopholes in farm bills||The National Democratic Alliance government termed the two farm bills passed by Parliament on Sunday to liberalise the agriculture sector as “historic”, but farmers’ groups and activists opposing them allege the bills will create a system lacking adequate oversight and make cultivators vulnerable to exploitation. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation. Farm produce, under a decades-old system, are sold and bought in wholesale markets run by so-called agricultural produce marketing committees, or APMCs, under state laws. This is the mandi system. The bill enables food traders to buy farmers’ produce from any market, outside the purview of APMCs, rather than be bound to a specific market where they are licensed to operate. Ushered in during the 1960s, APMCs were originally meant to protect farmers from distress selling by creating a system of notified markets that records all transactions and prices. Over time, however, these have often acted as monopolies, evidence suggests. In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India, revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik. While the APMC system is cartelised, bypassing it altogether will leave farmers vulnerable to big food corporations and the country will have no way of knowing what is being traded and at what price, critics argue. Intelligence on price and stock are critical to protect farmers and consumer interests both, they say. “The govt is abdicating all oversight responsibility since it is not prescribing a system of registration of all traders of farmers’ produce,” says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. “Nor does it want to build a price intelligence system even as it weakens the mandi system. How and when will it intervene then?” On Sunday, parties such as the Congress and Biju Janata Dal said the government ought to have included federally-fixed “minimum support prices” as the benchmark for any farm trade. The lack of any mention of MSP, which is considered as a basic remunerative price mandated by the government and federally fixed, in any of the legislations has given rise to suspicion that the new system will weaken the existing MSP regime. It’s not surprising that farmers and middlemen have come together to oppose the bill. Critics say the bill doesn’t consider the realities of interlocked farm markets. In India farmers typically are “locked” in with middlemen because the latter loans farmers money to meet cultivation costs with an assurance to buy their produce. HT research shows that farmers value MSPs highly and negatively view middlemen (https://bit.ly/35SWAIU). The bill allows tax- or levies-free markets, whereas APMCs charge between 4.5% to 8% in mandi levies. This will lead to a loss in revenue. Critics say the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which brings a new contract-farming regime, doesn’t adequately protect the farmer. Sections 19 states that “no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of any dispute which a Sub-Divisional Authority or the Appellate Authority is empowered by or under this Act to decide”. This bar of jurisdiction will hurt interests of farmers, they argue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/critics-cite-crucial-loopholes-in-farm-bills/story-cXkw5I5xHpSpjwEDJxhCxK.html
20-09-2020||India||Will comply with laws, says Sudarshan TV; urges SC to lift injunction||Television channel Sudarshan News filed a fresh affidavit before the Supreme Court on Sunday, stating that it will comply with all laws in airing the remaining episodes of a controversial programme relating to the entry of Muslims in civil services, and appealed for the lifting of a September 15 injunction on the telecast . The affidavit filed by editor-in-chief of the channel, Suresh Chavhanke, reiterated the channel’s earlier stance that it does not harbor any ill-will against any particular community and reaffirmed its commitment to abide by the Programme Code under the Cable Television Network Rules which prescribes the permissible limit of TV content.“I will strictly comply with all laws while airing the remaining episodes of ‘Bindas Bol’ program series on the subject of UPSC {Union Public Service Commission} jihad. The respondent (Chavhanke) further states that he will abide and comply by the programme code and directions of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strictly,” the affidavit filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said.Interestingly, Chavhanke, in his affidavit, highlighted two shows aired by NDTV, one in September 2008 titled Hindu Terror: Myth or Fact, and another in 2010, titled Is Saffron Threat Real? which, he submitted “pained” and “shocked,” him. “The deponent (Chavhanke) was shocked and pained when on September 17, 2008 NDTV (English News Channel) had broadcast a programme anchored by Ms. Barkha Dutt titled as “‘Hindu Terror: Myth or fact.” In this programme just adjacent to the programme caption i.e. “‘Hindu’ Terror: Myth or fact?”, a Hindu Saint was shown with ‘Tilak’ and ‘Chillam’ and also a ‘Trishul’ (one of most scared symbols for Hindus and associated with most revered deity of the Hindus, ‘Lord Shiva’)”, the affidavit said.The Supreme Court had on September 18 ordered Sudarshan News to file an affidavit giving details of what changes it proposed to make in Bindas Bol so as to convince the court to lift the injunction imposed on September 15.The injunction was imposed after a lawyer, Firoz Iqbal Khan, approached the top court alleging that the programme contained statements which were derogatory about the entry of Muslims in the civil services and was in violation of the programme code.The Noida-based news channel had earlier filed an affidavit on September 16 claiming Bindas Bol is only intended to highlight the alleged dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organization, Zakat Foundation, which supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants. The channel had said that it does not oppose selection of any meritorious candidate and its intention was only to highlight anti-national activities.The Supreme Court, during a hearing of the case on September 18, said that it will not stand in the way of media discussing dubious funding of non-government organisations (NGOs) or issues concerning national security. But targeting an entire community on the basis of alleged dubious funding of one organization is not acceptable, it said. The court took exception to certain visuals aired in the first four episodes of Bindas Bol which the bench said were “very hurtful” and stereotyped the Muslim community.Meanwhile, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) also filed an affidavit before the apex court asking the court to pass directions to ensure that the Code of Ethics laid down by NBA for self-regulation of TV news channels should be given the force of law by including it under the Programme Code.This would make the Code of Ethics binding on all TV broadcasters irrespective of whether or not the broadcaster is a member of NBA, the affidavit filed on September 19 added.The Programme Code under Rule 6 of the Cable TV Rules regulates TV content by laying down what is not permissible to be carried in a cable service. The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act of 1995 along with Cable TV Rules and the Programme Code regulate television content.Besides, the NBA, which is a private association of 26 news channels, has also framed a code of conduct for self-regulation of media. It can hold an inquiry against broadcasters for violation of the code and can impose a fine of upto Rs 1 lakh. But it is applicable only to its members and many broadcasters, including Sudarshan News, are not members of NBA.The Supreme Court had taken a grim view of NBA’s functioning on September 18, calling it “toothless”. “NBA says they have a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. They can impose a maximum fine of Rs.1 lakh. This shows how toothless you are,” justice DY Chandrachud, who was heading the bench, said, underscoring that a fine of Rs 1 lakh will not have any impact on a news channel.Justice Chandrachud also pointed out that the NBA’s jurisdiction extends only to those broadcasters which are its members.The court had, therefore, asked NBA to come up with concrete suggestions on strengthening its self-regulation mechanism.“The court should grant recognition to the independent self-regulatory mechanism, so that complaints against all news broadcasters, whether members or not, may be entertained by NBA and the orders passed by it would be binding on all news broadcasters,” NBA said in its affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-comply-with-laws-says-sudarshan-tv-urges-sc-to-lift-injunction/story-HvGBRfs6vCMoWiCtyw8L0I.html
20-09-2020||India||In process of amending wildlife act: Centre||The Union environment ministry has informed Parliament that it is in the process of amending the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, after a review committee submitted a report to the ministry, suggesting several revisions to the Act, introducing tougher penalties for breaches of the legislation.Addressing other contentious issues during this monsoon session, the ministry said the Char Dham road project is not under its purview and that the draft environment impact assessment notification, 2020, removes existing redundancies.The Wildlife Protection Act was last amended in 2003. “The environment ministry had constituted a Committee for drafting the amendments to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 on May 1 2018, which has submitted its report. The drafting Committee has proposed a comprehensive review of various provisions of the Act,” the ministry said on September 15. Amendments likely to be made include a larger role for eco-development committees which are joint committees of the forest department and local people living in the fringes of protected areas. “Apart from involving more local people in conservation and stricter penalties, the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) clauses will be introduced in the act,” a senior ministry official told HT on condition of anonymity.CITES is an international treaty that protects over 35,000 species.The environment ministry on Saturday also told Parliament that the 900 km Char Dham road project to connect four Hindu pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand has not been referred to it for appraisal. The project does not need to be appraised by the ministry although it entails the loss of trees and ecological damage to the fragile Himalayas.The ministry cited an August 2013 notification exempting all projects related to the expansion of national highways up to 100 km from the purview of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The exemption was granted on the recommendation of a high-level committee constituted to review the provisions in the notification related to environmental clearance for roads, buildings, and special economic zone projects. “In view of the... thresholds applicable to roads in Char Dham projects, no project has been referred to the MoEFCC {Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change} for appraisal,” the ministry told Rajya Sabha.India needs move away from a a “hyper-legal and technocratic approach” to protecting the environment, a legal expert said. “Environment regulation requires a much more reflexive approach and not a defensive one. The approval of the Char Dham project is yet another case in point when poorly thought out and hasty decisions have resulted in severe and irreversible damage. Acknowledging it will not just help taking project-specific remedial action, but also allow us to bring back progressive legal measures that may have been undone through numerous exemptions introduced by successive governments,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.Forest diversionAccording to the environment ministry, forest land larger than Delhi and slightly smaller than Goa has been approved for non-forestry purposes like mining, irrigation, and hydropower from 2008 and 2020.It said 247,843.49 hectares of forest land has been approved for diversion under the Forest Conservation Act. The ministry added that certificates of compliance with the Act for diversion of forest land are obtained from district collectors. It added the proposals for such diversions have been placed before concerned village councils and forest-dwellers.On whether the contentious draft environment impact assessment rules dilute existing norms and deprive local residents the opportunity of public consultations on the impact of projects on their environment, the ministry on September 18 informed Parliament that draft seeks to remove redundancies and encourage modernization.It brings defaulters into the environmental regime with requisite action, penalty and remediation; and introduces standardization and technology-driven processes, the ministry said.Based on the nature of the project, public consultation through any other appropriate mode, such as the electronic or virtual mode will also be allowed now. Physical hearings will also continue to exist, the ministry said. The ministry had received around 1.7 million letters and emails with suggestions, comments, and objections to the draft EIA notification. Environmental groups had opposed it citing clauses including one that allows regularisation of projects set up in violation of EIA Notification, 2006, by starting construction before receiving environmental clearance; exempting certain projects from public hearings and so on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-process-of-amending-wildlife-act-centre/story-mnFQlGvSh8dZnl8B70Vh6L.html
20-09-2020||India||NIA questions six arrested al Qaeda men in Kolkata||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday questioned the six al-Qaeda terrorists, a day after they were arrested from West Bengal’s Murshidabad district, for more than 10 hours.The agency plans to fly the suspects to Delhi on Monday after they are questioned by a team of the Kolkata Police’s Special Task Force (STF), officers aware of the developments said. The officials cited above said that the bank accounts of two of the men showed deposits that did not match their incomes. It is suspected that the arrested men are members of a common social media group. It is also being probed whether they had recruited people from other districts in the state.The six men were also subjected to a medical examination on Sunday.Significantly, the arrests came five days after an NIA court in Kolkata ordered seven-year jail sentences and fines for two men connected with the 2014 IED blast at Khagragarh in Burdwan district, where the banned terrorist organization Jamat-ul-Mujaheedin of Bangladesh (JMB) was operating a cell.On Saturday, NIA teams conducted simultaneous raids across Ernakulam in Kerala and Murshidabad, and arrested nine men suspected to be associated with a Pakistan-sponsored module of the Al-Qaeda.The three men arrested in Kerala were identified as Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen. Those arrested in Murshidabad are Najmus Sakib, Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun Kamal and Atitur Rehman.The NIA said the group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks in Delhi and at vital installations in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-questions-six-arrested-al-qaeda-men-in-kolkata/story-rlEL1g0xJyfsJbuAxkvNUJ.html
20-09-2020||India||Lok Sabha proceedings delayed due to protests in RS||Protests by MPs in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday took a rare toll on the proceedings of the Lok Sabha as a crucial debate on the Covid-19 situation was delayed. According to the new protocol adopted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, MPs of one house are asked to sit in the other House in order to maintain social distancing to reduce the risk of infection. As a result, Lok Sabha MPs allotted seats in the Rajya Sabha were unable to sit for the session as the chamber was occupied by the protesting MPs.The Lok Sabha proceedings were scheduled to start at 3 pm. However, with opposition MPs protesting against the three farm laws in the Rajya Sabha, Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury appealed to the Speaker to delay the discussion on Covid-19. Inclined to start the debate at the scheduled time, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla assured the House that any MP who can’t find a seat in the other House, will be accommodated in the Lok Sabha galleries and the chamber. Chowdhury, however, persisted and Birla agreed to halt the proceeding for an hour. The Congress leader said the magnanimity of the Speaker will set an “example”. During the debate on the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Congress lashed out at the government. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor described India as the poster child for the worst-case scenario, saying, “We have the worst of both sides. We have neither managed to stop or limit the spread of the virus nor have managed to keep the economy afloat. The GDP for the first time in 41 years will actually shrink and our employment crisis has become even worst than before.” Reacting to the Congress attack, BJP member Kirit Solanki highlighted various welfare schemes announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. He said the poor were provided free food grains and cash incentives during the lockdown.Solanki said the country has so far tested five crore people for coronavirus of which 1.5 crore tests were conducted in the last two weeks.The BJP member also pointed out that 33 crore poor people were given Rs 31,235 crore through the direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and the beneficiaries include farmers, women and senior citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-proceedings-delayed-due-to-protests-in-rs/story-mbnA5pRDsi0lkBQxUlJSbN.html
20-09-2020||India||Govt seeks to make FCRA laws more stringent||The Centre on Sunday sought to make the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) – the law that governs foreign funding -- more stringent through a bill which proposes to bar public servants from receiving any money from abroad and makes Aadhar registration mandatory for non-government organisations (NGOS) to get such funding.The legislation seeks to prohibits transfer of foreign funds to a third party and designates State Bank of India, New Delhi, as the only bank where such funds can be received. Union minister of state for home (MoS) Nityanand Rai introduced the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 in the Lok Sabha, where it is likely to be taken up in the coming week. Significantly, if the law is amended, organizations receiving foreign funds won’t be able to use more than 20% of the money for administrative purposes. This limit hitherto has been 50%. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has often alleged that office bearers of NGOs misuse foreign funds, actually meant for social work, by spending it on their personal travel, shopping or office furniture. A key change proposed in the new bill, which gives sweeping powers to the Centre, says that licence of any NGO can now be suspended for more than 180 days in case of any violations. According to section 13 of FCRA, MHA had the powers to suspend the licence of an organization for only 180 days during which no foreign funding could be received. The period is when an inquiry is conducted by concerned FCRA department officials and an appeal is heard. “This means MHA can keep any licence under suspension till it wants without cancelling it,” said an officer who didn’t wish to be named. The bill also gives considerable powers to the Centre as it will be able to cease the use of foreign funds by conducting just a “summary inquiry” instead of “found guilty” previously. Apart from barring public servants including judges from receiving any funds from abroad, the proposed bill says that no organisation will be able to transfer foreign contribution to any association/person under Section 7 of the FCRA. It also makes Aadhar mandatory for all office bearers of NGOs and other organisations which are seeking foreign contributions. “Every person who has been granted certificate or prior permission for foreign funding shall receive foreign contribution only in an account designated as ‘FCRA Account’ which shall be opened by him in such branch of the State Bank of India at New Delhi, as the Central Government may, by notification, specify and for other consequential matters relating thereto”, the bill says. Tanveer Ahmed Mir, a criminal lawyer who specialises in FCRA and money laundering, said:“The provisions in the bill give unbridled powers to the executive and officials to take action unreasonably and arbitrarily and there will be no checks and balances. Government is geared to demolish the due process in India. By making SBI, New Delhi as the designated bank, are they trying to say that other banks are crooks or that only SBI will survive in this country in future?” According to the government, the proposed amendments “seek to streamline the provisions of the FCRA by strengthening the compliance mechanism, enhancing transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution worth thousands of crores of rupees every year”. The need to amend the law was felt after it was found that “the annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts,” according to the government statement. “This has led to a situation where the central government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including non-governmental organisations, during the period between 2011 and 2019. The criminal investigations also had to be initiated against dozens of such non-governmental organisations which indulged in outright misappropriation or mis-utilisation of foreign contribution,” it adds. Over Rs 58,000 crore of foreign funds were received by NGOs registered under the FCRA between 2016-17 and 2018-19. India has around 22,400 NGOs. Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India, tweeted: “Devastating blow. Red carpet welcome for foreign investments for businesses but stifling and squeezing the nonprofit sector by creating new hurdles for foreign aid which could help lift people out of poverty, ill health and illiteracy”.  “This will further stifle the space for non-profit sector and affect the smaller organisations working on the ground,” he told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-to-make-fcra-laws-more-stringent/story-li4tp6Ajc5IpO7Ua1cgWoK.html
20-09-2020||India||MSP, APMC buzzwords in controversy over bills||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government described the two farm bills passed by Parliament on Sunday to liberalise the agriculture sector as “historic,” but farmers’ groups and activists opposing them allege that the legislation will create a system lacking adequate oversight and make cultivators vulnerable to exploitation. Replying to the debate on the bills, farm minister Narendra Tomar said the bills would not jeopardise or end minimum support prices (MSPS) in any way. He also said the bills do not end the current agricultural produce market committee system in the country. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country so that agribusiness and farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses in cultivation. Farm produce, under a decades-old system, is sold and bought in wholesale markets run by so-called agricultural produce marketing committees, or APMCs, under state laws. This is the mandi system. The bill enables food traders to buy farmers’ produce from any market, outside the purview of APMCs, rather than be bound to a specific market where they are licensed to operate. Ushered in during the 1960s, APMCs were originally meant to protect farmers from distress selling by creating a system of notified markets that records all transactions and prices. Over time, however, these have often acted as monopolies, evidence suggests. In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India, revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik. While the APMC system is cartelised, bypassing it altogether will leave farmers vulnerable to big food corporations and the country will have no way of knowing what is being traded and at what price, critics argue. Intelligence on price and stock are critical to protect farmers and consumers’ interests, they say. “The government is abdicating all oversight responsibility since it is not prescribing a system of registration of all traders of farmers’ produce,” says Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. “Nor does it want to build a price intelligence system even as it weakens the mandi system. How and when will it intervene then?” On Sunday, parties such as the Congress and Biju Janata Dal said the government ought to have included federally fixed minimum support price (MSP) as the benchmark for any farm trade. The lack of any mention of MSP, which is considered as a basic remunerative price mandated by the government in any of the legislation has given rise to suspicion that the new system will weaken the existing MSP regime. It’s not surprising that farmers and middlemen have come together to oppose the bill. Critics say the bill doesn’t consider the realities of interlocked farm markets. In India farmers typically are “locked” in with middlemen because the latter loans farmers money to meet cultivation costs with an assurance to buy their produce. HT research shows that farmers value MSPs highly and don’t negatively view middlemen (https://bit.ly/35SWAIU). The bill allows tax- or levies-free markets, whereas APMCs charge between 4.5% to 8% in mandi levies. This will lead to a loss in revenue. Critics say the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, which brings a new contract-farming regime, doesn’t adequately protect the farmer. Sections 19 states that “no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of any dispute which a Sub-Divisional Authority or the Appellate Authority is empowered by or under this Act to decide”. This bar of jurisdiction will hurt the interests of farmers, they argue. “The bills were passed in a hurry. They lacked greater scrutiny of select committees. They create a system which will leave farmers vulnerable to exploitation. We will continue to protest,” said VM Singh, convenor of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-apmc-buzzwords-in-controversy-over-bills/story-j7jecxgUqDlXjRuiQ9AqaM.html
20-09-2020||India||Beginning of unprecedented era in agriculture sector: Amit Shah hails farm bills, says ‘MSP will remain’||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday hailed the passage of two farm bills in Rajya Sabha, calling it the beginning of an “unprecedented era towards the development of agriculture sector”.  In a series of tweets, Shah also applauded PM Modi and said that passage of the bills show his unwavering determination to strengthen India’s agriculture sector.“The passage of two important bills related to agriculture in Parliament today shows PM Narendra Modi’s unwavering determination towards the development of our farmers and strengthening the agriculture sector. This is the beginning of an unprecedented era of development in India’s agricultural sector,” the BJP leader wrote on Twitter in Hindi.On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha passed two bills -- Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. The government says that these bills will help boost the farming sector through private investments. During the farm bills debate in the Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) today, a lot of ruckus and uproar took place as several Opposition parties raised strong objection against the bills. Slamming the lawmakers, Shah further said, “For decades, people who took farmers’ votes and kept them in darkness and poverty, are again trying to provoke and mislead them by opposing the biggest decision in the interest of farmers.I assure the farmer brothers that if anyone thinks for your interests, it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”“These agrarian reforms by the Modi government will free our farmer brothers from the clutches of middlemen who kill their profits, and will also play a positive role in increasing their income by selling their produce anywhere and getting the right price for it. Even after this decision, the system of MSP (Minimum Support Price) will remain and government procurement will also continue,” he further tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unprecedented-era-amit-shah-hails-farm-bills-says-msp-will-remain/story-OVcRt7ONlKVkrpEpCaD7lN.html
20-09-2020||India||Pained by NDTV’s 2008 show on Hindu Terror: Suresh Chavhanke tells SC||Television news channel Sudarshan News filed a fresh affidavit in the Supreme Court on Sunday stating that it will comply with all laws while airing the remaining episodes of the controversial programme Bindas Bol relating to the entry of Muslims in civil services and prayed that the September 15 injunction on the telecast of remaining episodes be lifted. The affidavit filed by Editor-in-Chief of the channel, Suresh Chavhanke reiterated it earlier stance that the channel does not harbour any ill-will against any particular community and reaffirmed its commitment to abide by the Programme Code under the Cable Television Network Rules which prescribes the permissible limit of TV content.“I will strictly comply with all laws while airing the remaining episodes of ‘Bindas Bol’ program series on the subject of UPSC Jihad. The respondent (Chavhanke) further states that he we will abide and comply by the programme code and directions of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strictly,” the affidavit filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said.Interestingly, Chavhanke, in his affidavit highlighted two shows aired by another NDTV, one in September 2008 titled “Hindu Terror: Myth or Fact” and another in 2010 titled “Is Saffron Threat Real?” which he submitted “pained” and “shocked” him. “The deponent (Chavhanke ) was shocked and pained when on September 17, 2008 NDTV (English News Channel) had broadcast a programme anchored by Ms. Barkha Dutt titled as “‘Hindu’ Terror: Myth or fact.” In this programme just adjacent to the programme caption i.e. “‘Hindu’ Terror: Myth or fact?”, a Hindu Saint was shown with ‘Tilak’ and ‘Chillam’ and also a ‘Trishul’ (one of most scared symbols for Hindus and associated with most revered deity of the Hindus, ‘Lord Shiva’)”, the affidavit said.The Supreme Court had on September 18 ordered Sudarshan News to file an affidavit giving details of what changes it proposed to make regarding Bindas Bol so as to convince the court to lift the injunction imposed on September 15.The injunction was imposed after a lawyer, Firoz Iqbal Khan approached the top court alleging that the programme contained statements which were derogatory about the entry of Muslims in the civil services and was in violation of the programme code.The Noida-based news channel had earlier filed an affidavit on September 16 claiming Bindas Bol is only intended to highlight the alleged dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organization, Zakat Foundation which supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants. The channel had said that it does not oppose selection of any meritorious candidate to UPSC and its intention was only to highlight anti-national activities.The Supreme Court, during the hearing of the case on September 18, said that it will not stand in the way of media discussing dubious funding of NGOs or issues concerning national security. But targeting an entire community on the basis of dubious funding of one organization is not acceptable, the court added taking exception to certain visuals aired in the first 4 episodes of Bindas Bol which the bench said were “very hurtful” and stereotyped Muslim community.Meanwhile, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) also filed an affidavit before the apex court asking the court to pass directions to ensure that the Code of Ethics laid down by NBA for self-regulation of TV news channels should be given the force of law by including it under the Programme Code.This would make the Code of Ethics binding on all TV broadcasters irrespective of whether or not the broadcaster is a member of NBA, the affidavit filed on September 19 added.The Programme Code under Rule 6 of the Cable TV Rules regulates TV content by laying down what is not permissible to be carried in a cable service.

They said it was to be collected by Cherish Gidwani, the son of the senior IRS official, who was arrested.A senior NCB official said the consignee (Gidwani) made the payment through bitcoins and came in contact with the US-based consignor through an Instagram account.He claimed that the man admitted that he used to import such parcels on a regular basis for the last one-and-a-half years for himself and his friends.He said the accused, an engineering graduate, had been trying for jobs for the past few months but failed in his attempt due to sudden recession following Covid-19 outbreak.The official further said the accused used to order drugs from the USA through Instagram or Wickr (an instant messenger application of an American software company of the same name) and the payments were made through bitcoins.He said a total of 2.7 kg of bud was seized and the best quality of this marijuana was sold at the rate of about ₹ 5,000 per gram. He said the accused also revealed that he used to get ‘charas’ and marijuana from Delhi and Bengaluru-based suppliers.He said the recent seizures of curated marijuana show that the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol— the chemical responsible for most of marijuana’s psychological effects) content in these contrabands is higher than those seized (Indian grown weeds) earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-arrests-irs-official-s-son-in-lucknow-for-sourcing-curated-marijuana-from-us/story-2o47yAeJEPEnGHt559E3XI.html
20-09-2020||India||Indian Army strengthens hold over 20 strategic heights in Eastern Ladakh; Rafales to carry out sorties||The armies of India and China are set to hold the sixth round of Corps Commander-level talks in the next couple of days to explore ways to defuse tension in eastern Ladakh even as India further bolstered its dominance in over 20 mountain heights around the friction points near the Pangong lake, government sources said on Sunday.They also said that the IAF is set to use the newly-inducted Rafale jets to carry out sorties in Ladakh as part of the overall boosting of combat readiness in view of “provocative actions” by Chinese troops including the three incidents of shots being fired in the air in the last three weeks.On the sixth round of Corps Commander meeting, the sources said a joint secretary-level officer from the Ministry of External Affairs is expected to be part of the Indian delegation as India is looking for some concrete outcome from the dialogue.“It is set to take place in the next two days. There is a possibility that it may take place tomorrow (Monday) itself,” said a source.The main focus of the meeting is expected to be on the implementation of a five-point agreement reached between the two countries.Both sides reached the agreement to resolve the border row at a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) meet in Moscow on September 10.The agreement included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The sources said the Indian Army also strengthened its dominance in over 20 strategic mountain heights around the northern and southern banks of Pangong lake as well as in the extended general area of Chushul in the last few days even as freezing conditions are gripping the area, the sources said.The deployment of French-made Rafale jets in Ladakh came less than 10 days after they were formally inducted into the IAF.At a ceremony in Ambala on September 10 where five Rafale jets were inducted into the IAF, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the induction of the fleet was crucial considering the atmosphere being created along the frontier and that it is a “big and stern” message to those eyeing India’s sovereignty.Speaking on the occasion, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had said induction of Rafale jets could not have happened at a more opportune time considering the security scenario. The Rafale fleet is stationed in Ambala air force station.The multirole Rafale jets, built by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are known for air-superiority and precision strikes.“The Rafale jets are flying around Ladakh,” said a source without elaborating.The IAF has deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC. The IAF is also carrying out night time combat air patrols in the eastern Ladakh region.The IAF has also deployed Apache attack choppers as well as Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations in eastern Ladakh.The sources said the Army has made elaborate arrangements to maintain the current level of troops and weapons in all forward areas in eastern Ladakh and other sensitive high-altitude sectors in the harsh winter months when the temperature drops up to minus 25 degrees Celsius.They said the situation remained tense in both southern and northern banks of the Pangong lake areas as well as in other friction points.There have been at least three attempts by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army(PLA) to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong Lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.On September 7, Chinese troops unsuccessfully attempted to close in on the Indian position and even fired shots in the air in the Mukhpari area of Rezang-La ridgeline on the southern bank of Pangong lake.As Jaishankar and Wang were to hold talks in Moscow, the Chinese military resorted to firing a barrage of “warning shots” into the air on the North Bank of Pangong lake to “intimidate” the Indian troops, Army sources had said.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions. China has been occupying the areas between Finger 4 and Finger 8. The mountain spurs in the area are called Fingers.China has strongly objected to India’s move. However, India has maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-strengthens-hold-over-20-strategic-heights-in-eastern-ladakh-rafales-to-carry-out-sorties/story-MPufyYSGG0hoo6dCKUNThP.html
20-09-2020||India||NIA interrogates alleged al Qaeda terrorists for ten hours in Kolkata||Officers of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday interrogated the six alleged al-Qaeda terrorists, arrested the day before from Bengal’s Murshidabad district, for more than ten hours at the agency’s office at Salt Lake in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. The agency has plans to fly the suspects to Delhi on Monday evening. Before that they will be questioned by a team of the Special Task Force (STF) of the Kolkata Police, officers aware of the developments said. An officer from the state CID questioned the suspects on Sunday evening. Officials aware of the developments also said that bank accounts of two of the suspects showed deposits that did not match their income. Efforts were being made to find out if the arrested men were members of a common social media group. It is also being probed whether they had recruited people from other districts, especially Birbhum, where gelatin sticks stolen from stone quarries have been smuggled in large quantities in recent years. The arrested men were examined by doctors from a local hospital on Sunday since they are in transit police remand. Significantly, the arrests were made five days after a NIA court in Kolkata ordered a seven-year jail sentence and fine for two men connected with the 2014 IED blast at Khagragarh in Burdwan district where the banned terrorist organization Jamat-ul-Mujaheedin of Bangladesh (JMB) was operating a cell. On Saturday, NIA teams conducted simultaneous raids at several locations at Ernakulum in Kerala and Murshidabad and arrested nine men suspected to be associated with a Pakistan sponsored module of al-Qaeda. The three men arrested in Kerala were identified as Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen. Those arrested in Murshidabad are Najmus Sakib, Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun Kamal and Atitur Rehman. The NIA said that it got to know about an inter-state module of al-Qaeda operatives at various locations in India including West Bengal and Kerala. The group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks in Delhi and at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people, the agency said in a statement. According to the NIA, incriminating material including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devices were seized from the possession of the arrested men. “As per preliminary investigation, these individuals were radicalised by Pakistan-based al-Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Region. For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fund raising and a few members of gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country,” said a NIA statement. On September 15, a NIA court in Kolkata ordered a seven-year jail sentence for two men in the 2014 Khagragarh blast case. Mustafizzur Rehman alias Saqib alias Tuhin was arrested in December, 2018 and convicted under Section 120B and 125 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 18, 18A, 18B, 19 and 20 of the UA (P) Act. The second convict, Kadar Kazi alias Kador was arrested in January 2019. He was convicted under Section 120B and 125 of the IPC and Section 18 and 20 of the UA (P) Act. On October 2, 2014, the IED went off accidentally when it was being assembled by JMB members who had taken the house on rent to carry out operations. Two people died in the blast while a third suffered injuries. The case was initially probed by the state police before NIA took over the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-interrogates-alleged-al-qaeda-terrorists-for-ten-hours-in-kolkata/story-ct5RlNSFoHEfBu7kVvMNxN.html

20-09-2020||India||Onion exporters permitted by Centre to send some trucks to Bangladesh||Eight trucks loaded with onions entered Bangladesh through the Mahadipur land port in West Bengal’s Malda district on Saturday, after the Centre allowed relaxation for vehicles that reported for customs clearance on or before September 14, the day the ban on onion export was ordered in view of the steep price rise across India. Following the order, many exporters started diverting trucks headed for Bangladesh to wholesalers in West Bengal. As a result, prices came down by around five rupees in the state’s retail markets. On September 14, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Union ministry of commerce and industry issued a notification, stopping export of onions to foreign countries. Hundreds of trucks headed for Bangladesh got stranded at the six land ports in Malda, North Dinajpur, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and North 24 Parganas districts. Uzzal Saha, general secretary, West Bengal Exporters’ Coordination Committee, said, “The DGFT has said in a new notification that trucks that reported to the customs on or before September 14 for inspection and document verification may be allowed to enter Bangladesh.” “Eight trucks reached Bangladesh on Saturday through Mahadipur but hundreds more are still stranded at the other land ports. We are receiving reports that around 25 per cent of the onions have turned bad because of heat and humidity. Many exporters have started selling their consignments in local markets,” said Biswas. “We suffered huge losses during the nationwide lockdown. The ban on onion export will add to that loss,” he added. On September 15, the West Bengal Exporters’ Coordination Committee wrote a letter to the DGFT, saying exporters are having difficulty because many consignments are sent against letters of credit issued by banks of the importing countries. It is difficult to divert these consignments to local markets as that would be breach of commitment, said the letter. In recent weeks, Bangladesh has exported around 200 tons of Hilsa to West Bengal. Considered a delicacy, Hilsa has been in short supply at local markets this year because of low yield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-exporters-permitted-by-centre-to-send-some-trucks-to-bangladesh/story-Qfn0SJkZu2YNxBYHtkrTfP.html

Addressing a press conference along with several of his colleagues, defence minister Rajnath Singh said: “Whatever happened was against parliamentary dignity. It has delivered a big blow. Rule books were torn, other important papers were torn. Mikes were snatched. Opposition members were in the well and attempts were made to climb onto the vice-chairman’s chair.” He was joined by his colleagues Prakash Javadekar, Prahlad Joshi, Piyush Goyal, Thawar Chand Gehlot and Mukhtar Abbas Naqwi.

Our government has increased MSPs and they will never be ended under any circumstances,” Singh said.

The meet will be held at a time when all four members of the Quad have serious differences with China – India is engaged in a border standoff in Ladakh, the Australian government has pledged to halt projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan is worried about Chinese intrusions near the Senkaku Islands, and the US is engaged in a trade war. There has been no official word on the Quad meeting, with the external affairs ministry only saying the four sides were in talks to decide the venue and timing.

India, Australia and France held their inaugural senior officials’ trilateral dialogue, with the focus on building convergences in the Indo-Pacific, on September 9, the same day that India and Japan signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA), a pact for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces.

Vipin feels content that he was able to spend time with him. “Above everything, I sang for him and he loved my bhajans wholeheartedly! I will cherish always those days. I found a sense of belonging and have attained peace of mind,” he said during his recent visit to his hometown Gorakhpur. ‘Housefull 4,’ ‘De de Pyaar de’ and ‘Daas Dev’ composer is working on original singles. “I continued composing for different projects from my home during the lockdown and unlock phases. This phase gave me a lot of time for myself and music. In between, I went to Chandigarh to shoot for a music video for a Punjabi singer. I simultaneously worked on quite a few singles and this week I’ll be releasing my new single ‘Pukara’ written by Dr Sagar that I have composed and sung. It is my small tribute to my father.” When asked to pick between composing and singing, he was quick to revert, “I live music, I was a music scholar before reaching Bollywood so for me music is first and foremost. Of late, singing has been my focus and I’m enjoying it too but composing remains my first love. “ Vipin has composed songs for upcoming films like, ‘The Girl on the Train’, ‘Nikamma’ and others along with his singles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/vipin-gives-a-musical-tribute-to-his-father/story-5QksM1JwtBxJDyXfqYyapN.html

Earlier we were not getting the expected price of the crops and now I think the Central government is standing with us and supporting the farmers of the country,” said another farmer.The Rajya Sabha on Sunday gave a nod to two crucial farm bills as the upper house of Parliament witnessed a ruckus by the slogan-shouting Opposition leaders.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, were passed by voice votes.As per the bills, farmers can take their produce anywhere - inter-state or intra-state - beyond agricultural produce market committees (APMCs).The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, also tabled by the Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, could not be taken up due to the time limitation.These bills will now go to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent after which they will become law.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against the bills.Describing it as the “anti-farmer”, agriculturists fear that these bills will end the mandi system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-in-maharashtra-s-dhule-laud-farm-bills-passed-by-rajya-sabha/story-YqUJPQFEOmzf5lYmUZ3fkK.html

20-09-2020||India||Clone trains will arrive at destinations 2-3 hours before parent trains: Official||With the Railways rolling out 40 clone trains from Monday, waitlisted passengers on high traffic routes can hope to reach their destinations two-three hours before the corresponding parent train, a senior official said on Sunday.These clone trains -- primarily 3-AC trains with fewer halts, higher speeds and a departure time before the parent train -- come as a boon for the passengers who have to travel in an emergency or have made last-minute plans, the official said.Their stoppages will be limited to operational halts or the Divisional Headquarters en-route (if any), thereby reducing their journey time, the official said.“These trains will reach their destinations two to three hours in advance. That’s how they have been planned,” a senior official told PTI.“We are assuming that during these times, people will travel only in an emergency and we want to make sure that on the high traffic routes, we can accommodate all passengers who want to travel.” The Railways has introduced these 20 pairs of trains on high demand routes with most trains between Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.While the tickets for 19 pairs of these trains -- all 18 coaches -- will be charged at the Humsafar Express rates, it will be at par with the Janshatabdi Express rates for the 22-coach clone train between Lucknow and Delhi.The advance reservation period for these trains will be 10 days and the booking opened at 8 am on September 19, the Railways said.“It is better to run trains on routes where there is more demand, than keeping the assets idle. We tried to implement this earlier, but not enough path was available. Now, with this pandemic there is no dearth of path and this is the right time to test the market for such trains,” the official said.“The clone trains will be primarily 3AC trains and run ahead of the already operating special trains. The zones have been given flexibility to decide how much of a head start the clone trains will be given depending on the availability of path and commercial viability it can be one hour or four hours or even more ,¨ he added.While as of now, no dynamic fare is being charged for these trains, sources said that in the near future, it can be considered. This initiative was first announced by then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu in 2016, but it failed to take off primarily because of congestion on the rail network. While the 19 pairs of Humsafar Express trains will be of 18 coaches, the Lucknow-Delhi train will have 22 coaches.According to the list of trains being run by the Railways, 10 trains (5 pairs) will operate between Bihar and Delhi under the East Central Railways.These trains will originate and terminate at Bihar’s Saharsa, Rajendra Nagar, Rajgir, Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur.The two trains operating under the Northeast Frontier Railway are also from Bihar: Katihar to Delhi and back.The Northern Railway will also run 10 trains (5 pairs) which will operate between Delhi and Bihar and back, West Bengal to Delhi, Punjab to West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh to Delhi among others.The South Central Railway will operate two trains between Danapur (Bihar) to Secunderabad and back.The South Western Railway will operate 6 trains (3 pairs) between Goa and Delhi, Karnataka-Bihar and Karnataka-Delhi.The Western Railway will run 10 trains (5 pairs) between Bihar (Darbhanga)-Gujarat(Ahmedabad), Delhi-Gujarat, Bihar (Chhapra) to Gujarat (Surat), Mumbai-Punjab, Gujarat(Ahmedabad)-Bihar (Patna) The Railways had suspended all passenger trains services due to the imposition of a nationwide lockdown from 25th March. However, it resumed services in a staggered manner, with Shramik Special trains to help stranded migrant workers reach their home states from 1st May. Then, it started 230 special trains across the country, followed by another 80 special trains from September 12. The additional trains were announced keeping in mind the COVID-19 situation, and also to allow reverse migration of workers to urban areas for work, with the country entering into Unlock 4.0.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clone-trains-will-arrive-at-destinations-2-3-hours-before-parent-trains-official/story-MIK5IDiPjSyhyf2CZdtx3J.html
20-09-2020||India||Delhi Assembly panel issues fresh notice of appearance to Facebook India VP||A fresh notice has been issued by the Delhi Assembly’s peace and harmony committee to Facebook India vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan to ensure his presence for deposing before the panel on September 23.Any defiance to the subsequent notice for appearance will be deemed to be an act of “breach of the constitutionally-guaranteed privileges” of the committee, warned a statement issued by the panel on Sunday.The final warning to the social media giant was issued by the committee chaired by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Raghav Chadha as Mohan did not appear for his deposition during the last meeting of the panel.Chadha had said the non-appearance of the top Facebook official to depose before the committee was a contempt of the Delhi Legislative Assembly as well as the people of the national capital.He had insisted that Facebook must honour the proceedings taking place under Delhi’s state legislature in the same manner as they did for a parliamentary standing committee.“Any rebuttal or disregard to this subsequent notice shall be deemed as a wilful act of breach of privilege and thus, shall entail various proceedings initiated against Facebook India,” the statement said.The committee had taken cognizance of the accusations against Facebook for its alleged “complicity” in the northeast Delhi riots of February on the premise of the “incriminatory material” produced on record by the witnesses as well as their depositions in its previous meetings.“In the interest of natural justice, the committee had decided to call Ajit Mohan as an official representative of Facebook to dispel the allegations levelled against the platform and enable the aggrieved citizens to restore their faith on their platform and services offered by them,” the statement said.The hearing by the Assembly panel started in the backdrop of a Wall Street Journal report that claimed that a senior Facebook India policy executive had intervened in internal communication to stop a permanent ban on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from Telangana, after he allegedly shared communally-charged posts on the social media platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-assembly-panel-issues-fresh-notice-of-appearance-to-facebook-india-vp/story-aDuq4czlNHdo0Xnx0V0tPN.html
20-09-2020||India||Closed for 6 months due to pandemic, Taj Mahal set for reopening on Monday||The stage is set for the reopening of the Taj Mahal on Monday after six months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Preparations are in full swing for the 17th century monument to welcome visitors, albeit with social distancing and other restrictions.A maximum of 5,000 visitors will be allowed in a day into the monument.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said they had not neglected the monument despites its gates having remained closed for so long.“Lawns were maintained all through these six months and we are all set for the Taj re-opening from September 21 – from sunrise to sunset. The tourists would go through thermal check and they would be provided with sanitizer,” said AN Gupta, the new conservation assistant for ASI at Taj Mahal. Gupta said not more than five visitors will be allowed at a time within the main mausoleum which houses the graves of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Tickets will not be sold through the window counters. These can be booked online from the ASI website or mobile app. “Taj Mahal and Agra Fort will reopen for tourists from Monday. Ticket sale will be online and the Taj will remain closed on Fridays. Protocol for Covid-19 will be followed while allowing tourists inside the monument,” said Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh. Vasant Swarnkar, superintending archaeologist for ASI’s Agra Circle, said, “The Taj Mahal will have visitors in two slots — pre-lunch and post-lunch. In each slot, there would be a maximum of 2,500 visitors. Once tickets for the first slot are sold, tickets will be issued for the second slot. In a day, a maximum 5,000 visitors can visit the Taj Mahal.” Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans will remain at a distance and check visitors with hand-held metal detectors.While no goods are to be carried inside the Taj Mahal, an ambulance would be ready at the gates of the monument, Gupta said. Those who make a living in and around the Taj are also excited. For instance, Munawwar Ali, 50, began cleaning items at his marble goods shop on Sunday for the first time since March 16. “We have called the staff on Monday after six months. We expect business to be slow but at least we will see tourists going to the Taj,” said Ali who has a shop adjoining the western gate of the monument. ‘Yes, we are excited about the reopening of the Taj after such a long duration. Once the gates of the Taj open, a day will come when international flights will resume. In the beginning, domestic tourists from nearby regions would come,” said Rajiv Tiwari, president of the Federation of Travel Association of Agra.“ASI needs to follow the Covid protocol so that all goes smoothly. The government should begin thinking about restarting international flights as European nations have resumed tourism. We have to live with the coronavirus,” Tiwari added. Indians will have to pay Rs 50 per ticket for visiting the Taj and shell out Rs 200 more for entering the main mausoleum. During routine days, it was mostly foreign tourists who used to pay extra to enter the main mausoleum.Tourism trade experts recollect that the Taj Mahal had never remained closed for such a long period before. The decision to close monuments all over the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic was taken on March 17, even before the lockdown. “It is perhaps for the first time that the ‘monument of love’, which attracts a large number of tourists to India, had been closed for such a long time,” said Arun Dang, former president of Tourism Guild and veteran of the Agra tourism trade. “This is unprecedented. Though the monument was closed during the Second World War and also during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, the closure had not been so long,” said Dang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closed-for-6-months-due-to-pandemic-taj-mahal-set-for-reopening-on-monday/story-YV86ca5AFR8dGzNuuuVfJJ.html

20-09-2020||India||India provides soft loan of $250 mn to the Maldives||India on Sunday provided a soft loan of $250 million to the government of the Maldives as budgetary support to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the latest in a string of support measures for the Indian Ocean archipelago. The aid was welcomed by the Maldives’ foreign minister Abdulla Shahid, who said it would help bridge the revenue gap and meet his government’s immediate needs. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on the tourism industry, the mainstay of the Maldives’ economy. The financial aid, first announced during a virtual meeting between Shahid and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on August 13, was handed over at a ceremony in the Maldives’ foreign ministry attended by Shahid, finance minister Ibrahim Ameer, Indian envoy Sunjay Sudhir and senior State Bank of India official Bharat Mishra. Shahid, who spoke in Hindi at the event, said: “The whole world has been confronted by an unprecedented challenge, an unseen enemy, a threat we can’t disregard, a virus that has stopped operations by the world’s airlines, and forced all countries to make difficult decisions. It is a pandemic that forced us to close our borders and our homes. “But our friends, as always, have proved this pandemic couldn’t get them to close the doors to their hearts. Even at this difficult time, India has been our great friend.” Shahid also tweeted: “Grateful to receive the USD 250 million financial assistance from India to the Maldives today. The financial assistance provided through subscription in GoM Domestic Treasury Bonds by SBI will support the financing of the revenue gap, and meet the Gov’s immediate financing needs.” The Indian side said the budgetary support was provided in response to a request by President Ibrahim Solih to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for assistance to overcome the difficult economic situation. The soft loan has a very low interest rate and can be repaid over 10 years, said a statement from the Indian mission in Male.The loan is “extended without conditions” and the Maldives is “at liberty to use the money in repairing the domestic economic situation in line with its own priorities”, the statement said. The aid is “being routed through SBI, Male so that it does not reflect in the external borrowings of the Maldives” and the Indian government has provided a sovereign guarantee to SBI for the loan. “Since the principal payment is due only at the end of 10 years, it will not put any immediate debt servicing liability other than bi-annual interest payment. Maldives is the only country to which India has provided such assistance,” the statement said. During the meeting of the two foreign ministers on August 13, India also unveiled a $500-million package to help the Maldives build a connectivity project linking its capital Male with three islands. As part of measures to counter Covid-19, India will send doctors and nurses recruited on short-term contracts to reinforce the health system of the Maldives. Over the past few weeks, a total of 500 Maldivians patients travelled to India in eight batches for treatment. A team of Indian doctors and specialists visited the Maldives in March to assist in Covid-19 preparedness and two consignments of 11.7 tonnes of medicines were provided in April and May. India also lifted export restrictions on medical supplies, respiratory apparatus, test kits and reagents and maintained the supply of essential commodities to the Maldives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-provides-soft-loan-of-250-mn-to-the-maldives/story-yEtwD2LBZX9RszJnTSmDtO.html
20-09-2020||India||After ruckus in Rajya Sabha, Venkaiah Naidu to take a call on unruly behaviour of MPs||Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu will take a call on the action that could be taken against the opposition MPs who trooped into the well of the House on Sunday while protesting against the farm bills. According to people aware of the details, the chair has called a meeting with the parliamentary affairs minister to discuss the issue. While protesting, some MPs broke the microphones on the chairman’s desk; and were seen on camera tearing papers. Some MPs were caught on camera protesting near the chair.While Derek O’Brien from the TMC was caught waving the rule book at the chair, AAP’s Sanjay Singh was carried out by the marshals later. At least 12 Members of the Opposition later sat in protest in the House, after the proceedings were over; they also moved a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh. BJP MP and national general secretary, Bhupender Yadav critcised the “unruly behaviour” of the opposition members. He said the “chair is competent” to take a decision on what action should be taken.As per the rules of the House, the decision to ask an MP to leave is taken by the Chairman. Rule 256 provides for suspension of member; it says, “If the Chairman may, if he deems it necessary, name a member who disregards the authority of the Chair or abuses the rules of the Council by persistently and willfully obstructing the business thereof. Rule 256 (2) says if a member is so named by the Chairman he shall forthwith put the question on a motion being made, no amendment, adjournment or debate being allowed, that the member (naming him) be suspended from the service of the Council for a period not exceeding the remainder of the Session: Provided that the Council may, at any time, on a motion being made, resolve that such suspension be terminated; while 256 (3) says a member suspended under this rule shall forthwith quit the precincts of the Council.While several MPs complained the audio system was turned off, hampering the live proceedings of the House through the Rajya Sabha TV; there was no clarity on whether the mikes were turned off on the instruction of the chair. “There was a lot of disruption. After the mikes were broken, the sound system was affected, so even inside the House, the members could not hear the proceedings,” said a functionary aware of the details. Speaking outside Parliament, Prahlad Joshi, the parliamentary affairs minister criticised the behavior of the Opposition. The people of the country have given a mandate to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “this (ruckus) is an insult of the people’s mandate,” he said. He went on to add, “Opposition has showed height of intolerance in Parliament today. They think of themselves as baadshah (king). We condemn the unruly behaviour of the opposition and we will never budge to such threats,” he said. Questions were also raised about the propriety of MPs shooting videos inside the House. O’Brien who tweeted a video from inside Parliament, told mediapersons that recordings were made by MPs to put on record the proceedings. He said he did not tear up the rule book and will put out the proof at the right time.A person familiar with the rules of the house said, the MPs have privileges, but if the chair deems fit, it can seek an explanation. “It is considered unethical, but since this an extra ordinary situation, the MPs may have recorded the visuals for the record. However, since the videos include what was expunged or not allowed to go on record; these cannot be used by the media,” the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ruckus-in-rajya-sabha-venkaiah-naidu-to-take-a-call-on-unruly-behaviour-of-mps/story-UZPCIwBkybnRh9C1b84GJN.html
20-09-2020||India||Tripura’s Covid-19 death rate highest in Northeast region, says govt report||Tripura, the smallest northeastern state, has the highest Covid-19 death rate in the region, according to the latest data released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.According to the data, Sikkim recorded 1.03% death rate followed by Meghalaya with 0.79%, Manipur (0.63%), Assam (0.35%), Nagaland (0.28%), Arunachal Pradesh (0.18%) while Mizoram has no death so far.The fatality rate of Tripura, as per latest data shared by the state government, is 1.11%.Out of Tripura’s Covid-19 tally of 21,507, the death toll stands at 239. Two other patients died by suicide. The positivity rate in the state stands at 6.09% compared to the national positivity rate (8.01%) while the recovery rate is 68.83%. The state is conducting 88,334 tests per million, according to the state government’s data.Among the eight districts, West district is the worst affected in terms of fresh Covid-19 cases and deaths, according to the latest report of the state government. Agartala that falls in the West District has 70% of the positive cases.Barely a week ago, an analysis by the West District administration found that massive social functions including more than 3,000 wedding ceremonies, religious festivals and political rallies between August 9 and August 26 emerged were the main reasons for the spurt of Covid-19 cases in the district. “People did not maintain social distancing and that’s the reason for surge in the coronavirus cases in the district and mainly in Agartala,” West district magistrate Dr. Shailesh Kumar Yadav said earlier.After identifying ten different wards of Agartala Municipal Corporation with 70 per cent of Covid-19 positive cases, the administration set up testing centres in these wards. The testing centres conduct 400-700 tests each day in these places out of which 20-30% turn out to be positive cases, officials said. “In order to prevent deaths, we have focused on conducting tests extensively. We have also started satellite mapping of the positive cases to deal with the situation. We also found that delay in admission of patients in the hospital resulted in their death and we urge people that if they have Covid symptoms, to contact hospital or health centres immediately,” said Yadav.Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb has already asked every district hospital to provide treatment to the Covid-9 patients instead of shifting them to Agartala. The state also constituted a special corona team comprising ten medical officers and another ten IAS officers to monitor the situation.A three-member central team which toured different parts of the state, found violation of social distancing norms, improper use of masks and late admission of patients to hospital as the main reasons for the rise in Covid-19 cases and casualties. They have already submitted their reports to the government.After getting feedback from the central team, the government framed ‘The Tripura Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulations, 2020’ to make mandatory wearing of masks and imposed a fine of Rs 200 on the violators. A subsequent offence will cost the violator Rs 400. The government which conducted a two-day Mask Enforcement Drive that ended on Saturday, is yet to share the figure of violators and the amount of fine collected.According to the data from March 24 to September 14, a total 10,560 people were arrested for violating lockdown guidelines and curfew and the police collected an amount of Rs. 2.57 crore as fine. In the meantime, the state-run Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital, the only dedicated Covid hospital in Agartala has come under fire over poor health services for Covid-19 patients after videos and images of bodies of patients lying on the hospital floor became viral on social media.After such reports surfaced in media, the Tripura High Court on September 11 asked the state to submit an affidavit on total number of Covid-19 cases, availability of medical and paramedical staff and doctors and necessary infrastructures in the Covid care centres, ways of communication between patients and their relatives, fund allocation to upgrade the government Covid care centres etc. After the government submitted its affidavit on September 18, the court again asked for further details on the state’s Covid-19 containment efforts and also the central team’s report by September 28.The court also suggested setting up a special enquiry cell to manage communication between Covid-19 patients and their relatives including a complaints and suggestion centre at the GBP hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-s-covid-19-death-rate-highest-in-northeast-region-says-govt-report/story-ieaqTLfqT1xND1gARBtPLL.html
20-09-2020||India||KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha clocks a million followers on Twitter||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s daughter and former parliamentarian Kalvakuntla Kavitha on Sunday became the first woman politician in South India to clock a million followers on Twitter. “We are a million! Thank you for all your unconditional support,” Kavitha said on her twitter handle @RaoKavitha, as the number of her followers crossed the million mark in the afternoon. Some of the prominent women politicians who come close to Kavitha in terms of social media followers are Divya Spandana (Ramya), former MP from Mandya in Karnataka (831.1K followers), Kanimozhi of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) (around 524K) and Jothimani Sennimalai, Congress MP from Karur constituency in Tamil Nadu (around 122K followers). Though Congress leader from Tamil Nadu, Khushboo Sundar has more than a million followers, it is mainly because she is also a popular actress rather than a full-time politician. “The follower count has been gradually going up despite the constraints in meeting people directly due to Covid-19 pandemic. I have been constantly in touch with a cross section of people through social media, attending to their needs during the pandemic and constantly interacting with them, answering their queries,” Kavitha told Hindustan Times. The TRS leader, who represented Nizamabad parliamentary constituency between 2014 and 2018, had been associated with the movement for a separate Telangana state since 2008. “I joined Twitter in 2010, when the movement was at its peak. I have been using this social media platform to represent the interests of the Telangana statehood movement,” she said. While her father KCR was spearheading the Telangana movement through electoral politics, Kavitha gave it a cultural thrust by launching a social movement called Telangana Jagruthi to invoke the spirit of Telangana culture and tradition. “Through Twitter, I have been echoing the people’s voice and their sentiments while carrying forward the political movement,” Kavitha said. After the formation of Telangana state, Kavitha became the first woman Member of Parliament from Telangana. She raised her voice in Parliament on issues of regional and national interest echoed on social media, national television, and regional media. “Social media campaigns like #SistersForChange and #GiftAHelmet during Raksha Bandhan evoked massive response from the people online and offline. Celebrities from all across joined this campaign like ace badminton player P V Sindhu, cricketer Virendra Sehwag, current Member of Parliament and former cricketer Gautam Gambhir, film-stars like Mahesh Babu, Rahul Dev, Nameis Nani and famous sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik and many others,” Kavitha said. Her latest campaign #ThankYouWarriors that Kavitha had run to thank Covid-19 frontline warriors while serving the society have left a long-lasting digital and real impression upon people. She reached out to frontline Covid Warriors thanking them and celebrating their invaluable contribution towards combating Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-s-daughter-kalvakuntla-kavitha-clocks-a-million-followers-on-twitter/story-qwhwkMOO3g2aTrpVCXG0rI.html

Heavy downpour has already wreaked havoc in several parts of Karnataka, especially in Udupi district where the rescue operations by National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Relief Force are in full swing. The MeT department has also predicted very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy downpour at isolated places in costal Karnataka for Sunday and Monday. An alert for heavy rainfall has been issued for Malnad, coastal regions and a few interior and northern districts for next couple of days, PTI said citing Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) officials.The state is already recovering from the floods that drowned North Karnataka last month and now is fighting the strong hits of southwest monsoon. Coastal Udupi is witnessing the worse as the heavy rainfall destroyed houses, washed away roads and submerged several villages.The heavy rains have also destroyed standing crops. Looking at the grim situation in Udupi, state home minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday issued a statement, urging the district to take relief measures.A team of 250 SDRF members have been deployed in Udupi district for rescue operation.“I am aware of the floods in Udupi inundating a few villages.

This is the result of endless dedication and determination of the Govt under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi,” Singh tweeted.“The passage of both the Bills in Parliament is indeed a landmark day for Indian Agriculture. I am thankful to the Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi for his vision to unleash the true potential of India’s agriculture,” he added.The defence minister also congratulated Tomar for “explaining all aspects of the Bills with clarity and conviction in both the Houses of Parliament.”Opposition parties demanded that the farm bills be sent to select committees but the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson did not agree to do so which led to a ruckus in the Lok Sabha following which the proceedings were adjourned till 9am on Monday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has maintained that the farm bills will increase the scope for farmers to earn more profits and expand the markets. The opposition still believes that the farm bills will hurt the minimum selling price (MSP) and procurement of food grain processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-paved-way-for-atmanirbhar-agriculture-rajnath-singh-after-farm-bills-passage/story-wHriBOdAUWbWVTUY0cklBP.html
20-09-2020||India||Pakistan rejects diplomat proposed by India as next acting head of mission in Islamabad||Pakistan on Sunday said the diplomat proposed by India as the next acting head of the Indian mission in Islamabad is too senior for the post even as it sought to link bilateral relations to the resolution of the Kashmir issue. The name of Jayant Khobragade was proposed to the Pakistani side in June, days before New Delhi asked Islamabad to reduce the strength of its high commission by 50%. The move had triggered a reciprocal decision by the Pakistani side. People familiar with developments had said on condition of anonymity that the Pakistani side felt the diplomat was too senior to function as the charge d’affaires. One of the people said Khobragade’s current assignment – he has been serving on deputation with the Department of Atomic Energy since 2017 – could have been a factor in Pakistan’s decision. The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in the two national capitals have been headed by the deputy chiefs of mission since August 2019, when Pakistan asked India to withdraw then high commissioner Ajay Bisaria as part of a slew of retaliatory actions in response to India’s decision to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. Pakistan also opted at that time not to go ahead with the posting of the diplomat who had been chosen as its next envoy to India. A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Pakistan believes that by proposing a senior diplomat, who has already served as ambassador in another post, India is trying to circumvent the effect of downgrading of diplomatic relations, which is obviously not in line with Pakistan’s decision.” Khobragade, who served as a counsellor in the Indian mission in Islamabad some years ago, has also held assignments in Russia, Kazakhstan and Spain, and was ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic during 2013-17. “However, keeping in view the diplomatic norms, Pakistan has counselled India to nominate an officer with seniority commensurate with Pakistan’s decision of downgrading the diplomatic relations,” the statement added. The Pakistani spokesperson referred to “veiled threats” in sections of the Indian media that the visa issue would “further destabilise” bilateral ties and said that “it must be clear that the relations between India and Pakistan are inextricably linked to the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions”. A lasting solution of the Kashmir issue is also critical for peace and stability in South Asia, the spokesperson said, adding India “is once again reminded of its international obligations with regard to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the Pakistani spokesperson’s comments. There are virtually no diplomatic engagements between the two sides as of now and they have also not held any formal and structured talks since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that were carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan has repeatedly sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN, with the backing of its close ally China, and at other international bodies but these moves have not had much impact on the world community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-rejects-diplomat-proposed-by-india-as-next-acting-head-of-mission-in-islamabad/story-ouaHkWwT3dgkmdLKn6axRO.html

20-09-2020||India||Farm bills passed in Parliament: Which party stands where||The Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) on Sunday passed two contentious farm bills amid uproar by Opposition members. The bills have triggered protests by farmers at several places.The two bills - Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 - were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday.These bills will now be sent to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent.The Opposition parties protested against the bill, criticising the manner in which they were passed in Parliament. In fact, the Opposition members who had earlier moved amendments refused to participate in the proceedings when the bill was being put to vote.Here’s the stand taken by the various Opposition parties:Bharatiya Janata PartyBJP president J P Nadda hailed Parliament’s nod to two farm sector reform bills on Sunday, saying they will give farmers freedom in selling their produce and rid them of middlemen.He also hit out at the opposition parties over the ruckus in the Rajya Sabha after the Chair proceeded to take up the bills for passage as he termed the behaviour “highly irresponsible” and an attack on democracy.YSRCPThe party led by Jagan Mohan Reddy announced its support for the bill. YSRCP MP Vijaysai Reddy slammed the Congress and said that there is no reason for it to oppose agriculture-related bills. “I want to bring the hypocrisy of Congress party. In their manifesto of Lok Sabha elections, they have said the same things which are in the bills and now they are not supporting the bills,” he said.Janata Dal (United)Ram Chandra Prasad Singh of the JD(U), while supporting the bills, said it is for the first time that a farmers’ policy has come after a long time. He said in 1991 when the country saw liberalisation, it missed bringing agriculture reforms.He cited the example of Bihar where the Nitish Kumar government has abolished the APMC Act in 2006 and yet farmers are getting good price for their produce through MSP and farmers are producing more.CongressThe Congress has targeted the government on the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP), calling the farmer bills introduced by the government as “black laws”. “Why the government is running away from providing legal obligation for MSP. Who will take a guarantee of MSP outside ‘Mandi’,” Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said. The Centre has tried to allay the concerns of the farmers that the MSP will remain intact and slammed the Opposition parties for misleading the farmers for their political gain.Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted to say on Sunday afternoon that the MSP will remain intact, and hailed the passage of the bills in Parliament.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)SAD, the oldest constituent in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), said that there can’t be any talks with the Centre unless the agriculture bills are taken back. This stand was announced by SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday.Punjab food and civil supplies minister BB Ashu took a dig at SAD for taking a “U-turn” on the issue. He accused Akali Dal of changing their position on the Bills after “realising the seriousness of the matter.”Trinamool Congress, DMK and CPMThese parties wanted the bill to be sent to a select committee of Rajya Sabha for greater scrutiny. Deputy Chairman Harivansh put their demands for vote and said the motions have been negated by voice vote. There was then slogan-shouting as the members tried to heckle the presiding officer who was protected by House marshals.Rashtriya Janata DalHitting out at the Modi government over the issue of the farm bills, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said on Sunday that his party has always fought for the rights of farmers and will fight “tooth and nail” against this “corporatisation of the agriculture sector”.Why did a Union cabinet minister resign if the bills were not “anti-farmer”, he said while speaking to news agency PTI. Yadav was referring to SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal quitting the Cabinet last week over the farm bills issue.Shiv SenaThe Maharashtra party took a stand against the farm bills with its leader Sanjay Raut demanding a special session to discuss them. Raut also asked the government to guarantee that no farmer will commit suicide after the bills are passed, and that their incomes will increase.AIADMKThe Tamil Nadu party, part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), opposed the bills. It claimed the bills will favour the corporate houses.Telangana Rashtra Samiti TRS chef and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had said he is against the bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country.Major farmers’ organisations, such as the Bharatiya Kisan Union and the umbrella All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a front for nearly 200 farmers’ groups, have also opposed the bills.Aam Aadmi PartyThe AAP has opposed the farm bill. The party’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh lashed out at the government alleging it wants the corporates to take over the agriculture sector of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bill-passed-in-parliament-which-party-stands-where/story-YVY2L8aXinQ99lcx4KLw4O.html

The Upper House was also adjourned as MPs from the opposition parties created a ruckus during the seventh day of the Parliament’s Monsoon Session on Sunday when the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman disagreed to send the bills to a select panel. Several farmer leaders and farmer unions have begun staging protests across Punjab and Haryana. The government has assured that the bills will not affect the minimum selling price and the system of public procurement will not be affected by these bills.

20-09-2020||India||‘My dream is to see...’: President Kovind lauds NEP in Jammu and Kashmir||President Kovind on Sunday welcomed the implementation of the National Education Policy in Jammu and Kashmir and said that education is the biggest catalyst for change and the youth is the most potent agent of social transformation. He said that NEP will prove to be a milestone in realising India’s unprecedented demographic dividend.The President was addressing video conference on Sunday attended by the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, vice chancellors of universities and other principals of colleges in Jammu and Kashmir. Here is the full text of President Kovind’s address:I am happy to address this conference on the implementation of the National Education Policy in Jammu and Kashmir, which used to be rightly called the Paradise on Earth. Through this conference, we must deliberate the methods and devise the ways to restore this region its glory, using education as a tool.In my opinion, there could not be a better way to realise your dreams than through education. The National Education Policy, approved by the Union Cabinet in July 2020, is nothing short of a revolution. So far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, I have been meeting and interacting with school children from the region at Rashtrapati Bhavan every year. In my own experience, I can say it with conviction that Jammu and Kashmir is a reservoir of extremely intelligent, talented and innovative children. I feel that the implementation of the education policy will produce students with “ignited minds” if I borrow the phrase of my illustrious predecessor Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. Such youth would unleash the hidden potential and take India to greater heights in future.Dear participants,The unfolding of India‟s growth story rests on the talent and energy of its youth. Our nation has an unprecedented demographic dividend but it can be realized only if the young people constituting a substantial segment of the population become skilled, professionally competent, and above all educated in the real sense.In this regard the National Education Policy will prove to be a milestone. I firmly believe that education is the biggest catalyst for change and the youth is the most potent agent of social transformation. And whenever these two forces have come together, it has changed the course of history.2Dear participants,Kalhana, the great Kashmiri scholar and poet, in his masterpiece, Rajatarangini‟ had said, “Learning, lofty homes, saffron, ice water and grapes: things that in heaven are difficult to find are common here”. It is important to note that the “learning” figured first among the five things that he referred to.Jammu and Kashmir is a land of rich and diverse cultural traditions. From Hinduism to Buddhism to Sufi Islam, all faiths and beliefs have found home in the cultural ethos of this land. This peaceful and shared coexistence manifests in the lives of its people. We should always remember that education brings people together; it is ignorance that divides.Jammu and Kashmir since time immemorial has been a centre of literature and learning, science and spirituality. Whether it be Mahayana Buddhism or monistic Shaiva metaphysics, Tantric theory and practice, the theory of art and aesthetics or the philosophy, language, communicative role of Sharda script or enrichment of Sanskrit literary styles, Kashmiris‟ creative innovations in almost all areas of art and thought have been highly significant. Any history of India‟s cultural traditions will remain incomplete without taking them into consideration.It is not at all surprising, therefore, that Kashmir became a favoured place for the pan-Indian intellectual community and also for scholars from other countries, to gather here and interact on issues related to different disciplines and fields of knowledge. The quest for knowledge was uplifted by the serene Himalayan surroundings, turning it into a quest for the meaning of life.I feel that a land with such a great and shining past should strive hard to add new chapters of excellence and achievements to its history. I wonder why the land of such scholarly accomplishments cannot walk along with the rest of the world on the path of progress and academic excellence.3If we want to ensure that our children and youth excel in life, we have to ensure value-based education for them. To understand your value system, you need to understand your roots, your tradition and rich cultural heritage. This understanding cannot be complete without taking your mother tongue into consideration.In this context, I feel the National Education Policy has done a great service. The most encouraging feature of the Policy is that it adheres to the cultural ethos of each region. The three-language formula which is envisioned in this policy is of immense significance and can promote multilingualism as well as national unity. However, there will be greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any state or union territory.Dear participants,Education is the biggest enabler. It enables us to take charge of our destiny and we want to enable the youth of Jammu and Kashmir to become masters of their fate. The new policy, with its emphasis on vocational education, has given us a blueprint to realize this dream.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a call to make India “Aatmnirbhar‟, or self-reliant, and this is possible only when we make our youth self-reliant. Vocational training will play an important role in this regard.The policy focuses on ensuring Accessibility, Equality, Affordability, Accountability and Quality in Education and also tends to encourage Skill Development, Experience-Based Learning and Logical Thinking. I think this will ensure new and better pedagogical standards in the country.We live in an era where research and innovation are the keys to success and development. Jammu and Kashmir is a land of extremely talented people. Its youth have excelled in every field. Today, when we are seeing a new dawn in Jammu and Kashmir, we want the youth of this land to be the harbinger of change by excelling in their respective fields. The National Education Policy will help them realize their true potential and make their dreams come true.Dear participants,My dream is to see Jammu and Kashmir emerge as a centre of knowledge, enterprise, innovation and skill development. In the field of education and scholarly pursuits, the region has set unmatchable milestones. Many of the core ideas and concepts that have shaped the Indian mind over the centuries have emanated from this region. I hope that through this conference you will make determined efforts to make this paradise a hub of knowledge, innovation and learning by implementing this policy in letter and spirit. Let us strive together to make Jammu and Kashmir a Firdaus on the earth, a bright jewel on the crown of Mother India.With these words, I wish you all the best in this endeavour. I thank Lieutenant Governor, Shri Manoj Sinha for inviting me to share my thoughts with you.I wish the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the youth, a very happy, peaceful and prosperous future.Thank you,Jai Hind!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-dream-is-to-see-president-kovind-lauds-nep-in-jammu-and-kashmir/story-SxLMI0XyKkK1jscr3etc4N.html

I also thank all MPs and political parties for their support,” Nadda said in a series of tweets in Hindi.“The bills The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, passed by Parliament will truly give farmers the freedom to store, harvest and sell their crops and middlemen. Let’s free them from middlemen,” he said.Also read: ‘Will not sign on farmers’ death warrant’: Heated debate in Parliament as farm bills tabled in Rajya Sabha“MSP -- minimum support price--was, is and will remain. The system of APMC will also be maintained. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, while showing foresight, has taken these steps for the better future of farmers, which will play an important role in doubling the income of farmers,” he added.Nadda also criticised the Congress, saying the party, in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha election last year, had talked about abolishing the APMC system, while the MSP and APMC will continue to operate according to these bills. “The Modi government is providing better options to the farmers. After all, why does Rahul Gandhi and Congress not want to see farmers becoming stronger,” he said.“Congress never brought about any reforms for the empowerment of farmers. It had neither the thought nor the will to do it. Congress has an old habit of doing politics by misleading farmers and the poor. The farmers are aware of the double character of the Congress, they are not going to fall into its mischief,” he added.Union minister of agriculture and farmer welfare Narendra Singh Tomar moved the crucial farm bills in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday, amid the ongoing protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana.“The two bills are historic and will bring a change in the lives of the farmers. The farmers will be able to freely trade their produce anywhere in the country. I want to assure the farmers that these bills are not related to Minimum Support Price (MSP),” Tomar said in the Rajya Sabha.Two bills were passed; however, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, could not be taken up due to time limitations.During the heated debate over the contentious farm bills, members of opposition including Trinamool Congress’ Derek O’Brien climbed the chairperson’s podium in protest after their demand for voting on motion to send the farm bills to select panel was not considered. They also showed the rule book to chairperson Harivansh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-to-farmers-bjp-s-nadda-after-rajya-sabha-s-nod-to-2-farm-bills/story-CvWG5B0xWsfBwS62rNMEcJ.html

Sources in the HPC privy to the matter said the letter has been written by Ravi Chopra, chairperson of HPC to the regional head of MoRTH on four points, including the formation of a comprehensive work plan to comply with the SC order. “We have asked them to submit the rapid environmental assessment report so that a comprehensive view can be taken on how to protect the Himalayas. Secondly, we have asked them to submit a full inventory of the vulnerable slopes and muck dump by September 25. This inventory has to be put in the public domain according to the Supreme Court’s original order (August 2019),” said a senior member of the HPC, who did not wish to be named. The senior member further said, “We have also written for the submission of a work plan by September 29, for sustainable restoration of the damaged slopes and authorised muck dump sites. This also has to be put in the public domain. Fourth is, submission of a comprehensive plan to bring the Char Dham Pariyojana in compliance with the SC’s direction that it will follow MoRTH’s 2018 circular.” VS Khaira, chief engineer, regional office of MoRTH Uttarakhand and project in-charge of Char Dham road project, confirmed that the chairperson of the HPC has written to them. “We have been asked to submit a comprehensive work plan on how to comply with the Supreme Court’s order and we have started working on it. We are re-working with all the agencies involved and we will send a plan to the HPC at the earliest. To mitigate the environmental damages already done, we will look into the stability of slopes to understand what treatment needs to be undertaken for slope stability,” said Khaira. Khaira said the work has been completed on over 350 km of road, adding that the road width of the completed stretch is 12 metres. He added that work is underway for over 600 km of road, with different stretches being at different stages, some at the hill cutting stage and others where work has to be started from scratch.

It referred to the fragility of the hilly terrain and the impact of the road width on the Himalayan ecosystem while issuing the order. A March 23, 2018 circular of the MoRTH with the subject “Standards for Lane width of national highways and roads developed under Central Sector Schemes in Hilly and Mountainous terrains”, states, “The carriageway width shall be of intermediate lane configurations, i.e. of 5.5 m width with two-lane structures”.

20-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha passes two key farm bills amid protests||The Rajya Sabha on Sunday passed through a voice vote two key agricultural reforms bills, which have been opposed by farm groups, even as the opposition protested against the legislations and stormed the well of the House.Opposition members from the Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam were seen on camera tearing documents – some reports claimed it was the rule book --- and rushing to the chairman to register their protest. This led the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to demand action over violation of rules. No division of votes was sought as opposition members continued to oppose the chair’s decision of extending the house beyond the scheduled 1pm closing time to complete the voting process.On Thursday, the Lok Sabha passed by a majority voice vote the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. Also Read: Haryana farmers block highways including NH 344 over farm billsIn the Rajya Sabha on Sunday, a section of the opposition demanded that the two bills be sent to a select committee for further scrutiny. The opposition members, who had earlier moved amendments, refused to participate in the proceedings when the bill was being put to vote. Earlier in the day, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced the legislations in the House. “The two bills are historic and will bring a change in the lives of the farmers. The farmers will be able to freely trade their produce anywhere in the country,” Tomar said in the House, reassuring farmers.Speaking to the media outside Parliament, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the people of the country have given a mandate to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and “this (ruckus) is an insult of the people’s mandate”. If the Opposition wanted, they could have asked for a division, the minister said. The deputy chairperson was ready, he added.BJP president JP Nadda said the bills will bring in historic reforms in the agriculture sector and those opposing these bills have proved that they are “anti-farmer”. Commenting on the protest by opposition MPs, he said their behaviour was “irresponsible and condemnable”, and that they broke the rules for physical distancing imposed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read: Delhi Police on alert amid farmers’ protests on agriculture billsTrinamool’s Derek O’Brien said 12 MPs will sit in the Rajya Sabha chambers till 3pm to protest the passage of the bills. He said the MPs had to record evidence inside Parliament and denied that he tore the rule book. “We have all the footage with us and we will release it at the right time,” he said.The main opposition Congress and a clutch of smaller parties are opposed to the government’s farm liberalisation plan. A key opposition to the bills came on Thursday from BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet over efforts to unshackle the farm sector. PM Modi has accused detractors of spreading “misinformation and lies”, while reassuring farmers the reforms were in their best interests. Modi has called the reforms a “protective shield” around farmers, which would bring “more options and opportunities”. The two legislations seek to liberalise farm trade, enable modern supply chains, allow agribusinesses and farmers to engage with one another more confidently, break interlocked markets and create a seamless commodities trade, currently fragmented. India’s agricultural trade still requires licenced traders who must operate out of notified markets allotted to them. The bills aim to sidestep this system, called agricultural produce market committees (APMC), and free up market restrictions. But critics argue the new system will lack adequate oversight in its current form. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows buyers of farm produce to trade outside the mandi system or wholesale markets run by states under APMCs, which have become cartelised over time. APMC laws require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits. The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these markets without any taxes and will therefore open up APMCs to competitions.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, lays down a new architecture for contract farming. It provides for a national framework on farming agreements, enabling a farmer to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a mutually pre-agreed price. Major farmers’ organisations, such as the Bharatiya Kisan Union and the umbrella All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a front for nearly 200 farmers’ groups, have opposed the bills.After the Upper House passed the bills, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh tweeted: “The dictatorial attitude of the Chair in not wanting to get a sense of the House, which is the convention to extend the session beyond the scheduled 1 pm, led to bedlam & chaos. The anti-farmer Bills were passed in the din without voting. Why the tearing urgency? On whose orders?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-two-key-farm-bills-opposition-triggers-ruckus/story-jpMTI6jsavLUnsU7Bi1BoI.html

20-09-2020||India||Govt proposes to amend FCRA, make Aadhar mandatory for NGOs to receive foreign funds||The Centre on Sunday proposed amendments in the Foreign Contribution Regulations Act or FCRA through a bill it introduced in the Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament.According to the government, the proposed amendments “seek to streamline the provisions of the FCRA by strengthening the compliance mechanism, enhancing transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution worth thousands of crores of rupees every year”.The proposed amendments seek to bar public servants from receiving foreign funding.The amendments seek to make Aadhar mandatory for all office bearers of NGOs and other organisations which are seeking foreign contributions.The bill also seeks to limit the use of foreign funds received under FCRA for administrative purposes from the current limit of 50 per cent to 20 per cent.“The annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts,” according to the proposed amendment.“This has led to a situation where the central government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including non-governmental organisations, during the period between 2011 and 2019,” it further says.The bill, if passed, will empower the government to ask a violator to not use the funds by holding a “summary inquiry”.After the amendments are passed, no organisation will be able to transfer foreign contribution to any association/person under Section 7 of the FCRA.“Every person who has been granted certificate or prior permission for foreign funding shall receive foreign contribution only in an account designated as “FCRA Account” which shall be opened by him in such branch of the State Bank of India at New Delhi, as the Central Government may, by notification, specify and for other consequential matters relating thereto,” the proposed amendment says.The FCRA was enacted to regulate the acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality by certain individuals or associations or companies and to prohibit acceptance and utilisation of foreign contribution or foreign hospitality for any activities detrimental to the national interest and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.The act came into force on the May 1, 2011, and has been amended twice since then. The first amendment was made by Section 236 of the Finance Act, 2016 and the second amendment was made by Section 220 of the Finance Act, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-proposes-to-amend-fcra-make-aadhar-mandatory-for-ngos-to-receive-foreign-funds/story-6OQ8z35lKN9gddrZoSq7CI.html

In view of specific efforts of the states, only 10 states are contributing 77 per cent active cases. If you see state-specific data, you will find that these cases are concentrated in a few districts,” the minister said.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telangana, Assam, Chattisgarh, Kerala, Delhi are these 10 states.Community transmission is the phase where the source of a new infection can’t be identified.The health ministers comment comes a day after Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain took a dig at the Centre and said the Centre should have accepted community transmission. “Community transmission is a technical term, but with so many cases being reported from Delhi and other parts of the country, community transmission should have been accepted. But, it is only the centre and scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) who can say so, however the infection is spreading in the community,” Jain said on Saturday.On several predictions of Covid-19 peak in the country, the health minister said often these predictions fail. “An epidemic curve has ascending, peaking and descending phases. India is at multiple trajectories across the urban, semi-urban and rural populations.

The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, part of the broader farm liberalisation plan, could not be taken up and the House was adjourned for the day.Opposition members, including those from the TMC, Congress and Left, created ruckus after deputy chairperson Harivansh did not consider their demand for a division of votes on a resolution to send the two bills to a select committee. Amid the ruckus, the House was adjourned briefly.Members of the Trinamool, including Derek O’Brien, and other opposition members had earlier climbed the chairperson’s podium after their demand for voting on motion to send the farm bills to select panel was not considered. They also showed the rule book to Harivansh during the debate on the contentious farm bills.The upper house was adjourned for a short while.Several members, including O’Brien, the CPI’s KK Ragesh, Trichi Siva of the DMK and Congress’ KC Venugopal, moved resolutions asking for the two bills to be sent a select committee of the House for consideration before they are taken up for passage.Union minister of agriculture and farmer welfare Narendra Singh Tomar moved two crucial farm bills in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday.

Can the government assure the country that after the passing of the agriculture reform bills, farmers’ income will double and no farmer will commit suicide?.... A special session should be called to discuss these bills,” Raut said during a discussion on the two agriculture bills in the Upper House.“Why farmers are protesting in Punjab and Haryana if it is for their interest?” he added.Taking a dig at the Centre over Lok Sabha MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigning from the Cabinet, Shiv Sena MP said, “The Prime Minister has said that the government is not ending the MSP system. It is just a rumour. So, did a Union minister resign on the basis of a rumour? The government is giving markets to private companies.”Harsimrat Kaur Badal, of the Bharatiya Janat Party (BJP) ally Shiromani Akali Dal, had resigned from the Union Cabinet on September 17 in protest of the three bills.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad had earlier demanded that reply to the debate on the two bills be postponed until Monday as the scheduled time for sitting on Sunday was over.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows the electronic trading of farmers’ produce and the setting up transaction platforms for facilitating direct online buying and selling of farm products.

The team visited government medical college and hospital (GMCH) Jammu and held deliberations with principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra and senior faculty members for nearly two hours on the first day of their visit on Saturday. Dr Vijay Hadda, one of the team members said, “We are here to see how hospitals are combating Covid-19 pandemic, how are they equipped to tackle it, how can we make them better and how Centre can help improve the situation.” Dr Hadda also said that the team spoke to the medical superintendent, deputy medical superintendent, the principal of the hospital and other faculty members to understand difficulties faced by them. “We felt that there are certain areas where we can improve the facilities. We have also come to know about certain problems, but I won’t be able to discuss them before the media. These problems certainly need a solution and we hope that all of us contribute in controlling the pandemic,” he added. Dr Hadda said that the team will also be visiting other major hospitals in the region.“We discussed about ICU beds, per day arrival of patients, death rate and trend of the infection. We have prepared a list of three to four major hospitals in Jammu where the team will visit. These are the hospitals that witnessed a sudden spike in deaths and they include government chest diseases hospital and the GMCH,” said Dr Hadda. Besides Dr Hadda, who is a professor with the department of pulmonary critical care, AIIMS, New Delhi, the team comprises SK Singh, director, national centre for disease control (NCDC), and Dr Ramesh, an epidemiologist. The Centre on Friday decided to depute a high-level medical team to Jammu after the district reported a rise in the number of new Covid cases in recent days. Also Read: Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, NC says ‘declare medical emergency in Jammu’Principal of the GMCH, Dr Nasib Chand Digra said the visiting team discussed facilities, reasons behind the recent spike in deaths and new Covid infections. Patient care has been severely hit at GMCH Jammu, which has become a battlefield for senior doctors and the incumbent principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra. Peeved over indiscipline and chaos, Dr Digra had recently written to L-G Manoj Sinha, opting for VRS citing interference in working of the hospital from “extra-institutional” officials. He, however, didn’t name them in the letter. Attendants of Covid patients at the hospital complained of shortage of oxygen cylinders and an unavailability of beds while a video, in which paramedics were seen escaping out of windows leaving behind patients at the mercy of God at an isolation ward of the hospital, went viral on Thursday. The team said it will support the state’s efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management of the positive cases. The Central team shall also help in effectively managing the challenges related to a timely diagnosis and follow up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-of-experts-studying-rising-covid-deaths-in-jammu-visits-gmch/story-XNPmSkHqCZNCpFNT6uNqDJ.html

A special session should be called to discuss these bills,” Raut said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the nation on Friday that after these bills become laws, farmers will have more opportunities to sell their produce without having to worry about middlemen and that this will result in increased profits.Also read: ‘Defeat them, this is what farmer wants’: Kejriwal on farm bills in Rajya SabhaOn September 17, the PM also told farmers that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system will remain unchanged. “A lot of power is engaged in confusing the farmers.

These bills are really going to empower the farmers by giving them many more options. #JaiKisan,” he tweeted.“PM has said that the government is not ending the MSP system and it is just a rumour. So, did a union minister resign on the basis of a rumour?,” Raut said in his pitch against the bills in the Rajya Sabha.He was referring to Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who had resigned as the Union minister for food processing industries earlier this week in protest against the bills.

20-09-2020||India||Haryana farmers eyeing highway blockade to oppose farm reform bills||Farmers in Haryana have set in motion their planned protest against the three farm reform bills by mobilising to block national and state highways on Sunday even as Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar made an appeal asking farmers not to block highways and invited their leaders for a talk to clear alleged misgivings on the bills, as per reports.Farmers in Kurukshetra, Karnal, Yamunanagar and a few other districts of the state were using tractor-trailers, bikes and cars to reach protest spots with an aim to block the highways, reported agencies. NH 344 between Ambala and Roorkee had been blocked by farmers as per the latest reports. Several farmer leaders were also using social media platforms to mobilise more farmers to join the protest.As per the initial reports, focus of farmer unions will be in the northern districts of Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Ambaka, Karnal and Kaithal and the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU)’s Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni will lead the agitation in Yamunanagar by blocking the NH 344, near Milk Majra toll plaza.Charuni uploaded several video messages on social media urging farmers not to get misled by the government and join the protests.“News is being spread that the national highways will not be blocked, this news is fake and I appeal to the farmers to block all national and state highways except for the Chandigarh-Delhi highway (NH 44),” Charuni told his supporters in a video message on Sunday morning.Following instructions by the state home department, the district administrations have made heavy police deployment to ensure people do not face any problem due to the planned blockade of the highways. Talking to Hindustan Times, Yamunanagar superintendent of police, Kamaldeep Goyal said, “Our priority will be to convince the farmers and we will request them not to block the highway, but if they will continue with the blockade we have also made arrangements to divert the traffic if required, so that commuters do not face any problem”.Since Kurukshetra remained the hotspot for protests, where a lathi charge on farmers on September 10 had led to criticism of the police, the district police have made elaborate arrangements to avoid a repeat of the clashes.Also Read: Khattar urges farmers to defer agitation, invites them for talksKurukshetra SP Astha Modi told HT that seven points have been identified in the district where the farmers are likely to hold protests and block traffic before adding that the district police have made elaborate arrangements to divert the traffic and ensure that the protests remain peaceful.“Even, we have made a plan to divert the traffic on the NH 44 from Pipli to avoid traffic jams as there were reports of protests by a political party in Ambala,” she added.Also Read: Vij appeals to farmers to not block Highways, takes a dig at BadalsIn a statement issued late night Saturday, the chief minister said that in a democracy, everyone has a right to express views, but maintaining peace in the state is also the utmost duty of any government.He assured that the farm ordinances are entirely in the interest of farmers and it is unfortunate to see that the opposition parties are blatantly politicizing the issue so as to achieve their vested interests by misleading the farmers.The farmer leaders said that they did not get any invitation for talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-farmers-eyeing-nh-blockade-to-oppose-central-farm-ordinances/story-rlYhb0iDv58JVn4EYnFWwM.html
20-09-2020||India||PLA opens three fronts in South China Sea to distract the world from Ladakh||Post the military flare-up at Galwan Valley, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has mobilised four out of five of its military theatre commands with reports suggesting that live firing drills and exercises from the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea to the South China Sea to date were a distraction for its calculated aggression in Ladakh.While both India and China have still to finalise the dates of military commanders’ meeting with each asking for postponement once, PLA is continuing to build-up along the 1,597-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the western sector. After the India and China foreign ministers’ meeting on September 10 in Moscow, a decision was taken to ask the military commanders to implement the total disengagement and then de-escalation agreement on the ground. The two sides are still to fix a mutually convenient date for the meeting but is expected in this week. It is understood that the meetings at the corps commanders’ level will restrict itself to disengagement of forces post-April and the Depsang Bulge issue will be taken up at a separate divisional commanders’ level.Also read: PLA’s actions aimed to test India’s mettleAccording to a report in Nikkei Asian Review, PLA has mobilised its Southern Theatre Command, which oversees the South China Sea, Northern Theatre Command, which overseas Korean Peninsula, and Eastern Theatre Command, which oversees arch-rivals Japan and Taiwan. The newspaper said that just like the Chinese annexed Tibet in 1950s against the backdrop of its intervention in the Korean war, the present mobilisation was a distraction for a real stand-off in the Karakoram-Zanskar ranges of Himalayas. For the Ladakh operations, PLA’s western theatre command has been fully mobilized with military districts of Xinjiang and Tibet fully involved in the aggression.The Korean War in the 1950s also turned out to be a distraction for Jawahar Lal Nehru government and Indian diplomacy as they got involved in sorting out the North Korea issue leaving their own flanks in western and eastern sector open to Chinese military in 1962. PLA chose to attack India in 1962 when the entire world was diverted towards the Cuban missile crisis.Also read: India readies for QUAD and 2 plus 2 dialogues, China is elephant in the roomWhile India is engaging China through both military and diplomatic channels to resolve the current stalemate, the military commanders are prepared for the worst on all the borders and at sea. They know that distraction, diversion and deception are part of Chinese information warfare with psychological operations playing the lead role before the flag goes up.By deploying three military commands against the US from South China to the East China Sea and test firing both DF-26 also called Chinese’ Guam Killer and DF-21 D also called the Carrier Killer intermediate-range ballistic missiles in last week of August, the PLA is sending a message that it can take both US on its eastern and India on its western flank. The missile firing was to show-case Chinese capability to taken on the exercising USS Navy’s supercarrier Ronald Reagan and Nimitz around the Chinese nuclear submarine base at Hainan Islands in the South China Sea. Maybe the Ladakh incursion is a distraction for Chinese moves on Taiwan after Hong Kong and not the other way around.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-war-drill-in-south-china-sea-a-distraction-for-ladakh-aggression-or-otherwise-analysis/story-I2IiROajJhYTeW0ZWyimFK.html

20-09-2020||India||HC cites sketchy evidence to uphold acquittal of 2009 Goa bomb blast accused||Acquittal of six persons charged by the national investigation agency (NIA) for allegedly planting a bomb at a Diwali eve celebration at Margao to be attended by then Goa chief minister Digambar Kamat, has been confirmed by the Bombay high court at Goa, citing lack of sufficient evidence against the accused. Vinay Talekar, Vinayak Patil, Dhananjay Ashtekar, Dilip Mangaonkar, Prashant Ashtekar and Prashant Juvekar, all barring Mangaonkar, residents of Maharashtra, faced trial under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the Explosive Substances Act and the Indian Penal Code, after a homemade bomb went off on the eve of Diwali in 2009 in Margao in South Goa. Two persons -- Malgonda Patil and Yogesh Naik -- who were reportedly ferrying the bomb, were killed in the explosion after the bomb went off prematurely. The duo were also named as accused but since they died, the charges against them were abated. Three other accused were absconding and never found. On the eve of Diwali on 16th October, 2009, when effigies of Narkasur, a mythical demon king, are burnt all over Goa, an explosion took place at a distance of hardly 400 metres from the venue of the Narkasur effigy competition. The explosives were placed in an Eterno scooter belonging to a close relation of the accused persons.The NIA investigation built a case that the Sanatan Sanstha, which had been regularly opposing the holding of any Narkasur effigy competition claiming the demon’s grand effigies were taking the focus away from Lord Krishna’s assassination of Narkasur, had planted the bomb to disrupt the competition. “The motive for the accused persons (was) to cause an explosion at the venue of the competition and thereby instil terror not only in the minds of organizers of such competitions but also in the members of the public, who, in hundreds attend such competitions,” the NIA said. The court while partially agreeing with them, however, found the evidence sketchy. “There is evidence on record that the accused persons had close links with the Sanatan Sanstha and there is evidence on record that this Sanstha for the period between 2001 and 2009 was protesting the holding of any Narkasur effigy competition in the State of Goa,” the High Court bench of Justices M S Jawalkar and M S Sonak said in its order. “The prosecution may have established that there was an explosion at Margao. However, that by itself is not sufficient to hold that such an explosion was a result of conspiracy hatched by the accused persons. There is no independent evidence on record to establish the conspiracy or meeting of minds amongst the accused persons. The evidence regarding conspiracy is quite sketchy,” the high court observed. Also Read: Goa: German woman found dead by daughter in her flatThe court ruled that that merely linking the accused with Sanatan Sanstha and putting on record the organisation’s opposition to the effigy competition doesn’t establish their role in the bomb blast.“Merely because the accused persons may have links with Sanatan Sanstha and Sanatan Sanstha was opposed to holding of Narkasur effigy competitions, is by no means sufficient to establish the accused persons had conspired to make explosion at such competition on the fateful night of 16th October, 2009,” the High Court ruled. “Suspicion, however, grave, can never take the place of proof which is required in such matters,” the high court said. Also Read: Alaya F shares stunning photo in a cutout monokini on Goa beach, says ‘freedom’The court however, disagreed with the trial court which had said that the NIA had launched a malafide investigation against the Sanstha. “To suggest that there was some manipulation in the FIR or that the prosecution was unfairly directed against a particular institution, is not an inference which could be legitimately drawn on the basis of the evidence on record. The observations made doubting the veracity of FIR or suggesting any malafides in the launch of the prosecution… cannot be sustained and are required to be set aside as being contrary to the weight of evidence on record,” the High Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-cites-sketchy-evidence-to-uphold-acquittal-of-2009-goa-bomb-blast-accused/story-rTrTFgAPji92vriz7w4z2K.html

20-09-2020||India||BJP, Opposition seek to rally support as farm bills reach Rajya Sabha||Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the contentious farm bills on Sunday with the Congress and many opposition parties trying to put a united front to oppose these proposed legislations terming them as anti-farmer and pro-corporate, even as the ruling BJP is also reaching out to several regional outfits for support. The numbers, however, appear to be in favour of the ruling dispensation to get these bills passed from Rajya Sabha, while the lower house has already cleared them despite a key NDA member Shiromani Akali Dal vehemently opposing them.Also read: Why western UP farmers are silent on Centre’s new farm bills Some key BJP leaders are said to be in touch with various non-Congress opposition parties to seek support from their Rajya Sabha members for these bills. While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is yet to have a clear majority of its own in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, many regional parties have backed it for the last several sessions to ensure passage of various legislations proposed by the government. BJP leaders expressed confidence that they will get the support of over 130 members, including nine of the AIADMK and six of the YSR Congress -- both of whom are not part of the ruling alliance if a division of votes is sought on these bills. Another regional party, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) was also being wooed by the BJP, but its chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against these bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country. The BJP itself has the highest tally with 86 seats, followed by 40 of the Congress. The three members of the SAD are sure to vote against the bills, but Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally and now in opposition, has expressed it support for these bills. The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha. Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition’s ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forceful defence of the three bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament’s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.Also read: PM Modi defends farm bills, says critics misleading farmers His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these bills, calling them “anti-farmers”. Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.    A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislations suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together. Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday. These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government.  With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as “anti-farmers” and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as “historic” and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price. A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels “saddened” that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.Also read: Agriculture bills passed in Lok Sabha, farmers protest: All you need to know  The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ‘mandis’. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment. However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as “anti-farmers”, claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests. Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-opposition-seek-to-rally-support-as-farm-bills-reach-rajya-sabha/story-EcgwrMK0EJnzIwWlII73XM.html

20-09-2020||India||Heavy rain in peninsular region to persist, says IMD||Heavy and widespread rain in peninsular and northeast India will persist till October, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday. Northwest India will continue to remain dry and Rajasthan is likely to experience dry weather but weather models are not showing monsoon withdrawal commencement from northwest India as yet.Due to heavy rain over south India and parts of northeast India rain deficiency of 30% in the week ending September 9 was not only compensated last week but also recorded an excess of 7% this week according to the weekly weather report. “A change in weather patterns which resulted in above normal rain in the past week from -30% we reached 7% excess as far as weekly rain is considered. This change was possible because of a low-pressure system that formed over Andhra Pradesh coast, a cyclonic circulation over west coast of India which brough rainfall throughout south peninsular India. Monsoon trough shifted to foothills during the end of the week causing heavy to extremely heavy rain in parts of northeast India,” said Soma Senroy, scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre of IMD.A fresh low-pressure area is likely to develop over northwest Bay of Bengal around September 20 which will bring heavy and widespread rains to east, northeast and peninsular India till end of September while northwest India is likely to record large deficiency. Between September 18 and 24 above normal rain is likely over west peninsular coast as westerlies strengthen due to development of the low-pressure area.Widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Kerala, Karnataka and Konkan and Goa from September 19 to 22. Extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Coastal Karnataka during September 19 to 20; over north Kerala and ghat sections of South Interior Karnataka on September 19 and 20; over south Konkan and Goa on September 21 and 22.Localized flooding of roads; water logging in low lying areas; mudslides; damage to horticulture and standing crops in some areas due to inundation and riverine flooding in some river catchments is likely in these areas, IMD said on Saturday. Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on September 22 and 23.There is a 12.5% deficiency in rain over the country in September; 53.9% deficiency over northwest India; 32.4% deficiency over central India; 4.4% deficiency over east and northeast India and 77.4% excess rain over peninsular India. In the monsoon season since June 1 there is 6.6% excess rain over the country; 15.5% deficiency over northwest India; 13.5% excess over central India; 1.5% excess over east and northeast India and 28.4% excess over south peninsula.“The circulation patterns are not suggesting withdrawal of monsoon yet. We are not seeing significant reduction in moisture. Westerly winds will strengthen next week due to development of low-pressure area,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-in-peninsular-region-to-persist-says-imd/story-gfTg8l4E3gt7uLNqO0U9jP.html
20-09-2020||India||Mercury rises in north as monsoon loses steam||The monsoon has gone missing from all of north and north-west India in September , and the heat and humidity the region is witnessing may last for the rest of the season, with experts blaming the monsoon trough from Bay of Bengal travelling in a westerly direction instead of the usual north-westerly one for this.The sultry conditions may last for the next 10-13 days, the experts added, at least till the monsoon fully withdraws from the region without any rainfall. The withdrawal will finally result in pleasant weather, they added. According to the India Meteorological Department, the rainfall deficit in the northern part of India in September is near total -- up to 99% of the normal, the highest for any region in the country. The southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana received up to 50% excess rain during the same period with Chitradurga district in Karnataka seeing 245% excess rainfall.In Himachal, the tribal district of Kinnaur, known for its delicious royal apples harvested this month, received 88% less rainfall, the highest for any district in the state. In Uttar Pradesh, the western parts were almost dry with districts such Bulandshahr and Mathura recording 100% rain deficiency.Delhi was slightly better than its neighbouring states with 61% rain deficiency. New Delhi, the seat of the Central government, recorded 76% less rainfall than normal, the most for any district in the national capital. Likewise, southern Haryana districts such as Gurugram and Faridabad recorded close to 90% less rainfall.“Only one trough formed in the Bay of Bengal during this period and that also travelled towards the westerly direction bringing in some rain in West Bengal, Odisha and North-East India. Hence, the north and north-west remained dry,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private forecaster.North and north-west India receive rains due to the oscillation of troughs, getting its moisture feed from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. With few troughs forming, the region witnessed westerly winds adding to the humid conditions, said an IMD scientist, who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. The warmer-than-usual period, with temperatures ranging from 32 degrees Celsius in the hills of Himachal and Uttarakhand to 39 degrees in Delhi, five to eight degrees above normal, showed its impact on horticulture crops.“Because of the excessive heat, the colour of apples in my orchards turned almost yellow from red. No rain has resulted in leaf-fall turning the fruit, which looked good a month ago, into bad quality. Nobody buys a small size and pale red apple,” said Chander Mohan Justa, an orchad owner in Shimla.Devendra Sharma, an agriculture expert, said poor rainfall in the food bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, could have some impact in the kharif output. “Though the sowing was good because of good early monsoon rains, the dry patch in August and September has hurt farmers.” North and north-west India’s loss was east and south India’s gain -- depressions in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal moved towards the west bringing heavy rains. The western coast, from Maharashtra to Kerala received 90-100% excess rain whereas most of the North-Eastern states received up to 50% more rainfall than normal, IMD data showed. A recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, said that by the end of this century southern India is likely to register the maximum increase in rainfall compared to the states in central and north India. “In the worst-case scenario, rainfall could increase by 2.7 mm per day in north India and by 18.5 mm per day in Western Ghats in southern India,” said Rajib Maity, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur, who led the study.In its weekly forecast, IMD did not project any major rainfall in the remaining part of the monsoon season; the monsoon is expected to withdraw from western India in the third week of September. The temperature is expected to be higher than normal for northern and central Indian plains.The anti-cyclone activity, a sign of monsoon withdrawal from western India, is now visible in central Pakistan, meaning that the monsoon will start withdrawing from Rajasthan in a week, Palawat said. Despite less rainfall in September, Mritunjay Mohapatra, director-general of IMD, said on September 8 that je expected the overall monsoon in India to be 102% of the normal with south, central and western India receiving substantially more than normal rainfall .“We are not expecting any improvement in rain deficiency over northwest India now because we are heading towards monsoon withdrawal,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune, agreeing that the monsoon is pretty much over in northern India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-rises-in-north-as-monsoon-loses-steam/story-BUMSX60CMzgTKlffIz8FEN.html
20-09-2020||India||AugustaWestland case: CBI names Rajiv Saxena in second charge sheet||The Central Bureau of Investigation has filed a supplementary charge sheet in the ₹3,727 crore AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case, naming nine Indian nationals including Rajiv Saxena; the former managing director of AgustaWestland, Giacomino Saponaro; and five companies that allegedly played a crucial role in facilitating the movement of kickbacks meant for politicians, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force officials, people familiar with the probe said. The charge sheet, the second in the case – first was filed in September 2017 naming former IAF chief S P Tyagi and 10 others – doesn’t name any politician or government official. It also doesn’t name former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, then Air Vice Marshal Jasbir Singh Panesar and three senior retired IAF officials, chief test pilot S A Kunte, Wing Commander Thomas Mathew and retired Group Captain N Santosh. The agency recently sought sanction from the defence ministry to prosecute former bureaucrats and IAF officials. The sanction is yet to be accorded. “Investigation against beneficiaries has been kept pending for now but a supplementary charge sheet will soon be filed against politicians and government officers,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. Among those arraigned as accused in the CBI charge sheet, filed on Friday, are Rajiv Saxena, a middleman who was deported to India from Dubai in January 2019 and was made an approver in the case by the Enforcement Directorate in April the same year. However, the anti-money laundering probe agency sought revocation of his approver status in November last year alleging that he has misled the investigators and is “not reliable”. The matter is still pending in courts. The Delhi high court had refused to revoke his approver status. ED has accused Saxena of being a “hawala operator” who ran accommodation entry business in Dubai through shell companies. Accommodation entry is an aspect of money laundering where a sum of money is broken up and moved to several accounts over a period of time so as to make the transaction difficult to trace. Apart from Saxena, the eight other Indians, who helped create shell companies, or assisted AgustaWestland in procuring documents related to the VVIP chopper contract, named by CBI are: SP Tyagi’s cousin Sandeep Tyagi, Praveen Bakshi, Pratap Krishan Aggarwal (ex-Managing Director of IDS Infotech Ltd), Narendra Kumar Jain, Rajesh Kumar Jain of Kolkata, Sunil Kothari, Deepak Goyal, KV Kunhikrishnan (former GM of Westland Support Services Ltd, New Delhi). Kunhikrishnan has been linked to British middleman Christian Michel, who helped him procure contract documents and and former managing director of AgustaWestland - Giacomino Saponaro. CBI’s latest charge sheet establishes how a cash payment of ₹5 crore given to SP Tyagi’s cousin Sandeep Tyagi was brought to India through small companies in Mauritius and India and also through banking channels. It mentions details of discussions between European middlemen Guido Haschke, Carlo Gerosa and Christian Michel related to bribes to be paid to different persons. The three were already named as accused in CBI’s first chargesheet in September 2017. The agency said that when Michel was procuring classified defence documents for the contract, he gave over ₹90 lakh to Kunhikrishnan for the same. It is alleged that Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland allegedly paid Michel, who was extradited to India in December 2018 from Dubai, Euro 42 million (₹295 crore) to bribe politicians, bureaucrats and defence ministry personnel for swinging the deal for 12 VVIP choppers in favour of the company. According to CBI’s investigation documents, which have been reviewed by HT, at a meeting held in Cascina Costa (Italy) in July 2006, it was proposed that Michel would work with Haschke and Gerosa in monitoring activities with regard to the acquisition of helicopters in India, keeping in view his knowledge of Indian military deals. “During this meeting, they negotiated a comprehensive fee equal to 7% of the supply contract amount to cover the expenses and fees of both of them,” said the second officer. Michel signed 12 contracts through two of his firms with Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, Westland Helicopters UK etc to legitimise the illicit commission on procurement of helicopters. “Finmeccanica paid total Euro 42.27 million [₹295.00 crore approx] to the firms of Christian Michel as kickbacks/bribe without undertaking any work against the receipt of such amount,” said the second officer. Michel had prepared a note in which alleged bribes worth Euro 30 million meant for politicians and bureaucrats were mentioned. CBI pinned hopes on his interrogation, particularly to identify individuals who were referred to as “AP”, “Pol”, “Bur” and “AF” in the note. The note used abbreviations of designations like “DCH”, “PDSR”, “DG Maintt” and “FTT” under the head “AF (air force)”. Under the head “BUR”, it had entries like “DS”, “JS Air”, “AFA Air”, “DG Acq”, “VC” and “Auditor Gen” and under “POL”, it had “AP”. The note had a separate entry “Fam”, believed to be S P Tyagi’s family – his three cousins Sanjeev, Rajiv and Sandeep Tyagi. It mentioned that Euro 6 million were for “AF” (Air Force), 8.4 million for “BUR” (bureaucrats), 3 million for “AP” and 15-16 million for “Fam”. In its first charge-sheet, CBI said it had established the “money trail” of Euro 62 million (around 415 crore) out of suspected 67 million (Rs 452 crore) bribe paid to Indians through middlemen. The irregularities in the award of the contract to AgustaWestland led to an estimated loss of Euro 398.21 million (around ₹2,666 crore) to the government in the Euro 556.262 million (₹3726.9 crore) contract according to CBI. The contract was cancelled in January 2014. Michel’s lawyer Aljo Joseph said: “There is no evidence against my client. The whole case is based on false allegations”. Saxena’s lawyer R K Handoo said the allegations are “baseless”. Legal representatives of others named in charge sheet could not immediately be reached by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/augustawestland-case-cbi-names-rajiv-saxena-in-second-charge-sheet/story-GzbCeBoWD9wLhnM74RzPwJ.html
20-09-2020||India||UK believed Rajiv Gandhi ran ‘oriental court’, was ‘king among courtiers’||The British government had a poor opinion of Rajiv Gandhi’s performance as the prime minister (1984-89) and on the eve of the 1989 general election, concluded that the atmosphere in his cabinet was that of an “oriental court”, where he was “king among courtiers”.The confidential assessment of Gandhi’s tenure in office was penned by the then British high commissioner in New Delhi, David Goodall, and received in the Foreign Office in London as an “astute and perceptive analysis”. It has now been declassified and released by National Archives.The Gandhi-led Congress lost the 1989 election. Gandhi was the focus of two detailed confidential notes by the diplomat, who wrote he had a difficult time explaining to an “incredulous” then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in September 1989 that Gandhi would not return as the prime minister.The notes are particularly critical of Gandhi’s ways of functioning, and his alleged dependence on a “coterie”. They quote former foreign secretary M K Rasgotra and former diplomat Ronen Sen to substantiate the assessment of Gandhi’s “appalling” working methods.Goodall wrote: “The small coterie of privileged bureaucrats and political associates on whom he relies for advice are liable to go in and out of favour with disconcerting suddenness; and the question who currently has the Prime Minister’s ear is the perennial topic of speculation among both Indian and foreign political observers in Delhi”.“After over four years in office, inexperience is no longer a sufficient excuse. It has become clear that Gandhi also has problems of indecisiveness and a tendency to lose interest in the implementation of policies”.“It would be unfair to apply to him Lord Beaverbook’s dictum about Lord Derby that, like a cushion, he bears the imprint of the last person to have sat on him; but it is a frequent observation that he is too influenced by the last person who has spoken to him, and that he signally lacks judgment in his choice of close advisers”.According to Goodall, Gandhi had failed to revivify the Congress party, had become aloof and inaccessible to party workers, lacked “any profoundly thought-out political philosophy of his own”, and was ineffectual in foreign affairs.“I believe that at the root of Gandhi’s monarchical proclivities there lies a sense of personal insecurity…Perhaps the only confidante he trusts completely is his wife, Sonia…(There) is little doubt that in private she is a tower of strength, and exercises a powerful influence on his choice (and rejection) of friends”, the diplomat, who passed away in 2016, wrote.He added: “Indeed with Ministers his status is more that of king among courtiers than first among equals. We are told that in cabinet no-one, with the possible exception of K C Pant, the Defence Minister, dares to contradict him. With 24 re-shuffles in four years, no Minister has been allowed to remain in one job long enough to establish an independent political reputation”.“In other respects too, the atmosphere is that of an oriental court; indeed comparisons, not altogether far-fetched, are sometimes drawn with the late Shah of Persia…Alongside the urbanity and the gentleness appear flashes of unpredictable petulance”.On the credit side, the declassified notes mention Gandhi’s pro-western outlook, lineage and the Nehru-Gandhi family’s long-standing links with Britain, particularly its leading lights attending schools and universities in the country over the decades.The note says: “Rajiv was strikingly handsome. He was a most attractive person to be with. He had charm, modesty and human warmth. He was full of decent instincts and devoted to his family. Undoubtedly, he wanted to do the right thing for India; and in the end he spent himself in the attempt”.“But the truth is that his character, admirable in many ways, was not big enough for the job. He tried, but he never seemed to try hard enough…(He) never succeeded, either by force of character or example, in making even the smallest dent on the moral decay and galloping corruption of Indian political life and Indian political institutions,” Goodall wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-believed-rajiv-ran-oriental-court-was-king-among-courtiers/story-gSwowKxfPI15pkG1uunoCJ.html

Uttarakhand currently has 492 containment zones in nine districts including a maximum of 369 in Haridwar district. Anoop Nautiyal, the founder of Dehradun-based think-tank Social Development for Communities that has been analysing the Covid-19 data in the hill state, said, “With continuous rise in cases, Dehradun has now crossed over 10,000 cases. This is alarming and needs the highest levels of intervention from the state government. As per official figures, the infection rate in Dehradun district is at an average of 31% for the past one week. If we look at today’s cases (Saturday) the infection rate is around 40% in Dehradun. Experts and the state government need to identify the spread in the district and take immediate steps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-reports-biggest-single-day-spike-with-2-078-new-covid-19-cases-14-people-die/story-O2xBFdm8yGbOXj43AhXKeN.html
20-09-2020||India||9 al Qaeda men arrested for plan to trigger attacks in India||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said on Saturday that it has busted an al Qaeda module and arrested nine people who were allegedly planning to carry out major terror strikes in India at the direction of their Pakistan-based handler.The nine suspects were picked up from West Bengal and Kerala on Saturday, people familiar with the developments said, requesting anonymity. The suspects, under the scanner for some time, were arrested after the agency learnt that they acquired large quantities of weapons, country-made firearms, locally fabricated body armour, jihadi literature, and literature used for making explosives, according to the officials cited above.Also read: Kin of alleged al Qaeda operatives arrested from Bengal still puzzled about offenceThe suspects were planning attacks at several locations, including Delhi-NCR, Kochi and Mumbai, and they were about to leave for Kashmir to receive a consignment of weapons, which was likely to arrive from Pakistan, the officials added. “NIA learnt about an inter-state module of al Qaeda operatives at various locations in India, including West Bengal and Kerala. The group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people and strike terror in their minds,” NIA spokesperson Sonia Narang said in a statement.Also read: 9 Al-Qaeda operatives arrested by NIA in raids conducted in West Bengal, Kerala. Full list“These individuals were radicalised by Pakistan-based al Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places, including the National Capital Region (NCR). For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fund-raising and a few members of gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country,” the statement said. The handler of the module has been identified as Abu Hamza, who is in Pakistan. He is said to be directly linked to the main al Qaeda outfit headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, according to the officials familiar with the investigation. The suspected Indian operatives were found to have been in touch with the leadership of the al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and not the general high command of the terror group.All nine suspects are residents of West Bengal. While three of them (Murshid Hasan, a labourer; Iyakub Biswas, a salesman; and Mosaraf Hossen, a cook at a small eatery) were held in Kerala’s Ernakulam, the remaining six (Abu Sufiyan, a tailor; Mainul Mondal, a cook; Leu Yean Ahmed, an electrician; Ali Mamun Kamal, a driver; and Najmus Sakib and Atitur Rahman, both pursuing graduation) were taken into custody from West Bengal’s Murshidabad. Murshid Hasan is believed to be heading the nine-member module and was receiving directions from Pakistan through social media. A senior official who did not want to be named said that the agency recovered YouTube videos of Murshid Hasan --- who is believed to have been in touch with the Pakistan-based handler for a year --- in which he purportedly threatened to kill non-Muslims. Also, the agency detected a YouTube channel of Leu Yean Ahmed on which he allegedly propagated jihadi ideology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-al-qaeda-men-held-for-plan-to-trigger-attacks/story-I5CmQZ8bMp7qVHMG4mXKgK.html
20-09-2020||India||Covid cloud may end monsoon session by Wednesday||Parliament’s monsoon session may end as early as on September 23, eight days ahead of its schedule, after many political parties agreed to cut it short amid a rising number of Covid-19 cases linked to the Parliament House complex. So far, two Union ministers, 30 MPs and several House officials have tested positive for Covid, posing a serious challenge on the ongoing session schedule despite the health safety makeovers. Both ministers attended some days of the session that started Monday. At Saturday’s meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC), a panel that decides the weekly agenda of the House, the government’s floor managers said they had no objections to cut short the session but wanted 20 laws — including the ratification of 11 ordinances — to be cleared. It had previously shortlisted 14 bills for the week amid talks of shortening the session at the BAC meeting, and furnished a list of another 6 bills. So far, 11 out of 20 bills have been cleared by the Lok Sabha and 5 have been approved by both Houses. Now, amidst the push to cut short the session, more bills might be cleared without long debates, two Opposition leaders said. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAs India faced the first wave of Covid-19 cases, the budget session of Parliament was cut short on March 23. Two days later, a sweeping federal lockdown that eventually lasted 68 days kicked in. As Covid cases kept increasing, particularly in Delhi, the monsoon session was deferred by two months from its usual mid-July start. It finally started from September 14; the Indian Constitution makes it mandatory to start a session within six months of the previous one. At Saturday’s meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi listed the three labour codes — on social security, industrial relations and occupation safety — FCRA amendments, J&K official languages bill and The National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Bill for passage. Congress chief whip K Suresh argued that it’s not feasible that only government agenda would be cleared and issues raised by the opposition parties not find any mention. The Congress insisted in the meeting that the environment impact assessment draft that has become controversial, the new national education policy, and issues related to the economy and delays in GST compensation payments to the states be discussed. A non-Congress Opposition leader said that both sides may come to an adjustment to take up one or two Opposition-sponsored debates. And a few bills may be quickly passed to save time, this person added. While all 20 legislations might not get cleared, all bills replacing ordinances and the labour reform bills are likely to be cleared. Also read: Stricter punishments for attacking medics workers during an epidemicOnly two parties, Trinamool Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party have not agreed to the curtailment plan so far. Trinamool’s floor leader Derek O’Brien tweeted, “First, this Govt calls an 18-day Parliament Session. After 6 days have they realised it’s a hare-brained idea? Now want Opposition to find them a solution.” The monsoon session set an ambitious 18-day schedule with no weekend breaks. Aiming to keep MPs in Delhi for as less time as possible, it was decided to hold the two Houses in shifts, with lawmakers spread across both chambers and galleries to ensure social distancing, and with added protection such as plexiglass partitions in the lower house and a complete ban on visitors. All MPs were also required to take a RT-PCR test ahead of the session. With two ministers and some officials testing positive, they have been recommended to take these tests as many times as they want. Other officials and journalists attending Parliament have to take a rapid antigen test everyday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cloud-may-end-session-by-wednesday/story-pyJQckQ5b6N6eGyj47yAQK.html
20-09-2020||India||Stricter punishments for attacking medics workers during an epidemic||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which provides for up to seven years of imprisonment for those convicted of attacking doctors and healthcare workers during an epidemic.The Bill, which was introduced by health minister Harsh Vardhan in the Upper House, was supported by parties across lines. The Act will replace an ordinance issued on April 22.Under the Act, the commission or abetment of violence will be punishable with imprisonment for a term of three months to five years, and with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2,00,000. In cases of causing grievous hurt, the imprisonment shall be for a term of six months to seven years, with fines ranging from Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.Vardhan explained that the ordinance was put in place as incidents of harassment and violence against health workers were rising due to a lack of awareness about coronavirus. “We have all noticed that there has been a dramatic decline in the incidents of violence against health workers all over the country,” he said.He said the step had to be taken as there were few laws and powers in this regard in some states. “There was a need to have a central law to put in place a prohibitory mechanism to stop such activities,” Vardhan said.Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India (CPI), who moved a statutory resolution on the Bill, said it did not address the issue of violence on health professionals within hospitals.He said that issues such as non-payment of salaries to doctors and nurses, failure to provide protective equipment and other safety concerns are being ignored, as these issues have not found a mention in the Act.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicCongress’ Anand Sharma said there is a need to expand the provision to protect police and personnel of various other services engaged in providing relief. “There are personnel engaged in providing relief and managing quarantine shelters. They should also be, in the future, included into the expanded list of people, who need support and protection,” he said.He also suggested the immediate setting up of a national task force for stakeholders’ consultation, with states and institutions, including the scientific community and medical fraternity, for a comprehensive review and amendment to make the proposed Act contemporary, taking lessons from the current situation.Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) alleged that the Centre is interfering in the functioning of states through the move. “There are sinister provisions in the Bill. States must be authorised to take decisions.”Ram Gopal Yadav, of the Samajwadi Party, stressed the need for special provisions to penalise people and private hospitals that are making a quick buck on the pretext of Covid-19 treatment.Vandana Chavan of the NCP suggested adding ASHA workers to the list of those protected by the Act.Replying to the points raised during the discussion, Vardhan said issues related to biological emergencies are also covered under the National Disaster Management Act. On overcharging by private hospitals, he said the Central government has issued guidelines to states in this regard. “We have tried to rationalise these prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stricter-punishments-for-attacking-medics/story-KJJ8iPzeKHJLkd09YKW1PK.html
20-09-2020||India||Congress hits out at NDA govt over farm bills||A day before the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is expected to push three contentious legislations on farm reforms in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress sought to mount pressure on the ruling side, signaling an imminent confrontation when the bills come for passage in the Upper House on Sunday. Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram compared the farm reforms proposed by his party and the NDA’s version. “While our promise is clear, the Modi government has surrendered to the corporates and traders,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “Every political party has to take a stand — is it with the farmers or is it with the BJP threatening the livelihood of farmers,” he said.His comments came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took on critics of the farm-liberalisation plan, accusing detractors of spreading “misinformation and lies” while reassuring farmers the reforms were in their best interests. Modi called the reforms a “protective shield” around farmers and took a veiled but sharp attack on the Congress. “These people who would make big promises to farmers during election time, would do it in writing, and in their manifestoes, forget these promises after elections,” Modi said. The Congress’s 2019 manifesto promised to liberalise agricultural markets. Chidambaram alleged that the government and the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “deliberately and maliciously distorted the Congress manifesto”. “Little knowledge is dangerous and little reading is even more dangerous”, he said, and added that the BJP was caught in a web of its own creation. The Congress, meanwhile, has issued a three-line whip to its members, asking them to be present in the Rajya Sabha during the debate and voting on the farm bills on Sunday. The party has also called a meeting of its general secretaries and in-charge of states on Monday to discuss the course of action on the bills and give a final shape to its proposed nationwide agitation. The meeting, to be held at the party headquarters in Delhi, is expected to be attended by six members of a special committee (AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, KC Venugopal, Mukul Wasnik and Randeep Singh Surjewala). Also read: Punjab’s farmer leaders to burn copies of farm bills tomorrowThe BJP, which does not have a majority in the Upper House, too, has asked all its members to be present in the House. The Lok Sabha, where the BJP and its allies enjoy a brute majority, passed two of these bills --- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 --- through a voice vote on Thursday. It has earlier passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. The main opposition Congress and a clutch of smaller parties are opposed to the reforms. A key opposition to the bills came on Thursday from BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet over efforts to unshackle the farm sector. India’s agricultural trade still requires licenced traders who must operate out of notified markets allotted to them. The bills aim to sidestep this system, called agricultural produce market committees (APMC), free up market restrictions, enable farmers and agribusinesses to engage more confidently under a new contract farming law and help to create modern supply chains. Critics argue the new system will lack adequate oversight in its current form. “The Bills assume perversely that the farmer and the private purchaser have equal bargaining power. They do not. The small farmer will be at the mercy of the private purchaser,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-hits-out-at-nda-over-farm-bills/story-e1OSkxnqKX8XLoCE7YOVsO.html

Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Sinha said, “I am glad to announce a Rs 1,350 crores economic package for the people in the business community facing economic difficulties. This is additional to the benefits of Atma Nirbhar Bharat and other measures taken by us to comfort the business community.”Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliance campaign) of the Central government, the L-G said, Rs 1400 crore have already been provided to the people of the UT through the Jammu and Kashmir Bank.“For one year, we will be giving a 50 per cent concession in water and electricity bills. We will be spending Rs 105 crore on this. This will benefit farmers, normal people, businessman and others,” the L-G said. “This is a beginning and more things are in the offing.”He added that the government is working on a structured mechanism and package for taxi drivers, transporters, autorickshaw drivers, houseboat owners, shikarawallas and others who have been affected by the economic slowdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are setting up a customised help tourism scheme by the Jammu and Kashmir Bank for financial assistance to persons associated with the tourism sector with attractive pricing and repayment features. We are setting up an exclusive land bank and will make available land for warehouses in industrial estates and food parks,” Sinha said.The main component of the ‘Business Revival Package’, Sinha said, is a 5 per cent interest subvention to all borrowers irrespective of their sizes. “You know that at the most, a two-per cent interest subvention is provided and that is what the people expect as well. However, keeping in mind the special situation here -- businesses have been suffering for the last about 20 years -- we have decided to give an interest subvention of five per cent without any discrimination to all businesses whether small, medium or heavy. This is an unprecedented decision,” he said. The Union Territory administration will directly support this with Rs 950 crore, he added.The L-G also announced that stamp duty has been exempted for all borrowers till March 2021. “From October 1, J&K bank will set up special desk for the youth and women entrepreneurs,” he said.The administration has also decided to assist bus drivers/conductors, auto/taxi drivers etc, who may have lost their livelihood, by providing for an appropriate mechanism. “A further 50% or Rs 5 lakh subsidy, whichever is lower, shall provided to the transporters for replacement of old buses and the insurance premium shall be borne by the Government,” Sinha announced.He also announced that those associated with the handloom and handicraft sectors will get an enhanced credit of Rs 2 lakh in their credit cards as also a seven-per cent interest subvention to improve these sectors.“Overall, this economic package is historic in terms of volume and reach. I can see that Kashmiris are eager to contribute to the growth of the Union Territory as they are fed up with the cross-border terrorism sponsored by our neighbour. I strongly feel that it is our collective responsibility to ensure that a lot of money goes into creation of jobs, strengthening of businesses and coming together of families for a quick bounce-back of Jammu and Kashmir’s economy,” Sinha said.The L-G had constituted a committee on August 18 to assess the help required by the business community of Jammu and Kashmir and also suggest administrative measures to boost banking, industry, tourism, agriculture and handicrafts.The committee, headed by K K Sharma, the advisor to the L-G, submitted its report on September 1 after deliberations with at least 35 business organisations from Srinagar and Jammu.The package also includes the Guaranteed Emergency Credit Loan (GECL), Working Capital Demand Loan (WCDL) facility for Private Educational Institutions and the J&K Business Support Loan Scheme for hotels and guest houses, which are likely to be rolled out soon. Welcoming the package, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries’ president Shiekh Ashiq said that Sinha has kept his promise. “The business community appreciates this gesture of the government. We are going through the components of the package and if there will be any shortcoming, we will again meet the Lt Governor. We are really thankful for this package.” (With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-350-cr-aid-to-revive-business-sector-in-j-k-power-water-bills-subsidised/story-U32620pj6XgOTimU83zu6H.html
20-09-2020||India||Covid-19: 97 died while travelling on Shramik trains, says Centre||The railways ministry has said that 97 people died while travelling on the Shramik special trains that were operated to repatriate domestic migrant workers, the first official confirmation of a string of fatalities that prompted questions over how the lockdown for Covid-19 was planned and on the measures made to help vulnerable, urban workers who were left without pay and jobs return to their homes in the Indian hinterland.The disclosure was made on Friday as a response to a question by Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien in the Rajya Sabha. At the start of the monsoon session, a separate government department – the labour ministry – said it did not have data on how many migrant workers had died when the country locked down to stem the spread of Covid-19. “Out of these 97 cases of death, state police sent dead bodies for post mortem in 87 cases. 51 post-mortem reports have been obtained from respective state police so far, in which the reasons for deaths have been shown as cardiac arrest/heart disease/brain hemorrhage/pre-existing chronic disease/chronic lung disease/chronic liver disease etc,” said the reply by Union railways minister Piyush Goyal. Also read: Parliament monsoon session: No data available on migrant deaths during lockdown, says CentreThe data accounted for deaths till September 9. On May 30, Hindustan Times first reported that between May 9 and 27, almost 80 deaths took place on board Shramik special trains, according to data accessed from the Railway Protection Force. Shramik special trains began operation on May 1 to ferry migrant labourers back home after hundreds were seen setting out on foot for their towns and villages hundreds of kilometres away in the middle of peak summer conditions. In all, 4,621 Shramik special trains were run between May 1 and August 31, 2020, carrying 6.3 million passengers to their home states, the ministry said in Parliament. In an interview to HT on June 1, after the report on the deaths, Goyal said that the Indian Railways has been transparent about the deaths, and insisted on compiling a list of them, and finding out causes even as news reports suggested that “eight or nine migrants” died on trains. The real number has emerged only because of this, he suggested. “We are very concerned... My heart goes out to the families (of those who have died),” the minister said.Separately on Saturday, the labour minister said the government is collecting information on suicide of migrant workers from states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/97-died-in-shramik-trains-says-centre/story-Odye5Oz6jzu3nafMGj4mwL.html
20-09-2020||India||Farooq Abdullah calls for 4G restoration in J-K, talks with Pakistan||National Conference MP Farooq Abdullah on Saturday said that no progress is taking place in Jammu and Kashmir in the absence of high-speed internet. Addressing the Lok Sabha for the first time since his release from detention, Abdullah said that the decision to suspend internet services in the region was against the interest of students and businessmen. “No progress is taking place in Jammu & Kashmir. People there do not have access to 4G facility, how are they going to grow in the present time when the rest of the country has access to every facility on the internet… Today our children, shopkeepers don’t have a 4G facility that is there in the rest of the country. How will they study, get education, when everything these days is on the internet,” he asked during zero hour of the ongoing monsoon session. Mobile phone, landline and internet services were suspended in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir hours before the Centre, on August 5 last year, effectively nullified Article 370 which accorded the region special status. The state was bifurcated into Union territories— Jammu & Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one.The government, on August 15 this year, restored high-speed mobile internet services in two districts of Jammu and Kashmir on a trial basis, a little over a year after the facility was snapped ahead of the revocation of the region’s special status and its bifurcation.Abdullah also called for talks with Pakistan, referring to the ongoing talks with China amid the border standoff at Ladakh.“Border skirmishes have been rising and people are dying…as you are talking to China to attempt that it withdraws (from LAC), we should also talk to our (other) neighbour to find a way to get out of this situation,” he said.Abdullah was among several leaders who were put under detention by the Centre last year ahead of the changes in the regions status, and was released in March this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-calls-for-4g-restoration-talks-with-pak/story-UGn3jvX8rk7jUB2JnQ9BhK.html
20-09-2020||India||Arrested journalist passed on info to China, say police||The Delhi police on Saturday said that journalist Rajeev Sharma,61, arrested on charges of spying five days ago, allegedly passed on “sensitive and classified” information to Chinese intelligence agencies since 2016 and has been paid nearly Rs 40 lakh through various channels including hawala transactions and shell companies. Police said a 30-year-old Chinese woman, Qing Shi, and a Nepalese man, Sher Singh alias Raj Bohra, 30, have been arrested and booked along with Sharma under the Official Secrets Act. Sanjeev Yadav, the deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said Sharma was allegedly in contact with a Chinese intelligence official whom the police only identified as Michael, and, since 2019, with another Chinese person identified as George . He sent Michael classified information related to Indian army deployment in the China-Bhutan-India tri-junction, including Doklam. DCP Yadav said that the 2017 Doklam standoff happened just a few weeks after Sharma shared some classified information regarding India’s position, procurement and strategies on the border. Police said Sharma had also passed on information related to India’s military cooperation with Myanmar and other details about the border between India and China. According to investigating officials, Sharma has a Press Information Bureau (PIB) identity card, which he used to visit different government offices and get information from his contacts. The PIB card was issued in the mid-80s, when he was working with United News Agency and was valid till December 31, 2020. The police said that Sharma has told them that he visited the defence and external Affairs ministries to gather information to write his columns, he also took help from other journalists in getting details, by claiming that he wanted the information for his columns. Sharma’s columns appeared in Mail Today, a newspaper from the India Today group, until June 7 this year, before it was shut down. The paper’s former editor, Dwaipayan Bose, said, “Since the case is being investigated we feel that to comment now is inappropriate.”Specifics of the information collected and passed on by Sharma are not known. Nor is it clear how he came by classified information. The police said nothing about his contacts in the ministries. HT learns that Sharma may have been caught on the basis of communication intercepts by intelligence agencies, but could not confirm this. Yadav admitted that Sharma’s arrest came after police received inputs from a central intelligence agency. Sharma’s lawyer, senior advocate Adishi Aggarwala, denied the allegations. “As per the statement of the wife of my client (Sharma), the police did not recover any “classified and sensitive” documents from their home. She has told me that the police seized his laptop, mobile phone, bank statement, passport, income tax-related files, insurance documents , and other such documents. He had been writing articles, columns as a freelance journalist and was being paid for them, which is the job and right of any journalist. The charges against my client are false and he is innocent,” Aggarwala said. Police said the investigation has revealed that the two other people arrested, Qing and Singh were the directors of two shells companies, MZ Pharmacy and MZ Malls , in Delhi’s Mahipalpur that were floated exclusively for the purpose of bringing money in from China and transferring it to Sharma in cash fin return for the information. The shell companies were set up in 2013 by Chinese nationals Jhang Chang and his wife Chang-li-lia, who, according to the police, identified themselves as Indian citizens Suraj and Usha. Police said that at least three persons, including another freelance journalist, are being examined in the case . They did not identify these people. DCP Yadav said that between 2010 and 2014 Sharma wrote columns for Global Times, a Chinese daily that is widely considered a mouthpiece for the Chinese government. “Observing his columns, he was first contacted by a Chinese Intelligence officer, Michael, from Kunming city of China in 2016 through LinkedIn. Michael invited Sharma to Kunming City for an interview in a Chinese media company. His entire trip was funded by Michael. In the interview, he was told to pass on information on various aspects of India-China relations and assured money in return,” the officer said. Sharma remained in contact with Michael and his junior Xou, since 2016 and passed on to them classified information related to Indian army deployments in the China-Bhutan-India tri-junction. DCP Yadav said Sharma met with Chinese intelligence officials in China, Laos and Maldives. Yadav said that between 2016 and 2018, Sharma was in contact with Michael and Xou. The information were sent in “pointer format” through emails, and mobile applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp. HT visited Sharma’s residence in Pitampura on Saturday but his house was locked. Neighbours said that on the night of September 13, at around 11.00 pm, police raided his house. A security guard who was on duty that night said, “At around 11 pm a group of men in a car ordered my colleague to open the society gates. As soon as the gate was opened, about seven-eight cars zoomed into the colony. Soon, about 30-35 men, all in plainclothes, surrounded Sharma’s house (on the ground floor) They left at around 2.30 am.” Detailing Sharma’s alleged role after 2018, the special cell officer said, “In January 2019, Sharma came in contact with another Kunming-based Chinese person named George. He visited Kunming via Kathmandu and met George. George was introduced as a general manager of a Chinese Media Company. During the meeting, George asked Sharma to write and keep them informed about issues related to the Dalai Lama. For this, he was offered $500 per article. George told Sharma that they would send him money through a company operated by Qing.” Before returning to China in 2018, the Chinese couple (Jhang Chang and his wife Chang-li-lia) made Qing Shi and Nepalase citizen Sher Singh alias Raj Bohra the directors of the two shell companies. Singh used to work as the couple’s driver, Yadav said. Police said Qing Shi came to India in 2013 on a student visa and completed a nursing course from Jamia Millia Islamia. She is in India on a business visa. The have also found that around Rs 500000 was transferred into the account of Sharma’s neighbour at Sharma’s behest. “We questioned the neighbour, who is a prime witness in the case. The neighbour said that Sharma took his bank details for getting a money transfer. The money came into the account through multiple channels involving at least three different countries and some states in India,” added DCP Yadav. Neighbours, who did not wish to be identified, said Sharma lives with his wife, an associate professor in the department of physics at a Delhi university college. The couple has been living in the colony for the last 20 years. Their son, an MBA, works in the US, police said. In his Linkedin bio, Sharma has identified himself as a strategic analyst, political commentator, and maker of short films. He mentions he is a Masters in English Literature from Delhi university in 1981 and has been a journalist since 1982. He claims to have worked in various capacities such as correspondent, diplomatic correspondent and diplomatic associate editor with Tribune, Sakal Times and Eenadu Newstime. Press Club of India President Anand K Sahay issued a statement describing Sharma as an “independent journalist of long-standing” and describing his arrest by the police as “high handed” and “inspired by obscure and questionable considerations.” Sharma’s last post on Twitter (his account is currently suspended) on the day of his arrest read: “ Despite the five point peace reached between India and China in Moscow last week, China can still do mischief and the only mantra for lndia in dealing with Chinese must be: distrust and verify”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-journalist-passed-on-info-to-china-say-police/story-kYeKS6aqUyfJ2ysQnSPQwJ.html
20-09-2020||India||Defamation case: Ramani seeks acquittal, says freedom of speech intrinsic to a democratic society||Rebecca John, the lawyer for journalist Priya Ramani, concluded her arguments on Saturday in an online hearing of the criminal defamation suit filed against her client by former Union minister MJ Akbar. Akbar filed the case under Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code in November 2018 after Ramani made an allegation of sexual misconduct against him on Twitter in October 2018 during the Me Too movement. Ramani “exercised due care and attention” in her tweets which were “made in good faith” and “for public good” John said.“Freedom of speech and expression as given under article 19 of the Constitution of India is critical and intrinsic to a democratic society. Priya Ramani has been able to show the truth and the public good of her statements made in the public domain. She was a small part of a large nationwide and global movement that uncovered the pervasive nature of sexual harassment at the workplace. The Me Too movement revealed the prevalence and normalisation of sexual harassment at the workplace with hundreds of thousands of women across the world participating in it,” John told the court of Additional Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja.Ramani’s allegation pertained to the time when Akbar purportedly interviewed her in 1993 for a reporter’s position while he was the editor of Asian Age newspaper. Akbar denied the allegation and said the meeting, as described by Ramani, did not take place.Refuting the charge that Ramani’s tweets and an article which she wrote on sexual harassment at the workplace were “per se defamatory” and harmed the reputation of Akbar, John said that it was not defamation if what was imputed is the truth and was stated in good faith for the public good. In February, Akbar’s lawyer Geeta Luthra had said during her closing arguments that Ramani’s statements against Akbar were “per se defamatory” and were made with the intention to harm the reputation of her client.Citing other cases, Luthra had said, “It is sufficient to show that the accused has reason to believe that [what they said] will harm the reputation of the person.” “I have examined people who said that they held [Akbar] in high regard, and the respect they held for him was lowered in our eyes… In this case, no reasonable person can say that it was not defamatory,” Luthra said.John pointed out that Akbar’s lawyers had opened the door to the issue of Akbar’s reputation, which put the onus upon her to contest their claim. “There was an avalanche of disclosures against the complainant. [Ramani’s] was one of them,” John said.Fourteen women made allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour at the workplace. One of them, journalist Ghazala Wahab, was Ramani’s witness. Akbar, who was the minister of state for external affairs at the time the allegation was made, resigned shortly after they surfaced. “There are some people who, when their reputation is hurt, it shatters their whole existence. It destroys them,” Luthra said during her closing arguments.“My case has always been that before I met him I admired him as a journalist and as a writer. But his conduct with me on that night in December 1993, and the experiences of other women, does not justify this complaint,” John said on behalf of her client, on Saturday.John quoted deceased United States Supreme Court judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who in a 2015 interview spoke of the “arbitrary barriers put in women’s way”, which is “the experience of everyone who grows up female”. “The Me Too movement and the challenge to sexual harassment at the workplace was an attempt to correct the historical wrong, and an attempt to remove the arbitrary barriers that have been put in women’s way,” John said.Luthra will respond to John’s final arguments on October 13 and 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defamation-case-ramani-seeks-acquittal-says-freedom-of-speech-intrinsic-to-a-democratic-society/story-eLpoHteM4i6PGMAcTGNQXJ.html
