19-09-2020||News||The Nehruvian imprint on Indus Waters Treaty||Exactly 60 years ago, on September 19, 1960, the Indus Waters Treaty between Pakistan and India was signed. Despite the energy and voluminous paperwork that marked eight long years of negotiations, under the aegis of the World Bank (WB), the Treaty was largely viewed by both parties as one which gave away their respective water interests. The two leaders — Jawaharlal Nehru and Ayub Khan — for different reasons felt otherwise and soaked in the historic moment of the signing ceremony in Karachi on September 19, 1960. As a military dictator, Khan’s diktat overrode public opinion, while the democratic Nehru had to contend with domestic opposition. The Treaty partitioned the Indus system of rivers. The three eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi and Sutlej) with a mean annual flow of 33 million-acre feet (maf) went to India while the control of over 80 maf of waters of the western rivers (Indus, Chenab and Jhelum) was granted to Pakistan. In terms of volume, however, 80.52% of water went to Pakistan and only 19.48% came to India. The ratio of 4:1 favoured Pakistan and India’s initial demand for 25% was raised in the Lok Sabha as a failure of its negotiations. Many newspapers in India castigated the government for giving in to Pakistan and making “concessions after concessions”. Some parliamentarians felt that had India conceded to Pakistan’s water requirements in 1948, as a “human consideration”, the Treaty would possibly not have been required. As things developed, Pakistan’s demand became bigger and bolder. “I wish,” said Harish Mathur, a Congressman from Rajasthan, in the Lok Sabha, “our government takes note of the feeling in this country. It is not that our over-generousness should be at the cost of the development of this country.” As the debate grew, Nehru was presented with some uncomfortable facts. First, the unfairness of the terms; second, the cost of the replacement of canal works; and, third, the overall context of India-Pakistan relations. Of the cultivable land in India, only 19% had irrigation facilities while in Pakistan it was 54%. Fundamentally, therefore, India was left with less-irrigated land and even fewer irrigation facilities. This could hardly be justified as fair to India. “It is a kind of second partition which we are experiencing...this is being done again with the signature of our honourable prime minister,” argued Ashok Mehta of the Praja Socialist Party. The money allocated was equally disadvantageous. Pakistan was to get grants and not loans of about ₹400 crore of the Rs 450 crore required to build its link canals; India would get Rs 27 crore of the overall requirement of Rs 100 crore to build infrastructure. The money was to be given as loans and not grants — Rs 15 crore from the United States (US) and Rs 12 crore from WB. But this was not all. India’s commitment to pay Rs 83 crore to Pakistan in pound sterling, without settling earlier financial dues with that country was incomprehensible to the Lok Sabha. Considering the desperate foreign exchange position in India, it was foolhardy to agree to this. In terms of adjustment of debts that Pakistan owed India, only Rs 6 crore as dues for the waters that India spared over the years was adjusted. Despite all this, Nehru had a different take. He felt he was looking at the larger foreign policy picture. He emphasised, “It is the context that we have to consider, not a particular bit.” In the political environment of the 1950s, Nehru was not averse to reaching out for peace and tranquillity. These were requisites, he strongly felt, for the stability and development that India desired. It was not that he was blinded by reconciliation with Pakistan. After all, in 1959, when Ayub Khan advocated a “common defence” in which both India and Pakistan would come together to guard the subcontinent, Indian leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan and C Rajagopalachari welcomed the idea. Even General KM Cariappa was not entirely opposed to this. It was Nehru who cold-shouldered it by famously retorting “defence against whom?”. In the case of the Treaty, however, he felt it was a price worth paying and expressed his disappointment that the House treated it with such “a narrow-minded spirit” and tactfully praised the engineers “who fought for India’s interest strenuously” to take the heat off the debate. However much Nehru tried to separate himself as the proponent of a broad perspective from the nitty-gritty of negotiations, there was an undeniable Nehruvian internationalist mindset to the whole water issue with Pakistan. His ideals of oneness though clashed with the realities of power politics and interest-oriented relations which he understood, but adamantly refused to accept. The goodwill and friendship that India hoped to gain from the generosity and sacrifice it had shown to Pakistan were belied by Khan’s statements. Soon after signing the Treaty, he talked about the physical possession of the upper reaches of the Indus basin rivers. The Indus Waters Treaty may have prevented “another Korea”, as WB had anxiously observed, but it did not fundamentally change Pakistan’s lower riparian angst nor in its perception of the upper riparian dominance of India.

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Fall of a beloved bird||In an explosion of ugly smoke and sparks early on Thursday morning, a most beloved bird of the City Beautiful was lost to us. It was a juvenile Oriental Pied hornbill, a rare species that has captured the imagination of citizens like few birds have. The hornbill had perched on a transformer at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) residential quarters and was electrocuted. “My wife saw that happen. I had earlier seen the parents and the juvenile cross the same area 8 to 10 times in the past. While the mature parents never perched on the transformer, the juvenile probably committed a fatal mistake. After that, the anguished parents kept moving in the area and calling out to trace their child but unknown to them it was lying dead in the dense undergrowth at the transformer’s base,” Upendra Goswami, bird photographer and a senior physiotherapist at the PGIMER, told this writer.Its dapper black and white plumage distinguishes it from the duller Grey hornbill (Chandigarh’s State Bird). It is the male’s imposing casque on the bill that really conjures visions of an exotic bird that we expect to see from a NatGeo documentary on the Amazonian rainforests or a tribal chief from the North-east donning a hornbill hat rather than in the arboreal life of a staid Chandigarh. If the big bill and tail of the Grey hornbill attracts abnormal attention, the Pied hornbill amounts to pure fascination.Primarily, it is a species ranging in the Himalayan foothills eastwards of Chandigarh towards North-east India. A resident species at the Rajaji, Kalesar and Jim Corbett national parks, a specimen was first sighted at village Sanauli (Zirakpur) in 2011 by Narbir Kahlon. Since then, this migrant has settled down in Chandigarh and has bred successfully. None less than UT administrator, VPS Badnore, has wanted to photograph this rare species. When a striking pair staged an appearance at the Sector 4 residence of a thespian of renowned talents, Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry, she could not resist clicking a beautiful picture from her window. WILDLIFE CRIMES GO VIRALIn a chilling reminder of videos of wildlife killings that go viral and turn murderers into virtual heroes, a farmer, Vir Singh, fired two cartridges from a .12 bore double-barrel gun at a Rock python taking shelter amid the dried corn in a house. After shredding the writhing python with shotgun pellets at virtually point-blank range, the killer was cheered by the onlookers as if he had downed a fearsome enemy of the nation! The incident took place in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh. Another video of a python shot with a double-barrel gun while perched high on a tree in a jungle also went viral. The videos bore a resemblance to those emanating from Punjab showing pigeon fanciers trapping and slaughtering a Shikra and migratory Peregrine falcons as they preyed on their pet birds.However, unlike Punjab where the forests and wildlife preservation department took two years to act against the falcon killers, Hamirpur divisional forest officer LC Bandana took immediate action when the python videos came to her notice. “We traced out the spot, recovered the python’s body and seized the gun of Vir Singh. We have lodged a FIR against him. The python enjoys the highest protection under the laws, equivalent to that applied to a tiger as it is a Schedule 1 species. However, Singh has not been arrested by the Police. I will be taking up the matter at the higher level with my department. We could not trace out the killer in the video of python shot on a tree,” Bandana told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-fall-of-a-beloved-bird/story-qOwG1HoN0vgszmyFbwN7wK.html

However, not many remember his contemporary Balbir Singh (Junior), an outstanding hockey player of the same era and a very media shy person. Balbir Singh (Jr) was born on May 2, 1932, at Sansarpur (Jalandhar), which is known as the nursery of hockey players in India. As was customary, he took to playing hockey from the early age of six and later became a player of national fame. While studying at Lyallpur Khalsa College in Jalandhar in 1951, he was selected to play for the Indian hockey team touring Afghanistan and was also a part of the Punjab state hockey team for the Nationals at Madras in 1951 as well as at Calcutta in 1952. Besides playing against Pakistan at Lahore during this period, his team also won the Dhyan Chand Hockey Tournament at Delhi in 1953-54. As he completed his graduation from DAV College in Jalandhar, the name of Balbir Singh (Jr) is inscribed on the roll of honour boards there as well as Lyallpur Khalsa College. He was the captain of the Punjab University team. They won an inter-university tournament at Sagar under his captaincy. His other team-mates were Balkishan, Prithipal, Charles Stephen, and Kulwant Arora, who went on to become Olympians later. At Sagar, a representative of the East Bengal League met and wooed him with an attractive package. Controversy arose when he played for Calcutta League and the Punjab Hockey Association objected on the grounds that he had not sought their permission and stopped him from playing. Balbir Singh (Jr) then met Ashwini Kumar, (president of the association), who was then the commandant of the Police Training School at Phillaur, for clearance to play. However, Ashwini Kumar instructed him to join the Punjab police team, which at that time was playing the Gold Cup Tournament at Bombay. When Balbir Singh (Jr) pleaded that the Calcutta League would suspend him if he did so, Ashwini Kumar retorted: “You deserve that.” Ashwini Kumar offered him a job as sub-inspector if he chose to join Punjab police, but Balbir Singh (Jr) chose not to accept because he felt there was lot of friction in the Punjab police team amongst some prominent players. He then returned to Calcutta and Bengal state selected him to play for them as centre forward in the National Games at Bangalore. By then his friend Sarpal Singh had joined Indian Railways, and on his recommendation Balbir Singh (Jr) joined the engineering wing of Indian Railways as an apprentice permanent way inspector (PWI). He represented the Indian Railways Hockey team on tours to various European countries such as the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, Spain, Switzerland and Italy as well as three test matches at Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and won most of the matches. During the National Tournament at Jalandhar in 1956, he played so well that people say he even overshadowed Balbir Singh (Sr) of Punjab Police. This player was instrumental in the success of the Indian Railways team, which won the National Hockey Championship for three consecutive years in 1957-1959. He was one of the 18 players selected for Olympics at Melbourne. His career took a turn in 1962, when he joined the Army as an emergency commissioned officer. He played for the Services hockey team at the National Hockey Tournaments at Delhi. While in the Army he played test matches against the visiting Kenyan Team. Balbir Singh (Jr) retired as a Major in 1984 and is now settled in Chandigarh. Post-retirement, he was an active golfer at the Chandigarh Golf Club. Now an octogenarian and a few health issues notwithstanding, he is basking in the glory of his career as a sportsman of national fame as well as a Defence officer, though he did not seek any limelight. wcdpsbajwa@gmail.comThe hockey player spoke to the author, who is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-three-cheers-for-balbir-singh-junior-a-hockey-player-not-many-know-about/story-MrcJ5RWf7P1tWfrYqTqu0O.html

While his custody ended on Saturday, he could not be produced before the court. His lawyer moved an application before the special court to shift him either to Apollo Hospital or Medanta Hospital in Delhi. The lawyers claimed that ED’s decision to shift him from AIIMS Hospital to NCI Jhajjar was illegal and that the decision was taken without informing the court. ED denied the allegations and said while ED admitted Kochchar to AIIMS, the decision to shift him was taken by AIIMS authorities. The probing agency also asked the court to decide on Kochchar’s plea.The court, after hearing both sides, allowed the plea and directed Kochchar to submit his medical reports to ED office every day. Further, ED has been asked to place a guard for Kochhar, the cost of which would be borne by Kochhar.Kochchar was arrested by ED on September 7 in connection with money laundering allegations linked to ICICI Bank scam and was subsequently remanded in ED custody by PMLA court the next day. ED took up the probe into money laundering after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case of corruption against the Kochhars in 2017 following allegations that ICIC Bank had sanctioned credit facility of around ₹3,250 crores to various entities in violation of the rules. It was alleged that the couple received kickbacks for sanctioning the credits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/icici-bank-scam-accused-deepak-kochhar-tests-positive-for-covid-19-court-allows-plea-to-shift-to-private-hospital/story-1stTR9l66YQ0J7aqgyEYrI.html

According to GRP officers, the accused, Bajirao Maruti Khatkar, was wanted from December 2019. However, he evaded arrest and fled to Kolhapur when train services were shut due to the lockdown. Assistant inspector Hemraj Sathe from unit 2 of GRP crime branch said, Khatkar had, on December 27, 2019, stole a bag kept on the baggage shelf in a Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus-bound train for Thane. The commuter, who alighted the train at Mulund station, reported the incident to GRP. The commuter said she had jewellery worth ₹2 lakh and a mobile phone in the bag. “We tried to track down the accused with the help of CCTV at Mulund station, but had not been able to identify him,” said Sathe. During lockdown, when the officers got in touch with informers who said most of the petty criminals had fled to their villages as local trains were shut. “With the help of the cybercrime police officers, we were able to get the call data record of the commuter’s mobile phone and noticed that several calls had been made to people in Kolhapur. We tracked the phone’s last location to Kolhapur,” added Sathe. On Friday, GRP officers reached Kolhapur and arrested Khatkar. “Khatkar was going to return to Mumbai once local train services resumed. We recovered the victim’s jewellery and mobile phone from Khatkar and are now verifying whether he was involved in other bag lifting cases as well,” said Sathe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/grp-arrests-40-year-old-bag-snatcher-from-kolhapur/story-bh0QO1iNqGAk7eqaP4lLGN.html

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: In Covid times, cultivate kinship with plants||Most people are feeling stressed out and anxious during the Covid-19 pandemic because of its multidimensional effect on our routines. With people confined indoors, more cases of domestic violence and mental health problems are also being reported.This could be the right time to start a positive engagement with nature -- by taking care of plants and starting a kitchen garden. As Canada based writer David Hobson quotes, “I grow plants for many reasons: to please my eye or to please my soul, to challenge the elements or to challenge my patience, for novelty or for nostalgia, but mostly for the joy in seeing them grow.” This activity benefits both the body and mind, irrespective of age. A kitchen garden has many benefits. Historically, people in America were urged to establish gardens at their home to ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruits during World War-II. They named these ‘victory gardens’ and contributed more than eight million tonnes of food during times of scarcity (equivalent to the country’s 40% fresh produce) from 20 million gardens. Learning from this admirable feat, you can use your backyard, terrace or balcony for kitchen gardening.You need to make a plan first, get the required materials and lay out the garden and enjoy watching plants grow and harvesting them. Vegetables can be given first priority as they make up the principal component of our diet. Growing plants will have following benefits:•Unique opportunity to have home grown, chemical free, freshly harvested vegetables. There’s a unique joy in watching plants grow. Nothing else can give us such exceptional happiness during this Covid-19 crisis•Working in the garden in open is healthy. It will give you an abundant amount of VitaminD• You won’t be breaking any social distancing rules. Your time will be utilised productively and your mind diverted from letting the pandemic situation overwhelm you • Gardening will improve your mental and physical well-being by providing a productive outlet. Likewise, with all the twisting/bending/stretching involved, you are bound to burn up those calories and give a boost to your spirits. • Growing plants will help your family bond as everyone should be encouraged to contribute their bit for the kitchen garden and get away from mobile phones and computers. A family can learn to care for each other in the wake of perceiving how nature grows and functions in the form of plants. • Cultivating/harvesting one’s own plants could be entertaining and instructive for children as an outdoor lab. It will encourage them to consume more vegetables and develop healthy dietary habits. •Consuming chemical free vegetables is great for one’s health.. •Could become a potential hobby. •This is the perfect time to experiment with your gardening skills as you will have ample time if you’re working out of home. It will also help you relax. To begin gardening, identify a small piece of land you will use. It could be your terrace. Get pots, soil, manure and select a spot which gets six to eight hours of sunlight. You can even use waste plastic containers and old drums. In case of apartments, put out containers, boxes and hang pots.Log into online sources for more information. One can start with leafy green vegetables. Try growing palak (spinach) due to its fast growing and high nutritional value. Apart from this, you can also try flowering annuals/indoor plants. With time and experience you can upgrade your skills and abilities. Urge your children to explore nature by nurturing plants. They will definitely love seeing little seedlings grow into plants and afterwards bear flowers and fruits. Who gets a chance to be close to plants, birds, squirrels, dirt, bugs, butterflies, insects and soil? Children will love it and so will you. During gardening, one can experience the delights of witnessing the germination of seeds, emergence of new leaves, conversion of a small bud into a beautiful and colourful flower and finally a fruit. As author Michael Pollan has said, “The garden suggests there might be a place where we can meet nature halfway”. hira@pau.eduThe writer is assistant professor at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-covid-times-cultivate-kinship-with-plants/story-qKy2cfagC7iwygkSxrWwcO.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||BMC to maintain Mumbai’s Carter Road Promenade||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to take over the upkeep of the iconic Carter Road, after it lay unmaintained for over 2.5 months since the agreement with Bandra West Residents’ Association’s (BWRA) to oversee the promenade, ended on June 30. The decision was taken in a meeting between Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the guardian minister for suburban Mumbai, Maharashtra fisheries and ports minister Aslam Shaikh, and officials from BMC on Friday. Aslam Shaikh said, “BMC and MMB (Mumbai Maritime Board) have agreed that BMC will maintain the promenade.” A formula will be worked out for sharing profit arising from advertisements, and other public activities that take place at the promenade. Officials said that no commercial exploitation of the space will happen. Asif Zakaria, Congress corporator from Bandra (West) said, “After two decades of maintaining the space, in March this year BWRA had expressed they cannot continue maintaining the promenade. However, MMB requested them to continue till June 30, until their agreement ended. After BWRA’s agreement ended, the association surrendered Carter Road to MMB, which owns the land. I urged BMC to take over its maintenance, as the civic body maintains the Worli and Marine Drive Promenade, and already has the expertise, being the local body.”Both Zakaria, and members of BWRA had urged MMB and BMC to hand over maintenance and upkeep of the promenade to BMC, via letters written in July, August and September. However, no decision could be reached between BMC and MMB regarding sharing of profit from revenue generated from advertisements, and regarding who will maintain the space, Zakaria said. After June 30, BMC has been sweeping and cleaning the space. Aaditya Thackeray took to social media on Friday and said, “Thankful to my colleague cabinet minister @AslamShaikh_MLA ji for a quick meeting over Carter Road Promenade. Officials from MMB and @mybmc met with us and have resolved the issue of maintenance. ...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-maintain-mumbai-s-carter-road-promenade/story-6GmtvWq9EUxtVgy8vX1MlL.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Mahul to get its own real-time air monitoring station along with 4 other ‘critically polluted’ sites in Mumbai by December: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will set up five continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) in Mahul village, Chembur; Shivaji Nagar, Deonar; Pant Nagar, Ghatkopar; Charkop, Kandivli (West); and Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan And Zoo, Byculla. The Mahul area in the eastern suburbs, which was described as a “gas chamber” by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last month, should have an operational CAAQMS by December. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the proposal would be finalised by BMC’s environment department in the coming week. “Display boards with air quality index (AQI), weather information, and daily forecast will alert citizens about health risks of poor air quality. Mahul will be especially benefitted since it does not have a dedicated air quality monitoring mechanism,” said Kakani. For over two years, residents of Mahul-Trombay have complained of dangerous levels of air pollution due to refineries and thermal power plants in the area. These pose a health risk and several court orders have directed industries to reduce emissions. However, the area’s pollution levels remain high. Last month, NGT told four industrial firms to pay Rs. 286.2 crore as environmental compensation due to air pollution damages. Each CAAQMS will record levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (benzene, toluene, and xylene), hydrocarbons (methane and non-methane), carbon monoxide, ozone, and ammonia. “Data from all five stations with analyser-based models will be connected to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) servers as per mandates issued to the BMC under the National Clean Air Program,” said a scientist from BMC’s environment department. These five stations will be the first real-time network setup by BMC in Mumbai, apart from the 10 existing stations run by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and another 15 by MPCB. In the first phase of BMC’s plan, the selected locations include five locations identified as critically-polluted by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2014. Tentative locations for the next set of stations are Love Grove pumping station in Worli; Hasnabad Municipal School in Khar (West); a municipal school in Tilak Nagar, Chembur; KMJ Phule Hospital in Vikhroli; T-Ward office in Mulund (West); and selected spots in Prabhadevi, Saki Naka, and Oshiwara. Kakani said the second phase will entail the installation of 127 sensor-based low cost air monitoring devices across select locations. “Our aim is to have a more dense spatial monitoring network to identify hotspots,” he said. Proposal for air purifying unit in every ward, BMC not convinced senior BMC official said a nagar sevak had recently submitted a proposal for the installation of air purifying systems in every ward similar to the Wind Augmentation and Air Purifying Units (WAYU) installed at Mumbai traffic junctions in 2017 by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. “The proposal will be heard during our monthly general body meeting on September 28. This model did not help achieve clean air quality at junctions at the time, and it does not meet MPCB and CPCB norms. We need to first be aware about the concentration before implementing such models,” said a senior civic official. Kakani said he was not aware about it.Air quality monitoring mechanismAmbient air quality monitoring is done through a manual method (analysis of pollutants measured once every six days where data is transferred manually), continuous - CAAQMS method (automatic real-time data collection of pollutants measured), and real-time low-cost sensors (based on light scattering technology using small equipment). According to MPCB, manual monitors cost Rs. 8 lakh per station per annum while continuous ones cost Rs. 1.5 crore per station per annum.

19-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police constable booked for ‘spreading disaffection’ among colleagues against seniors||The city police booked a constable on Thursday who allegedly tried to spread disaffection among other personnel against senior officers. The accused constable, Sachin Ambhiram Jaiswal, would make record audios or videos of police personnel on issues faced by them. He would then upload the clips on police’s WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms. HT tried to contact Jaiswal, but his phone was switched off. Action against Jaiswal was taken after deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of the quick response team (QRT) (an elite commando unit formed after the 26/11 terror attacks), Vasant Jadhav, registered a complaint against the constable at Worli police station. According to Jadhav’s complaint, on September 12, he received a call around 8pm from Jaiswal. “Jaiswal asked Jadhav why he did not relieve six commandos [from QRT], who are selected for the special protection unit (SPU) for training at Pune. When Jadhav asked Jaiswal if he was from QRT, the constable informed him that he is from the local arms division at Naigaon and called the DCP on behalf of the police union. Jadhav told Jaiswal that the commandos were not relieved based on the commissioner of police’s order,” stated the DCP’s complaint. Four hours later, Jadhav learnt that an audio clip of his statements was uploaded by a QRT constable on a WhatsApp group of the police. “Jaiswal uploaded the recorded conversation on WhatsApp groups with an intention of spreading disaffection among the personnel of QRT against their seniors and the government, and hence I have lodged a complaint against him,” Jadhav stated in the first information report (FIR) registered on Thursday. Worli police booked Jaiswal under section 3 of the Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922. The charge is to penalise a person who intentionally causes or attempts to cause, or does any act which he knows is likely to cause disaffection towards the government established by law, among members of police force; or induces or attempts to induce or does any act which he knows is likely to induce any member of a police force to withhold his services or to commit a breach of discipline. An officer from Worli police station said the constable may be suspended soon as he went against the seniors and it amounts to indiscipline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-constable-booked-for-spreading-disaffection-among-colleagues-against-seniors/story-aSaUlQIFw8kGORM8byxauM.html
19-09-2020||Noida||Homebuyers of Jaypee Kalypso Court conduct ceremony to restart work on project||Homebuyers of Jaypee Kalypso Court in Sector 128, along with officials of Uttar Pradesh-Real Estate Authority (UP-Rera), conducted a pooja ceremony on the project site on Saturday, thereby paving the way for the recommencement of the construction work on the project, which has been stuck for the past nine years. This is the first time since RERA came into existence in 2016, that a homebuyers’ association has managed to take over the construction work of a real estate project after the developer failed to finish it.Jaypee Kalypso Court is a part of debt-ridden Jaypee Group’s Wish Town project, along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The project was launched in 2007 and was supposed to house 1,140 residential units. However, the developer, Jaiprakash Associate Limited, missed its 2010-2011 deadline, forcing the homebuyers’ association to approach UP-Rera in 2019.“This is a first-of-its-kind initiative, in which the homebuyers have taken over an unfinished project. They have been suffering for a long time. We hope that homebuyers now get the possession of their residential units within the new stipulated timeline. There are many other viable projects in the national capital region (NCR) where this model can be replicated. The authority hopes that many more stalled projects can be now be completed in this manner if the homebuyers’ association and the developer are able to mutually work together,” Balvinder Kumar member of the UP-Rera.The project has a total of eight towers, of which four have been completed and the rest are under construction. It has total of 304 units out of which 274 are sold out and the remaining are unsold. The 274 units are in towers 7, 8, 11, and 12. Under the provisions of Section 8 of the Rera Act, the authority can allow homebuyers to take over an unfinished housing project.“Jaypee Kalypso Court is the first such project under UP-Rera, in which the buyers’ association has overtaken the delayed project to finish the remaining construction work. The original developer of the project, Jaiprakash Associate Limited, has been rehired as the contractor of the project and has been told to infuse ₹45 crore into the project and complete the remaining development work within a period of 18 months, including three months for mobilising resources,” said Rajive Kumar chairman of UP-Rera.The authority will closely monitor the completion of this project through a project advisory and monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of Balvinder Kumar, who is a member UP-Rera. The committee will also consist of the CEO of Noida authority, the finance controller of UP-Rera, the technical advisor of UP- Rera, and others, said officials.Homebuyers present at the ceremony said they were thankful to the authority for their support. “After waiting for so many years and approaching several government officials for redressal of our grievances, we finally reached out to UP-Rera. We are now hopeful that the project will be completed by next year. We are thankful to the UP-Rera for their support,” Dr. SK Dubey a homebuyer of Tower 7. “A whole decade has passed and now I am over 65 years of age. I am grateful to all the officials of Rera to make this happen,” said Rajender Kumar, a homebuyer of Tower 11.The project requires a total of ₹103.3 crore to finish the remaining construction work. While the contractor has been asked to infuse ₹45 crore, the remaining money will come from the sale of the unsold units. The proposed completion date is January 2022, said UP-Rera officials.Ajit Kumar, advisor, Jaypee Group, said, “We are committed to work under the supervision of UP-Rera, along with the homebuyers to ensure that the residential units are delivered. We have already provided ₹6 crore in an escrow account, while ₹6 crore more will soon be released. Buyers would also contribute to fund the remaining construction work. We will fulfil our commitment to complete the project on time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/homebuyers-of-jaypee-kalypso-court-conduct-ceremony-to-restart-work-on-project/story-a3CNN3sDAGQ66hxXd8crqM.html

Now, to further support investors, we have decided upon this scheme which can encourage entrepreneurs, who deal with IT businesses. We have multiple offerings for investors in different sectors,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer of GNIDA.The authority has 10,500 square metres of land at its disposal to be allotted for BPO units in sectors Knowledge Park-V and Techzone-7. For these, plots range between 500 and 1,000 square metres in size.For IT and ITES units, there are 175 acres of land in sectors Techzone, Techzone 2 and Knowledge Park-V, while plot sizes are in the range of 40,470 to 1,03,049 lakh square metres.If the project involves ₹200 crore of investment then as per the UP industrial policy-2017, the investor can approach the state additional chief secretary of ITES or IT or the Greater Noida chief executive officer. Projects under this category fall into mega, mega plus or super mega plus projects, said officials.“The authority will issue a comfort letter for such a big project so that the investor gets the allotment letter issued within 15 days without any hassle, provided the investor would put in ₹7 crore per acre for the project,” said the Chandar.For projects whose budget is less than ₹200 crore, allotment can be done via www.greaternoidaauthority.in without any problem, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-boost-growth-and-job-creation-greater-noida-decides-to-allot-land-to-it-bpo-call-centres/story-yZDqWt70teiWsfUr3zEsfI.html
19-09-2020||City||Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan, rest house meant for pilgrims, awaits govt nod to open||The Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s pet project, is complete and waiting for directions from the state government to start operations, officials of the UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, the construction agency, said on Saturday. The pilgrim centre is meant for stay of pilgrims taking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, Kanwar Yatra and Sindhu Yatra. The new building -- which houses a basement, ground floor and four other storeys -- has come up at Indirapuram and can accommodate 280 people in 94 rooms. The project, spread over an area of about 9,000 square metres, is completed at a total cost of about ₹70 crore. “The construction of the building is complete and all the furniture, fixtures and other amenities have also been provided. We have now written to UP’s Dharmarth Karya Vibhag (department of religious affairs) to take over the project and decide accordingly about its operations. The construction cost of the building is about ₹57.99 crore while the rest expenditure is on furniture, fixture, etc,” said SK Tyagi, project manager of the UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, a UP government undertaking. “The building has beautiful architecture and we have also made use of sandstone in the construction,” he added. The project was scheduled to get complete in March this year, but got delayed due to the lockdown and last year’s ban on construction activities due to rise in air pollution. CM Yogi Adityanath had laid its foundation stone in August 2017. The project was initially proposed at Arthala near the Ala Hazrat Haj House. However, some environmentalists had filed complaints with the district administration maintaining that one of the major land chunks was registered as ‘Jheel’ – a water body – whose nature cannot be changed as per norms. The municipal corporation, on the other hand, claimed that the land was ‘banjar’ (barren) in their property records. HT had published several reports on the controversy. Later, the then district magistrate, Ministhy S, took cognizance and acted swiftly in the matter, and the land at Indirapuram was finalised by the UP government. In June this year, Anil Agrawal, Rajya Sabha MP from UP and also a resident of Ghaziabad, had written to the chief minister to dedicate some of the floors of Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan for healthcare facility. However, officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said that there is no such proposal by the government. “As per last known development, the Dharmarth Vibhag has sought suggestions from the tourism department and the Ghaziabad development authority about the operation of the Kailash Mansarowar Bhawan. The finalisation is to be done,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kailash-mansarovar-bhawan-rest-house-meant-for-pilgrims-awaits-govt-nod-to-open/story-Ki4tfVwOBfdB9ZQZbWed4M.html
19-09-2020||City||Amid opposition, corporation removes encroachment from land meant for UP’s first political training institute||The corporation officials on Saturday launched a massive encroachment on land earmarked for UP’s first political training institute in Nandgram. People who had built houses there opposed the move saying that they had documents to prove their legal nature, but official said they managed to remove around 20 of the 100 structures. The proposed institute is meant to train politicians and activists in public policy and other advanced political subjects, and is planned to come up on land owned by the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. Located near the Hindon Elevated Road, it measures a little over 3 hectares, but about 1.37 hectares was encroached with people constructing houses and boundary walls. “We have been able to remove a number of encroachers during the past year. Of the 101 houses constructed on the site, 11 are directly over the land meant for the institute, while the rest of the houses, their boundary walls etc are on its periphery. We have been meetings the encroachers and also served them notices,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. “The land belongs to the municipal corporation and will be freed up in graded manner. The project depends on it.” On Saturday, the officials said that they demolished about 20 different structures, including boundary walls and three houses. Encroachers opposed it, relying in claims of being legal and that they had been on the plot for over two decades. The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet had cleared the proposal in 2018 and the project is estimated to cost about ₹168 crore. Maya Devi, local councillor from ward number six opposed the move by the corporation, but the effort landed her in a private hospital. “My mother is in ICU with high blood pressure and high sugar levels after opposing the move,” said Tushar Kumar, the councillor’s son. “Those having houses on the land have proper registries and documents of ownership, and purchased the land 20 years ago. Locals told us that the eviction notices were pasted at the house on Friday night.”He said the councillor had pressed the municipal corporation for at least 15 days’ time for the residents.Municipal commissioner Tanwar, however, reiterated that the land belonged to the government. “The encroachers were probably duped by some people who claimed that the land belonged to them and issued fake documents,” Tanwar said. Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city), said that police were deployed for the drive on demand from the corporation. “We have not received any complaint so far from the corporation with regard to the protest,” he said. The institute is proposed to be constructed by Construction & Design Services, a unit of UP Jal Nigam, and part of the project approved by the UP housing department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-opposition-corporation-removes-encroachment-from-land-meant-for-up-s-first-political-training-institute/story-WC1H2Wzz3zKy15bmPA9LOJ.html

19-09-2020||City||UP to have e-reports of Covid-19 tests that patients can download||With the number of Covid-19 cases on the rise in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government has set up a facility to generate electronic reports of Covid-19 tests, which patients can download at their end and keep for further use. The state officials said chief minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to inaugurate the online facility Sunday. Currently, people undergoing RT-PCR tests have to visit test centres again after two to five days to collect reports manually. Manual collection of reports had led to crowding at the collection counters and had also posed the added risk of having Covid positive people in the queue. To resolve this, a fortnight ago, health officials had started sending reports as text messages to patients but these were not downloadable.E-reports, on the other hand, will be available as soon as the testing centres upload the result on the state portal. The e-report availability depends on how fast the reports are uploaded by the labs, even though the portal will be updated daily.According to officials, the state has tested 8,399,785 people till Friday and all efforts are being made to scale up the testing to 10 million by the end of September. Till Saturday, Uttar Pradesh has 348,517 Covid cases, which includes 66,874 active cases, 4,953 deaths and 276,690 discharged cases.The testing in the state include rapid antigen kits, TrueNat machines and RT-PCR and the e-reports are expected to benefit residents. An antigen test result is available within the hour, but symptomatic persons and those with co-morbid conditions who test negative on antigen test have to undergo RT-PCR testing. “From Sunday, a new facility is getting launched wherein the test report will be available online and can also be downloaded. People will be able to download the report from the state health department website, from under the tab ‘laboratory results’, using the mobile phone number given at the time of the test,” Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary (health), said. “Once the mobile number gets entered, an OTP will be sent to that number and (s)he can access the test report. The reports are updated daily. The new facility is to be inaugurated by the chief minister on Sunday and will be beneficial to people,” he said. “Once the online system starts, people will be able to get reports that they can download,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said. The district is testing about 4,000 samples daily and about 1,000 to 1,200 of these are through RT-PCR tests. Till Saturday, Ghaziabad has a total 12,153 Covid cases. This includes 1,933 active cases, 74 deaths and 10,146 discharged cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-to-have-e-reports-of-covid-19-tests-that-patients-can-download/story-JqZKUzmKC3fFBCPHiMLFMO.html
19-09-2020||City||EPCA chief directs Ghaziabad to control dust, burning of waste, ensure better traffic management||Chairperson of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) Bhure Lal on Saturday visited several spots in Ghaziabad and directed officials to strictly control dust, roadside parking, burning of solid and plastic waste, apart from ensuring effective traffic management.He said Ghaziabad needs to come up with a parking plan to prevent roadside parking of trucks and other vehicles which in turn cause traffic bottlenecks and lead to higher vehicular emissions. Lal, who is currently visiting different districts in western Uttar Pradesh, spent a substantial time in different areas of Ghaziabad conducting inspections. While driving on the NH-9 (Delhi-Meerut) stretch, he found the road shrouded in plumes of dust and directed the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials to penalise National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which is currently taking up the construction of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME). “I found huge plumes of dust from the under-construction project and have directed UPPCB regional officer to impose a penalty on NHAI. In Kaushambi, there was a garbage dump and I have directed for its removal. At Bulandshahr Road Industrial Area, there was irregular parking and a major chunk of the green belt was filled with garbage and plastic waste. I have directed for the restoration of the green belt,” Lal said. Based on his directions, the UPPCB said it will impose a fine of ₹5 lakh on NHAI. “A penalty of ₹5 lakh has been proposed against NHAI for causing dust emission on NH-9. We have already prepared the winter action plan and it includes measures against dust emission, burning of waste and traffic management,” Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, said. The NHAI officials said they have completed the black topping of the NH-9 section in question. “There are some patches where the work is ongoing, but motorists often weave in and out of the work site, throwing up more dust. In case a penalty is levied against us, we will also forward UPPCB our point of view. On our part, we have already deployed water tankers for sprinkling water at our sites as well as three anti-smog guns,” Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI, said. On the matter of garbage dumping in Bulandshahr Road Industrial Area, municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said he has directed his teams to clean the area. “The area has several garbage and construction and demolition waste dumps. All the waste will be immediately lifted. We have already deployed road sweeping machines to control dust emission and there is also a plan in the works to wash major roads during night hours, at least twice a week,” he said. Lal also raised four vital points concerning Ghaziabad, a district that has been reeling under severe pollution levels, especially during the winter, for the past several years. “The major problem which I feel need to be addressed is the issue of burning of solid waste and garbage. In many areas, such as Hindon Vihar, Pasonda, Tulsi Niketan and even Loni, burning activities take place. This year, we do not want any garbage burning taking place. The main problem in Ghaziabad is fugitive dust. Officials have been asked to put in place dust control measures,” he said. “The other two points are related to traffic. I have directed officials to come up with a parking plan and also to better regulate traffic as snarls lead to more pollution due to vehicular emissions,” the EPCA chief said. Lal also visited nearby districts of Hapur, Meerut and Sonipat and Panipat in Haryana. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said a winter action plan to tackle pollution is ready. “We will abide by all the directions of EPCA chief and all respective departments will implement air pollution abatement measures. We have already started executing the winter action plan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/epca-chief-directs-ghaziabad-to-control-dust-burning-of-waste-ensure-better-traffic-management/story-abOGDDgCWNpXZ1Jv8ZugZK.html
19-09-2020||Gurugram||Teachers to be tested for Covid-19 as schools reopen for guidance visits from Sept 21||With schools set to open on Monday for students of classes 9 to 12 who wish for guidance from their teachers, the district education and health departments plan to get government teachers tested for Covid-19. In co-ordination with the health officials, the education department will submit a week-long schedule, dividing the teaching staff to be tested at various Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs), according to the order issued by the directorate of secondary education on Saturday.Saturday’s order follows a September 16 direction from the directorate that mandated testing of all teachers at the schools. This, some health officials say, is against the Union government guidelines. “But this is against Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) guidelines,” said a senior health official on condition of anonymity. “It allows only asymptomatic persons (teachers, employees and students) in the school premises and only the symptomatic staff or student has to be tested. There is no such clause for testing the entire teaching staff. People can always contract the coronavirus even if they are tested negative for the first time.”The issue was raised in a meeting with the state officials on Saturday. It was thereafter decided that the education department will prepare a plan to test teachers in batches. Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said, “It is not possible to test all teachers in one-go. It has to be administered in a staggered manner. Teachers who will be joining the work will have to get themselves tested in the nearby Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC). Only those who are symptomatic will be tested through rapid antigen test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR).”As per the MHA guidelines, part of the Unlock 4 plan, students who want to attend the school will also have to get a written consent from their parent or guardian. Only schools outside containment zones will be allowed to open. Also, teachers and students living in containment zones will not be allowed to attend the school. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that government schools expect many students to voluntarily come to school. “We have been asked to visit the nearest health center to get these tests done,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teachers-to-be-tested-for-covid-19-as-schools-reopen-for-guidance-visits-from-sept-21/story-Hf6xW5s9WjMHFziZ6wkihI.html

19-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Health department will charge for Covid tests for work, travel purposes||Gurugram: The state health department on Saturday instructed civil surgeons in all districts of Haryana to set up designated centres for ‘non-medical’ Covid-19 tests, which will be chargeable at the same rates being levied by private laboratories. ‘Non-medical’ tests, health department officials explained, refer to those tests which are administered to individuals who require a Covid-negative certificate to return to work or for travel purposes. The development comes after several districts, including Gurugram, started witnessing a sudden influx of people seeking Covid-19 tests at primary healthcare centres (PHCs) since September 7, when the state government allowed walk-in tests (without a doctor’s prescription) for Covid-19. In Gurugram, the district health department will set up a dedicated facility for non-medical tests at Civil Hospital in Sector 10 in the coming week, confirmed Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. This is also the first time during the Covid-19 outbreak that the health department will charge for any test conducted as part of its public health response. As per the Saturday’s order (a copy of which is with HT), an RT-PCR test will be chargeable at ₹1,600, while a rapid antigen test will cost ₹650. An ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test, which is done to check for presence of antibodies, will cost ₹250. “Creating a separate facility for non-medical tests will take away some strain that our PHCs have been facing, ever since walk-in tests were introduced. The removal of the mandatory prescription rider has resulted in many individuals, in both blue and white collar jobs, seeking tests to prove to their employers that they do not have Covid-19, but that is not what we were trying to facilitate. I strongly advise that only those people who have had confirmed contact with a positive patients, or who have symptoms, seek a free test,” said Yadav, emphasizing that all tests conducted for medical purposes will remain free of cost. On Saturday, HT spoke to multiple people seeking non-medical tests to understand their reasons for doing so. Manish Yadav, who works at a private insurance firm in the city and was getting himself tested at a PHC in Wazirabad, said, “My job involves visiting people’s homes to verify their documents. My employer has called me back to work after two months, but said I will need a Covid-negative certificate. They are not paying for the test, so I came here because it’s free.” Manju Sindhu, a teacher who works at a private school in Delhi’s RK Puram area, approached the Gurugram health department’s office on Jharsa Road for an RT-PCR test over the weekend. “With the metro having reopened, I am expected to go to school two to three times a week, but not without producing a negative certificate. I came to know that we can get tested for free here,” she said. Nearly identical stories were narrated by a domestic help whose new employer had asked her to get tested before joining work, as well as an industry worker in Udyog Vihar whose employer declined to pay for his test.“This is the main issue, and it diverts testing resources away from those who may require it for medical diagnosis. Any employer who insists on a Covid-negative certificate should ideally be willing to pay for it as well. Our focus is to isolate positive cases, keep an eye out for symptoms, and prevent deaths,” Yadav said.On September 5, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) had issued a revised testing advisory to all states, paving the way for walk-in tests. The revised criteria was implemented in Gurugram on September 7. According to estimates given by doctors and lab technicians across various PHCs in the district, the demand for non-medical tests has been rising with each passing day since then. “We were earlier getting 10 to 15 people in a day. Now, about 30 to 40 people come in demanding to be tested,” said Anantha K, a senior lab technician with the health department.Experts, on the other hand, were critical of the state health department’s decision to charge for Covid-19 tests. Malini Aisola, co-convener, All India Drug Action Network, said, “All public testing for Covid-19 should be free of cost. It is an unfair practice for the government to be charging for tests conducted as part of a public health response. It is evident from the health department’s own observations that a large section of the population, who require tests for so-called ‘non-medical’ reasons, are not able to afford them. In that sense, this policy is also an exclusionary one.”Echoing similar views, Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former head of the department of community medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh, said, “Every single Covid-19 test administered by the government needs to be free. I don’t understand what is meant by a ‘non-medical’ test. Every test plays an important role in preventing the spread of Covid-19.” Non-medical tests can also be availed for interstate travel purposes, or “for joining any educational institution”, as per the health department’s order on Saturday. No fresh case in Bhondsi JailMeanwhile, 101 rapid antigen tests were administered to inmates at Bhondsi Jail on Saturday, and no new cases of Covid-19 were reported. A total of 42 prisoners have so far tested positive for the disease, with 35 patients having already recovered. Saturday marked the third testing drive in Bhondsi prison this month. “As of now, none of the patients have shown severe symptoms. All those who have tested positive have been made to undergo a period of 17 days’ isolation at a facility in Sector 9. Soon, such patients will be kept under observation at a community centre in Begumpur Khatola,” said Sanjay Kumar, assistant jail superintendent. Health department officials did not share any plan to conduct further testing inside the prison, but said they are keeping a close watch on inmates’ symptoms. “All prisoners who are sent outside for any purpose will be quarantined on return, tested and only then released to his usual barracks,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-health-department-will-charge-for-covid-tests-for-work-travel-purposes/story-1uKNjr7GUd3dwHvmh1qGzL.html

This information, which has been revealed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, comes in the backdrop of mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu’s efforts to rein in fuel theft in the corporation. Activist Rohit Sabharwal, who had filed the RTI application, has sought an inquiry into the matter as MC, on an average, has spent around Rs 71 lakh a month on fuel alone. As per information, the civic body’s expenditure on fuel in 2019 was Rs 8.96 crore, while another Rs 3.12 crore were spent on it till May 31 this year. The fuel was purchased against 55 vehicles for officials, 79 tractors, 53 Tata ace, 43 tippers, 22 tankers, jetting machines and trucks, 19 JCB cranes and loaders, 14 road rollers, and nine Tata 407 and cranes.The mayor had recently marked an inquiry after it was suspected that some employees got fuel allocated for defunct tractors. A sanitary inspector was removed from field duty till the inquiry was completed. MC had also decided to auction around 70 vehicles, mostly Hindustan Ambassador and Maruti Gypsy cars that are 15 years old to save expenditure on fuel and repairs. Sabharwal said besides an inquiry into the misuse or theft of fuel, it should be looked into whether the entire machinery was at work during the lockdown and how much fuel was issued against the vehicles during that time. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “I am keeping an eye on fuel consumption in MC, but the expenditure is anyway on the higher side as the civic body utilises a large number of vehicles. Inquiries were marked in the past wherever any theft or manipulation was suspected and the staff concerned were also penalised.”“Besides, no fuel is allocated on Sundays to avoid misuse and unnecessary movement of vehicles has been restricted. I do not even take my pilot car to every place I visit in routine to save the expenditure,” he added. Heavy vehicles being driven by sweepers, beldars The RTI response also revealed that most of the MC vehicles, including heavy vehicles like cranes, JCB machines, tippers and road rollers, were being driven by Class-4 employees, including sweepers, sewermen, beldars, etc. Sabharwal said MC should check whether these employees have valid driving licences for heavy vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cash-strapped-ludhiana-mc-spent-12-08-crore-on-fuel-in-17-months-reveals-rti/story-hQgFTtt7UH5ivNkbJS9qTN.html

19-09-2020||City||Farmers to protest across Haryana against farm ordinances||Gurugram: Farmers in Haryana will block roads across the state on Sunday to protest the three agriculture ordinances and press for their withdrawal, alleging these are against their interest. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Haryana (Charuni), Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Union and other groups on Friday said they will block roads from 12 pm to 3 pm in different parts of the state. The farmers groups, however, said they will use different modes to protest but ensure people don’t suffer. Gurnam Singh Charuni, BKU, president, Haryana, who heads a large faction, said a state wide chakka-jam will be held in the state from 12 pm to 3 pm on Sunday, and if the government does not address the grievances of farmers, a nationwide protest will be held on September 25. “The government can register criminal cases but our resolve will not be broken and we have the support of multiple farmers organisations,” Charuni said. BKU leaders said the government needs to discuss the matter with farmers and clear their doubts. “Such important issues can’t be forced upon people,” they said. BKU Haryana (Charuni) is already staging state-level symbolic protests at all district headquarters in Haryana from 10 am to 4 pm since September 16.They said that a farmers protest in a limited manner will also be held in Gurugram. Dharmbir Singh, district secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha said they will hold a protest in various parts of the state and burn the effigy of government as mark of protest. “We will block the road for a few minutes to protest against these policies,” said Singh. Asked if the protest will be held in Gurugram as well, Singh said that since the number of farmers was fewer in the city, they would hold a symbolic protest. The farmer leaders said the association of commission agents, rice millers and other stakeholders have supported their demand for withdrawal of these ordinances. Rattan Singh Mann, president, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Haryana said they are planning protests and will hold a mahapanchayat on October 5 to discuss the matters with farmers. “These policies are against the people and must be taken back,” he said. The three agriculture ordinances against which the farmers are fighting were passed in June. These are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, and an amendment in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.In view of the statewide road blockade call, the Haryana Government has issued directions to ensure law and order and minimise inconvenience to the people of the state.An official spokesman said all executive magistrates and police officers have been asked to remain present in the districts and they should not proceed on leave. He said the executive magistrates have been directed to remain stationed along with their police counterparts at all such places where congregation of protestors is anticipated.

Vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon thanked the farmers and farm women for their massive participation in the Kisan Mela, which was organised virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Day 2, Dhillon again urged farmers not to burn paddy straw and adopt straw management technologies for environmental protection. Saturday saw three panel discussions, which were showcased via http://www.kisanmela.pau.edu/.In the panel discussion on “Water-Saving Technologies”, SS Kukal, dean, College of Agriculture; GS Mangat, head, department of plant breeding and genetics; OP Choudhary, head, department of soil science; KG Singh, head, department of soil and water engineering; Ajmer Brar, senior agronomist; Rajan Aggarwal, principal scientist from PAU; Dr Rajesh Vashisht, joint director, agriculture, and Gurpreet Singh Aulakh, sub-divisional soil conservation officer, were the panel experts.Rakesh Sharda, principal scientist, extension (soil and water engineering), was the moderator of the discussion. A farmer, Hardeep Singh from Patran in Sangrur, also shared his experience with other farmers. During the discussion, the experts advised farmers to grow water-saving varieties of paddy recommended by PAU and also adopt water-saving technologies. Expressing concern over the declining groundwater table and its poor quality, they urged farmers to refrain from cultivating PUSA-44 as it required more water and stick to paddy transplanting time as recommended by the Punjab government.The area under direct seeded rice (DSR), which was a water-saving technology, had increased to 5 lakh hectares in Punjab, they disclosed. The experts advocated the use of drip irrigation system, which was water as well as labour-saving. Regarding subsidies, they said 80% subsidy was being provided by the state government on drip irrigation, 90% to small farmers and 60% on solar pumps. Underground pipeline system, which saves 30 to 40% of water, was also being promoted in south and central Punjab, they said. The second panel discussion on “Livestock Production and Allied Occupations” stressed on the adoption of subsidiary occupations like poultry, dairy and fish farming, etc., along with agriculture. Scientists from Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University were the panel experts. In the last panel discussion on “Voice of Farmers,” AS Dhindsa, a flower and vegetable seed producer known for exporting seed to 100 countries; KBS Sidhu, an innovative farmer known for export of fresh vegetables; and progressive farmers Devinder Singh Mukshabad, Mohinder Singh Dosanjh, Jagtar Singh Brar and Balwinder Singh Tikka shared their experiences with other farmers. They stressed on making agriculture a precision agriculture linked with marketing, maintaining farm records and urged youth not to avoid farming. AS Dhatt, additional director of research (horticulture) and Kamal Vatta, head, department of economics and sociology, PAU, were the moderators of the discussion. TS Riar, additional director communication, said on a whole, the mela was a big success. Old memories of previous Kisan Melas were revived and songs on paddy straw management was another highlight of the mela, he added.Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, PAU, said the virtual Kisan Mela will be made a permanent feature, along with the traditional mela. “The seeds of all varieties will be ready within a week and farmers can contact their nearby Krishi Vigyan Kendras or get information on Farm Inputs App for purchase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pau-virtual-kisan-mela-event-ends-with-tips-to-farmers-on-water-saving-tech-allied-occupations/story-5ooE4GcDqrsw95iVzKWUTO.html

Water supply has been affected in Makkar Colony in Ward 29, and Prem Ashram Colony and Maha Singh Nagar in Ward 31. Residents are relying on water tankers.SAD leader Sandep Shukla said, “Residents of the affected areas have lodged a complaint with the MC but officials of the bridges and roads department and operations and maintenance cell are passing the buck to each other, while residents are bearing the brunt .” “The MC has been taking action against residents for wasting water but water is overflowing out of the broken water supply line at Giaspura road for days now, but no one is paying heed to the problem,” he said. A resident of Maha Singh Nagar says,”It is difficult to fill buckets from tankers, especially in this scorching heat. Also, the required number of tankers are not being sent to the area.” MC executive engineer Ranbir Singh said, “I only received a complaint on Saturday morning. I have directed the ground staff to have the contractor repair the supply line. If he fails to do so, the MC will have it repaired by the evening. The expenditure incurred will be deducted from the contractor’s account while issuing payment for the road construction project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/damaged-supply-line-ludhiana-s-wards-29-31-go-without-water-for-a-week/story-moe0yGI68EvCzOcpto4csM.html

We have also come to know about certain problems but I won’t be able to discuss them before the media. These problems certainly need a solution and we hope that all of us contribute in controlling the pandemic,” he added. “We discussed about ICU beds, per day arrival of the patients, death rate and trend of the infection. We have prepared a list of three to four major hospitals In Jammu where the team should visit. These are the hospitals that witnessed sudden spike in deaths and include government chest diseases hospital and the GMCH,” he said.Besides Dr Hadda, who is a professor at the department of pulmonary critical care, AIIMS, New Delhi, the team comprises Dr Ramesh an epidemiologist.

In a press statement issued here, Sharma said the country is already reeling under recession and the three bills will adversely affect farmers, horticulturists and other people associated with agriculture. He said the government passed the bills in Lok Sabha despite protests not only by farmers and opposition parties but also government’s allies. Sharma said the way in which the legislations were promulgated through ordinance in a hasty manner seems these are aimed at benefiting government’s corporate cronies. “It will be the farmer who will be hit by these,” Sharma said, adding that if farmers sell their produce outside the Registered Agricultural Produce Market Committee, the states will suffer a loss of revenue as they will not be able to receive duty. “It is feared that this may eventually lead to the end of the minimum support price (MSP)-based procurement system and lead to increased exploitation by private companies,” he said. “This law is designed to suit the big industrialists who wish to dominate the Indian food and agribusiness,” he said, adding that it will weaken the bargaining power of the farmers. Besides, large private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors will get control, he added.Sharma said the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill proposes to exclude agricultural commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onions and potatoes from the list of essentials except under extraordinary circumstances like war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity. The limit of stock applicable to such items will also be eliminated. “This will allow big companies to have storage of these agricultural products so that they can impose their will on farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aicc-secretary-sudhir-sharma-slams-govt-over-agriculture-bills/story-Y3VusoQwnMhfF64nxdTEfP.html

He said that government should have anticipated such a situation and taken necessary measures by taking help from private hospitals and nursing homes, besides setting up of a thousand-bedded hospital.He drew the attention towards the paucity of beds, questioning how just 608 beds of the total capacity of 2,637 beds in Government Medical College and Associated Hospitals in Jammu will meet the current requirement. The situation is worse in semi-urban, urban and rural areas. Availability of oxygen is poor and dysfunctional ventilators are worrisome, he added.He called for installation of liquid oxygen plant, oxygen generation plant and others in hospitals to cater to the need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/declare-medical-emergency-in-jammu-rana/story-SsXbROoHiZFbIQjPUB5ypJ.html

The road blockade call comes almost a week after agitating farmers were lathicharged by cops in Kurukshetra’s Pipli. According to information, BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni had been going from district to district over the last two days to garner farmers’ support. According to Charuni, a total of 17 farmer organisations in the state are supporting Sunday’s protest and the farmers “are united despite the government’s efforts to divide them”. He said they will block the state and national highways from 12pm to 3pm and in each district, one or two spots will be picked, depending on the strength of the farmers. As per information, Charuni will lead the agitation from Yamunanagar, where farmers will block the Yamunanagar-Panchkula highway at Milk Majra toll plaza.Stating that political parties will be allowed to lend support, BKU (Charuni) state secretary Harpal Sudhal said, “Any political party can support the farmers’ protest but they will not be allowed to politicise it.”Meanwhile, a few political parties, including the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), have extended their support to the BKU. As per party insiders, INLD senior leader Abhay Chautala has issued instructions to all district level office-bearers to support the protest in their respective districts.

19-09-2020||City||Clean your refrigerator at least once a month||When was the last time you deep cleaned your refrigerator? If you cannot remember, it’s time you set about doing just that because in the absence of regular cleaning , your refrigerator could well be harbouring disease-causing micro organisms.Before frost-free refrigerators made their way into the market, consumers were forced to defrost their refrigerators once a week. Since that required emptying out the fridge and switching off the machine , that was also the time the refrigerators were thoroughly cleaned with a detergent solution and wiped dry. The self- defrosting machines of today have freed consumers from that cumbersome job, but in the process, consumers have lost the habit of cleaning their refrigerators regularly.Several studies conducted in different countries have shown a variety of pathogenic microbes in the refrigerators, reinforcing the need to clean them frequently to ensure the safety of food stored. Samples taken from the base, shelves and sides of refrigerators in the district of Vellore, Tamil Nadu, for example, revealed the presence of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal infections, besides infections in the urinary and respiratory tracts, such as Citrobactor, Proteus, Salmonella and E.Coli . In their paper titled “Isolation of various bacteria pathogens from domestic refrigerators” published in the Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research in 2012, the authors said there was an urgent need for consumer education on regular cleaning of the refrigerator , maintaining the right temperature, besides proper food storage and hand hygiene practices.More recently in 2019, the UK consumer Magazine ‘Which’, brought out by Consumers’ Association, analysed 10 refrigerators, for the presence of microbes. Five samples were taken from each refrigerator -- from the bottom shelf meant for storing meat, vegetable drawer, upper door rack, back wall of the refrigerator and the outer door handle. Analysis of the samples found that seven out of 10 refrigerators had harmful germs. Out of the 50 samples, 19 had high concentrations of Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella Oxytoca- bacteria that can cause respiratory and urinary tract infections. Another study published in the American Journal of Epidemology and Infectious Disease in 2017, revealed that all the 50 randomly selected household refrigerators in Calabar Metropolis, Nigeria, were contaminated with bacteria. In addition , 32 per cent had fungal and 28 per cent had parasitic organisms. So it is absolutely essential to regularly and thoroughly clean the refrigerator -- at least once a month, say food scientists. It is also extremely important to maintain the refrigerator at below 4 degree Celsius, freezer compartment at minus 18 degree C and not to crowd the refrigerator, so as to allow proper air circulation inside. And the cooked and ready to eat food should always be properly covered with a tight lid to prevent not only microbial contamination, but also the possibility of any worms or insects from raw vegetables (that may have been kept without cleaning) getting into food.Since the source of contamination is mainly raw food, it is always best to thoroughly wash and dry all fruits and vegetables before storing them in the refrigerator. Similarly, raw meat and poultry should be kept separately in tightly sealed containers. Always separate raw and cooked food and raw food on the bottom shelf and ready-to-eat food at the top .I must also mention that even though scientists say that there is no evidence of food borne transmission of Novel Coronavirus, they do say that the virus may survive for long periods in a refrigerator. Of course this is based on a 2010 study that used two surrogate viruses or viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV to examine the effect of temperature and humidity on its survival and found that at 4 degree C and a relative humidity of 20 per cent, for example, two-thirds of them survived for as long as 28 days. So do play safe and sanitise packets before you put them into the refrigerator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/clean-your-refrigerator-at-least-once-a-month/story-tcvB0EzxQiNibDAj1eJ6QJ.html

He demanded the immediate release of the arrested persons, and pressed for the regularisation of workers’ jobs, and also flats for all staffers under the jhuggi-jhopri (JJ) scheme. Azad, clad in grey trousers, white shirt and blue scarf, reached Sector 6 in a Mahindra Scorpio around 1pm. He soon mounted the Scorpio to address the protesters. A number of police personnel were deployed at the spot, who had locked the main entrance gate to the authority office. Azad, holding aloft a copy of the Indian Constitution in one hand and a broom in the another, demanded that sanitation worker be given their rights as per “the Book (Constitution)”. He addressed the gathering of over 1,000 people and also sat in protest for some time with the sanitation workers. “The police crackdown on sanitation workers on Friday was not right. These sanitation workers are corona warriors. The government launches schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission with the support of sanitation workers. They have been working for over a decade and they still get a meagre salary. The workers have been cheated of their dues,” he said. He also said there was no unity among sanitation workers and, hence, their demands were being ignored. On behalf of sanitation workers, Azad put forward five demands to the Noida authority -- all contractual workers should be directly employed by the authority; they should get flats under the JJ Scheme; Noida farmers’ land issues should be resolved; kin of Anil Balmiki, a contractual worker who killed himself on Monday, should get compensation and job;and the Noida authority should also ensure jobs to the local youth.The Bhim Army chief also demanded the release of six arrested sanitation workers and said he would intensify the protest in the coming days if these demands are not met. Saveer Makhwana, a sanitation worker, said on Friday, the police registered a case against 20 named, and 100 unnamed sanitation workers. They were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 353 (assault or criminal force on public servant) of the IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. “The police arrested six of our workers for demanding regularisation of jobs, and sent them to jail. The protest will continue till the arrested persons are released,” he said.Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty (OSD), Noida authority, said contractual workers are engaged for various works across the state and not just Noida. “We are not the only city which offers contractual jobs. We have informed higher authorities about the sanitation workers’ demands. We will also explore options to provide them flats under the JJ Scheme,” Singh said. Singh said Balmiki was a contractual worker and the contractor who employed him has given his family ₹1.10 lakh compensation and contractual jobs to two family members. Kumar Ranvijay, additional DCP, Noida, said the protest was peaceful on Saturday. “A police team was deployed at the spot to ensure that order was maintained. The six persons had created a ruckus and, hence, they were arrested. They will be released by the court following due process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bhim-army-chief-lends-support-to-striking-noida-sanitation-workers/story-2OlMo8l47Q80ChZk0bkhFK.html
19-09-2020||City||Missing saroops: Morcha for criminal case against culprits enters day 6||Amritsar The indefinite morcha (agitation) being undertaken by members of some Sikh bodies, including the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, outside the Teja Singh Samundri Hall, the headquarters of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), entered its sixth day on Saturday. Their demands in the case of missing 328 saroops of the Guru Granth Sahib have not been met yet.The agitators are seeking that the culprits in the missing saroops case to be booked under a criminal case, and that these be found. “We are firm on our demands. Till these are met, our morcha will continue. We are getting a good response from the sangat,” said Ranjit Singh, a leader of Sikh Youth Federation Bhindranwala, who is participating in the stir.Sikh activists visiting the Golden Temple are meeting the agitators and addressing them. A panthic gathering held on September 17 at the Akal Takht had also extended support to the sit-in. The dharna got major publicity after a nihang was injured on September 15, when the SGPC used force to disperse the agitators. The agitation was launched on September 14, when the SGPC executive committee, in a U-turn, resolved not to register a criminal case against its staffers indicted in an inquiry report into the missing saroops, claiming that it was competent to take action against them within the organisation.Without mentioning the SGPC’s U-turn, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh also referred to this on Friday, when SGPC office-bearers and executive committee members appeared before him at the Takht. The jathedar said, “Reversing decisions is not fair and it has hurt the reputation of the SGPC. The Akal Takht Sahib directs it to take decisions after consulting Sikh intellectuals and scholars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-saroops-morcha-for-criminal-case-against-culprits-enters-day-6/story-cHiRQ4lsMRrcEUhHE6pSTI.html
19-09-2020||Chandigarh||After Rohtang, focus shifts to Shinku La tunnel between Ladakh and Lahaul||With Atal Tunnel, formerly known as the Rohtang Tunnel on the Manali-Leh highway, set to be opened for traffic this month-end, the Centre has set the ball rolling for the construction of another high-altitude tunnel under the 16,730-ft-high Shinku La (pass) in Himachal Pradesh. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) under the ministry of road, transport and highways has speeded up the detailed project report (DPR) work on the 13.5-km Shinku La Tunnel connecting the Union Territory of Ladakh and tribal Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh. The high-level team led by KK Pathak, managing director, NHIDCL, along with Sanjeev Malik, executive director, visited the north and south portals of Shinku La tunnel on Thursday. The team drove from Leh via Padum to the north and south portals of Shinku La in two days, travelling almost 12 hours a day. Though Shinku La has no glacier, it is prone to avalanches during the snow season that hampers vehicular movement. Three years ago, Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completed the 39.6 km stretch connecting Lahaul valley with Zanskar. The stretch connecting Darcha with Shinku La drastically reduces the distance between Manali and Leh. The road is not only of strategic importance as it provides easier access areas on the Indo-China border but also comes as a relief for the 15-odd villages in Zanskar valley where residents have to walk for five to six days to either reach Leh or Manali. The BRO has already conducted feasibility studies to bore a tunnel under the 11,575-ft Zoji La connecting Srinagar and Leh. Zoji La is the second highest pass after Fotu La on the Srinagar-Leh highway, which often remains closed during winter. In 1948, Pakistani raiders had laid siege to Zoji La in their campaign to reach Ladakh but it was regained by the Indian forces after a fierce battle. Anand Kumar Pahal, executive director at BRO’s regional office in Srinagar accompanied Pathak, who stressed on speeding up the project work before October 15 in view of heavy snowfall in the area. ATAL TUNNEL AWAITS INAUGURATION Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to dedicate the 9.2-km Atal Tunnel that connects Manali with Leh, the world’s longest high-altitude tunnel above 10,000 feet, to the nation by this mont-end. Work on the tunnel has been completed in 10 years, whereas the original estimated time was less than six years. The ₹32,000-crore tunnel will shorten the 474-km distance between Manali and Leh by 46km, which means the eight-hour journey will be cut by two-and-a-half hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-rohtang-focus-shifts-to-shinku-la-tunnel-between-ladakh-and-lahaul/story-v5HGeLhQ7FN5NoITch1nEI.html

Jagmohan Singh, a member of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said that the representatives who met at Moga agreed to extend support to the farmers’ agitation in neighbouring Haryana on September 20. “Tomorrow, Punjab farmer association members will burn copies of farm bills in the state as a mark of protest,” he said. On the Punjab bandh call given by Left-leaning farmer associations, he said besides shops and commercial establishments, railway and highway blockades would be part of the statewide protest from Friday morning till 4pm. Harinder Singh of Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) said that the farmer leaders have decided to come on a single platform to oppose the passage of the bills and have resolved not to engage any political party in the agitation. He said the further course of action would be decided next week after bringing non-political fronts together in the interest of the agrarian community. “The meeting was organised to coordinate with other farmer organisations and forge a common platform to oppose the bills,” Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal) BS Rajewal said earlier. The representatives met at Nachattar Singh Hall in Moga on Saturday afternoon. Harinder Singh said representatives of 13 farmer organisations had met at a gurdwara in Alamgir village near Ludhiana on Friday to discuss the course of action after the controversial legislation, including the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, were passed on Thursday. On Tuesday, the Lower House of Parliament passed a third legislation, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. “During the meeting on Friday, a five-member coordination committee was formed.

19-09-2020||Pune||Sinhgad road, Karvenagar and Dhankawadi areas in Pune report spike in Covid cases in past seven days||According to data released by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the past two weeks, the wards of Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road have shown a drastic improvement in terms of Covid-19 positive cases and on the other hand Sinhgad road, Vadgaonsheri, Dhankawadi, Sahakarnagar and Karvenagar have reported a spike in the last seven days. In terms of the number of positive cases reported, Sinhgad road has reported a 15.2 per cent spike, Ahmednagar road-Vadgaonsheri reported 16.6 per cent growth, Warje-Karvenagar reported a 15.8 per cent rise and Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar reported 15.6 per cent growth. According to experts, it would be too early to speak about herd immunity or the flattening curve in the population living in Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road areas without knowing the number of tests being done. In the past two weeks starting from September 2nd to September 8th and September 9th to September 15th, these two wards have shown the slowest growth percentage as compared to other wards. In the week from September 8th to September 15th alone, the Dhole Patil road reported 6.5 per cent while Bhavani peth reported 11.7 per cent. Both the wards, Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road wards which are also one of the most congested wards were the hotspot in the city with most cases being reported from there. The samples for the first serosurvey conducted in the city by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC); Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) to determine the spread of the virus by detecting the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were collected from these areas. The survey had shown a higher percentage of antibodies in the samples indicating that the prevalence of the virus is higher in these places. The presence of antibodies hints that the immune system is capable of fighting the virus. Once a higher number of people in a given area develop antibodies against the virus, it could be called herd immunity. However, the experts who conducted the sero survey cleared that it needs to be studied further to understand if these places had developed the neutralizing antibodies capable enough to fight this virus. Aurnab Ghose, who was the principal investigator in the study said, “ We have also got the data that these areas are not reporting the least number of cases as compared to other areas. However, we need to see if the number of tests are the same as other areas. The infection does not consider administrative boundaries. If there are enough tests being conducted in these areas too, and the number of cases is still receding then we could talk about herd immunity or flattened curve. Also, it has to be noted that this dip in the numbers could be temporary too as it would be too early to say that the curve has flattened.” Initially, the PMC had taken excess efforts to ensure that the containment zone norms are implemented properly and also washing public toilets repeatedly. Assistant municipal commissioner Bankar Somnath Haribhau who was earlier the ward officer at Bhavani peth and is now the ward officer of Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward said, “When I was the ward officer at Bhavani peth, we provided masks and sanitizers to every household and ensured cleaning of all public toilets at least three times a day. Toilets were the super spreaders and so we had to control them. We also tested more people and isolated them as soon as possible. We will now be trying the same strategy in Hadapsar too which is also throwing a greater number of cases now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sinhgad-road-karvenagar-and-dhankawadi-areas-in-pune-report-spike-in-covid-cases-in-past-seven-days/story-6s5pFcLQO62DEZe8wD9q6J.html

The committee submitted its report on time...on the recommendations of the committee, the package [has been announced]...” said Sinha. “This is a beginning and more things are in the offing.”Also read: J-K govt forms committees for panchayat, block development council bypollsSinha’s announcement comes as businesses in the region are reeling under massive losses since August 2019 when a lockdown and communications blackout were imposed to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and to split it into two Union territories. Mobile internet services continue to remain restricted in the region even as other restrictions have eased. Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed this summer to check its spread turned out to be a double whammy for the businesses. Restrictions on mobile internet have hurt e-commerce that has gained elsewhere in the world during the pandemic. Sinha said the package is apart from the Rs 1,400 crore announced for Jammu & Kashmir under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign). He said a separate package will be announced for transporters, taxi-drivers, autorickshaw drivers, houseboat and shikara owners who have faced problems. He added there will be stamp duty exemption till March 2021 for all borrowers. “From October 1, Jammu & Kashmir Bank will set up special desks for young people.”Sinha said the 50% rebate on electricity and water bills for a year is going to all sectors including common households, businessmen, industrial unit holders, farmers and others. “...for this, the government will be spending 105 crores. This has been done for all,” Sinha said. He added the Centre is also working on a new industrial policy for Jammu & Kashmir.Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq said Sinha has kept his promise and announced the package and that the business community appreciates the gesture. “We are going through the components of the package.

19-09-2020||Lucknow||LESA’s ‘Good Morning Team’ to check power theft in Lucknow||The Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA) has formed a ‘Good Morning Team’ as part of a campaign to check power theft and act against those involved in the practice to run heavy appliances at night in Lucknow.“The campaign is aimed at exposing consumers who pilfer power,” said LESA executive engineer Gyan Prakash. He added they were getting regular complaints of heavy line losses in areas like Zehra colony, Sonaron Wali Gali, Nanak Nagar, etc. “Here, line losses were touching 60%. Our staff was baffled when they were unable to find any power theft during the day time.” Prakash added that is why they roped in informers, and through them, got to know about residents stealing power at night.Also read: ‘Vasooli Bhabhi’: Meet Madhya Pradesh’s women recovery agents for outstanding power bills“During the last 10 days, we have conducted six raids in morning hours and surveyed 225 houses. LESA has lodged cases against 75 residents who, despite stealing power, were not ready to pay bills.”LESA superintendent BN Sharma said they have fined 225 residents around Rs 40 lakh. He added they have constituted two teams to conduct morning raids in the areas reporting maximum line losses.LESA officials have got special permission from authorities to conduct early morning and night raids.Mani Ram, a junior engineer, said night patrolling has been started to check power theft. “Soon our night raids, with help of police, will also begin. Teams will record power theft on camera, and carry out raids with proof. We are keeping our morning raids short and quick because we do not want to give power thieves the time to collect mobs, which often come to their rescue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lesa-s-good-morning-team-to-check-power-theft-in-lucknow/story-w9iGCzq3ykWgM4sxeX5MxI.html

19-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad, Meerut farmers on dharna on Delhi-Meerut eway; stall construction work||Farmers’ indefinite dharna on Delhi-Meerut expressway entered its second day on Saturday. Farmers of 24 villages of Ghaziabad and Meerut have continued to protest over their compensation, forcing the construction company to stop further work. Land of farmers of 19 villages of Ghaziabad and five villages of Meerut district was acquired for the 4th phase of the expressway between Meerut and Dasna of Ghaziabad. The protesters have been demanding an equal compensation for all the farmers whose land was acquired for the expressway and service roads.Also read: Ghaziabad’s SC/ST hostel to stay; UP’s first detention centre to come up in another locationEarlier in the week, agitated farmers had taken out a three-day march from a Meerut-Ghaziabad boarder village which ended at the Ghaziabad district magistrate’s office on Thursday but the talks between officials and farmers eventually failed.Dr Babli Gurjar, convener of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said, “We are demanding equal compensation for farmers whose land was acquired for the expressway and service roads. The talks concluded without any outcome and officials demanded 10 days to resolve the issue.”“ We have given them 10 days but won’t allow them to continue work on the expressway until they come out with a solution,” said Gurjar. While Ghaziabad farmers have sat on dharna at village Moradabad, another group of Meerut farmers have begun their protest at Achraunda village where construction of a toll plaza on the expressway is proposed.Families of farmers have also joined them, cooking their meals on the expressway and singing bhajans at the protest site.“ We had been raising the issue for over a year. We took out marches, met divisional commissioner Anita C Meshram... but received only hollow assurances,” said Gurjar. Later in the day, sub divisional magistrate, tehseeldar and circle officer of Modinagar (Ghaziabad) held a meeting with protesting farmers at the venue. After assurances from additional district magistrate (land acquisition) on telephone, farmers allowed authorities to restart construction but decided to continue their dharna. They also warned they will stop the work again if their demands were not met in eight days. At Achraunda in Meerut, farmers have come together under the leadership of Mahmud Ali and SP leader Oawan Gurjar. “ We have divided the protest at two places to mount pressure on officials of Ghaziabad and Meerut,” said Ali, explaining that they are also seeking equal compensation and construction of service roads.Meanwhile, jawans of Rapid Action Force and police have been deployed and officials have tried to convince the farmers to end their protest.Mudit Garg, project manager of expressway in Ghaziabad region, refuted the charges of unequal compensation and said, “It was given as per rule.” He alleged that the farmers were mounting pressure now because the construction work was in its last lap and the agitators hoped the authorities would buckle under the pressure and approve additional compensation. The deadline for the expressway has already been extended many times. As of now, 34% of the 4th phase is yet to be completed by December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-meerut-farmers-on-dharna-on-delhi-meerut-eway-stall-construction-work/story-g7BECLoAC18aZDtYpE8DXM.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||‘There was a time when govt listened to its allies’: Sena questions Centre’s policies||The Shiv Sena on Saturday questioned the Modi government’s policies on economy, trade and agriculture, and alleged that it was moving towards privatisation of airports, Air India and railways and giving the control of farmers’ lives to traders and private players.The party also alleged that the Centre introduced Bills on agriculture “without consulting” its allies,farmers’ organisations or opposition parties, and said the resignation of Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has brought the issue to the fore.In an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) during the time of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior BJP leader L K Advani was “different” as they used to “treat the NDA constituents with respect and consult with them”.“Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member Harsimrat Kaur Badal has resigned from the Union Cabinet. The Modi government brought two anti-farmers bills (in Parliament) and she resigned in protest. Her resignation has been accepted. The Shiv Sena has already walked out of the NDA and now comes the SAD’s move,” it said.“During the time of Vajpayee and Advani, the NDA allies used to be treated with respect, affection and trust. There used to be consultations on policy decisions and BJP leaders would hear out the views of the allies. In those times, spoken word had value,” the Sena said.“Like Maharashtra, Punjab is an agrarian economy. Hence, before introducing the farmers’ Bills, the government should have held talks with the representatives of farmers’ organisations and agriculture expertsin Maharashtra, Punjab and the rest of the country,” it added.The Bills propose to create a system wherein traders can purchase farmers’ products even outside ‘mandis’. The Congress, DMK and Trinamool Congress opposed this proposal.They think it is anti-farmer, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.“The Centre is pushing for privatisation of airports, Air India, ports, railways, insurance companies, and also giving control of farmers’ lives to traders and private players. The Modi government’s policies regarding economy, trade, agriculture create doubts,” it alleged.“The government says that the new system would benefit farmers. Even if one believes it to be true, what was the harm in holding consultations with a few leading farmer leaders in the country? It should have at least held talks with NCP chief Sharad Pawar. But this government has nothing to do with the words ‘dialogue’ or ‘consultation’,” the Sena said.The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.Harsimrat Kaur Badal said her decision to resign from the Union Cabinet to protest the farm sector bills symbolises her “party’s vision, its glorious legacy and its commitment to go to any extent to safeguard the interests of farmers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/there-was-a-time-when-govt-listened-to-its-allies-sena-questions-centre-s-policies/story-Kmad37Naw5R7TyPep0DkhP.html

19-09-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh police adds sedition to case against AAP MP Sanjay Singh, summons him||The Uttar Pradesh police have summoned Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lawmaker Sanjay Singh to record his statement after adding charges including sedition to a First Information Report (FIR) registered on September 1 against him and directors of an agency hired for conducting a survey based on the state’s alleged casteism through pre-recorded voice calls.Singh, who is a Rajya Sabha member, reiterated his willingness to face the investigation and said he will visit Lucknow on Sunday to surrender. He added 63% of people surveyed called the government casteist and 29% did not. “In UP [Uttar Pradesh], cases of rape, murder, loot are increasing every day. Aren’t the people who do all these are anti-national or am I anti-national for raising people’s voice against these issues?”Also read: Why western UP farmers are silent on Centre’s new farm billsHe slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for the politically motivated case and added it has been filed against him for raising his voice to oppose alleged atrocities against Brahmins and Dalits.“Every section and community is unhappy with the Yogi [Adityanath] government. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]-led government under Shri Yogi Adityanath is torturing the people of Brahmin community. Atrocities are going on against the people from Maurya community, Nishad, Bind, Kashyap, Jaat, Gujjar, Valmiki, Kurmi, Yadav and other communities.”He added he has also raised the issue of the government’s “massive corruption” in buying Covid-19 kits. “I have shown how the Yogi government is buying Rs 800 Oximeter for Rs 5,000 and looting the people. Similarly, thermometer which is locally available for Rs 1,600 was purchased at Rs 13,000 and I pointed out how in the time of Corona the Yogi government was doing corruption.”He said businessman Indrakant Tripathi in Mahoba produced a voice recording exposing how the district magistrate (DM) and police superintendent (SP) were allegedly trying to extort Rs 5 lakh from him. “When the SP and DM found that Shri Tripathi was unable to pay then the SP himself met him and threatened him to kill if he does not pay the money. Shri Tripathi was so scared that he made a video a week before his death where he urged... Adityanath to give protection to him. Shri Tripathi requested the CM’s [chief minister]’s support and described how the SP and DM are threatening him. But no action was taken. Few days back, he died after suffering from a bullet injury in Uttar Pradesh for not paying extortion money.”Singh said he exposed the corruption of the government and unmasked it. “First they registered a case under IT [Information Technology] Act but when in Rajya Sabha, I raised the corruption issue, the Yogi government filed the sedition case yesterday [Friday] evening against me.”The FIR was initially registered in Lucknow against unidentified people under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 501-A that pertains to “printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory” in this case to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and under the Information Technology Act for “misuse of electronic communication”.Singh accepted his involvement in the survey through a tweet on September 2 and said he was willing to face investigation.Anjani Pandey, the inspector in-charge of Lucknow’s Hazratganj police station, charges of sedition under IPC section’s 124-A have been added during the course of investigation along with 153-A (promoting enmity between different castes), and 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration). He said the names of Singh and the private agency directors involved in the survey have been included in the FIR after their role surfaced during the investigation. He said Singh has been sent a notice to appear before the police to record his statement.BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava said those who have done nothing should not fear. “But those who want to divide the society on caste lines or whip up communal passions for gaining foothold need to fear the law which will take its own course against such people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-police-adds-sedition-to-case-against-aap-mp-sanjay-singh-summons-him/story-2sG1aRXbqF0zviceMnCAcK.html

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers refuse to allow Badal village protester’s last rites, demand relief, loan waiver||A day after a protester, Pritam Singh, 65, died after consuming pesticide at the native village of the Badals in Muktsar district, farm union leaders on Saturday said they would allow the last rites only after his family was compensated with Rs 3 lakh, a government job and loan waiver. Pritam Singh, a resident of Akanwali village in Mansa, consumed the pesticide during the protest outside the house of former chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal on Friday morning. He was rushed to a private hospital in Bathinda, where he died in the evening. The protesters were demanding the revocation of the three farm bills passed in the Lok Sabha earlier this week. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahana) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann demanded that a state government representative visit the protest site and announce the compensation to Pritam Singh’s family. “The body is in a mortuary in Bathinda and we will not let the post-mortem examination till the demands are met,” Mann said. The farmers decided to extend the round-the-clock dharna outside the residence of the Badals till September 25. The protest that started on Tuesday was to end on Sunday.‘BADALS SHOULD SNAP TIES WITH BJP’ With the number of protesters swelling at the site, Badal was shifted to his farmhouse at Balasar in Sirsa district of neighbouring Haryana. His son and SAD member of Parliament Sukhbir Singh Badal is in Delhi to attend the Lok Sabha proceedings along with his wife Harsimrat Kaur, who resigned from the Narendra Modi cabinet after the passage of the bills on Thursday. Union general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said, “Instead of shedding crocodile tears now, if the SAD terms itself a party of and for the farmers, it should snap ties with the BJP.” “Harsimrat’s resignation from the cabinet is a political drama. The SAD leadership has been exposed. She was forced to quit because of the anger among farmers. The Badal family has played with the sentiments of farmers. Being a part of the Modi government, Harsimrat had been saying that the bills are pro-farmer. She did not raise any objection,” Mann said. ALL EYES ON MOGA MEET Meanwhile, representatives of Left-leaning and farmer associations are meeting in Moga on Saturday to form a common platform to oppose the bills. Jagmohan Singh Patiala, the working committee member of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), said efforts are being made to bring 25 farm associations of Punjab under one umbrella for a long-drawn fight against the BJP-led Centre’s move. “We should sink political differences in farmers’ interests. After Harsimrat quit, all political and farmers’ fronts, except the BJP, have stood against the new agricultural rules. We hope for a positive outcome,” said Jagmohan, a Left ideologue. Farm rights activist Ajmer Singh Lakhowal said pro-farmer organisations had contacted him to form a common platform to fight for the agrarian community. “Our five-member committee will meet representatives of the Left-leaning farmer fronts in Moga. Delegates will discuss the next plan to pursue a joint agitation to oppose the three bills,” said Lakhowal, who decided to stay away from Saturday’s meeting due to his medical condition. Meanwhile, Covid-19 guidelines are not being followed at the protest site as farmer leaders and protesters can be seen without masks and ignoring social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-refuse-to-allow-badal-village-protester-s-last-rites-demand-relief-loan-waiver/story-i5Jj8IHuD2rY9D9OvuZUyJ.html

19-09-2020||Mumbai||Abetting suicide requires intention, says Bombay HC, grants bail to Pune resident||Reiterating that abetment of suicide requires intention and involvement on the part of the accused, the Bombay high court on Friday granted bail to a Pune resident booked for abetting suicide of an elderly woman.In order to sustain a conviction for the offence under section 306 of IPC, there has to be a clear mens rea -- active participation or direct act which leads the deceased, having left with no other option, to take the drastic step -- said justice Bharati Dangre while granting bail to Sachin Shinde.Also read: Delhi constable’s body found hanging at Malviya Nagar homeShinde was booked by Chikhali police in Pune district along with several others for harassing and driving Mangal, an elderly woman, to death by suicide.According to police, Shinde and several others were duped by Mangal’s son, Chandrashekar, who had lured them to part with substantial amounts of money promising to secure jobs for them. He, however, failed to fulfil the promise and also did not return the amounts.When the victims started demanding their money back, Chandrashekar absconded, forcing the unemployed people to accost his family members. They visited Chandrashekar’s house twice in January 2019 and threatened his mother in an attempt to recover their money.Eventually, on March 6, 2019, both Mangal and her sister, Alka Babar, consumed some poisonous substance and tried to end their lives. Alka survived, and on the basis of her complaint, police booked Shinde and others for abetting Mangal’s suicide.Shinde had moved high court for an anticipatory bail after his plea was turned down by the Pune sessions court on July 23, 2020.The high court, however, granted him pre-arrest bail after noticing that there was no proximity between the alleged incidents of harassment, which took place in January 2019 and the suicide in March 2019, and therefore “prima facie, the material on record cannot hold the applicant responsible for driving the deceased to take the extreme step.”Justice Dangre also noted the anguish of the cheated men. The judge said one can understand how difficult it is for a person to arrange a sum with a ray of frail hope that their kith and kin or they themselves would get jobs, but in this case, neither employment came nor the money was returned by Chandrashekhar. “He pushed them against the dead wall and therefore they sought their money back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/abetting-suicide-requires-intention-says-bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-pune-resident/story-0lTheI7oasouhtxLueHuWO.html

The trio had come from Pulwama via Mughal road and had picked up the consignment before security forces swooped on it. It was the fourth such attempt by Pakistan since June to push arms and ammunition into J&K with the help of drones. The first such attempt was made at Rathua of Hiranagar sector in Kathua district on June 20. Also read: Police bust militant hideout in J&K’s Awantipora, recover huge cache of arms, explosivesThe Lashkar terrorists have been identified as Rahil Bashir alias Ayaan Bhai, 20, of Tickan in Pulwama, Amir Jaan alias Hamza, 25, of Kakapora in Pulwama and Hafiz Younus Wani alias Zubair,19 of Shopian. Recoveries include two AK-56 assault rifles, six AK magazines with 180 rounds, two Chinese pistols, three pistol magazines with 30 rounds, four grenades and Rs 1 lakh in cash. An FIR has been registered against the trio under the IPC, Indian Arms Act and UAPA. Addressing media persons in Rajouri, DGP Dilbag Singh said, “Pakistan has been continuing with its attempts to send weapons and narcotics by drones. Infiltration attempts and ceasefire violations in Rajouri and Poonch are also on but police and army besides other security forces are working in unison and remain active. This time, police and 38 RR did a commendable job on Friday. They caught a group which had come from Kashmir to this area to pick a consignment of arms and ammunition.” “The team found three men with bags in the area. The moment they saw the team, they lobbed a grenade which didn’t explode.. .They were overpowered. Arms and ammunition besides and rupees one lakh cash that was sent by Pakistan to fuel and sponsor terror activities were found from the bags,” said the DGP. “The three terrorists belonged to LeT and weapons were sent across by a drone from Pakistan,” he added. DGP further said that Pakistan was trying to revive terrorism in Rajouri and Poonch districts. He admitted that detecting weapon dropping via drones in hilly areas was a bit challenging.On the alleged fake encounter of three Gujjar men in Amshipora on July 18, he said police and army have launched parallel probes into it. “We are also working on it and we had taken DNA samples. Army has clarified in cleat terms that action will be taken,” he added. On Friday, army had said, “An inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the Do’s and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-suspected-militants-held-in-j-k-s-rajouri/story-GIEXQAZXOD82mGaLc5j6JJ.html
19-09-2020||Lucknow||Covid patients in UP’s capital wait 2-4 hrs in ambulance before admission||A long wait for an ambulance can be agonising for a patient, but it is even worse when an ambulance carrying a Covid-19 patient has to wait outside a hospital for up to 2 to 4 hours before the patient is admitted. A large number of patients in Lucknow have faced this situation at the time of admission of a Covid patient. The aim is to pick up Covid positive patients in ambulances, as soon as possible, to contain the spread of infection, but the lack of provision for their quick hospitalisation is creating problems. But hospitals say they have now introduced measures to tackle the issue. Sample this: On September 9, an ambulance transported a Covid patient from a private hospital in Gomti Nagar to a Covid facility in Chowk in about half an hour. But the journey was not over yet for Pradip, who had to spend the next two and a half hours just waiting outside the corona ward at the KGMU campus as the driver had instructions not to leave the patient outside the ward. In a nutshell, the time (over two hours), which could have been utilised to transport another patient, was lost. In another case, a 55-year-old woman in Alamnagar waited at the hospital gate for four hours. The authorities are now recognising this to be an issue that needs addressing.“The waiting time could be up to a few minutes to check a patient’s documents, verify patient-identity but not beyond that as information about the patient is given to the hospital in advance,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, IMA, Lucknow. The KGMU has now come up with a solution. “We have made a ‘May I Help You’ desk to address issues such as delay in admission. The staff at the desk facilitates correct and speedy admission,” said Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson, KGMU.

To tackle this situation, we have created one bed holding area with oxygen. If serious patients come without referral, we can keep them here and inform the Covid control room.” She added, “Limited staff at the hospital is another reason. Sometimes the staff is on a round when a patient arrives. In such a situation, the staff is informed and they reach out to the ambulance. But if the same staff is engaged in some procedure with a serious patient, it may take some time.” In all, 57 ambulances are on Covid duty in Lucknow. These include 48 from 108 fleet and nine advanced life support vehicles. Patients also keep ambulances waitingAmbulances are being held up not only at hospitals but also while picking up patients. In a recent incident, an ambulance had to wait for an hour at Mohalla Koriyana in Alambagh on September 12 since the Covid-19 patient was busy finishing his household and business work before he was taken to a hospital. The ambulance driver couldn’t do anything, but wait.

She had earlier agreed to hospitalization when officials of the Covid command centre spoke to her on phone an hour before. The ambulance driver had to wait for one hour outside her house before she finally made up her mind to go to the Covid facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-patients-in-up-s-capital-wait-2-4-hrs-in-ambulance-before-admission/story-kjqp9YTJmjjFL0BBVb6FlI.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: 26 former DGPs respond to Ribeiro’s letter, show support for police||After ten former IPS officers, including ex-Mumbai Police commissioner Julio Ribeiro, questioned Delhi Police’s probe into Delhi riots cases,and accused them of implicating anti-CAA protesters while being lenient to others associated with the ruling party, another group of ex-IPS officers has come out in support of the city police. In a statement issued on Friday, 26 retired IPS officers said that they were “surprised at the conduct” of a few fellow ex-police personnel who support such kind of “anti-India expression and communal narrative’. They referred to some controversial slogans allegedly raised by former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and other serious charges. Khalid’s arrest last Sunday in the riots case has been criticised by many social activists, who have accused Delhi Police of targeting anti-government voices. The 26 former police officers said, “The Delhi Police has every right and duty to investigate the role of any such persons, and custodial investigation is a part of due process of law. The accused has his rights under the law to seek anticipatory bail or regular bail, as the cause may be, and the right to a fair trial where he can prove himself innocent Former Delhi Police commissioner RS Gupta, former UP DGPs RN Singh and Bhanu Pratap Singh, ex-DGPs of Bihar SK Bhardwaj and Ramesh Chandra Sinha, former Maharashtra DGP Praveen Dixit, ex-DGP of Tripura BL Vohra and former Kerala DGP S Gopinath are among the 26 ex-IPS officers who have signed the statement. “A section of former police officers cannot usurp for themselves the office of Presiding Officers of the Courts to declare anyone innocent and try to put the police force in bad light. These officers have no right to suspect or question the integrity and professionalism of their successors in the Indian Police Service, and in turn demoralise them,” they said in the statement. They said that such “posturing and adverse commentary” may demotivate police officers and dilute their firm resolve to act against criminals, including those who incite communal divide in India by instigating riots. “We disapprove any statements or gestures by any motivated group of former police officers, which is aimed at defaming the police force and its serving officers, who are performing their duty day and night at great personal risk for the safety of general public,” they added. Last week, noted former IPS officer Ribeiro wrote a letter to Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava, requesting him to look into the North-East Delhi riots probe and make sure it was impartial. Riberio told the Delhi Police chief that police have failed to act against those who made hate speeches that led to the riots. Two days later, nine retired IPS officers, including AS Dulat, former OSD on Kashmir, Prime Minister’s office; K Saleem Ali, former CBI special director; Amitabh Mathur, former special secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat and PGJ Nampoothiri, former director general of Gujarat Police, wrote an open letter to Shrivastava, saying they were pained at the police implicating those who spoke and joined protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) but letting off the hook those who instigated violence and are associated with the ruling party. On Tuesday, Shrivastava responded to questions raised over the riots probe by Riberio and wrote to him, saying the investigation was being carried out without any discrimination on caste or religion, and was backed by documentary and scientific evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-26-former-dgps-write-respond-to-ribeiro-s-letter-show-support-for-delhi-police/story-i8ly2oUs68wdcP0sa1ZlSP.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Declare non-protected mangrove areas reserved forests, says Aaditya||Maharashtra’s environment minister, Aaditya Thackeray, has directed collectors of districts along the Konkan coast to identify and transfer mangrove areas under their jurisdiction within two months to the state forest department for their declaration as reserved forests.“Some mangrove land is currently not officially declared as reserved. It is anyway not developable and neither must it have human interference. Hence, we met today [Friday] to decide on the further course of action to officially tag them as reserved forests, and accord the necessary protection under the Indian Forest Act,” said Thackeray after a meeting with revenue, forest, environment departments officials. Mangrove forests are spread over 30,200-hectare land across Maharashtra, according to the Forest Survey of India. The Maharashtra government has notified 15,312 hectares of the land as reserved forest under the Indian Forest Act. The remaining is private land. Of the 15,312-hectare, 1,592.8 hectares is yet to be transferred from the revenue to the forest department for better protection as per the Bombay high court’s September 2018 directive.Principal secretary (forests) Milind Mhaiskar called the move important and timely decision considering the impact of increasing frequency of cyclones, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and associated storm surge for coastal zones. “Mangroves act as the first line of defense against this while acting as a breeding ground for large marine biodiversity. “ He added the reserved forest status for mangroves around Mumbai’s Mahim Nature Park could prevent annual flooding during the monsoon.According to a 2017 National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite study of Mumbai’s mangroves, the deposition of sediments narrowed creek channels and allowed mangroves to spread along its edges and expanded green cover overtime. “This is the foreshore land which is increasing and our intention is to protect these areas, especially in Mumbai suburbs and Thane even if they have sparse mangrove trees. These areas need to be mapped jointly by the forest and revenue department and protected after final notification,” said Konkan commissioner Annasaheb Misal.Misal said all inquiries, land identification, handing over, and final notification needs to be completed within two months. “Overall protection of these zones will be enhanced when their control would be completely with the forest department. Additionally, the district collectors have been told to undertake a ground survey to calculate the areas falling under the jurisdiction of various state agencies and ensure such lands are handed over to the forest department within two months as well.”Misal has proposed a declaration of newly-developed mangrove and mudflat patches due to excess sedimentation (foreshore areas) along creeks and estuaries as reserved forests.In September 2018, the Bombay high court said the destruction of mangroves “offended the fundamental rights of the citizens and hence it was a mandatory duty of the state and its agencies to protect and preserve” them. All mangroves in the state are to be declared as protected or reserved forests, including land belonging to government agencies, it added.The Mangrove Cell estimates that approximately 2,000-hectare mangrove areas fall under the control of agencies like the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority. “This needs to be handed over and notified as reserved forest,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/declare-non-protected-mangrove-areas-reserved-forests-says-aaditya/story-umnQHxDtD2d5c4FEOPbSrL.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Dombivli murder case: Five arrested||A 25-year-old man was beaten to death and another person suffered serious injuries after a fight between two groups over an old feud in Dombivli near Mumbai on Friday, investigators said. The investigators added Mahesh Gunjal, 22, Nikhil Mane, 23, Jayesh Juwale, 22, Ashish Walmiki, 22, and Shrinivas Sugala, 23, have been arrested for allegedly killing Shivaji Khandagle, 25.

Around 2 am on Friday, when they were drunk, Lashakre told Dhotre that Gunjal had five months back abused him. Dhotre immediately called Gunjal and abused him.“Lashkare, Dhotre and Khandgale then went to Gujal’s place to teach him lesson. All the five accused who carried a hockey stick, iron rod, sword with them, beat up the trio badly. The accused hit Khandagle with the iron rod. He fell unconscious and later died before reaching hospital,” said an investigator.Senior police inspector Suresh Aher said the accused were arrested on Friday night and were due to produce them before a court on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dombivli-murder-case-five-arrested/story-CiUCr1sbsfSuVmq5x2hV3O.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi to experience very light rain today; mercury to remain high||Delhi is likely to have very light rain or drizzle on Saturday, which may bring slight relief from the hot and humid weather being experienced by the city. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast partly cloudy sky and possibility of ‘very light’ rain/drizzle. Good winds are likely to prevail across Delhi over the next two to three days. However, the maximum (day) and minimum (night) temperatures are likely to remain high because of high moisture levels. On Friday, the day temperature was 38 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal while night temperature settled at 27.8 degrees C, also three notches above the season’s average. Also read: Monsoon withdrawal delayed by one week. says IMD“A drizzle may only increase the humidity levels. Delhi may get some reprieve because of strong surface winds over the next few days and a possibility of rain or thundershowers on September 23-24,” said a senior IMD scientist. With the good winds, the air quality is also likely to improve slightly over the next few days, however, the improvement may be short-lived, the scientist added. After a month of of relatively clean air with August seeing four ‘good’ (when air quality index or AQI reads 0-50) air days and remaining 27 days in the ‘satisfactory’ (when AQI is between 50 and 100) zone, the air quality slipped to ‘moderate’ category (when AQI reads 101-200) on September 5 with an AQI reading of 101. It improved to ‘satisfactory’ for a few days and again fell to ‘moderate’ on September 9. Since then, Delhi’s AQI has remained in the ‘moderate’ category. On Saturday at 6 am, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) the AQI was 106 in the ‘moderate’category. Over the past two days, with average wind speed remaining around 10-12 kmph, the AQI readings improved slightly though remaining on the lower end of ‘moderate’ category. As per CPCB data, on Friday the average AQI was 108 while on Thursday it was 120. During September 9-16, the AQI was recorded on the higher end of the ‘moderate’ category. “Such changes in meteorological conditions, like monsoon almost drawing to a close after which mostly calm winds are observed, are not favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Unlike last month, when the city saw clear blue and rain-washed skies on most days, monsoon withdrawal and slowing down of winds may lead to deterioration in air quality,” the scientist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-experience-very-light-rain-today-mercury-to-remain-high/story-GASaBksAyPmQfNo7kXnxDL.html
19-09-2020||Bhopal||Father in custody battle ordered to meet son through video conferencing due to Covid 19||The Madhya Pradesh high court has directed a man to use his visitation rights through a virtual meeting as a physical meeting may not be in the interest of the child and her mother during Covid pandemic, as per the court’s order. The order was passed by the high court’s principal bench at Jabalpur on September 7, 2020, while hearing an application filed by the father seeking an interim custody of his 9-year-old son, subject to the high court’s judgement on a petition filed by mother of the child to challenge a family court’s judgement delivered on August 31, 2019, whereby her husband got a divorce from her. The boy is presently in the custody of his mother residing in Alwar in Rajasthan while the father is posted in Raipur in Chhattisgarh, as per counsels of the parents.Mother of the child in her reply, as per the HC order, said she complied with the court order and brought the child from Alwar to Bhopal on every first and third Friday of the month. During the lockdown and the extended lockdown periods, she ensured regular conversations between the child and the father through video calls, normal phone calls and WhatsApp. She denied the allegation that she didn’t allow the child to speak to his father on some pretext or the other. She said she was a doctor by profession and “during the ongoing pandemic, it was suitable for the child to continue to stay with her until travel within the country resumed normally as Alwar to Raipur (Chhattisgarh) is not only an inter-state travel but is also very far, which could be risky for the child’.

Accordingly, it is directed that the respondent-applicant i.e. the father shall be entitled to have video conferencing with the child every fortnight for half-an-hour in an amicable environment and said this arrangement shall continue for the months of September and October, 2020.” Welcoming the order, Ruchika Gohil, the counsel for the mother, said, “I have not heard so far that any court anywhere else allowed visitation rights to a parent through video conferencing due to the Covid situation.” Ajatshatru Meena, counsel for the father of the child said, “We are not satisfied with the order and will challenge it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/father-in-custody-battle-ordered-to-meet-son-through-video-conferencing-due-to-covid-19/story-4lcgBL1heiK3KrisCjne4I.html

Meanwhile, nodal officer Bhupinder Kumar said the Centre’s team of experts will reach Jammu on Saturday.Following spike in Covid cases and deaths in Jammu, Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh had flagged the issue with the health ministry and had also spoken to L-G. He had said a team of experts will be sent immediately to Jammu to check the surge of Covid 19 infection.Patient care has been severely hit at GMCH Jammu, which has become a battlefield for senior doctors and incumbent principal Dr Nasib Chand Digra. Fed up with the ‘indiscipline and chaos’, Dr Digra had recently written to L-G Manoj Sinha opting for the voluntary retirement scheme.“Is this is how financial commissioner health Atal Dulloo has prepared for the Covid pandemic. It has almost been seven months but the hospitals remain underprepared,” he said. On Thursday, a video showing paramedics escaping from windows of GMCH’s isolation ward also went viral on social media sites. “The patients in the isolation ward were left at God’s mercy,” alleged one of the attendants, who shot the video on his cell phone.“There is none to provide treatment to Covid patients. All staff has fled the hospital and patients are at God’s mercy,” he said. A doctor at GMCH said the sorry state of affairs at the hospital could be gauged from the fact that the director health services,a former principal and influential people don’t rely on government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-infected-jammu-health-director-admitted-to-private-hospital/story-CUtYilZ3KUq4NyiBwMTjDO.html

The three young men hailed from Rajouri district. The family has also demanded that the ‘source’ who branded the three young men as terrorists to the army for ‘rewards and awards’ be exposed. The three men had been missing since July 17. Lal Hussain, uncle of Imtiyaz Ahmad, Abrar Ahmad and Ibrar Mohammad, said “ We have lost three young men. I demand that those involved in the fake encounter and the contact who branded my nephews as terrorists and passed on the information security forces be punished under the law of the land.” The three young men aged 21, 26 and 18 years had left Rajouri and reached Shopian via Mughal Road on July 2 and July 17 to work as labourers and had gone missing thereafter. On July 18, the army claimed it had killed three unidentified terrorists in Amshipora of Shopian. On August 14, a police team from Shopian collected DNA samples of three families in Rajouri to match them with those of three young men. Lal Hussain has been claiming that his nephews were innocent Gujjar boys, who had gone to Shopian to work as labourers and that they had nothing to do with terrorism. The army on Friday said, “The inquiry ordered by the army authorities into operation Amshipora has concluded. The inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the do’s and don’ts of the chief of army Ssaff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has been directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable”. “The evidence collected by the inquiry has prima-facie indicated that the three unidentified terrorists killed in Op Amshipora were Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammad Ibrar, who hailed from Rajouri. Their DNA report is awaited. Their involvement with terrorism or related activities is under investigation by the police”, it added. “Indian Army is committed to ethical conduct of operations. Further updates on the case will be given periodically without affecting due process of the law of the land,” read the army statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amshipora-encounter-have-lost-3-nephews-want-guilty-to-be-punished-says-victims-uncle/story-iEfjxsqV60bx2qF7B9Z7LL.html
19-09-2020||Bhopal||Skeletons in MP hospital morgue: Ward boys suspended, action recommended against cops||Four ward boys of Indore’s Maharaja Yeshwantrao (MY) hospital were placed under suspension on Friday night and action was recommended against at least two police personnel based on an inquiry into the recovery of two skeletons from the hospital morgue in a span of three days, as per commissioner (revenue), Indore division. Also, a show cause notice was issued to the hospital superintendent and another doctor in regard with the incident, according to the commissioner Pawan Sharma. MY hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in Madhya Pradesh, happens to be a teaching hospital of MGM medical college, Indore. The three-member inquiry committee headed by additional commissioner (revenue), Indore, Rajni Singh, completed the inquiry after inspecting the morgue and submitted its report to the commissioner, who had ordered the probe after the first skeleton was found on Tuesday. The first skeleton found was of an unidentified man, whose body was allegedly left on a stretcher, unattended, in the morgue for about 10 days. The second skeleton of a three-month old baby was found in a box in the same morgue on Thursday, during the inspection by the inquiry committee, as per officials.

At the same time, lack of coordination between the police and hospital administration has also come to light. Hence, we are going to address all the issues immediately and simultaneously.” The hospital superintendent Dr PS Thakur could not be reached for his comments on the latest developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/skeletons-in-mp-hospital-morgue-ward-boys-suspended-action-recommended-against-cops/story-WQK2MPrII9dRZrHfgnTFxI.html

19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Pangs in the park||Can you hear? Here comes one of these songs again. The ones about love and heartbreak. The singer’s voice is tinged with ache and is getting shriller with the heightened passions of the lyrics.Isn’t he the famous Arjit Singh, the Hindi film playback singer?He’s not, but every evening in Lodhi Garden, a band of young men is heard singing romantic Hindi film numbers, especially of the Arjit Singh repertoire. They gather inside the Sheesh Gumbad tomb, where the songs echo off the stone walls of the centuries-old monument, and waft over the surrounding greens like ripples in water. The strings of guitars and the mood of songs might annoy a Lodhi Garden conservative trying to focus on flowers and birds. But for others among us, less rigid and more manipulatable, these love songs can enter like a pang in the heart.The twilight moments are quite touching, because the sun sets exactly behind the monument. So, as the evening sky is streamed with translucent gold, and the bats are flying overhead, and everything is turning slightly darker, a ditty on heart’s betrayals can affect even those walking around with their faithful lovers.This evening, however, the band is sitting outside the tomb, on the grassy slope. It turns out that they are long-time friends, who come from different parts of the city and have been hanging out here for years. Rahul and Salman come from Paharganj, Feroze and Zaid come from Nizamuddin Basti, Aggy comes from South Extension and Honey comes from Madangir. Some of them have jobs, others are enrolled in colleges. “We head here daily and play songs because it gives us sukoon (calmness),” says Rahul. The others say that passers-by often compliment them for their singing. “We can sing all kinds of tunes, but the garden is so romantic that we usually stick to romantic songs — and not only by Arijit Singh.”And now they start again. This time it is... but the song doesn’t matter as much as the atmosphere. The garden’s gathering darkness, people quietly exercising on the grass, folks perched on benches, the sombre monuments and the air filled with haunting love-lorn melodies.The men usually play from 5pm to 8pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-pangs-in-the-park/story-9iAuIdddKrVk0YZz7nujKO.html

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Migrant woman held for murdering son in Himachal’s Nalagarh town||Fearing that her nine-year-old son would disclose her extra-marital affair to her husband, a migrant woman strangled the boy to death with her lover’s help at Nalagarh in Solan district, police said on Saturday. The woman, identified as Kamlesh, and her partner, Ashok, were arrested for the murder that was executed on September 14 when the boy saw the two together. Police said the woman panicked that her son would tell his father about her affair so they both strangled the boy, killing him on the spot. They disposed the body in a nearby field. Unable to find his son, the boy’s father, Aasra Ram, lodged a complaint with the police. On being questioned, Kamlesh said that the boy had gone to his aunt’s house but had not returned. On September 16, the police found the body of the boy in the field after which they questioned the aunt, who said that he had not visited her. The police checked the CCTV footage of a hospital near the boy’s house and found that after Kamlesh and Ashok arrived, the boy had also entered the house but did not come out. The accused were interrogated again and they admitted to committing the crime. They were arrested on Friday evening. Baddi superintendent of police Rohit Malpani said a case was registered under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-woman-held-for-murdering-son-in-himachal-s-nalagarh-town/story-hUgMx6ZpOhGlg2tDUkalwL.html
19-09-2020||Chandigarh||BDPO shifted for claiming farmers’ protest proposed by Punjab govt||A block development and panchayat officer (BPDO) was shifted on Saturday for issuing a letter claiming that a farmers’ protest would be organised by the Punjab government over the issue of farm ordinances on September 21. “Taking serious cognisance of the matter, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh ordered the shifting of the Sardulgarh BDPO to the headquarters, and immediate withdrawal of the letter issued by him regarding farm protests that he incorrectly claimed to have been organised by the Punjab government,” a government statement said here. The directions came a day after Shiromani Akali Dal leader Daljit Singh Cheema had uploaded the BDPO letter on his Twitter handle, accusing the ruling Congress of “outsourcing its programmes” to the panchayati raj department. The Punjab government has not organised any such protest, as claimed by the BDPO, according to the statement issued on Saturday. Far from organising any protests, the government has been appealing to political organisations to refrain from organising public gatherings in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, it said. The overzealous BDPO had, on his own, announced a protest dharna on September 21 and had issued a letter asking all panchayat secretaries under his block to intimate sarpanches about the same, the statement said. He had also wrongly claimed that ministers and MLAs would join these protests, it said. The Punjab government had neither planned such protests against the farm ordinances nor asked the BDPO to issue the letter in question, the statement said. The chief minister has asked officials concerned to inquire into the incident and pin the responsibility for this incorrect communication, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bdpo-shifted-for-claiming-farmers-protest-proposed-by-punjab-govt/story-n9ND4jSeXKRqli9EpdiRVN.html

The accused had allegedly been harassing his wife from the past four to five months for money to buy liquor and would also assault her, said the police. The woman took the extreme step on the night of September 13, after which her father registered a complaint with the police. In his statement, the woman’s father said that his daughter and the accused studied in the same college and fell in love with each other and got married two years ago. “My daughter used to work for a financial firm and my son-in-law is unemployed. He used to consume liquor regularly owing to which they both used to have frequent quarrels. My house is in the same area and I used to go to their home and mediate between them,” the father said to the police. “My daughter used to tell me that her husband had started beating her to get money to buy liquor. We tried to explain things to him about the ill-effects of consuming liquor and also said that it would affect their family life. My daughter went into depression because of his drinking habit and on September 13 we learnt that she ended her life,” said the father in his statement. “We arrested the accused after the father registered a complaint with us,” said an officer from Tilak Nagar police station. The accused has been booked under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-year-old-arrested-for-abetting-wife-s-suicide-in-mumbai/story-9o76Yd76HEdwRKxW8ijo3I.html

Panipat DSP (headquarters) Satish Kumar Vats said Akhlaq, who hails from UP, had reached Panpiat and joined the investigation. “His blood samples have been taken for DNA examination. The samples will be matched with the chopped hand recovered from the railway track.”Vats, who is leading the special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the matter, said DNA reports will be crucial in the case as Akhlaq has accused some people of Kishanpura locality of beating him up and chopping off his hand when a sawing machine when he knocked on their door to ask for drinking water on the intervening night of August 23 and 24. Police say there is a possibility that his hand was chopped off by a train as the government railway police spotted him on the railway track the next morning. Akhlaq says he was dumped on the railway track by his assailants. A man from the same locality had also accused Akhlaq of sodomising his 11-year-old son on the same day. He has been booked for kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code and under sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.On being asked why Akhlaq had not been arrested, the DSP said it was because he was still under treatment and had also come to Panipat in an ambulance. “He will be called in as and when required,” he said.

19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Rights of allottees not subservient to banks: HARERA||In an order aimed at safeguarding the interests of home buyers, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA), Gurugram, has ordered that financial institutions, lending banks and creditors will have to take prior approvals from the Authority before initiating auction of a real estate project and while transferring the auctioned property to a new buyer. Chairman of the Authority, KK Khandelwal, in an order, said that the rights of allottees were not subservient to banks. Therefore, if the banks fail to ensure that the funds are used for the purpose they are granted for, then the banks cannot be allowed to supersede the rights of the allottees. He said that if it is found that any lending financial institution is engaged in auctioning real estate projects without the approval of the Authority, penal proceedings shall be initiated against the debtor promoter and the lending institutions. Such actions shall be demanded solely to protect the money invested by the allottees, who are not as powerful and resourceful as the builders and financial lender counterparts, he said. Khandelwal said promoters often mortgaged their project land, structure as well as all receivables from the sold and unsold inventory to lending institutions and banks to get loans for funding the construction costs of projects. But when these promoters fail to repay the loans, the financial institutions directly auction residential or commercial properties that have been pledged with them to recover loans from borrowers by invoking the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 “Such auctions invoke great anguish and distress to the allottees of the project as there is no acknowledgement of the huge investments made by the allottees into buying their dream home. The future of such allottees is in complete darkness and obscurity. Such aggrieved allottees are bound to languish for their own hard-earned money,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rights-of-allottees-not-subservient-to-banks-harera/story-lqCE5PHec3w1RWSReQyL3L.html
19-09-2020||Chandigarh||HC seeks action-taken report on panchayat land encroachers in Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought an affidavit from the Haryana chief secretary on the action taken against the encroachers of panchayat lands in Haryana.The order was passed by the high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice HS Sidhu on a plea from Dharambir Sharma, a Panipat resident, who had alleged before the court that on June 7, 2019, the Haryana Lokayukta had passed directions for removal of illegal encroachment on panchayat land but the state failed to implement the order.He had demanded that as per the Lokyayuka order, legal action should be initiated against the private persons who had illegally encroached upon 170 acres of gram panchayat land in Panipat. The land, as per the plea, was illegally transferred in the names of private persons in collusion with the then sarpanches and village panchayat secretaries in 1960s. It was further demanded that the state be directed to implement the Lokayukta order in which it was directed that illegal encroachment over the gram panchayat lands across the state be removed and criminal proceedings be initiated against government officials and private persons who had acted hand and in glove for encroachment. The court took serious view of the matter observing that authorities were expected to take prompt action on the recommendations made by the Lokayukta but the same have not been implemented so far. “It is a serious lapse on the part of the competent authorities/state authorities,” the bench observed seeking personal affidavit from the chief secretary detailing the consequential steps taken by state after the June 7, 2019 order and told the official to apprise the court by September 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-seeks-action-taken-report-on-panchayat-land-encroachers-in-haryana/story-hiJdRsW8SuT63h7iFczVaI.html
19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest running out of steam but pressure on JJP to take acid test||The farmers’ unrest in Haryana over the enactment of three controversial farm legislations by the Parliament seems to be running out of steam. But politics is now taking the centre stage. With Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MP, Harsimrat Kaur Badal quitting the Union Cabinet in protest against the “anti-farmer” legislations, the pressure is now on the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the BJP’s ally in Haryana, to take the acid test and prove its pro-farmer credentials. SAD is an old ally of the BJP and a part of the national democratic alliance (NDA). While the JJP has tendered an apology to the farming community for last week’s police lathi-charge at Kurukshetra during a protest, the studied silence of JJP leader and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has not helped their cause. The deputy chief minister on Friday met chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to press for action against the cops who cane-charged the farmers. While Dushyant remained incommunicado, his younger brother and the chief of JJP’s youth wing, Digvijay Chautala said on Friday that he is of the belief the state government would initiate action against those who ordered lathi-charge on farmers during the protest. Responding to a query on the fate of the BJP-JJP alliance in light of Badal’s resignation from the Union Cabinet, Digvijay said that she was a Central minister and the decision to quit was her party’s decision. “I would not like to comment about Punjab. All I can say is that BJP-JJP alliance is strong and steady in Haryana,” he said, ruling out the possibility of JJP severing ties with the BJP. Attacking Dushyant, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala on Friday said that he has betrayed the farmers of Haryana for his lust for power. “Why is he hiding behind JJP’s second rung leadership? The fact is that Dushyant and his JJP have become addicted to the crumbs of power thrown at them by the BJP,” the Congress leader said. “For how long can Dushyant hide behind the conspiratorial silence of chai samosa meeting with chief minister ML Khattar. He is yet to utter a word against the anti-farmer laws aimed at selling the farm produce and farmers’ interest to a few crony capitalists,” Surjewala said. Dushyant’s brother, Digvijay, meanwhile, said, “The conspiracy hatched by Congress leaders, who claimed to espouse the cause of farmers but actually betrayed them when the farmers took to the streets, would soon be exposed.” “They are trying to circumvent the real issue and put pressure on Dushyant. We will expose their evil designs.” he said. Leader of opposition in the assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday said the situation demanded a political consensus and it is important that political parties raise their voice in the interest of farmers. “A special session of the assembly should be called. These laws should be discussed in the assembly so that people know which party and MLA stood with the farmer and who all stood against them,” Hooda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-protest-running-out-of-steam-but-pressure-on-jjp-to-take-acid-test/story-fhxbiaXMK5rC0sK5xCYEpJ.html
19-09-2020||City||Haryana commission agents declare indefinite strike||In more trouble to farmers ahead of the paddy harvesting season, commission agents in Haryana have declared an indefinite strike from Friday. They are demanding the withdrawal of the three farm bills passed by the Centre. The strike will affect the procurement operations in mandis, adding to the woes of farmers, who are already suffering due to the fall in prices of basmati and parmal varieties. Addressing a gathering of commission agents in Kurukshetra, Haryana Ahtrias Association president Ashok Gupta said, “The commission agents of the state are opposing the ordinances as these are anti-farmer, anti-mandi and anti-ahrtiya.” He added that the new laws will end the old mandi system and demanded that the representatives of the state government hold a meeting with the commission agents and address their concerns. On the other hand, farmers associated with the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) also continued their protests at the district headquarters on the third consecutive day. They said that they will continue with the protests as per the schedule and all roads will be blocked on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-commission-agents-declare-indefinite-strike/story-Lh0Gs64xnsFupYJGQ8mBQL.html
19-09-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Roadways runs in loss as private vehicles ply illegally||Alarmed over tax revenue dipping and private vehicles, including buses, plying in the state illegally, Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma has directed additional deputy commissioners (ADCs)-cum-secretaries, regional transport authority (RTA), to personally check vehicles thrice a week. Haryana Roadways has been reeling under heavy losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The roadways earned Rs 22 crore in four months from April to July, while during the same period last year, the total revenue receipt was Rs 348 crore. In August, the roadways hit the path of recovery as the total receipts from the sale of tickets increased to Rs 29 crore. The total number of passengers who travelled in roadways buses in August also rose to 49 lakh as the buses covered over one crore kilometres in a month. TAX BEING COLLECTED ILLEGALLY AT STATE BORDERS The transport minister’s statement that private vehicles are operating illegally comes close on the heels of another revelation by the minister that kiosks have been opened near inter-state borders in Haryana where motor vehicle tax is being collected illegally. An inquiry was ordered after it came to the fore that some people were operating private shops (kiosks) illegally in the areas of Haryana bordering Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh for depositing motor vehicle tax online. These shop owners were giving fake receipts and didn’t deposit the money in the state government treasury. “Taking advantage, unscrupulous elements have been plying passenger vehicles and buses illegally across the state. This is leading to heavy losses to the state exchequer,” Sharma said. SURPRISE CHECKS AT ODD HOURS On Thursday, the transport commissioner wrote to RTAs in the state about the minister’s concern over the illegal plying of passenger vehicles/buses across the state during a review meeting on September 8. This was causing loss to the exchequer. Now, all ADCs-cum-secretaries in the state will personally check these illegal vehicles in their respective jurisdictions at least three days in a week and impose fine on vehicles plying illegally. A surprise periodic checking of the passenger vehicles will also be carried out at odd hours. These vehicles will be checked in terms of fitness, registration certificate, permit, taxes and pollution. Besides, the RTAs have been directed to ensure routine round the clock checking of illegal passenger vehicles plying in their jurisdiction by the staff already designated for the checking of such vehicles. The entire exercise will be monitored by the minister. The RTAs will have to maintain records of the checking of passenger vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-roadways-runs-in-loss-as-private-vehicles-ply-illegally/story-TVQGb2aW54JljBYkCBrsMI.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Gold chain returned to owner 19 years after theft in Thane||Nineteen years after a 63-year-old woman from Thane was robbed of 48 grams of gold chain worth Rs 2.30 lakh, the Thane Government Railway Police returned the jewellery. The GRP solved the case one year ago. However, the woman’s address had changed and the GRP did a lot of networking to find her and return the jewel.The complainant, Nirmala Radha Krishnan, was boarding a train from Thane station in 2001, when her chain was snatched. She had registered a case. She resided at Central Complex in Koparkhairane, Navi Mumbai.Smita Dhakane, senior police inspector, Thane GRP, said, “The accused was caught in 2003 and the gold chain was recovered and kept in a safe locker as we could not find Nirmala at the address given to us. Ravindra Sengaonkar, police commissioner, Government Railway Police, had given directives to trace the victims of thefts and return the gold ornaments kept in the locker. Accordingly, we began looking for Nirmala’s address.”A police constable visited her residence but she had shifted to a new place. Dhakane added, “We decided to visit the gas agency in Koparkhairane to get some clue about the address, but it did not yield results. Our team members then started checking the FIR and found an MTNL land line phone number. We checked with the telephone agency and traced the number to a new address in Kopar, Thane. We visited the address but found some other person residing there.”The security guard, Laxman Jangam, of that building checked the old records and found a mobile number. Dhakane added, “Calling on the number, we got confirmation about Nirmala and our staff visited her residence at Ravi Estate in Thane. On Friday, we went to her residence and returned the gold chain worth Rs 2.30 lakh.”Nirmala could not believe her luck when the cops knocked on her door. “The chain was Rs 19,000 some 20 years ago and now it is ten times the amount. I am surprised and elated to get the chain after so many years.”The Thane Government Railway Police, in the past two months, have returned 22 tola gold to six victims of thefts. All the victims had reported the theft more than 12 to 20 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gold-chain-returned-to-owner-19-years-after-theft-in-thane/story-1Sqw9NXE7quNig71thXwuL.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Thane corporators demand revision in civic budget in wake of Covid-19||Thane Municipal Corporation has suffered huge financial losses because of the Covid-19 pandemic while funds are unavailable for most developmental works. To improve the financial situation in the city, BJP corporators have demanded that the administration revise its annual budget and present it again on the backdrop of the pandemic.The corporators from all the parties also demanded that the corporator’s funds and ward funds should be under the head of emergency funds so that stalled works can be sped up. The general body meeting was held online at TMC on Thursday. The issue of financial situation of the corporation was taken up for discussion. Corporators claimed that as the budget was not yet approved, funds for most developmental works were still stuck.Asha Dongre, Shiv Sena corporator, said, “Most roads in the city have not been repaired, drainage work incomplete and trees not trimmed. These works were stalled due to lack of funds as the budget wasn’t approved. The ward and corporator’s funds should be considered as emergency funds so that important works aren’t stalled.”Milind Patankar, BJP corporator, said that the earlier budget of the corporation was prepared keeping in mind the revenue generated by the corporation. Patankar added, “However the revenue is affected during the pandemic. The corporation will not be able to tally the expenses and the revenue earned. The administration needs to revise the budget estimate for this fiscal year and present it again. The new budget should take into consideration the expenses on the pandemic,” Patankar said.Congress corporator Vikrant Chavan, however, claimed that it is not as per law to present again a budget that has been presented once.Thane mayor, Naresh Mhaske, added that the administration was already working on releasing funds for developmental works in each ward. Mhaske said, “We are planning to stop the projects that aren’t urgent and divert the funds to the emergency works. Some solution will be sought on this in the next 10 to 15 days. The corporation has also earned a good revenue in property tax that can be used for emergency developmental works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-corporators-demand-revision-in-civic-budget-in-wake-of-covid-19/story-BEUIKebez7d6oCkNDadFYM.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown spells doom for small community of horse cart drivers in Kalyan||The modes of transport have progressed by leaps and bounds in the last few decades. However, the historic city of Kalyan has still kept the good old tongas (horse carts) alive through a small community of tonga drivers.This community, however, is now facing its worse downfall since March this year as public transport has been stopped under lockdown norms. For many whose only livelihood was ferrying commuters in their tongas are now struggling to make ends meet.From ferrying passengers and newly-weds to giving a joy ride to children, the tongas have been an integral part of Kalyan. Over 30 tonga drivers continued to give the cheapest mode of transport.Rehaan Falke, 52, who used to earn for his family with his tonga in Kalyan city, is now completely dependent on his son’s income for his livelihood.“Since March, the tonga business in the city has completely stopped. I used to earn for my family by transporting people in tonga. Now, since I am not earning at all, I am completely dependent on my son’s salary, which is also not much. We are adjusting from whatever we get. Sometimes my son earns only Rs 5,000 a month, which is not sufficient, “ said Falke, who lives with his wife, daughter and son near Bail Bazaar in Kalyan (W).A few of the horse cart drivers have started looking for passengers with the relaxations in lockdown; however, they claim that not many hire their tongas. On Wednesday, after waiting for three hours at the Kalyan railway station road, Falke managed to get 3 passengers.“This is a huge loss for business but I decided to take the streets just thinking that I might earn some amount and help my son, as the entire burden of the family is on him now. Earlier I used to make around Rs 300-400 a day which was sufficient, “added Falke.A Tonga can carry a maximum of four passengers, while each passenger is charged Rs 10 for a ride covering a distance of 1-1.5 km. Commuters from areas like Paar naka, Doodh naka and Tilak chowk in old Kalyan, who used to travel by local trains for work, preferred the tongas to auto rickshaw during the peak hours.The horse cart drivers not only have no income these days, but they also have to incur additional expenses on the horse and the tongas to keep them in shape. “We spend around Rs 200 a day on the horse for its food. Even though we are earning nothing, we have to look after them. Also, there are no such occasions like marriages, festivals where the horse carts are required and we can earn from it. There is no scope of business with the horse cart anymore, “added Falke.Shahid Dolare, 35, who has two horse carriages and five horses and used to give it to other tonga drivers to ply in the city, said, “I am into this Tonga business for the last 40 years. My father started it. Now, this is the first time we have seen such a bad time as tonga transportation is stopped and also the horse carriages are not booked for any function. I spend around Rs 300-400 a day to maintain the carriages and feed the horses from my pocket.”Some of the residents in Kalyan take a tonga as a fun ride for their children. With the lockdown on, children are also not taking the ride.Akram Shaikh, president of Tonga association, Kalyan, said, “When the local trains will resume for all commuters, then the tonga transportation might return to the streets as regular passengers will again take the tongas. We will obviously follow all the required sanitation norms. Many of the tonga drivers are either sitting at home jobless while some have taken up selling vegetables or other items in their areas.”Rich Tradition In the olden days, driving tongas was the livelihood of several families in Doodh naka, Paar naka and Tilak chowk in Kalyan (W). With the passage of time, only a few individuals practiced the profession before the lockdown. Families in Kalyan who drove tongas for a living used to wake up early in the morning, dedicating two hours to clean and groom their horses, and then feed them hay, jaggery and Bengal gram. Around 7am, they began ferrying people from Doodh Naka to Kalyan station and back. Tongas used to play a major role in transportation before buses and autos started to ply in the city. Kalyan then was a port near Durgadi Fort, famous for trade. Horse carts decorated with colourful veils (pardah) and lights (kandil) were seen on the streets and royal families from different parts visited the city on the decorated horse carts.Fifteen years ago, there were around 300 such tongas in the city. Today, it has reduced to 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-spells-doom-for-small-community-of-horse-cart-drivers-in-kalyan/story-f5953JlUeegRu8ZWAKCfiM.html

Being in isolation meant he cannot celebrate with his friends and relatives.However, Kaushal received a huge surprise from his relatives and friends who stood below his building, sang a birthday song for him and held placards wishing him while others looked on.Kaushal, his 43-year-old mother and sister tested positive two weeks ago and are in home quarantine. His relatives used to keep food at his doorstep daily for the family. His father, however, was not infected.Rita Kaushal, his mother and a teacher, said, “Tears rolled out of my eyes when I saw my sister, other family members and friends with placards mentioning happy birthday for my son. They also sent a cake for him. All these days, we were depressed, locked in the house but the surprise brought cheer to us.”Kaushal had high fever for a few days after his mother tested positive. “My children used to see me suffer from fever. They could not come close to me as I had isolated myself in one room. My husband used to take care of me all the time. We had decided to not celebrate the birthday this time,” she added.On Thursday, Sagar’s aunt Kiran Mestry, 50, along with other family members and friends reached his building with huge placards carrying the message “Happy birthday Sagar.” They wore birthday caps and sang birthday songs for him. Other residents from his building also peeped out of the balcony and joined in singing.“We made him cut the cake at the balcony where we could see him smile. The family was going through a lot since the last 14 days as they isolated themselves. So, we decided to make them happy for a moment. We planned to give him a surprise,” said Mestry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/birthday-surprise-for-16-year-old-covid-patient-in-kalyan/story-pmbQQN6DQw5G6NSHtA2IjK.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Ruckus in Thane civic body by corporators over property tax waiver||BJP corporators from Thane created a ruckus in the general body meeting of the Thane Municipal Corporation held on Friday over Shiv Sena’s poll promise of waiver of property tax on flats with area of less than 500 sq ft.The party corporators sang songs in the house to draw attention to the demand.Meanwhile, Congress corporators also demanded exemption of property tax to those below poverty line, at least for three months.Shiv Sena, in its manifesto in 2017 civic polls, had promised waiver of property tax for houses with an area of less than 500 sq ft BJP and MNS had staged several protests in Thane in the last few days, reminding the ruling party of its promise in the pandemic. BJP has also installed huge banners across the city reminding the Sena of its poll promise.Manohar Dumbre, BJP corporator from Ghodbunder, said, “Sena made a promise to the people of Thane to waive property tax after coming into power. However, there is no follow up on this promise. In this pandemic, such an exemption is important for the people.”He was seconded by other corporators who sang songs to remind Sena of its promise. The Sena, however, chose to remain silent.Vikrant Chavan, Congress corporator, said, “There are many people who have lost their livelihood in this pandemic. People are jobless and not even able to provide two square meals to their families. The worst affected are those residing in slums. We request the corporation to exempt property tax on these people who are below poverty line at least for three months.”Sena corporator Vimal Bhoir also supported the demand and said that the months of exemption should be increased to five instead of three for those residing in slums.The administration claimed that no such decision was taken yet.

19-09-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams: Mumbai colleges opt for customised software for students with limited or no access to smart devices, internet connectivity||With final-year exams slated to begin on October 1, city colleges are going the extra mile to ensure that students with limited or no access to smart devices and internet connectivity are also able to take the tests. As directed by the University of Mumbai (MU), most colleges have completed a survey of students to find out if they have the means to take exams online. Principals said that while a majority of students had access to devices and/ or internet connection, some reported they had neither. As a solution, many city colleges are opting for customised software that is compatible on all devices, browsers and connectivity. Kishore Peshori, principal of Mithibai Motiram Kundnani College of Commerce and Economics (MMK college), Bandra, said, “While most of our students said they have a smart device, a few who have gone to remote places [at their hometowns], have said they do not have proper internet connectivity. So we have zeroed in on an exam software that does not require a high-speed internet connection and can run on 2G.” Nirmala Memorial Foundation College of Commerce and Science, Kandivli, too, has opted for a customised software that can run on low bandwidth. “After the survey, we have called students who expressed inaccessibility to make them comfortable with online exams and check if they can borrow a device from parents or neighbour,” said principal Swiddle D’Cunha. For students, who may not be able to manage taking an online exam at all, the college will make arrangements for a physical exam. The software will also help proctor the exams and enable students to take the exams offline. “Meanwhile, we have formed a taskforce with IT (Information Technology) personnel and teachers. Students can call the taskforce and get their doubts clarified on subjects as well as technology,” added D’Cunha. MMK College, too, has a similar helpline. “We are also planning to ask some parents to donate their old devices so they can be distributed among students who need them,” said Peshori. “We will soon send out a list of dos and don’ts to our students so that they are careful while taking the exam. For example, if they do not turn their notifications off, the software may log them out, even if it is a genuine notification about connectivity,” said Madhav Rajwade, principal, Sathaye College in Vile Parle. At Ruparel College in Matunga, only one student does not have access to internet connectivity. “We are trying to arrange for an internet connection for the student,” said principal Tushar Desai. Those students, who have opted for answering questions in Marathi, will be also able to do so online, he said. Dhobi Talao’s St Xaviers’ College, too, is trying to provide connectivity to few students, who do not have accessibility, at a nearest institution. “We are trying to reach their nearest institution – either college or school – which can help us. If not, we will find other solutions,” said principal Rajendra Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-mumbai-colleges-opt-for-customised-software-for-students-with-limited-or-no-access-to-smart-devices-internet-connectivity/story-pYEu9G6tVG5Qe2nkq5WhJK.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams: Maharashtra government says 100% attendance must for teaching, non-teaching staff; teachers irked||The Maharashtra state department for higher and technical education released a government resolution (GR) late on Friday directing 100% attendance of all teaching and non-teaching college staff to ensure that the upcoming online exams for final-year students and the result declaration are completed on time. While the exams are scheduled to start on October 1, the GR does not mention when the directive will be implemented. Teachers’ groups have raised an objection to the attendance owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Honourable Supreme Court has given a judgment on August 28 to conduct final semester exams and to conduct the same, teaching and non-teaching staff is needed,” read the GR. It further stated that the practice of conducting examination includes several processes such as question paper preparation, assessment of answer sheets, preparation of mark sheets and declaration of results. “Examination in the state will be conducted between October 1 and 31 this year and results are required to be announced by the first week of November. This will require a large amount of manpower. To complete the challenging task, 100% attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff is required henceforth.”The GR also highlighted the need for all colleges to strictly follow the guidelines issues by the government and health department to ensure the safety of staff amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Colleges said the implementation of the GR will be difficult. “For starters, the government needs to ensure that the teaching and non-teaching staff gets access to travel by local trains. We are talking about at least 50,000 employees who work across colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and there is no way they can travel safely, if not by trains,” said T Shiware, chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges. Teacher groups said it is “unfair to ask the staff to attend everyday, at a time when the Covid-19 cases are hitting the peak in Maharashtra. “Online exams are being held to ensure students don’t leave their homes for their safety, but no such importance is being given to teachers and the non-teaching staff. This is unfair to us,” said a senior teacher from a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-teachers-irked-as-maharashtra-government-directs-100-attendance-must-for-teaching-non-teaching-staff/story-jPtyA6wo0HMng14zKTmWkK.html

19-09-2020||Mumbai||Age cut-off date relaxed for nursery, Class 1 admissions in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra education department has relaxed the cut-off date for pre-primary and Class 1 admission eligibility, according to a government resolution (GR) released on Friday. As per the GR, a child has to complete three years by December 31 to be eligible for pre-primary/nursery admissions. Similarly, the child should have completed six years by the same date for admission to Class 1. The rule will be implemented from the academic year 2021-22. The earlier cutoff date for both was September 30. In January, the education department came up with a common cut-off date for admissions in schools as several private schools were following different criteria for admissions. As per the RTE act, schools should admit students who have completed 6 years for Class 1 and 3 years for nursery. As per the GR, “Schools can allow a relaxation of upto 15 days from the cut-off date. The decision to do so, rests with the school principals.” The relaxation in the cut off date has come after the office of director of primary education made the recommendation to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/age-cut-off-date-relaxed-for-nursery-class-1-admissions-in-maharashtra/story-XpvB9zQzksh5rIl5zI2TXL.html

The lack of clarity over the resumption of the process has left students anxious and colleges confused.On September 9, the Supreme Court (SC) ordered an interim stay on Maratha reservations in education and jobs, following which the state education department stayed FYJC admissions until further notice. The community was provided 12% reservation in education under the socially and educationally backward class (SEBC) category, which after the SC stay was no longer held valid. Though the department said that a revised timetable for the second admission round – which was to take place on June 10 – will be declared soon, it is yet to make an announcement on the schedule. “We are yet to get clarity on the issue from the state government,” said a senior official from the state education department. Colleges said they are flooded with calls from students on queries over the resumption of the admission process. “Students have all kinds of anxieties. The ones who are yet to get admissions are clueless about when the process will start, while students whose admissions have been confirmed under the SEBC quota are now worried of losing their seats. We cannot guide students in such a situation because we ourselves do not know the government’s plan of action,” said the principal of a junior college in the eastern suburbs. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Region alone, more than 2.12 lakh students applied for admissions for around 3.1 lakh seats that are up for grabs this year. Of the 17,844 seats reserved for students applying under the SEBC category, only 2,923 (16%) applied for admissions, even as 2,309 students under the quota have been allotted a college in the first round of admissions. This is a considerable dip from 2019, when 30% of the total seats were claimed by students from the SEBC quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-stay-on-maratha-quota-no-clarity-on-new-schedule-for-class-11-admissions-in-maharashtra/story-7hY0LSho5wbUPm4cV3DhoJ.html

The actor’s lawyer had approached HC on September 9, the day alleged structural violations in her office premises in Pali Hill, Bandra were demolished. Stating that the petition was filed in haste, the lawyer had sought time to amend it, which the court allowed. BMC was asked to respond to it. The amended petition of the actor stated that even before the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice RI Chagla stayed the demolition on September 9, civic personnel had razed 40% of the bungalow and caused severe damage to movable properties. In light of these submissions, the actor sought a compensation of ₹2 crore. BMC’s additional affidavit, however, stated that the actor’s claims were false as “only the illegal and unauthorised portion of the bungalow was demolished” and hence she could not seek compensation for it. The affidavit filed by Bhagyavant Late, designated officer, H-West ward, stated that the actor had not disputed the notice served to her on September 7 or the stop-work order pasted on the gate of her bungalow on September 8, which was a clear indication that she was aware that the alterations and additions being made on her premises were unauthorized and not as per the sanctioned building plan. Late stated the notices were served on the actor after a mukadam and an executive engineer on inspection of the premises arrived at the conclusion that substantive alterations and additions had been made to the property without the permission of the civic authority. “The petitioner, who has undisputedly carried out substantial unlawful additions and alterations contrary to the approved plan and without applying for and obtaining any permission for the same, cannot be heard to contend that remedial action taken in respect of such unlawful acts, was either illegal or high handed or approach writ jurisdiction of HC for relief and make ‘baseless’ and ‘bogus’ claims for compensation,” the affidavit states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-s-demand-for-2-crore-baseless-bogus-says-mumbai-civic-body-on-actor-s-compensation-for-office-demolition/story-nV9z3xr44nsq03rUJfKChP.html

19-09-2020||Mumbai||International Coastal Clean-up Day: Eight Indian beaches vie for international eco-label||Eight Indian beaches complying with the stringent Blue Flag certification criteria have been recommended by the Centre for final consideration before an international jury. No Indian beach has qualified for this certification so far. Blue Flag is a voluntary eco-label for the cleanest and most developed coastal areas in the world, awarded by a Denmark-based jury of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). The results are expected in less than a month. According to a report by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC), the eight beaches that are under consideration are Shivrajpur (Devbhumi Dwarka, Gujarat); Ghoghla (Daman and Diu); Kasarkod (Karwar, Karnataka); Padubidri (Udupi, Karnataka); Kappad (Kozhikode, Kerala); Rushikonda (Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh); Golden beach (Puri, Odisha); and Radhanagar (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). The report – Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS) – was prepared over two years by the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under MoEFCC. HT has seen the report. “BEAMs has managed to come up with a beach development model in line with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We are expecting the final results from the [Blue Flag] jury by October second week,” said Sanjai Jalla, mission leader of the program. He added that the Centre plans to develop eco-tourism models in 100 beach stretches along India’s coast over the next five years, vying for Blue flag certification. “A process has already been rolled out with pre-assessment scientific studies to identify 20 potential beach locations to be undertaken for development during 2021-22 and 20 beaches thereafter on a year to year basis,” said Jalla. Blue Flag is known for its stringent criteria. Only a few beaches in Asia have been conferred the certification. BEAMS found that the eight beaches from India had witnessed an average reduction of 82- 84% in marine litter since 2018. Cleanliness was calculated based using a beach litter measuring system (BLMS) wherein managers were appointed to conduct daily audits. For all marine litter, the quantity reduced from 83,198 kg in June 2018 to 14,929 kg in May 2020. Similarly, plastic litter fell from 14,970 kg in June 2018 to 2,420 kg across 10 Indian beaches in May 2020. The details were released ahead of International Coastal Clean-up Day celebrated on third Saturday in September. “For the Blue Flag certification, the cleanliness levels have to be maintained at A+ or A. Using BLMS, we categorised beach litter into bulk (over 10 cm) and fine (less than 10 cm), and divided the beach into transects of 100 sq. m for bulk and 1 sqm for fine each to calculate litter before and after clean-ups. Tourists said these eight beaches were among some of the cleanest in the world,” said Jalla. MoEFCC had originally identified 13 pilot beaches for the certification in 2018. However, work on Bangram beach, Lakshadweep island, Bhogwe beach, Sindhudurg, and Miramar beach is likely to be taken up for development and certification next year. “Work at Kovalam beach (Tamil Nadu) and Eden (Puducherry) are underway, and will be ready by December 2020,” said Jalla. Other developments across eight beaches, which have been identified with photographic evidence in the BEAMS report, are categorised into beach amenities, waste management, renewable energy, safety and security, recreational facilities, testing of bathing water quality, biodiversity conservation and maintenance of beach ecosystems. “Critical marine biodiversity data was collected through scuba diving to assess coral bleaching, diseases and litter and benthic sessile invertebrate fauna counts, fish counts and substrate type in our analysis,” said Jalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/international-coastal-clean-up-day-eight-indian-beaches-vie-for-international-eco-label/story-tyeXmmUklZ3fXUSDQ3R7WJ.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||1,875 cybercrimes reported in Thane since March: Police data||With more than 1,800 cases of cyber-crimes being registered in Thane police commissionerate since March this year, the cyber cell has claimed that there has being around 20 to 30 per cent increase in the number of cases in the lockdown compared to last year.While the crimes of thefts and house break-ins have decreased, cyber-crimes related to phishing and vishing scams are on the rise, claimed the police department.The Thane cyber cell has registered 1,875 cases under the cyber laws apart from which the department also has received thousands of phone calls with complaints that were not even registered in the past six months. Last year, the number was comparatively less by around 30 per cent.The police claimed that despite constant awareness, with most people staying at home and using net banking, digital modes of payments or shopping, most of them easily click on unknown links or fall prey to telecallers who convince them to share their details.Vivek Phansalkar, police commissioner of Thane, said, “Citizens should not deal with unknown persons and entities online; protect own data passwords, etc. fiercely, cross check, double check before transferring money and use only safe recommended apps for online payments. Do not copy paste the passwords or any important keywords.”Thane cyber police have been taking several awareness campaigns since last year and have been doing online awareness programmes since lockdown has started.Additional police commissioner (crime), Pravin Pawar, said, “Most people extensively use social media as they are at home over the last few weeks. The cyber criminals have found several innovative ideas to attract these net savvy people and rob them of their hard-earned money. Most frauds happen when people click on unknown links on social media or shop from unknown sites. Every week, there are complaints of various innovative phishing frauds, targeting gullible people.”KYC upgradation common fraud One of the most common frauds is the KYC upgradation. Here, most consumers receive call from the fraudsters posing to be from any of the popular digital payment portals asking consumers to update their KYC or they won’t be able to use the application.With most people paying through digital getaways to avoid cash exchange in pandemic, they inadvertently fall prey to these calls, said Patil.Assistant police commissioner, cyber cell, Sardar Patil, added, “The callers then ask the consumers to download a few desktop sharing applications, thus getting access to their phones or laptops, downloading all personal account information.“The second fraud is about the sending messages about free Covid-19 tests or concessions in the tests. The accused would call or send a message to register for the Covid test, along with a link to be filled requiring bank account details and later withdraw money from the account.“Another common fraud is also over updating the insurance policies. A few fake mobile applications that claimed to check people’s oxymeter also get details on fingerprints and other data to siphon off money.” People also used the pandemic to appeal to people to pay money for those requiring Covid treatment through social networking sites.An officer from cyber cell who did not wish to be named said, “When the online sale of alcohol was permitted, people received messages and numbers from the shops in their localities. Most of these numbers were fake and after people paid for the alcohol, no delivery was made. We got several such complaints in a month once the sale of liquor started.”People being duped on dating or matrimonial applications are also a common modus operandi in the lockdown period.Police creating awarenessPatil added, “We have tried to create awareness among people throughout the pandemic on these different types of frauds. There were 1,875 cases registered in Debit/credit card fraud, card cloning, OTP share, job fraud, online shopping fraud, social media-related fraud. People should not click on any random links. Keeping a strong secret password is also one of the important factors. If anyone gets a SIM card-related call or insurance policy details related call, people should call the authentic person for the same, or authentic helpline of that policy which is mentioned on your documents.”He added that if a person is helping any friend who has sent a message on Facebook, call or video call the person before sending money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-875-cyber-crimes-since-march-2020-thane-police/story-VY1WEDlXuyDqLTq6zDWR8N.html

Miranda, Sawant and Parihar were arrested by NCB as part of the agency’s investigation into allegations of drug abuse in the case of Rajput’s death. They applied for bail contending that the charges against them are bailable. The trio were previously denied bail by a special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. According to NCB, Miranda and Sawant received parcels with contraband material on instructions of actor Rhea Chkaraborty, who has also been arrested. Parihar allegedly supplied contraband to Rajput. Appearing for the arrested accused, advocate Taraq Sayed submitted that all offences under the NDPS Act involving small quantity of contraband material are bailable and his clients should not be charged with section 27A (financing illegal trafficking) of the NDPS Act. Sayed further submitted that there no drugs were recovered from the three applicants. He also pointed out that the quantity of drugs recovered is small and those from whom drugs were recovered were granted bail. Justice Kotwal directed ASG Singh to reply to the specific issues raised by the applicants and in response to which Singh sought time. Bandra hotelier Zaid Vilatra, who was also arrested by NCB in connection with this case, moved HC challenging his remand. His petition will come up for hearing on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-ncb-s-reply-to-bail-pleas-of-samuel-miranda-dipesh-sawant-and-abdel-basit-parihar/story-kT2bzFFJN37s12Hnzc3RgJ.html
19-09-2020||Mumbai||Only 64% of eligible students across India register for JEE-Advance this year||Only 64% students eligible to appear for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Advanced registered for the examination this year. While of the top 2.5 lakh students who cleared JEE-Main were eligible for the examination this year, only 1.6 lakh students finished the registration process by Friday evening.“Most students who apply for JEE-Advanced are those who have scored very well and sure of making it into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) of their choice. Students no more waste their time and effort by preparing and appearing for JEE-Advanced if they know they could get through a private engineering institute with their Class 12 and common entrance test scores closer home,” said a senior professor from IIT-Bombay. Last year, over 1.75 lakh students across the country of the top 2.45 lakh students who cleared the JEE-Main exam had registered for the examination. In 2018, of the top 2.31 lakh JEE-Main eligible candidates, only 1.64 lakh candidates had registered for JEE-Advance and in 2017, around 1.71 lakh of the 2.20 lakh eligible candidates had registered for JEE-Advanced exam.“Most engineering aspirants from larger metro cities are aware of options they have of engineering colleges closer home and the advantage of off-campus training they receive through internships and other temporary jobs. The overall growth along with studies attracts more students to other engineering institutes,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.JEE-Advanced exam will be conducted by IIT-Delhi this year and the exam is scheduled to take place across the country on September 27. Keeping in mind social distancing norms amid the ongoing pandemic, the number of exam centres across the country have been doubled compared to last year. While exam cities have been increased from 164 last year to 222 this year, exam centres stand at 1,150 compared to around 600 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-64-of-eligible-students-across-india-register-for-jee-advance-this-year/story-mEO5mlPWnyj2xbU0JYuPaI.html

19-09-2020||Delhi||Schools concerned about implementation of Delhi high court order||Following the Delhi high court’s order on Friday asking schools to provide gadgets and internet access to students from economically weaker section (EWS) and disadvantaged groups (DG) categories to assist in their online education during the Covid-19 crisis, private schools in the capital have raised concerns over the implementation of the order. According to the Right to Education Act, 25% of the seats at entry-level classes of private unaided schools are reserved for children under the EWS/DG category whose families earn less than ₹1 lakh annually. These children are entitled to free textbooks, notebooks, stationery and uniforms, and state governments are supposed to reimburse schools for these expenses. However, schools have claimed that over the years, the delay in transfer of funds by the government has added to the expenses of parents or schools, who spend the money and wait for reimbursements. Puneet Mittal, counsel for Delhi Public School, submitted in the high court that in the past decade, of the ₹30.36 crore spent for EWS students in the five DPS schools in the capital, only ₹2.92 crore had been reimbursed by the state government and the outstanding balance stands at ₹27.43 crore.Also read: Digital divide in mind, Delhi HC tells pvt schools, KVs to bridge gapWhile the court on Friday directed private unaided schools to file their claims for reimbursement to the Delhi government within eight weeks from the date of supply of gadgets or equipment and stated that the said claim shall be processed and reimbursed to the schools within eight weeks from the date of their submission, schools are apprehensive of when they will be compensated for these expenses.SK Bhattacharya, president of the Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, said, “While the court has given a time frame [for the reimbursement], compliance and red-tapism is often an issue. Several private schools have not received funds for providing textbook, uniform and other items to EWS children for the past five years. How can we expect to receive reimbursement for laptops and other facilities now?” Bhattacharya will also be a part of the three-member committee that the high court has directed to ensure uniformity and expedite the supply of gadgets/equipment to EWS/DG students, along with formulating standard operating procedure on the matter. “We welcome the decision by the court to call for serious deliberation on the matter and take the views of private schools into cognisance. Investments on laptop and internet facilities will be expensive and difficult to facilitate during a pandemic, since schools are already facing financial issues due to fee restrictions,” he said.Officials in the Delhi government said they have received the high court’s order and examining it. They refused to comment further on the matter. “A pragmatic solution would be that the government should give money in advance to the schools to purchase the material and distribute among children so that they can continue with their online classes,” he added. Om Prakash Gautam, chairman of Green Valley International Public School, agreed. “We haven’t received the reimbursements for books and uniforms provided by us to the EWS students for three years now. When the old reimbursements are not being fulfilled, how can we expect to receive new reimbursements for expensive devices like smartphones and laptops?” While parents have welcomed the move, questions remain over the academic loss in the six months since the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed moving the teaching-learning processes online. Malkeet Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, whose two children study in top private schools in west Delhi, said his children were still unable to appear for their ongoing tests. “Their academic year is under jeopardy as they couldn’t attend their classes or appear for the class tests for the past six months. I lost my job as a contractual driver and there was no possibility of buying a new smartphone to help with their classes,” Singh said. “My son still hasn’t received his books from the school creating further problems in following his studies. While the order intends to help students, we don’t know how it will be implemented. Often, schools don’t even talk to us to resolve our queries and help our children,” he said. Advocate Shikha Sharma, petitioner in the case and secretary at NGO Justice for All, said, “The judgement would help in combating the mass dropout of students along with assisting those who could not access a single class or missed examination due to lack of devices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-concerned-about-implementation-of-delhi-high-court-order/story-P5rQIVZBCtOhtTB5WYYgqK.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi schools stay shut for all classes till Oct 5 due to Covid crisis||The Delhi government on Friday said all schools in the national capital will remain closed till October 5 for all students. The order, which came in the backdrop of a fresh spike in Covid-19 cases, ended speculation over whether students of classes 9-12, as per the central government’s guidelines, will be allowed to visit schools to take guidance from teachers on a voluntary basis from September 21.“It is informed that all schools will remain closed for all students till October 5. However, online classes and teaching-learning activities will continue as usual and Head of Schools (HoS) are authorised to call teachers/ staff (as per requirement) for smooth conduct of online classes, teaching-learning activities and any other work,” the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) said in its order.Schools across the country have been shut since March-end in the wake of the coronavirus disease pandemic. Classes are being conducted online and links to online study materials are being sent to students via WhatsApp, emails and SMS.A senior education department official, who did not want to be named, said the decision was taken after assessing the Covid-19 situation. “The department has also received feedback from parents of both government and private schools, and a majority of them do not want their children to return to schools right now. We have also reviewed the situation and concluded that it is not suitable for the students to visit schools in Delhi for at least the next few weeks,” the official said.On Friday, Delhi reported 4,127 new cases and 30 deaths, taking the total infections to 238,828 and fatalities to 4,907. Authorities have ramped up testing as a measure to combat the current spike in infections. Before the resurgence of cases, the seven-day average of daily cases in the Capital peaked at 3,446 on June 26 before falling to 983 on August 4. In the last seven days, Delhi has seen an average of 4,154 new cases every day.Parents welcomed the Delhi government order on schools. “My daughter and her friends had already decided that they will not be visiting school after September 21. We conducted an online survey to take parents’ opinion on partial reopening of schools, and 97% of the 1,000 parents who participated in the survey said that they did not want to send their children to schools amid the pandemic,” Sumit Vohra, the father of a Class 10 student at DPS Vasant Kunj, said. Jyoti Arora, the principal of Mount Abu Public School, said around 65% parents of enrolled students were not in favour of sending their children to the institute at this point. “However, it has become a challenge for schools to teach practical-based subjects online. If schools were allowed to partially reopen, they could have conducted practical for students, especially those in board classes, in small groups while taking all precautions,” she said.AK Jha, the head of school at a government-run sarvodaya co-educational institute in Rohini, said: “Although students want to rejoin the school, but their parents are not in favour of sending them. It is better if the schools continue to remain closed for the next few weeks.” The central government, in its guidelines for Unlock 4 issued on August 30, said though schools, colleges and other education institutions will remain closed till the end of September, there will be some relaxations for senior students.Students of classes 9-12 may be permitted to visit their schools — only outside containment zones — on voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers, according to the guidelines.For doing so, students will have to give written consent of their parents/guardians. The guidelines said the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the same will be issued by the ministry of health and family welfare. The guidelines also said states and Union Territories may permit up to 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff to be called to the schools at a time for online teaching/tele-counselling and related work from September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-schools-stay-shut-for-all-classes-till-oct-5/story-L10P9TarWqTTS8wCdajYIO.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi L-G orders redrafting fresh policy for containment zones, better surveillance of Covid cases||Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Friday issued directions to the government for drafting a fresh policy for containment zones, increased surveillance of Covid-19 cases – with special focus on those in home isolation — and stricter enforcement of Covid guidelines.Baijal is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority , and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.The directions from the L-G came during a meeting of DDMA on Friday evening, which was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, revenue minister Kailash Gehlot, chief secretary Vijay Dev, and other top government officials and experts —including Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog, Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS and Dr Balram Bhargava, DG of ICMR. Most of the officials participated through video conferencing , government officials said.“The L-G chaired the DDMA meeting to review the Covid-19 situation… He advised officials and experts to jointly prepare blueprint for re-strategising containment zone policy to reduce positivity rate and mortality rate. He emphasised on aggressive campaigns particularly in vernacular language to engage stakeholders for ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said the office of the L-G, in a series of tweets.The chief minister’s office did not issue a separate statement about the meeting, with Delhi government spokespersons refusing to comment on it.On Friday, in a separate meeting with district magistrates, the deputy commissioners of police and municipal commissioners, the L-G issued directions to intensify surveillance to ensure better implementation of protocols of home isolation patients, ways to enhance early detection of cases, and enforcement of protective and preventive Covid-19 measures, said another senior official in the L-G office.As on Friday, Delhi had 1,751 containment zones — which are defined as sealed areas where free movement of individuals and traffic is prohibited, as is economic activities. All residents in containment zones are put under intensive surveillance and are periodically screened for the virus and the area sanitised. Essential goods are delivered at doorstep by government officials for a period of at least 14 days.Also read| Delhi: 4,217 new Covid-19 cases logged, positivity rate down to 6.8%This is the second time that Delhi’s containment zone strategy will be re-drafted. Earlier, the containment zone policy was redrafted on June 26, in adherence to recommendations of Union home minister Amit Shah.“While the L-G has given no clear deadline in Friday’s meeting, the health department is likely to submit the new containment zones strategy in a week,” an official privy to the developments said.While discussing ways to enhance early detection of cases, the L-G made a reference to rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests but did not delve further into the modalities, said two district officials who spoke with HT on the condition of anonymity.In a separate meeting on Friday, health minister Satyendar Jain discussed ways to ramp up RT-PCR tests with top health department officials and medical officers, in adherence to directions of the Delhi High Court earlier this week.On Friday, Delhi recorded 4,127 new covid-19 cases – taking the total number of people infected to 238,828 -- against 61,037 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/l-g-orders-redrafting-fresh-policy-for-containment-zones-better-surveillance-of-covid-cases/story-56HV70LuSt3zxPDhD6FppJ.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||One half of Sarai Kale Khan Flyover closed for traffic for a fortnight for repairs||Repair work on a one-way flyover in front of the Sarai Kale Khan interstate bus terminus, and ongoing construction of an underpass at Ashram, triggered traffic jams in parts of south and south-east Delhi on Friday evening.The traffic police have closed half of the 150-metre, one-way flyover to repair its expansion joints. Traffic officials issued advisories, asking motorists heading from Ashram and other parts of south Delhi towards ITO via Ring Road and Sarai Kale Khan to avoid the route for at least 14 days. “We have closed one half of the flyover -- from Ashram side towards ITO. In the other half, private vehicles are being allowed to move. A week later, the other side of the flyover will be repaired and vehicles will be allowed to move on the other half that would have been repaired by then,” said SD Mishra, additional commissioner of police (ACP), traffic, (southern range), Delhi Police.Traffic movement on the opposite carriageway -- from ITO towards Sarai Kale Khan and Ashram -- would remain unaffected as the road is not part of the one-way flyover. If private vehicles still use this route, they have to either take the half-open portion of the flyover, or a service road below it. which are anyway likely to be choked. A senior PWD official privy to the development said the expansion joints are being repaired. “We are changing the expansion joints of the flyover, as it has developed gaps,” the official said.About four-5 km away, work on an underpass at the Ashram intersection -- notorious for traffic snarls -- caused vehicular movement to slow down in and around the area and parts of Lajpat Nagar.The traffic authorities advised motorists to avoid Ashram to avoid getting caught in traffc snarls.“Vehicles coming from Moolchand on Ring Road and headed towards Faridabad should take Captain Gaur Marg from below the Lajpat Nagar flyover. Vehicles coming from Sarai Kale Khan and headed towards Faridabad can take a left on CV Raman Marg to get to Mathura Road,” said another official.Vehicles also moved at a snail’s pace around Sarai Kale Khan as the closure of a part of the flyover created a bottleneck. Rachit Singh, a commuter heading to Noida, said he took the flyover despite knowing about the repair work and restrictions. “I thought it would be a few minutes of wait, but I barely covered a kilometre in 1 minutes,” said Singh. Mishra said during this time, commercial vehicles from Ashram would be diverted to the DND flyway to ensure a smooth flow to Ring Road via Mayur Vihar and Akshardham. Commercial vehicles from DND flyway towards Delhi would also be diverted towards the Noida-Akshardham route, he added.“We are advising private vehicles to avoid this (Sarai Kale Khan) route. We deployed sufficient staff at this stretch. We are handling the traffic signal below the flyover manually during this period,” said Mishra.Traffic police have put up signboards and deployed its personnel on the DND flyway and the Barapullah flyover to handle any build-up of traffic on those stretches.Through Friday, the traffic police kept pushing out alerts about the closure of the flyover on its social media accounts. A senior traffic police officer, however, said the jam in Ashram was due to the construction of the underpass and the restrictions in Sarai Kale Khan had little impact on it. This Sarai Kale Khan stretch is important because it connects south Delhi with central and northern parts of the national capital. It is also part of Delhi’s Ring Road. A little beyond near the Millennium Park, the road turns towards the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (formerly NH 24) from where commuters can go towards East Delhi and Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-half-of-sarai-kale-khan-flyover-closed-for-traffic-for-a-fortnight-for-repairs/story-p8Ux7WlwyP2leIWvb1GjLJ.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||AAP asks BJP to withdraw worksheets having ‘distorted’ map of India||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi, to immediately withdraw worksheets that contained a ‘distorted’ map of India. The worksheets issued to students of class 4 in schools operated by the north Delhi civic body had a map that excluded Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) “The BJP-ruled MCD’s books for class 4 students have distorted map of India. The same that were once issued by China and Pakistan. Playing with India’s territorial integrity is a shameful and unacceptable act. The AAP demands immediate withdrawal of the books by the BJP. Also, people associated with this act should be booked for sedition,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs. The BJP said the concerned school assignment workbook was already withdrawn and accused AAP of indulging in “cheap melodrama”. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “This distorted map issue came to our North DMC civic leadership’s knowledge yesterday and the Mayor immediately ordered an inquiry as to who issued the wrong map and the home-work assignment was withdrawn. Durgesh Pathak should refrain from indulging in cheap melodramas like he has done today after the map issue was resolved yesterday itself.” “The workbook in Hindi for use in classes 4 and 5 in schools of the North MCD, has images of two maps of the country, one before and the other after Independence. The Jammu and Kashmir region in the post-Independence map has been shown as ‘truncated’,” said an official in the North MCD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-asks-bjp-to-withdraw-faulty-worksheets/story-vxRl4u5b38FgxolhbdGeiK.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Protect, notify Najafgarh lake: NGT to Haryana, Delhi||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Delhi and Haryana governments to jointly prepare an ‘environment management plan’ to notify and protect the Najafgarh lake, which falls partly in south-west parts of the city and partly in the neighbouring state.A principal bench of the tribunal in an order dated September 17 said, “In view of the fact that there is a large transboundary water body, which falls partly in Delhi and partly in Haryana, it will be appropriate that an environment-management plan be prepared by the state of Haryana and the NCT of Delhi.”A host of migratory bird species such as painted stork, sarus crane and black-necked stork among other flock to the around 7 sq km Najafgarh lake located on the Delhi-Haryana border every year.The NGT said the plan should be prepared within three months. “The ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF&CC) may steer the proceedings of the said plan with the assistance of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which may coordinate as a nodal agency,” the order stated.In a report submitted to the NGT on September 17, the Gurugram district magistrate said as per revenue records, there is no water body in the area. The area is partly government land and partly private. “However, factually, there is a large water body in existence and a management plan is under consideration of the state,” the report submitted before the panel stated.In 2017, the Haryana government had told the NGT and submitted a brief document in the MoEF&CC, saying that the water body in question was a lake and that the state was in the process of notifying it as a wetland.Historically, the Najafgarh lake used to get water from the Sahibi river, which used to flow from Rajasthan.Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said the lake is connected to the river Yamuna. “The lake used to get flooded during monsoons and to drain out the excess water, the Najafgarh drain was created. The lake now carries sewage from Gurugram and other parts of Haryana, which goes into the drain. The lake is spread over two states and has a rich biodiversity and needs to be conserved. The court order is a welcome step. Conservation of the water body will preserve the rich habitat as well as help recharge groundwater and become a source of water for Gurugram, which has a low water table.” In October last year, the Delhi government’s Wetland Authority had written to Haryana, urging it to provide a plan for declaring it as a wetland. At the same time, the Delhi government had also ordered an extensive survey of the area around the lake on its side in southwest Delhi to assess the area covered by its water. .In 2014, the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, an NGO, had filed a plea in the NGT to conserve and protect the Najafgarh lake, after which the court had asked the Delhi and Haryana governments to take steps in the direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protect-notify-najafgarh-lake-ngt-to-haryana-delhi/story-9amlTadPeW54KhV2kWhT7O.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Slum dwellers stage protest, want to be added to consultative process||Residents from slums located on railways land in Delhi on Friday received support from members of the civil society, as they held protests in different parts of the city to demand being made a part of the consultative process for their relocation.The Supreme Court, on August 31, had directed the Railways to remove nearly 48,000 slums situated close to the safety zone of the tracks within three months. All courts were restrained from ordering a stay on their eviction. Hindustan Times was the first to report on the Supreme Court order on September 3.After the Supreme Court order , over 65 organisations, movements and associations of residents of affected slums, have come together to voice their protest on the slum dwellers from being evicted. A flurry of applications were filed in the top court after its order with a group of 11 slum dwellers living near railway tracks in various parts of the Capital moved an application to join the proceedings. This application followed a separate plea by senior Congress leader Ajay Maken in the Supreme Court demanding alternate housing for the slum dwellers under the Delhi Slum & Jhuggi Jhopdi (JJ) Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015, before they are removed. On Friday, the Railway Basti Jan Sangharsh Morcha — a collective of NGOs, organisations working for welfare of urban poor and residents of slums — led the protests. Members of the outfit said that though they welcomed the Railways’ decision about no “coercive action against settlements on railway land in Delhi for four weeks” and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s assurance to slum dwellers that they will not be evicted , they wanted the residents of such slums to be part of the consultative process.The Centre had told the Supreme Court on September 14 that they were working in tandem with the Delhi government are in the process of making a decision with regard to clearing of 48,000 slums situated adjacent to railway tracks in Delhi. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had then informed the top court that no demolition action will commence till a decision is in place by the Indian Railways, ministry of urban development and Delhi government.Shakeel Ahmed, convener of Basti Suraksha Manch, said, “We will continue to hold protests till the government accepts our demands. The residents should be consulted while the state and the Centre draw up a plan for their rehabilitation as it affects their homes and livelihoods.”Ahmed said that they wanted the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s policy for rehabilitation of slums to be followed and in-situ housing be provided within 5km of the existing site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/slum-dwellers-stage-protest-want-to-be-added-to-consultative-process/story-14VOGpxdPUL2mmoDmq7fHL.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses plea seeking licence renewals for liquor sale in dept stores||The Delhi high court has dismissed a plea that sought a direction to the government for the renewal of licences to sell beer and wine at department stores across the city. The plea had challenged the Delhi government’s decision to not invite any applications for the issuance of L-12/L-12F licences, which allow retail sale of beer and wine, both imported and locally made, at department stores.While dismissing the plea, the court said it cannot interfere with the policy decisions of the state (Delhi) government, unless the same is found to be at fault on the grounds of “mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or unfairness”. In an order of September 16, a copy of which was uploaded on the court website on September 18, the court said that the Delhi government had not renewed the licences as it had decided to “bring in a revamped scheme with necessary modifications to plug all loopholes” .The Delhi cabinet on December 11, 2019, had decided to pause the issuance of L-12/L-12F licences, until the excise department revised the terms and conditions, under its next excise policy, for grant of L-12/L-12F licences. The petition had challenged the decision of the Delhi Cabinet whereby licences of all 125 stores were withdrawn despite violations being made only by 41 licensees. The petitioner had moved the high court last December aswell, challenging the withdrawal of all 125 licences mid-tenure on the basis of searches conducted by the excise department. The court has then granted a stay on the withdrawal of licences for fiscal 2019-2020.Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Rushab Aggarwal contended that L12 & L12F are renewable licences under the Delhi Excise Rules and his client had a legitimate expectation of renewal as has been done every year.Appearing for the Delhi government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh contended that in September 2019, it had inspected 41 of 125 stores and found large scale violations. He said stores were operating as liquor vends by failing to comply with the terms and conditions of the licence, in particular the stipulation that only 10% of the store carpet area be used for the sale of beer and wine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-licence-renewals-for-selling-beer-wine-in-dept-stores/story-fhHwX2taKcey3lXIklNFkM.html
19-09-2020||Delhi||Jamia violence: How have you punished erring officers, HC asks Delhi Police||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought to know from Delhi Police what action they had taken against police officers who allegedly used excessive force against students of Jamia Milia Islamia violence during the violence that had broken out at the university in December last year.Citing a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) report on the Jamia violence, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said it had pointed out instances of police violence and that no action had been taken so far. It sought to know from Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi, representing Delhi police, whether FIRs had been registered against erring police officials.Lekhi said an enquiry is on against individual cases where some police officers used excessive force. However, the NHRC report supports police intervention, he said. The court said, “But you need to satisfy us as to what action has been taken against those individual cases? Whether FIRs have been registered against those police officers?.The court was hearing a bunch of pleas seeking relief in the Jamia violence while urging for the constitution of an SIT or a court-monitored probe in the matter.Lekhi justified the police action, saying the officials were constrained because there was stone-pelting from inside the varsity. He said the mob started vandalising the properties and blocking the roads. To this the bench remarked, “The argument is not that you don’t have a right to enter the University. The argument is that you should have taken prior approval of the admin before doing so.”Violence had broken out in the varsity after student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Police have been accused of entering the campus and assaulting students after protests against the Act turned violent on December 15.At least 10 vehicles were allegedly torched by protesters. The Jamia students had said they were not involved in the violence and that their peaceful march was hijacked by outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jamia-violence-how-have-you-punished-erring-officers-hc-asks-delhi-police/story-nDYDMgPKbdzr6UmuZGib1L.html
19-09-2020||Pune||Pune’s Diwali anks in limbo; Rs 10-cr biz scripts a ‘in the red’ storyline||The 111-year-old tradition of publishing ‘Diwali ank’ (Diwali magazines), an important avenue for writers and readers, is reeling under the impact of Covid-19 situation. The most awaited literary magazine that hits the stands and bookshops ten days before Diwali will see few magazines instead of the regular 1,500 anks (editions). The oldest and most read Diwali Ank, “Sataayushi” will not be published this year, while the hard copies of several others may not be released. Many young publishers, like Megha Shimpi, have decided not to bring out Diwali edition. For the past 12 years, Shimpi has been publishing Diwali magazine through Saur Publications. “Eight people were depended on the profit that I got from advertisements and sale of magazine. The coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns have changed everything — meeting people in person, and getting advertisements for the magazine have become difficult. The fund required to publish a full-fledged, magazine is around Rs2-3 lakh. I have decided to not publish my Diwali magazine this year for lack of financial support,” she said. This year only 100 magazines will be published and on sale, but the dilemma for regular sellers is of how will the sale be? “There are at least 1,500 registered Diwali edition publishers with the Maharashtra government’s publicity department out of which 350 are commercial Diwali Ank regularly sold at bookshops and newsstands. Only 100 publishing houses have confirmed of bringing out the Diwali editions this year,” said Chandrakant Shewale, vice-president, Diwali Ank Sampadak Association, popularly known as DIVA Prathisthan. “Readership has decreased over the past three years and the coronavirus pandemic has almost brought the Diwali Ank publication to a standstill,” he said. Poonam Agency, the oldest book agency that is running for the past 61 years, is calling publications to confirm the number of Diwali anks to be published. Srikant Bhutada of Poonam Agency said, “There will be only 50 per cent of Diwali ank published and we are facing major losses. This is the second time that the business of these special magazine is affected. The demonetisation in 2016 saw our business profit drop by 25%. This business works only for a month and earns around Rs8 to Rs10 crore.” Rohan Champanerkar, publisher, Rohan Prakashan, said, “This special literary magazine is one of the most sought after magazine which is published specially for Diwali and its readership mostly consist of senior citizens or people over 45 years of age. The advent of smartphones and English readers have kept the youth away from this precious gift penned by Marathi writers.” Vandana Bokil Kulkarni began their Diwali edition in 2015 and she still hasn’t been able to break even. “Although we do not look at profits, we try to bring in enough money through advertisements to sustain the Diwali ank. While we have decided to bring out an edition this year, we are in a wait and watch situation because of the pandemic. We will keep the content ready and wait until October 15 to decide whether to print or release it online,” said Vandana. Sujata Deshmukh, editor of well-known Diwali Ank Maher, is still contemplating over the publishing. “We have begun our work of putting the content together and awaiting a nod from printers. The question is how to send the magazine across the state when postal services are refusing to begin delivery services of magazines, as only emergency and money orders are on at the moment.” “Diwali ank is a movement in terms of literary world and this pandemic has stalled the tradition. We are facing a dilemma of how to sell the magazine on stalls, when senior citizens who are our buyers cannot come to the shop nor are they literate enough for e-books or buying them online. So, this year, the Diwali ank is in limbo,” said Ramesh Rathivdekar, owner, Akshardhara bookstore in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/diwali-ank-in-limbo-rs-10-cr-biz-scripts-a-in-the-red-storyline/story-aK4R3kdckI9oCAWjV6Z6wN.html

He replaces K Venkatesham, who has been transferred as additional director general (special operations). Gupta will have to tackle multi-fold challenges ranging from street violations, vehicle thefts and property and cybercrimes. The 51-year-old, 1992-batch IPS officer, is an IIT graduate who hails from Uttar Pradesh was posted as principal secretary (special), home department, Mumbai, before his Pune posting. The newly appointed commissioner is likely to take charge on Saturday. Despite repeated attempts, Gupta could not be reached for comments.In a WhatsApp message, he said that he would revert. Meanwhile, outgoing police commissioner K Venkatesham had initiated a number of citizen centric programmes and widely expanded his public outreach initiatives through extensive use of technology and modernising drives during his tenure. He had taken charge as Pune CP in August 2018 from the then police commissioner Rashmi Shukla. Former governor CH Vidyasagar Rao during his public address had commended Venkatesham for the excellent citizen-centric initiatives.Known for his soft-spoken nature, the 1988 batch Maharashtra cadre officer came into limelight after the Pune police launched a nationwide crackdown on activists in the aftermath of the violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. The city police arrested activists like Sudha Bharadwaj, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Fareira , Gautam Navlakha, Mahesh Raut and advocate Surendra Gadling under his supervision. Venkatesham’s initiatives like Bharosa cell and senior citizen cell received good response amongst the citizenry and the government at the state and centre. Known for being active on Twitter, the former police commissioner tweeted on important issues and responded to the call of citizens who tagged their grievances on the social media.Venkatesham said, “I thank Puneites for their overwhelming response and support to our innovate policing experiments. It was a great opportunity to serve the needy. I thank the citizens for their feedback on our frequent report of outcomes. Besides, I also thank the committed team of deputy commissioners, police officers and constabulary of city police for making Pune a safe place to live in.” Social activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “The new police commissioner must improve basic policing and constables must be seen on roads. Land mafia has emerged as a single largest threat in Pune. Special attention must be paid to women’s security and safety.

The state transport bus service resumed service for common public without police pass from August 21.At the prominent ST stands like Swargate and Shivajinagar, which is now shifted to Wakdewadi, bus drivers and conductors were struggling to attract passengers.HT visited both the ST stands — Swargate and Shivajinagar — on Friday and noticed that there was not much crowd. Most of the buses were plying half-empty, except for routes like Satara, Kolhapur, Baramati, Solapur and Aurangabad which were running to its capacity.There were no arrangements of sanitisers at any of the stands for the public. Alternate seating arrangements were marked on benches, but people failed to follow safety norms. Social distancing was hardly maintained at any of the ST stands. Some passengers and even drivers were not wearing a face mask.On the other hand, private luxury bus agents were found roaming inside the stands and offering passengers low fares than MSRTC. Some passengers were even willing and taking private buses which were parked outside the ST stand premises, at a distance.“There is lack of safety arrangements at ST stands. If we pay such high fares for Shivneri bus, then the safety of passengers must be priority,” said a passenger Kushal Das travelling to Dadar (Mumbai) from Swargate ST stand.“The decision of plying buses with full capacity is not right. It is risking the lives of passengers. If a Covid positive person is travelling then co-passengers will be at a high risk of getting infected,” he said.“Each bus is sanitised from inside and outside and only then sent on the route. We have also provided sanitiser and face mask to our drivers and conductors on duty. At all the ST stands soon we will make arrangements for sanitisers for the public,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Yamini Joshi.“Yes, private agents are entering our stands to attract passengers, but our on-duty guards are identifying and warning them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/msrtc-buses-fail-to-attract-passengers-in-pune-safety-measures-not-in-place/story-5g0S5xejh4U7hsdPcd9I1L.html

19-09-2020||World||China launches sanctions regime after US moves on TikTok, WeChat||China on Saturday launched a mechanism that would allow it to sanction foreign companies, upping the ante in a tech war with the United States a day after Washington moved to curb popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat.China’s long-expected “unreliable entities list” is seen as a weapon for Beijing to retaliate against the United States, which has used its own “entity list” to shut Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of the US market, while also moving against TikTok and WeChat.Its implementation comes just a day after the US Commerce Department stepped up the pressure by ordering a ban on downloads of video app TikTok and effectively blocking use of WeChat, the Chinese super-app.An announcement by China’s Ministry of Commerce did not mention any specific foreign entities that could be targeted.But it said the new system would consider sanctions on entities whose activities “harm China’s national sovereignty, security, and development interests” or violate “internationally accepted economic and trade rules”.That language closely tracks wording that Beijing has used to repeatedly denounce US actions against Chinese companies.Punitive measures may include fines against the foreign entity, banning it from conducting trade and investment in China, and restrictions on the entry of personnel or equipment into the country.It covers “foreign enterprises, other organisations and individuals”, the ministry said.‘Unreliable’Under Friday’s US order against the Chinese apps, Tencent-owned WeChat would lose functionality in the United States from Sunday. TikTok users will be banned from installing updates but could keep accessing the service through November 12.That timeframe potentially allows for a tie-up between TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, and a US company to safeguard data for the wildly popular app to allay Washington’s security concerns.With President Donald Trump facing a tough re-election campaign, US officials have described the measures as essential to safeguard national security from potential Chinese espionage through the platforms.But in a response to the US steps, China’s Commerce Ministry on Saturday condemned what it called US “bullying”, saying it violated international trade norms and that there was no evidence of any security threat, shortly before announcing the new sanctions regime.Bytedance late Friday asked a US court to block the ban on downloading the TikTok app, asserting that it would respect the security and privacy of American users.The administration’s decision was made “for political reasons rather than because of any ‘unusual and extraordinary threat’ to the United States,” the parent company said in the court filing.It also maintained that the ban violates the right to free speech as well as due process, both enshrined in the US Constitution.Critics added that while the security risks were unclear, the sweeping ban raises concerns about the US government’s ability to regulate free expression.“It’s a mistake to think of this as (only) a sanction on TikTok and WeChat. It’s a serious restriction on the First Amendment rights of US citizens and residents,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Some analysts say Trump’s moves are motivated more by business competition than security concerns.The moves would effectively disable US use of WeChat -- a so-called super-app used for messaging, shopping, payments and other services -- and TikTok from the online marketplaces operated by Apple and Google.After Sunday, services on WeChat will be “degraded”, said a senior US Commerce Department official, who added that existing users may retain some capability.WeChat is widely used among Chinese expats to keep in touch with people back home. A court challenge to the ban by US-based WeChat users is pending.Pressure grows for a dealExisting TikTok users will be able to continue using the app until November 12 -- when it would also face a full ban on its US operations if no deal is reached, according to officials.TikTok’s brand of brief, quirky phone videos has become hugely popular, especially among young people, with 100 million users in the US alone. One potential deal would allow Silicon Valley giant Oracle to become the tech partner for TikTok, but some US lawmakers have objected to allowing ByteDance to keep a stake.Trump said Friday a deal could happen quickly.“For ByteDance, their back is against the wall to accept the terms of the deals outlined over the past few days,” Daniel Ives at Wedbush Securities said in a research note.“We still believe a deal can be reached and this shutdown averted although it’s a critical 48 hours ahead for deal negotiations between all parties involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-sanctions-regime-after-us-moves-on-tiktok-wechat/story-q5R6lWKweeYfrI8pPR5G9I.html
19-09-2020||World||Ginsburg’s death draws big surge of donations to Democrats||Democrats raised more than $31 million in the hours after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, demonstrating how the liberal icon’s passing and the contentious nomination fight that lies ahead have already galvanized the party’s base.The jaw-dropping sum was raised by noon Saturday after news of her death broke late Friday, according to a donation ticker on the website of ActBlue, the party’s online fundraising platform.The 2020 campaign, which will decide control of the White House and the Senate, had already delivered record-shattering fundraising totals for the Democrats, a sign of the motivation within the party to rebuke President Donald Trump on Election Day.But Ginsburg’s death brought new impetus to the campaign, particularly after Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., both pledged to move forward with finding a new justice.That would further tilt the court in a conservative direction, carrying wide-ranging implications for the fate of abortion access, environmental regulations and health care.Democratic challengers to Republican senators were a major recipient of the influx of cash.A group of Democratic strategists raising money through an effort called “Get Mitch or Die Trying,” which shares donations among Democratic Senate contenders, reported that within hours of Ginsburg’s death they nearly doubled what they had previously raised.“In tribute to the extraordinary life of Justice Ginsberg, I’m matching donations to this fund up to $10,000 tonight,” tweeted Grey’s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff.A separate Senate-focused Democratic fundraising push specifically mentions Ginsburg’s legacy.“In this moment it is vital to give to Senate candidates,” reads an ActBlue fundraising page called “Protect RBG’s Legacy”“Time to apply maximum pressure so that they do the right thing & refuse to vote to confirm before the 2020 election.”A representative for ActBlue did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. A spokesman for WinRed, Republican’s ActBlue counterpart, also did not respond to a request for comment.Democrats were not the only ones who raised the specter of the coming Senate nomination fight while raising money.In Iowa, vulnerable Republican Sen. Joni Ernst sent out fundraising pleas shortly after Ginsburg’s death was announced, drawing a swift online backlash.“BREAKING: The future of the Supreme Court is on the line,” read the subject line of fundraising email from Ernst.“Our Conservative values and Constitutional rights are now on the line,” the email said. “The next Supreme Court nominee will shape major decisions for decades to come.”Ernst later issued an apology.“This email never should have gone out,” she said in a statement. “Though I never saw it, it was sent out under my name and I take responsibility for it. Tonight, my prayers are with the family of Justice Ginsburg.”On Saturday, Trump’s campaign also texted out a fundraising solicitation to supporters.“Pres. Trump will fill the Supreme Court vacancy with a conservative justice,” the message read. “Make America Great Again!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ginsburg-s-death-draws-big-surge-of-donations-to-democrats/story-gcxwFq5IPwp2A2fHcvK58H.html
19-09-2020||World||From fumbling in the dark to prescribing the right drugs: Doctors narrate experience in fighting Covid-19||Covid-19 continues to kill close to 1,000 Americans a day. But for those who develop dangerous cases of the infection, advances in medical care and the growing experience of doctors are improving the chances of survival.Since the first case arrived in the US at the start of the year, medical professionals have gone from fumbling in the dark to better understanding which drugs work -- such as steroids and blood thinners, and the antiviral medicine remdesivir. Allocation of intensive medical resources have improved. And doctors have learned to hold off on the use of ventilators for some patients, unlike with many other severe respiratory illnesses.Doctors and experts say that improved medical tactics and earlier treatment are helping improve the outcomes for very sick patients, said Andrew Badley, head of Mayo Clinic’s Covid Research Task Force.“Health-care preparedness today is much better than it was in February and March,” Badley said in an interview. “We have better and more rapid access to diagnosis. We have more knowledge about what drugs to use and what drugs not to use. We have more experimental treatments available. All of those contribute to possible improvements in the mortality rate.”One study looked at 4,689 Covid-19 hospitalizations from March to June in New York, adjusting patients’ mortality rate for factors such as age, race, obesity and any underlying illnesses they might have had. In the first half of March, the mortality rate for hospitalized patients was 23%. By June, it had fallen to 8%. The research hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, a process through which other experts examine the work.Despite the gains, the US will soon pass 200,000 deaths, and tens of thousands of Americans are confirmed infected each day. The number killed by the disease is still in large part a factor of how many are infected in the first place -- the more people who get sick, the more die. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized that a mask is still the best available protection from the virus for most people. And experts warn that the virus is still very dangerous and can kill even seemingly healthy individuals.“Even with these improvements, this is not a benign disease,” said Leora Horwitz, an associate professor of population health and medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine who conducted the New York study of Covid-19 hospitalizations. “This does not mean that coronavirus is now a non-dangerous disease. It remains a very serious threat to public health.”The Right NumberPublic-health officials, epidemiologists, amateur observers and others have watched as the pandemic has unfolded, looking for how to measure the virus’s deadliness. Tallying deaths as a percentage of the greater population sheds light on the scope of the pandemic. Excess mortality compares fatalities to what the death rate is expected to be. But neither method offers insight into whether the virus is becoming more or less deadly for an individual with a severe case.Even looking at deaths per the number of confirmed cases can be misleading as the result is largely a function of testing, experts say. If many mild or asymptomatic cases are captured, mortality rates will be skewed lower. In Europe, for example, there are anecdotal signs of a similar trend, though much of the lower death rate may be because of more cases being found in younger, healthier people. More infections in young people are being found in the US, as well.“You have to understand who you’re testing and then what the real fatality rate is for that demographic,” said Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital.There is even a hypothesis that public health-measures like mask-wearing and distancing can help decrease the amount of virus people are getting infected with, leading to less severe cases because the body isn’t overwhelmed with a large dose of virus at once.“Even though they’re getting infected with the virus, perhaps they are getting less of a dose of the virus and so they’re just getting less sick from it,” Horwitz said.Lessons LearnedIn New York, the first major US city hit hard by the virus, knowledge among doctors was limited as cases poured into emergency rooms this spring. There have been more than 27,000 confirmed and probable Covid-19 deaths in the city, the bulk of them at the peak of the outbreak there in March and April.As the outbreak moved on to other parts of the country, such as Texas, health-care workers had more time to prepare and learn what works.“We kind of had a play book before we even started seeing any patients in Texas,” said Robert Hancock president of Texas College of Emergency Physicians. “We understand the things that work at this point with Covid much better.”Since March, doctors have learned valuable lessons, not only about how to ensure hospitals don’t run out of ICU beds and ventilators, but also that flipping a patient onto their stomach, known as prone positioning, can help. Giving patients steroids early on and treating them with blood thinners can also improve someone’s prognosis.“Now that we know that we might need to start these patients on blood thinners and Heparin pretty quickly, that’s helping,” said Diana L. Fite, president of the Texas Medical Association. “A lot of these deaths from Covid are because of the blood coagulation; the blood clots ruin their organs.”Though there is still no cure for the coronavirus, all of the improvements in treatment and preventative measures combined contributes toward an improved prognosis for patients, Fite said. In Texas, there have been at least 14,590 deaths from the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.“Even if these things aren’t cures, they help a small percentage do better,” Fite said. “You add several of those things up and you’ve got a better outcome overall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-fumbling-in-the-dark-to-prescribing-the-right-drugs-doctors-narrate-experience-in-fighting-covid-19/story-6whC4iYJYWS1QK4KhEqHhO.html
19-09-2020||World||How Ginsburg’s death could reshape the presidential campaign||A presidential campaign that was already tugging at the nation’s most searing divides has been jolted by the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, potentially reshaping the election at a moment when some Americans were beginning to cast ballots.For months, the contest has largely centered on President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, the biggest public health crisis in a century that has badly damaged his prospects for reelection as the US death toll nears 200,000 people.But in a flash, Ginsburg’s death on Friday added new weight to the election, with the potential that Trump or his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, could pick a successor who could decide abortion access, environmental regulations and the power of the presidency for a generation.With early voting underway in five states and Election Day just over six weeks away, Democrats and Republicans were largely unified late Friday in praising Ginsburg as a leading legal thinker and advocate for women’s rights. But strategists in both parties also seized on the moment to find an advantage.Facing the prospect of losing both the White House and the Senate, some Republicans viewed the Supreme Court vacancy as one of the few avenues remaining for Trump to galvanize supporters beyond his most loyal core of supporters, particularly suburban women who have abandoned the GOP in recent years.“It’s hard to see how this doesn’t help Trump politically,” said veteran Republican strategist Alex Conant. “Biden wants this election to be a referendum on Trump. Now it’s going to be a referendum on whoever he nominates to the Supreme Court.”Multiple Republicans close to the White House believe that Trump will likely nominate a woman, who could serve as a counterweight of sorts to Biden’s choice of running mate Kamala Harris, who would be the first woman to serve as vice president.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledged to quickly bring to a vote whomever Trump nominates. But he faces potential division within his own ranks, including from Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. Collins and Gardner are in particularly tight races for reelection this fall.That’s fueling optimism among Democrats that the vacancy could drive home the significance of the election to their base.“The implications for Senate races could be profound,” said Democratic strategist Bill Burton.“The presidential race will see some immediate churn as activists on both sides will be newly energized,” he continued. “The persistent question will be whether huge protests around the Capitol and the country will inflame such vigorous energy that it leads to awful clashes.”McConnell, in a note to his GOP colleagues Friday night, urged them to “keep their powder dry” and not rush to declare a position on whether a Trump nominee should get a vote this year. “This is not the time to prematurely lock yourselves into a position you may later regret,” he said.Biden, who has already pledged to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, told reporters late Friday that “voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider.”Democrats are enraged by McConnell’s pledge to move forward, especially after he blocked President Barack Obama from appointing a justice to replace Antonin Scalia nine months before the 2016 election. That decision cast a long political shadow, prompting Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who mounted a spirited bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, to make expansion of the Supreme Court a centerpiece of his campaign. Biden rejected the idea.Some Democrats privately concede that the Supreme Court vacancy could shift attention away from the virus, which has been a central element of Biden’s campaign.Trump took the unprecedented step in 2016 of releasing a list of Supreme Court picks before he was elected, a move that was credited with unifying skeptical conservative voters to unite behind him. Republicans also believe that the high-profile debate over Trump’s last Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, helped the GOP retain the Senate during the 2018 midterms, when the party lost control of the House.The president, seeking to build the same type of energy that surrounded his 2016 bid, released another list of potential Supreme Court nominees last week.But some Democrats said the political environment is already overheated, with partisan divides over everything from wearing a mask to curb the pandemic to addressing climate change. Ginsburg’s death, they say, may not change that.“It’s already pretty ugly out there,” said Megan Jones, a Democratic strategist who worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. “I do not know how this does not become a fight of epic proportions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-ginsburg-s-death-could-reshape-the-presidential-campaign/story-6E1RxqL4AJjXeIgAkY5BFM.html
19-09-2020||World||TikTok files complaint against Trump administration to try to block US ban||Popular video-sharing app TikTok has asked a US judge to block the Trump administration from enforcing a ban on the Chinese social media network, according to court documents filed late on Friday.TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., filed a complaint in a Washington federal court challenging the recent prohibitory moves by the Trump administration. The US Commerce Department announced a ban on Friday blocking people in the United States from downloading Chinese-owned messaging app WeChat and TikTok starting Sept. 20. The ban was being introduced for political reasons, TikTok and ByteDance alleged in their complaint. TikTok also said the ban would violate the company’s First Amendment rights. US President Donald Trump, who has been locked in a long-running trade dispute with China, issued an executive order on Aug. 6 that prohibited US transactions with the Chinese owners of messaging app WeChat and TikTok. Both ByteDance and TikTok are seeking a “declaratory” judgment and an order “invalidating and preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Prohibitions and the August 6 order,” according to the complaint. The White House did not immediately respond when Reuters contacted it for comment early on Saturday. TikTok, which has over 100 million users in the United States, said the ban would “irreversibly destroy the TikTok business in the US.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-files-complaint-against-trump-administration-to-try-to-block-us-ban/story-mqPqXFokXx1eoA40bMjBSP.html

Her death gives Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, a chance to expand the court’s conservative majority to 6-3 at a time of a gaping political divide in America.Democrats are still seething over the Republican Senate’s refusal to act on Democratic President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, in 2016 after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died 10 months before that election. McConnell in 2016 said the Senate should not act on a court nominee during an election year, a stance he has since reversed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-this-obligation-trump-says-he-will-name-successor-to-ginsburg-soon/story-OYGREdypNb772mhIB91jBP.html

The BGB officials ahead of the meeting had highlighted the rise in the number of deaths on the border, but BSF maintained that it only “fires with non-lethal weapons only in self-defence when they are surrounded by a large number of armed miscreants.”BSF also stated that the “death or apprehension of criminals on the border are irrespective of nationalities.”BGB Director General (DG) major general Md Shafeenul Islam also assured BSF DG Rakesh Asthana that both the forces will work together to check the rise and activities of insurgent groups of India and share realtime information on drug trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling of fake Indian currency notes and damaging of the Indo-Bangladesh border.BGB Director General Islam also took up the issue of mentally challenged persons crossing into Bangladesh. Asthana assured him that a detailed SOP will be released to deal with this issue.This was the 50th border coordination conference between both nations. During the conference, both sides lauded each other for their efforts to improve mutual relations through Confidence Building Measures (CBMs). These Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) will resume once the situation around the coronavirus pandemic becomes normal.The next conference between the BSF and the BGB will be held in India, according to the press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bsf-and-bgb-to-work-together-to-reduce-number-of-border-killings/story-gbz3zJx0aU5hzsbGYyzFmM.html
19-09-2020||World||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gears up to tackle second wave||The Boris Johnson government is considering imposing another nationwide lockdown after the UK reported a fresh surge of Covid-19 cases - 4,322 coronavirus infections were recorded on Friday - with experts and ministers huddled in meetings over the weekend amid growing ire over steps taken to stop the spread of the virus.Johnson admitted major challenges in providing tests and saw a second wave coming after similar spikes in cases were reported in other European countries as well. Experts want more stringent measures in place sooner than later. Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, whose modelling had influenced the decision to impose the first lockdown earlier this year, said on Saturday the UK is now facing a “perfect storm” due to the easing of some of the curbs in recent months, and called for quick action.Day-rise figures have been in the thousands in September after similar figures in the hundreds in July and August. There are local restrictions in north England and the Midlands, where the increase in infections is alarmingly prominent. From Monday, gatherings on more than six people have been banned.Also Read: UK to launch new Covid curbs, not ruling out national lockdownSpeaking during a visit to Oxfordshire, Prime Minister Johnson said, “We are now seeing a second wave coming in. We’ve seen it in France, in Spain, across Europe. It’s been absolutely inevitable, I’m afraid, that we would see it in this country.“We want to keep the schools open - that’s going to happen. And we’ll try and keep all parts of the economy open, as far as we possibly can. I don’t think anybody wants to go into a second lockdown.”The UK PM said, “Clearly, when you look at what is happening, you’ve got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday. We’ll be looking at the local lockdowns we’ve got in large parts of the country now and see what we can do to intensify things.”New measures that could mean another lockdown are due to be announced on Monday or Tuesday, after the opposition Labour joined experts to call for swift action to stop the spread of coronavirus.Labour leader Keir Starmer said, “I am deeply concerned about the sharp rise in coronavirus cases and the difficulties people across the country are facing in getting a test… This is the time for swift, decisive national action. We cannot afford to be too slow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-gears-up-to-tackle-second-wave/story-lqS662Sv0S1l3ilUOEA81O.html

19-09-2020||World||When will Covid-19 vaccines be generally available in the US?||US President Donald Trump and the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week disagreed about when a Covid-19 vaccine would become widely available. Trump said on Friday that enough vaccine would be available for every American by April, while the CDC director said vaccines were likely to reach the general public around mid-2021, an assessment more in line with most experts.What does it mean for a vaccine to be generally available?General availability is when every American who wants the vaccine can get it. There are currently no Covid-19 vaccines approved by US regulators, although a handful are in late-stage trials to prove they are safe and effective.Experts estimate that at least 70% of roughly 330 million Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as herd immunity, which occurs when enough people are immune to prevent the spread of the virus to those unable to get a vaccine.How long before vaccine production is fully ramped up?Most vaccines in development will require two doses per person.The CDC anticipates that 35 million to 45 million doses of vaccines from the first two companies to receive authorization will be available in the United States by the end of this year. The current front runners are Pfizer Inc . Drugmakers have been more ambitious with their calculations. AstraZeneca Plc has said it could deliver as many as 300 million doses of its experimental vaccine in the United States by as early as October. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE have said they expect to have 100 million doses available worldwide by the end of 2020, but did not specify how much of that was earmarked for the United States. Moderna on Friday said it is on track to make around 20 million doses by the end of the year and between 500 million and 1 billion doses a year beginning in 2021.Obtaining enough doses to inoculate everyone in the United States will likely take until later in 2021. CDC Director Robert Redfield told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that vaccines may not be widely available to everyone in the United States until the second or third quarter of next year. Who would get an approved vaccine first?The CDC decision will likely broadly follow recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.The CDC has said the earliest inoculations may go to healthcare workers, people at increased risk for severe Covid-19, and essential workers.It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children as major drugmakers have yet to include them in late-stage trials. Pfizer and BioNTech have filed with regulators seeking to start recruiting volunteers as young as 16 for vaccine studies.Which companies will likely roll out a vaccine quickly?Pfizer has said it could have compelling evidence that its vaccine works by the end of October. Moderna says it could have similar evidence in November. The vaccines would first need to be approved or authorized for emergency use by US regulators.Drugmakers have already started manufacturing supplies of their vaccine candidates to be ready as soon as they get the go ahead. The US Department of Defense and the CDC plan to start distribution of vaccines within 24 hours of regulatory authorization.Several drugmakers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc have all said they expect to produce at least 1 billion doses of their vaccines next year if they get regulatory authorization. Sanofi SA and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are also working on developing a vaccine they say could be authorized next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-covid-19-vaccines-be-generally-available-in-the-us/story-aABuiSK2rQLHvxXpJZ2nYJ.html
19-09-2020||World||Police: 2 dead, 14 wounded at party in Rochester, New York||Two people died and 14 others were wounded at a backyard party in Rochester, New York, early Saturday, police said.The deaths included a male and a female, both between the ages of 18 and 22, Interim Police Chief Mark Simmons told reporters. The 14 wounded people were taken to a two different hospitals. Simmons said none of them were believed to have life-threatening injuries.“This is truly a tragedy of epic proportions,” Simmons said near the crime scene, which appeared to stretch at least a block.The shooting comes as the city’s police department has been rocked by the suffocation death of Daniel Prude.Video taken in March and made public by Prude’s family Sept. 4 shows Prude handcuffed and naked with a spit hood over his head as an officer pushes his face against the street while another officer presses a knee to his back. The officers held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He was taken off life support a week later.On Monday, Mayor Lovely Warren fired Police Chief La’Ron Singletary, who she said initially misled her about the circumstances of Prude’s death.The fatal shooting early Saturday did not appear to be linked to the March death.Officers responded to calls of shots fired and found “approximately 100 people” running from the scene, Simmons said. Before the call, police were not aware of the party, he said.“This is yet another tragedy where individuals are having these illegal, unsanctioned house parties taking place in these properties, which — number one — is not safe because of Covid, because of the conditions. And then you add in alcohol and violence and it just becomes a recipe for disaster,” Simmons said.The interim chief said no suspects were in custody, adding that it’s too early to tell whether there were multiple shooters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-2-dead-14-wounded-at-party-in-rochester-new-york/story-6UBzRUUSwyZ1Hcr9k7BL6H.html
19-09-2020||World||Comic book on Kamala Harris to be released a day after her birthday||A day after her birthday, Kamala Harris is getting her own comic book, chronicling her path from childhood to her historic nomination as US vice president.“Female Force: Kamala Harris,” part of Tidalwave Productions’ Political Power series, is set for release on Oct. 21, a day after she turns 56. That is less than two weeks before the Nov. 3 US election.The publisher on its website describes Harris as “full of grit and determination,” and says that her “no-nonsense approach and bi-racial heritage have made her a popular member of the Democratic party.”The story begins with her birth in California to Indian biologist Shyamala Gopalan and Jamaican economics professor Donald Harris, and follows her path to becoming the second female African-American and first Asian-American US senator.A dramatic moment in the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination contest is featured, when Harris confronts front-runner Joe Biden in a debate about his work with segregationists in the US Senate to oppose school busing - the practice of transporting students to different school districts to improve racial integration.“There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day,” Harris declares. “And that little girl was me.”In a well-known plot twist, Biden clinches the Democratic nomination but names Harris as his running mate.Other political figures featured in the comic series include US President Donald Trump; Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 election; and 2008 US Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-star-in-new-comic-book-to-be-released-a-day-after-birthday/story-hmp0Zwr0BLMtOqayL3BMYK.html

According to the US-based Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tally, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Canada has surpassed 144,000, while the disease has claimed at least 9,250 lives.Erin O’Toole, leader of Canada’s principal opposition Conservative Party, has gone into self-isolation along with family members after a member his staff tested positive for Covid-19. Also in quarantine was Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, the second largest opposition group in the House of Commons, after he tested positive along with his wife. Several MPs from his party have gone into self-isolation as a precautionary measure. The Canadian parliament is scheduled to meet on September 23. The upcoming sitting is set to feature a Throne Speech from the country’s governor general that is expected to outline an ambitious agenda for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government. Trudeau has already sought virtual voting in the House so that legislative business can continue even as many MPs are unable to attend sessions in Ottawa in person.As cases surged, Tina Namiesniowski, the president of the Public Health Agency of Canada, has announced her resignation even as authorities responsible for dealing with the pandemic have increasingly come under criticism for their failure to control the spread of the disease.While not yet declaring a second wave, Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has warned that the “ongoing increase in the national daily case count is an indicator of accelerated epidemic growth”. She said in a statement, “This situation increases the likelihood that we could lose the ability to keep Covid-19 cases at manageable levels.”Several provinces have been reporting a spike in cases, including Ontario, where over 400 new infections - the highest since June - have been recorded after the daily case count had dropped to under 100 last month. British Columbia reported an all-time high of 179 Covid-19 cases on Friday, forcing the authorities to bring back some of the restrictions in Toronto, including limiting indoor gatherings to 10 and outdoor gatherings to 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-oppn-leaders-self-isolate-as-canada-sees-fresh-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-WFoUxzI3xEYfuJRSgE06TJ.html
19-09-2020||World||Joe Biden says presidential winner should pick Ginsburg replacement||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said on Friday that “there is no doubt” that the winner of November’s presidential election should pick Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s replacement.“There is no doubt - let me be clear - that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,” Biden told reporters after learning of Ginsburg’s death.Biden’s remarks appear to set the stage for a partisan fight over the judiciary that could dominate the fewer than seven weeks remaining until the Nov. 3 presidential election.Ginsburg, a stalwart liberal on the Supreme Court since 1993, died on Friday at age 87, giving President Donald Trump a narrow window in which to expand the court’s conservative majority with a third appointment during a tough re-election fight.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he intends to act on any nomination Trump makes. Biden’s comments signal he and the party will fight such a move.McConnell’s stance reverses the position he took four years ago, when he refused to act on Democratic President Barack Obama’s election-year nomination of centrist appeals court judge Merrick Garland to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Some Democrats accused McConnell and his fellow Republicans of “stealing” a Supreme Court seat by blocking Garland’s appointment. Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, has said he wished Democrats had been “a whole heck of a lot harder” on McConnell during that fight. McConnell’s explained his position in a statement on Friday, saying that in 2016 the Senate and White House were controlled by different parties, while now they are both controlled by Republicans. Democrats have called McConnell’s about-face hypocrisy.The Democratic former vice president learned of Ginsburg’s death while flying home from a campaign trip in Minnesota and he delivered brief remarks to reporters at an airport in New Castle, Del., without taking questions. As a senator, Biden presided over Ginsburg’s confirmation hearings for the job in 1993.“Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us,” Biden said. “She has been absolutely consistent and reliable and a voice for freedom and opportunity for everyone.”Ginsburg’s death could dramatically alter the ideological balance of the court, which already had a 5-4 conservative majority, moving it further to the right. The issue thrust courts into the center of an election that had been dominated by the coronavirus and its public health and economic consequences.Trump on Sept. 9 unveiled a list of potential nominees to fill any future Supreme Court vacancies in a move aimed at bolstering support among conservative voters. Biden has pledged to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court but so far has resisted unveiling his own list of nominees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-presidential-winner-should-pick-ginsburg-replacement/story-tCiZQolQsiJu2HU4dwvJzN.html
19-09-2020||World||McConnell vows quick vote on next justice; Joe Biden says wait||The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just six weeks before the election cast an immediate spotlight on the crucial high court vacancy, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly vowing to bring to a vote whoever President Donald Trump nominates.Democratic nominee Joe Biden vigorously disagreed, declaring that “voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider.”McConnell, who sets the calendar in the U.S. Senate and has made judicial appointments his priority, declared unequivocally in a statement not long after Ginsburg’s death was announced that Trump’s nominee would receive a confirmation vote in the chamber. In 2016, McConnell refused to consider President Barack Obama’s choice for the high court months ahead of the election, eventually preventing a vote.The impending clash over the vacant seat — when to fill it and with whom — is sure to significantly affect the stretch run of the presidential race, further stirring passions in a nation already reeling from the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people, left millions unemployed and heightened partisan tensions and anger.Trump, in brief remarks to reporters after learning of Ginsburg’s death, called her “an amazing woman who led an amazing life.” He had continued with a campaign speech in Minnesota for about an hour and a half after the nation — as well as aides and many in his audience with cell phones — had learned of her death. He seemed surprised when he spoke with reporters afterward, saying he did not know she had died.Trump had noted in his rally speech that the next presidential term could offer him as many as four appointments to the nine-member court, whose members are confirmed for life. “This is going to be the most important election in the history of our country and we have to get it right,” he added.Biden, returning to Delaware from his own campaign stop in Minnesota, praised Ginsburg upon his arrival.She was “not only a giant of the legal profession but a beloved figure,” he said. She “stood for all of us.”It must be up to the next president, whether himself or Trump, to choose a successor to be submitted for Senate confirmation, Biden said.“This was the position that the Republican Senate took in 2016, when there were nearly nine months before the election,” he said. “That is the position the United States Senate must take now, when the election is less than two months away. We are talking about the Constitution and the Supreme Court. That institution should not be subject to politics.A confirmation vote in the Senate is not guaranteed, even with a Republican majority.Typically it takes several months to vet and hold hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, and time is short ahead of the election. Key senators may be reluctant to cast votes so close to the election. With a slim GOP majority, 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, Trump’s choice could afford to lose only a few.McConnell did not specify the timing, but trying for confirmation in a post-election lame-duck session if Trump had lost to Biden or Republicans had lost the Senate would carry further political complications.Democrats immediate denounced McConnell’s move as hypocritical, pointing out that he refused to call hearings for Merrick Garland, Obama’s pick, 237 days before the 2016 election. The 2020 election is 46 days away.Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, in a tweet, echoed word for word what McConnell said in 2016 about the Garland nomination: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.”Both Trump and McConnell have pointed to appointments to the federal judiciary, including two Supreme Court justices, part of their legacy. Trump said last month that he would “absolutely” try to fill a vacancy if one came up before the end of his first term.“I would move quickly, ” Trump said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “Why not? I mean, they would. The Democrats would if they were in this position.”While plans were still being formalized, Trump was expected to announce a choice sooner rather than later and may meet with members of his short list in coming days, according to a White House official not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.Trump last week added 20 names to his list of candidates he’s pledged to choose from if he has future vacancies to fill. He contrasted his list with unnamed “radical justices” he claimed Biden would nominate who would “fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress.”Trump released a similar list in 2016 in a bid to win over conservative and evangelical voters who had doubts about his conservative credentials. Among those on his current list: Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, former Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, long a favorite of conservatives.The average number of days to confirm a justice, according to the Congressional Research Service, is 69, which would be after the election. But some Republicans quickly noted that Ginsburg was confirmed in just 42 days.Four GOP defections could defeat a nomination, while a tie vote could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence.Among the senators to watch are Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and others.Collins is in a tight race for her own reelection, as are several other GOP senators, including Cory Gardner in Colorado. Murkowski and Romney have been critical of Trump and protective of the institution of the Senate.Some Republicans, including Collins and Murkowski, have suggested previously that hearings should wait if a seat were to open. And because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as November 30 — which would narrow the window for McConnell if the Democratic candidate, Mark Kelly, hangs onto his lead.Under McConnell, the Senate changed the confirmation rules to allow for a simple majority. The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Thune, supported McConnell’s plan Friday night, though the Judiciary Commitee chairman, Lindsey Graham, did not weigh in.As a mourning crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court and tributes poured in, Obama hailed Ginsburg’s life and called for Republicans to wait, saying “a basic principle of the law – and of everyday fairness – is that we apply rules with consistency and not based on what’s convenient or advantageous in the moment.”One difference from 2016 is that, despite the vacancy resulting from Ginsburg’s death, conservatives have a working majority of five justices on a range of issues. When Antonin Scalia died four years ago, the court was divided between four liberals and four conservatives.However, the next pick could shape important decisions, including on abortion rights, as well as any legal challenges that may stem from the 2020 election. The 2018 hearings on Trump’s second pick, now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, turned into a bitter partisan battle after sexual assault allegations were made.Biden has promised to nominate a Black woman to the high court if given the chance. He has said he’s also working on a list of potential nominees, but the campaign has given no indication that it will release names before the election.Democrats believe doing so would unnecessarily distract from Biden’s focus on Trump’s handling of the pandemic and the economy, while also giving the president and his allies fresh targets to attack. In the hours before Ginsburg’s death, Trump trailed Biden in national polling but the race was much tighter in battleground states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-presidential-winner-should-pick-ginsburg-replacement/story-Ckx225qRvuAPD4v2gsGBJP.html

China claims the island as its own territory.Lee was president from 1988 to 2000.Lee’s greatest act of defiance was becoming Taiwan’s first democratically-elected president in March 1996, achieved with a landslide following eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send a carrier task force to the area in a warning to the Beijing government.On Friday, China carried out drills in the Taiwan Strait, including sending 18 fighter jets to buzz the island, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei, there for Lee’s memorial.Speaking at the memorial service in a chapel at a Taipei university, President Tsai Ing-wen said he had shaped the Taiwan of today.“Confronted with daunting international challenges, he skilfully led the people of Taiwan by promoting pragmatic diplomacy. Taiwan became synonymous with democracy and was catapulted onto the world stage. Because of this, President Lee came to be lauded as Mr. Democracy,” Tsai said.“Thanks to his efforts, Taiwan now shines as a beacon of democracy.”Lee, a committed Christian, died in July aged 97.U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach and former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori also attended his memorial.Lee’s remains will be interred at a military cemetery next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-shadow-of-china-war-games-taiwan-bids-farewell-to-mr-democracy/story-SM3JY0IdmzIggHtatkV2WN.html

A successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives, it will put an end to restrictions,” the President said.“All vaccine candidates are going through the gold standard of clinical trials with a heavy emphasis on safety,” he stressed.As part of Operation Warp Speed, initiated by the Trump administration to facilitate and accelerate the development of Covid-19 vaccines, Trump said all of the most promising vaccine candidates are being manufactured in advance.“Vaccine development is our top priority and we are moving forward swiftly with great success. When a vaccine is approved, it will be distributed within 24 hours,” he further said.According to the latest data by Johns Hopkins University, the US remains the worst-affected country by the Covid-19 pandemic and has 6,705,114 cases and 198,197 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expect-to-have-enough-covid-19-vaccines-for-every-american-by-april-2021-donald-trump/story-KFlfCA0jBU02jqfUrJUXJL.html
19-09-2020||World||Chinese jets enter Taiwan airspace||The Chinese military sent 18 planes, including fighter jets, over the Taiwan Strait in an unusually large show of force on Friday as a senior US envoy held a day of closed-door meetings on the self-governing island claimed by China.Chinese fighter jets appeared in Taiwanese airspace from four directions, media reports from Taipei said, as Beijing launched maritime and airspace drills near the island on Friday, leading Taiwan to scramble its own warplanes. Taiwan’s defence ministry said two bombers and 16 fighter jets from China crossed into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. The “real combat” drills come as Keith Krach, US undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and environment, arrived in Taiwan on Thursday, and will attend the memorial service for former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday. Lee, who died in July, is known on the mainland as the “godfather of Taiwan secessionism”. “We sent the delegation to a funeral and the Chinese have apparently responded by military blustering. I’ll leave it at that,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo told reporters during a visit to Guyana.Krach’s visit comes within a month of US secretary of health and human services Alex Azar’s trip to Taiwan as Washington and Taipei warm up ties, much to the anger of Beijing. In Beijing, defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said “those who play with fire will get burnt”, as he announced the drills. He said the exercises were a “necessary move aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity”. He accused the US and Taiwan of “stepping up collusion, frequently causing disturbances” without directly referring to Krach’s visit.Reiterating that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, Ren said the Taiwan question is purely China’s internal affair. Commenting on Krach’s visit, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Friday that China has the firm will to thwart external interference and secessionist acts in Taiwan.The US official held talks with Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs and the cabinet’s vice premier. He is scheduled to meet Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen for dinner at her official residence.Beijing has ramped up military activity near Taiwan in recent months and have conducted several exercises in the region.In June, Taipei scrambled jets in response to warn off the aircraft from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force, which had deployed fighter aircraft across the Taiwan Strait hours after a US transport plane flew over the island.In August, Beijing conducted exercises near the island, which coincided with health secretary Azar’s visit.The US is also preparing to sell seven tranches of weapons systems to Taiwan, the CNN reported on Thursday, quoting a US official. The US, like India and the majority of other countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, though the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 allows Washington to sell arms to the island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-jets-enter-taiwan-airspace/story-565y3fMRsftHZV0Vz8MQYO.html
19-09-2020||World||Europe battles Covid-19 surge as cases top 30 million globally||Much of Europe braced for new curbs against Covid-19 after the World Health Organization warned of “alarming rates of transmission” in the continent, even as global infections topped 30 million.Britain is limiting gatherings and France is set to roll out new curbs for major cities as governments across the region are battling fresh spikes of the disease. The Madrid region of Spain, witnessing an explosion of cases, said on Friday it was placing a partial lockdown on roughly 13% of the population.More than 947,000 people have now died from Covid-19, with Europe accounting for more than 200,000. WHO’s Europe director Hans Kluge said a surge seen this month “should serve as a wake-up call” after the continent recorded 54,000 infections in a single day last week.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicFrench authorities are preparing tighter restrictions in several cities to curtail a resurgence that has seen nearly 10,000 new cases per day in the past week. UK health secretary Matt Hancock said another national lockdown was not being ruled out, as the number of new cases accelerated in recent days. New curbs, called “circuit break” are likely next week targeting restaurants, pubs and hospitality areas, which could be shut or asked to close early for some weeks. Parts of north England have already been placed under new curbs.“This is a big moment for the country. We are seeing an acceleration in the number of cases,” Hancock told BBC radio. Asked if he was considering a new national lockdown, he said, “I have learned over the last nine months not ever to rule anything out. However, it is not the proposal that’s on the table.”Europe is still hoping not to follow the example of Israel, which entered a second nationwide lockdown on Friday at the onset of the Jewish high-holiday season, following a jump in new coronavirus cases.Iranian officials, meanwhile, said the country may be entering a third wave of infections, after 144 deaths and 3,049 new cases were recorded in past 24 hours.One-hour Covid test is accurate, finds studyA Covid-19 test known as DnaNudge that gives results in just over an hour and requires no lab was accurate in almost all cases, according to an academic review in The Lancet. The test, based on the design of a DNA test developed by a professor at Imperial College London, received approval for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in April after successful trials.In a study in The Lancet Microbe, the test was found to have an average sensitivity - ability to correctly identify those with Covid-19 - of 94.4% and a specificity - correctly identifying those without the disease - of 100%.Moderna targets 20mn vaccine doses by year endUS drug firm Moderna said on Friday it was on track to produce 20 million doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, while maintaining its goal of readying 500mn to 1 billion doses in 2021.Moderna had enrolled 25,296 participants out of a planned 30,000 in its late-stage study as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-battles-covid-19-surge-as-cases-top-30-million-globally/story-pCtuM8iOjQs1PiKCw0ae6O.html
19-09-2020||World||Facebook set to tighten rules on what its staff can discuss||Facebook has announced it will soon update the policies on its internal employee discussion platform and impose restrictions on their ability to debate social and political issues, a move that comes amid growing questions about how the social media company tackles problematic content on its main service for the public.The move comes days after employees have spoken up on Facebook’s internal discussion boards against the company’s policies, especially since charges of political bias emerged against Facebook India executives who are accused of favouring the ruling political party.A company spokesman said CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his plans for the curbs to employees on Thursday, with details of the new rules to be announced next week, according to Reuters. “What we’ve heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,” spokesman Joe Osborne said. Osborne said the rules will apply to employee discussions of how executives handle politically sensitive content on FB’s platforms.Conversation flows freely on Workplace, an internal social network that resembles Facebook’s namesake platform. As staffers have become vocal about their disagreements with Zuckerberg, statements posted on Workplace have leaked to the press.At least three employees HT spoke to said they were worried that Facebook was monitoring their devices and scrutinising their comments on the internal messaging system. “Instead of setting standards by focusing on problematic content, we are being monitored,” a US-based employee told HT.Two Facebook India employees said the company is monitoring gadgets and apps used by employees. “We all sign a confidentiality clause when we join, but we are now under increased surveillance,” one employee said. Another said, “All official emails are under the scanner, as are our official mobile phones. It is not safe to even send text messages using WhatsApp because that too is owned by FB.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-set-to-tighten-rules-on-what-its-staff-can-discuss/story-XHaNoTDU9QdkRgA54pNqQK.html
19-09-2020||World||US sends troops, armoured vehicles to Syria to counter Russia||The US has deployed additional troops and armored vehicles into eastern Syria after a number of clashes with Russian forces, including a recent vehicle collision that injured four American service members. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for US Central Command, said the US has also sent in radar systems and increased fighter jet patrols over the region to better protect American and coalition forces. “The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation in Syria, but will defend Coalition forces if necessary,” said Urban.Also read: Russia, US should help each other during pandemic: Kremlin A senior US official said a half-dozen Bradley fighting vehicles and fewer than 100 additional troops were sent in to eastern Syria. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the military move, said the reinforcements are meant to be a clear signal to Russia to avoid any more unsafe and provocative actions against the US and its allies there. There have been a number of escalating incidents this year between US and Russian forces who patrol in eastern Syria. The most serious was last month, when officials said Russian vehicles sideswiped an light-armoured US military vehicle, injuring four Americans. A US official said at the time that two Russian helicopters also flew above the Americans, and one of the aircraft was within about 70 feet (20 meters) of the vehicle. The deployment of the armoured vehicles was first reported by NBC News. Russia, which backs the Syrian government, has long opposed American presence in the country. The Russian Defense Ministry blamed the US for the vehicle collision.Also read: US officials say Russia is spreading virus disinformation The ministry said Russia had notified the US-led coalition about the Russian military police convoy’s route and said the U.S tried to block the Russian patrol. The four American service members injured in the crash received concussions. US troops are usually accompanied by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces on the patrols, and they have stayed in the region to root out remaining Islamic State insurgents. The crash last month took place near Dayrick, in northeast Syria, where Russian troops should generally not be present. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the US patrol left the area “to deescalate the situation.” While there have been several other recent incidents between the American and Russian troops in eastern Syria, officials have described the August crash as the most concerning. This is the second time that Bradleys have been sent into Syria. They were used last October in operations with US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in missions to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State group and protect oil fields in that area. The Bradley units are from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armoured Division, based at Fort Bliss, Texas. “The mechanised infantry assets will help ensure the force protection of coalition forces in an increasingly complex operating environment in northeast Syria,” said Col. Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the US-led coalition. “The Coalition forces remain steadfast in our commitment of ensuring the enduring defeat of Daesh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sends-troops-armoured-vehicles-to-syria-to-counter-russia/story-luWrorXF737LyOezzOVmoI.html
19-09-2020||World||US House condemns racism against Asian-Americans amid Covid-19 pandemic||The House has voted to condemn racism against Asian Americans tied to the coronavirus outbreak, approving a Democratic resolution on a mostly party-line vote. Republicans called the legislation an election-year effort to criticise President Donald Trump and “woke culture on steroids.” The resolution, approved 243-164, on Thursday calls on all public officials to condemn anti-Asia sentiment and to investigate hate crimes after a rise in aggression and violence from those blaming people of Asian descent for the pandemic. The measure does not name Trump but notes inflammatory terms used by him and other Republicans — including “Chinese Virus,” “Wuhan Virus,” and “Kung flu” — and says they have perpetuated an anti-Asian stigma.Also read: Trump downplaying Covid-19 is historic national tragedy, says Nancy PelosiHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that “at the same time that the coronavirus pandemic is broken out, so too has a disturbing epidemic of hate and discrimination” against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants, including physical and verbal attacks and vandalised businesses. She blamed Trump for trying to divert attention from Russia’s meddling in elections to demonise China. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., called Republican opposition to the resolution “disgraceful.” “The president is fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants,” Takano said. Trump has often used the term “kung flu” on the campaign trail as he has tried to turn focus to the virus’s origins in China amid criticism of his response to the pandemic.Republicans said Trump was turning his ire toward China’s government and not Asian Americans. Trump in March insisted that Asian Americans were “amazing people” and not at fault for spreading the virus.Several House Republicans spoke against the resolution. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said it was “just another opportunity to attack the president.” Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs called it “woke culture on steroids.” Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said it was “ridiculous” and a “waste of time” as the House was about to adjourn for the week and Democrats and the White House have so far failed to agree on additional coronavirus relief.Also read: Former Pence aide who helped organise White House Covid-19 response backs Biden“At the heart of this resolution is the absurd notion that referring to the virus as a Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian Americans, which I will tell you no one on this side of the aisle supports,” McCarthy said.Still, 14 Republicans voted with Democrats in favor of the resolution, many of whom are retiring or in competitive races in November: Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, Washington Rep. Jamie Herrera Butler, Texas Rep. Will Hurd, New York Rep. John Katko, Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, Florida Rep. Daniel Webster and Georgia Rep. Robert Woodall.Anti-discrimination groups have reported hundreds of actions against Asian Americans, especially in the early days of the outbreak. Even before cities began shutting down all restaurants to stop the spread of the virus, Chinese restaurant owners were experiencing steep declines in business because of racial stigma.Asked in March why he called the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” Trump told reporters at the White House that he doesn’t consider it a racist remark. “It’s not racist at all,” Trump said, adding that he calls it the “Chinese virus” because he wants to be accurate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-condemns-racism-against-asian-americans-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-5oiPbYq9XGwgR8OOsnPsNL.html
19-09-2020||World||Ginsburg’s death gives Donald Trump chance to add Justice to high court||The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday gives President Donald Trump an opportunity to try to fill her seat -- and potentially cement a rightward tilt of the Supreme Court for a generation -- less than two months before Election Day.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously said the Senate would act to fill a vacancy if one occurred this year, even though he spent most of 2016 denying a confirmation hearing to President Barack Obama’s pick to fill a vacancy on the high court.McConnell would need to find 50 senators willing to back a pick put forward by Trump. With 53 Republicans, they can afford to lose 3 senators and still confirm a pick with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote.“We would fill it,” McConnell told Fox News in February. McConnell said then that the difference between 2016 was that the Senate and the White House were held by different parties.Trump had not yet been informed of Ginsburg’s death, but Vice President Mike Pence was, according to people familiar with the situatoinOn Friday night, Democrats quickly demanded that any move to replace Ginsburg be left for the next president.“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet.Days before she died, Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter, NPR reported, saying, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”McConnell’s office hasn’t responded to questions about whether he will act before the election, but members of his leadership team, including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, have said they expect he would try to confirm someone before the elections if there is a vacancy.Trump released a new list of potential appointees earlier this month -- revisiting a tactic he used in 2016 to galvanize support among conservatives and evangelicals. “Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court justice is the most important decision an American president can make,” Trump told reporters on Sept. 9.In 2016, McConnell blocked Obama from having a hearing on his nominee in 2016 -- Merrick Garland -- setting the stage for Trump to install Neil Gorsuch instead.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said at a debate last year that he was opposed to adding additional justices to the court if Democrats were to win the presidency.“I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all,” he said. But, if Republicans move to replace Ginsburg this year and Biden wins in November, he’d face strong pressure from the left to expand the court.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, issued a statement that was silent on the question of whether Ginsburg should be replaced before Election Day. He called her “a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes.”“While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation,” said Graham, who is up for re-election this fall in an increasingly tight race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ginsburg-s-death-gives-donald-trump-chance-to-add-justice-to-high-court/story-4wJAcwNXhnbBTrvly31SNO.html
19-09-2020||World||Donald Trump spoke with Oracle’s Ellison as he weighs TikTok deal||President Donald Trump, nearing a decision on whether to approve an alliance between Oracle Corp. and the Chinese-owned video app TikTok, spoke by phone Friday with Oracle’s chairman, Larry Ellison, according to people familiar with the matter.Trump set a deadline of Sunday to approve or decline a deal in which Oracle and a Chinese company, Bytedance Ltd., would create a new company, TikTok Global, in order to satisfy US national security concerns about the popular app.The chief executive of Walmart Inc., Doug McMillon, was also on the call, the people said. Walmart, which had previously partnered with Microsoft Corp. to make an outright bid for TikTok’s US business, remains interested in investing as well, and could end up with a seat on the board of the new company, according to one of the people.The people asked not to be identified because the conversations were private.Separately, Democratic nominee Joe Biden assailed Trump for the timing of his interest in the app.“It’s a matter of genuine concern that TikTok, a Chinese operation, has access to over 100 million young people, particularly in the United States of America,” Biden told reporters in Duluth, Minnesota on Friday.“What I always worry about though, is what Trump does and the way he does it on the eve of an election,” he said. “All of a sudden he’s decided he’s going to deal with TikTok, and he’s talking about how we have to make money off of it. I mean what the hell is he talking about. Either it is a security risk or isn’t a security risk.”Earlier Friday, the Trump administration announced that it was banning TikTok, as well another Chinese platform, WeChat, from US mobile app stores. Trump has said the companies threaten national security because China could use them to mine user data or broadcast propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-spoke-with-oracle-s-ellison-as-he-weighs-tiktok-deal/story-6dr4tUm5fDrKK7Odvz1VyO.html
19-09-2020||World||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, second woman on Supreme Court, dies||Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose 27-year tenure as the second female justice on the US Supreme Court culminated a legal career dedicated to advancing the rights of women, has died.She was 87, and her death comes less than two months before the election gives President Donald Trump a chance to try to shift the already conservative court further to the right.She died due to complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer and was surrounded by her family at her home in Washington, the court said in a statement Friday. Ginsburg battled with five bouts of cancer.Trump will now have a chance to fill a third Supreme Court seat. Senate confirmation of his nominee would increase the chances of a decision overturning or severely curtailing the Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling.Only days before her death, National Public Radio reported that Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously said the Senate would move to confirm any nominee this year, even though McConnell blocked President Barack Obama from having a hearing on his nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016. That set the stage for Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch instead.“Our Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. “Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her -- a tireless and resolute champion of justice.”Long before President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court in 1993, Ginsburg argued cases before the court as a scholar and advocate of the women’s rights movement. She was a high-profile proponent of the unsuccessful effort to adopt an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S Constitution.On the court, she built a record as one of the court’s most liberal members, supporting gay and abortion rights, President Barack Obama’s health-care law and restrictions on the death penalty.Her strong dissents from rulings that cut back on voting rights and affirmative action won her the admiring nickname “Notorious R.B.G.” Two films about her were released in 2018: The documentary “RBG” and a Hollywood biography, “On the Basis of Sex.”She drew criticism during the 2016 presidential campaign when she denounced Trump, who had clinched the Republican nomination, as a “faker” in a media interview. Ginsburg later said she regretted the comments. Trump called on her to resign, saying on Twitter that “her mind is shot.”Ginsburg said she experienced gender discrimination personally when she tried, without success, to join New York City’s major law firms after being a star law student at Harvard and Columbia universities in the late 1950s.Her experience was similar to that of the first female justice, Sandra Day O’Connor, a Ronald Reagan appointee who joined the court in 1981 and retired in 2006.Battling SexismGinsburg made her clearest mark on the Supreme Court when she was fighting what she saw as gender discrimination, often challenging her male colleagues on views she considered sexist.When the court voted 5-4 in 2007 to uphold a federal ban on a late-term abortion procedure, Ginsburg took issue with the all-male majority’s professed concern that women might regret having an abortion and thus suffer a loss of self-esteem. Such thinking “reflects ancient notions about women’s place in the family and under the Constitution,” she wrote.“I was a law school teacher,” she said during a 2015 interview at the court. “And that’s how I regard my role here with my colleagues, who haven’t had the experience of growing up female and don’t fully appreciate the arbitrary barriers that have been put in women’s way.”Ginsburg wrote the court’s 7-1 decision in 1996 that ended the men-only admission policy at the state-funded Virginia Military Institute. In 2003, she joined the majority in upholding an affirmative action plan at the University of Michigan Law School, while dissenting from a second decision that overturned a race-conscious undergraduate admissions policy at the University of Michigan.Same-Sex MarriageIn 2013, she was the first justice to officiate at a same-sex marriage, and two years later was part of the 5-4 majority that legalized gay marriage nationwide. She voted in two cases to uphold key provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and dissented from the 5-4 Citizens United ruling in 2010 that struck down decades-old restrictions on corporate campaign spending.Since 2010, Ginsburg was the senior member of the court’s liberal wing, with the prerogative to write the main dissenting opinion.She did just that in 2013, when a 5-4 court threw out a core part of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, citing reduced incidents of discrimination as a reason. Ginsburg said the majority’s approach was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”That dissent, and another one in an affirmative action case, inspired New York University law student Shana Knizhnik to create a Tumblr site dedicated to Ginsburg. She titled it Notorious R.B.G. -- a play on the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. -- offering T-shirts and an admiring book about Ginsburg.Ginsburg became a devotee of the site. “I think it’s amusing,” she said in 2015. “It’s quite well done. There are some serious things on it. There are some funny things.”Voting RecordIn 2015 Ginsburg joined Justice Stephen Breyer in calling for the court to consider whether the death penalty is constitutional.In the bitterly fought case that decided the 2000 presidential election for Republican George W. Bush, Ginsburg said in dissent that thousands of votes had not been counted.In a 2009 interview with USA Today, Ginsburg said the Supreme Court needed more female justices. “Women belong in all places where decisions are being made,” said Ginsburg, who was the only woman on the high court from 2006, when O’Connor retired, to August 2009, when Sonia Sotomayor joined her. Elena Kagan raised the number of women on the court to three in 2010.Ginsburg was one of the most durable justices in history. Before the liver tumor, she had contracted colon, lung and on two occasions pancreatic cancer, and she was hospitalized on multiple occasions for less serious ailments. Until 2019, when she was recovering from surgery to remove masses from one of her lungs, Ginsburg never missed an argument because of illness.Ruth Joan Bader was born on March 15, 1933, in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Nathan Bader, owned clothing stores. Her mother, the former Celia Amster, died of cervical cancer when Ruth was 17.‘Unsettling’ DiscriminationIn an interview for the PBS series “The Jewish Americans,” Ginsburg recalled her first experience with anti-Semitism, during a car trip with her parents: “There was a bed-and-breakfast and there was a sign outside and it read, ‘No dogs or Jews allowed.’ I had never seen that before. And that was obviously unsettling.”At Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, she had a blind date with a classmate, Martin Ginsburg, and found him to be, as she later said, “the only young man I dated who cared that I had a brain.” They married after she graduated, first in her class, in 1954.Ginsburg joined her husband as a student at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where “women were not looked upon as people who should be there,” she later told the New York Times.She finished legal studies at the top of her class at Columbia Law School after her husband got a job in New York City. At both Harvard and Columbia, she won election to the law review. Unable to land a job with a major law firm, she clerked for a federal district judge.Breaking Tradition“The traditional law firms were just beginning to turn around on hiring Jews,” she later wrote. “But to be a woman, a Jew and a mother to boot -- that combination was a bit too much.”In 1963, she joined the faculty at Rutgers University School of Law in New Jersey. In 1972, Columbia Law School made her the first female tenured professor in its 114-year history, and she became the first director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project.At the ACLU, Ginsburg became a leading practitioner before the Supreme Court, planning and arguing sex-discrimination cases that cumulatively established for the first time that discrimination against women was banned by the Constitution’s equal-protection clause.Step by gradual step, sometimes using men as the lead client, Ginsburg challenged unequal treatment of men and women in six cases, winning five. Her steady, incremental assault brought comparisons to how Thurgood Marshall challenged racial discrimination in the years before he joined the Supreme Court.Survivor BenefitsIn one early win, Ginsburg helped argue the case of a female Air Force lieutenant whose husband was denied the housing allowances and medical benefits automatically given to military wives. In another case, she successfully represented a man seeking survivor benefits from Social Security after his wife died in childbirth, leaving him to raise his infant son. A subsequent case also won by Ginsburg extended the survivor benefits to all widowers, regardless of whether they had children.President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 1980. In 13 years on that court, Ginsburg staked out the center as a swing vote who sided not infrequently with her Republican colleagues.Justice Byron White’s announcement in March 1993 that he would retire gave Democrats their first Supreme Court pick in more than 25 years.The Senate confirmed Ginsburg 96-3. She offered a straightforward response when asked at her Senate hearing about abortion, saying the Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee assured women “that she be the decision maker, that her choice be controlling” on such matters.Friendship With ScaliaOn the court she was known for working long hours, often working from home until well past midnight, and for her collegiality, continuing a close friendship with her ideological opposite on the court, Justice Antonin Scalia. Opera lovers, they appeared together as extras in Washington National Opera productions, and they were photographed riding an elephant together in India. Scalia died in 2016.Ginsburg and her husband, who died in 2010, had two children, Jane, a professor at Columbia Law School, and James, a producer of classical music recordings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-second-woman-on-supreme-court-dies/story-owFo4puYAhKHU2UzVqnQZM.html
19-09-2020||World||US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies at 87||Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a diminutive yet towering women’s rights champion who became the court’s second female justice, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 87.Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer, the court said.Her death just over six weeks before Election Day is likely to set off a heated battle over whether President Donald Trump should nominate, and the Republican-led Senate should confirm, her replacement, or if the seat should remain vacant until the outcome of his race against Democrat Joe Biden is known.Chief Justice John Roberts mourned Ginsburg’s passing. “Our Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice,” Roberts said in a statement.Ginsburg announced in July that she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lesions on her liver, the latest of her several battles with cancer.Ginsburg spent her final years on the bench as the unquestioned leader of the court’s liberal wing and became something of a rock star to her admirers. Young women especially seemed to embrace the court’s Jewish grandmother, affectionately calling her the Notorious RBG, for her defense of the rights of women and minorities, and the strength and resilience she displayed in the face of personal loss and health crises.Those health issues included five bouts with cancer beginning in 1999, falls that resulted in broken ribs, insertion of a stent to clear a blocked artery and assorted other hospitalizations after she turned 75.She resisted calls by liberals to retire during Barack Obama’s presidency at a time when Democrats held the Senate and a replacement with similar views could have been confirmed. Instead, Trump will almost certainly try to push Ginsburg’s successor through the Republican-controlled Senate — and move the conservative court even more to the right.Ginsburg antagonized Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign in a series of media interviews, including calling him a faker. She soon apologized.Her appointment by President Bill Clinton in 1993 was the first by a Democrat in 26 years. She initially found a comfortable ideological home somewhere left of center on a conservative court dominated by Republican appointees. Her liberal voice grew stronger the longer she served.Ginsburg was a mother of two, an opera lover and an intellectual who watched arguments behind oversized glasses for many years, though she ditched them for more fashionable frames in her later years. At argument sessions in the ornate courtroom, she was known for digging deep into case records and for being a stickler for following the rules.She argued six key cases before the court in the 1970s when she was an architect of the women’s rights movement. She won five.“Ruth Bader Ginsburg does not need a seat on the Supreme Court to earn her place in the American history books,” Clinton said at the time of her appointment. “She has already done that.”On the court, where she was known as a facile writer, her most significant majority opinions were the 1996 ruling that ordered the Virginia Military Institute to accept women or give up its state funding, and the 2015 decision that upheld independent commissions some states use to draw congressional districts.Besides civil rights, Ginsburg took an interest in capital punishment, voting repeatedly to limit its use. During her tenure, the court declared it unconstitutional for states to execute the intellectually disabled and killers younger than 18.In addition, she questioned the quality of lawyers for poor accused murderers. In the most divisive of cases, including the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000, she was often at odds with the court’s more conservative members — initially Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.The division remained the same after John Roberts replaced Rehnquist as chief justice, Samuel Alito took O’Connor’s seat, and, under Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the court, in seats that had been held by Scalia and Kennedy, respectively.Ginsburg would say later that the 5-4 decision that settled the 2000 presidential election for Republican George W. Bush was a “breathtaking episode” at the court.She was perhaps personally closest on the court to Scalia, her ideological opposite. Ginsburg once explained that she took Scalia’s sometimes biting dissents as a challenge to be met. “How am I going to answer this in a way that’s a real putdown?” she said.When Scalia died in 2016, also an election year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to act on Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the opening. The seat remained vacant until after Trump’s surprising presidential victory. McConnell has said he would move to confirm a Trump nominee if there were a vacancy this year.Reached by phone late Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, declined to disclose any plans. He said a statement would be forthcoming.Ginsburg authored powerful dissents of her own in cases involving abortion, voting rights and pay discrimination against women. She said some were aimed at swaying the opinions of her fellow judges while others were “an appeal to the intelligence of another day” in the hopes that they would provide guidance to future courts.“Hope springs eternal,” she said in 2007, “and when I am writing a dissent, I’m always hoping for that fifth or sixth vote — even though I’m disappointed more often than not.”She wrote memorably in 2013 that the court’s decision to cut out a key part of the federal law that had ensured the voting rights of Black people, Hispanics and other minorities was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”Change on the court hit Ginsburg especially hard. She dissented forcefully from the court’s decision in 2007 to uphold a nationwide ban on an abortion procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. The court, with O’Connor still on it, had struck down a similar state ban seven years earlier. The “alarming” ruling, Ginsburg said, “cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this court — and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women’s lives.”In 1999, Ginsburg had surgery for colon cancer and received radiation and chemotherapy. She had surgery again in 2009 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and in December 2018 for cancerous growths on her left lung. Following the last surgery, she missed court sessions for the first time in more than 25 years on the bench.Ginsburg also was treated with radiation for a tumor on her pancreas in August 2019. She maintained an active schedule even during the three weeks of radiation. When she revealed a recurrence of her cancer in July 2020, Ginsburg said she remained “fully able” to continue as a justice.Joan Ruth Bader was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, the second daughter in a middle-class family. Her older sister, who gave her the lifelong nickname “Kiki,” died at age 6, so Ginsburg grew up in Brooklyn’s Flatbush section as an only child. Her dream, she has said, was to be an opera singer.Ginsburg graduated at the top of her Columbia University law school class in 1959 but could not find a law firm willing to hire her. She had “three strikes against her” — for being Jewish, female and a mother, as she put it in 2007.She had married her husband, Martin, in 1954, the year she graduated from Cornell University. She attended Harvard University’s law school but transferred to Columbia when her husband took a law job there. Martin Ginsburg went on to become a prominent tax attorney and law professor. Martin Ginsburg died in 2010. She is survived by two children, Jane and James, and several grandchildren.Ginsburg once said that she had not entered the law as an equal-rights champion. “I thought I could do a lawyer’s job better than any other,” she wrote. “I have no talent in the arts, but I do write fairly well and analyze problems clearly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies-at-87/story-LXP2kkFzuoysXE5zLzpxSM.html
19-09-2020||World||California wildfire smoke blankets parts of Canada||Smoke from California and Oregon wildfires has cloaked Canada’s third-largest city of Vancouver -- known for its majestic mountain views and fresh ocean breezes -- in the dirtiest air in the world this week.Days have been spent smarting under a thick haze that has irritated eyes and throats, and sent asthmatics gasping for breath. It has also complicated Covid-19 testing. On Friday, despite forecasted smoke-clearing rain storms, the city -- 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) north of the biggest California fires -- topped for the second time this week the World Air Quality Index for worst air, after briefly ceding first place to Portland in fire-stricken Oregon.“I’m out of breath all the time, my chest feels like it’s exploding, I feel like I’m going to suffocate,” Fatima Jaffer, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia, told AFP.“I’m afraid of the long-term damage this smoke might do to my lungs and my asthma.”Authorities for the metropolitan region of 2.5 million residents issued daily air quality warnings since September 8, with things so bad that Vancouver opened five filtered “clean air shelters.”It’s equivalent to smoking eight cigarettes a day, researchers noted. Health officials urged all citizens to close windows and avoid strenuous exercise or outdoor activities -- especially those with respiratory illness.Jaffer, 58, said her worsening asthma added to a sense of panic and dread, as she had just recovered from Covid-19, which robbed her of her sense of smell. Now she worries the smog could increase her odds of reinfection or cause new health complications.“I’d just gotten to the place of getting over the fear of Covid-19 and felt like I could breathe again,” she said, “and now I literally can’t.”It’s been an “entire horrible week for air quality,” said Armel Castellan, a federal warning preparedness meteorologist. “The fine particulate has brought our Air Quality Health Index up off the charts.”“There’s no doubt this is very massive and very concerning,” he said.Covid-19 and wildfire smoke The same people are at most risk of smoke inhalation and the coronavirus, according to provincial health officer Bonnie Henry. The past month has seen British Columbia’s active Covid-19 cases surge 130 percent, hitting highs more than double those at the pandemic’s April peak.“For many of us, there’s confusion about what symptoms are caused by smoky skies, and what symptoms are caused by Covid-19,” Henry told a news conference, “particularly for people who have underlying lung disease, asthma, heart disease and diabetes.”Another vulnerable group are Vancouver’s more than 2,000 homeless residents, many of whom have chronic illness, a recent survey found.“If you’re outside and homeless, and surrounded by this smoke and the pandemic, you can’t get away from any of these things,” said Jeremy Hunka, with Union Gospel Mission. “It’s hitting a group of people that generally have been just left far more vulnerable.”For North Vancouver professional dog-walker Barry Appal, 64, he and his wife ten years his senior have had to wear masks outdoors and avoid usual strenuous trails.“After a half-hour you could feel it in your lungs and get a headache,” he said. “We’re active and healthy, but with Covid-19 around, picking up any respiratory thing could become a bigger problem than normal.”He’s most worried for his 30-something nephew with cystic fibrosis. “He’s very susceptible to anything to do with his lungs,” Appal said. “He’s already freaked out about Covid -- that could wipe him right out at the drop of a hat.” Meteorologist Castellan said conditions should improve next week thanks to brewing Pacific storms clearing the air. But with the “fingerprints of climate change” clearly visible in the year-after-year worsening wildfire seasons, “We’re not done with this yet,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfire-smoke-blankets-parts-of-canada/story-0iDWDwiIGFhk3q7MWtjIfK.html
19-09-2020||World||Trump and Biden hit unlikely battleground state of Minnesota||A solidly blue state for the past half century, Minnesota became an unquestioned presidential battleground on Friday as President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden fought for working-class voters in dueling events that marked the beginning of early voting.The candidates steered clear of the state’s most populated areas near Minneapolis to focus on rural and blue-collar voters, some of whom shifted to Republicans for the first time in 2016. Trump was headed to Bemidji, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, while Biden campaigned n a suburb of Duluth, on the banks of Lake Superior and close to the Wisconsin border.Biden railed against Trump’s inability to control the pandemic, casting the president’s reluctance to embrace more serious social distancing safeguards as “negligence and selfishness” that cost American lives. At a carpenter union’s training hall, he also emphasized his plans to boost American manufacturing.“It’s time to reward hard work in America and not wealth,” Biden declared with roughly a dozen workers looking on.“When the government spends taxpayers’ money, we should spend that money to buy American products made by American workers and American supply chains to generate American growth,” Biden said. He promised to invest $400 billion in federal money over his first term to ensure more products are made in America.Also read: Donald Trump attacks his FBI chief over Russia assessmentSince narrowly losing Minnesota in 2016, Trump has emphasized the state in hopes that a victory this year could offset losses in other states. He has visited regularly and kept a close eye on issues of particular importance to rural corners of the state. He’s reversed an Obama administration policy prohibiting the development of copper-nickel mining and has bailed out soybean, corn and other farmers who have been hurt by trade clashes with China.More recently, he’s embraced a “law and order” message aimed nationally at white suburban and rural voters who may be concerned by protests that have sometimes become violent. That’s especially true in Minnesota, where the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer sparked a national reckoning on racism.But for all the work Trump has put into the state, it may elude him again in November.A series of polls over the past week show Biden has built a consistent lead in Minnesota. And in the 2018 midterms, Democratic turnout surged in suburbs, small cities and even on the Iron Range, across the blue-collar mining towns that were once labor strongholds but had been trending Republican.David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has produced anti-Biden ads, said Minnesota may help the Trump campaign build momentum.“They’re looking beyond the poll numbers and seeing the potential there,” said McIntosh, a former congressman from Indiana. “It’s always smart strategy to go on offense somewhere.”In 2018, Democrats flipped two suburban congressional districts, took back control of the state House by winning suburban Trump-voting areas and came within one seat of winning control of the state Senate. Democrats won every statewide race that year, even as they lost a rural congressional district.Trump’s path to Minnesota success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas –- running up the score beyond his 2016 tally. It’s a strategy he’s trying to pull off in other states and it depends on a robust field operation with the money and time to track down infrequent or first-time voters. That could be a tall order since Minnesota already has one of the nation’s highest voter turnout rates.“I don’t think they’re there,” said Joe Radinovich, a Democrat who lost a bid for a northern Minnesota congressional district in 2018. Radinovich noted the major organizational challenge and expense in tracking new voters, making sure they’re registered and getting them to vote – especially during a pandemic. “We have relatively high turnout already. Most people vote. I just don’t think it’s there. I think those people showed up in 2016,” he said.In 2016, Trump won that district, which includes the Democratic city of Duluth, by 15 percentage points. But in the midterms two years later, Radinovich lost by just under 6 percentage points.Still, Trump has spent more than a year building a sizable Minnesota ground game. Republicans are out knocking on doors and interacting personally with voters in ways that Democrats mostly have not, preferring online operations because of the coronavirus.The president’s reelection campaign announced this week a $10 million ad buy in a series of states, including Minnesota. It has spent nearly $17 million on advertising in the state since last October, compared with almost $6.3 million for Biden over the same period, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.Democrats warn that Biden still may have his work cut out for him. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said the Trump campaign has far outpaced Biden in local yard signs — which indicates enthusiasm but may not ultimately affect the outcome.“One of the things the Trump campaign has been very good about is visibility in Duluth, but also in areas around Duluth,” Larson said.Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that while Biden isn’t likely to carry the congressional district that includes Duluth, he might be able to pick up enough support there to deny Trump the votes he needs to win statewide.“If your opponent is on the ropes or on the ground,” Martin said “you don’t let them get up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-and-biden-hit-unlikely-battleground-state-of-minnesota/story-6nmrDh2SBCajGaFFWJqPJN.html
19-09-2020||World||Donald Trump attacks his FBI chief over Russia assessment||President Donald Trump on Friday attacked his FBI director, Christopher Wray, for highlighting the threat posed by Russia and right-wing militias to the US election, rather than focusing on China and left-wing groups.Trump, whose campaign had murky ties to Russian operatives offering assistance during his 2016 victory against Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly criticized his intelligence officials who consistently say that Moscow still poses the chief danger.Still, the Republican’s criticism of Wray at the White House, a day after the FBI chief testified before Congress, was unusually public for a US president.Asked by reporters if he wanted to fire Wray, Trump said: “We’re looking at a lot of different things.”“I did not like his answers yesterday. I’m not sure he liked them either. I’m sure that he probably would agree with me,” Trump said.The president, who faces a difficult reelection fight on November 3, repeated his insistence that China, not Russia, is the bigger problem.“Obviously China is at the top of the list. I see Russia, North Korea, many other countries, can be talked about. But China would be at the top of that list, so I don’t know why that’s not mentioned,” Trump said.He also attacked Wray over his assessment that white supremacist groups represent the biggest threat of domestic violence in the already tense pre-election season. “Within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket, people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist ideology is certainly the biggest chunk,” Wray said in his testimony to Congress.Trump, who has strong support from armed, right-wing militia groups and the conspiracy theory movement QAnon, said Wray should instead have been focusing on Antifa, a loose-knit leftist movement at the forefront of sometimes violent anti-racism protests.In addition to castigating China on the campaign trail, Trump has made claims that Antifa is seeking to destroy American suburbs and promote mass violence a central part of his reelection message.“Antifa’s a bad group and they’re criminals and they’re anarchists and they’re agitators and they’re looters and rioters and everything else,” he told reporters.“They’re bad. And when a man doesn’t say that, that bothers me. I wonder why he’s not saying that,” he said of Wray.“Why he doesn’t want to say that, that certainly bothers me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-attacks-his-fbi-chief-over-russia-assessment/story-IcTIqyrXY3J4rewFeaq4PO.html
19-09-2020||World||CDC drops controversial Covid-19 testing advice that caused backlash||US health officials on Friday dropped a controversial piece of coronavirus guidance and said anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person should get tested.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially returned to its previous testing guidance, getting rid of language posted last month that said people who didn’t feel sick didn’t need to get tested. That change had set off a rash of criticism from health experts who couldn’t fathom why the nation’s top public health agency would say such a thing amid a pandemic that has been difficult to control.Health officials were evasive about why they had made the change in August, and some speculated it was forced on the CDC by political appointees within the Trump administration.The CDC now says anyone who has been within 6 feet of a person with documented infection for at least 15 minutes should get a test. The agency called the changes a “clarification” that was needed “due to the significance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-drops-controversial-covid-19-testing-advice-that-caused-backlash/story-ytbjPD648fuhucWCscRDYK.html

Accusations of sexual abuse and harassment against him by several women had led to the #MeToo movement.The developments had prompted demands in the UK that his royal honour be cancelled.“The Queen has directed that the appointment of Harvey Weinstein to be an Honorary Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 29 January 2004, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order,” said The Gazette, the official public record, in a notification on Weinstein. The decision was taken at a recent meeting of the Honours Forfeiture Committee.Weinstein was previously expelled from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, while the British Film Institute removed the fellowship awarded to him in 2002.Once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, Weinstein has been associated with films with British themes such as The English Patient (1996), Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Enigma (2001).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-queen-strips-harvey-weinstein-of-royal-honour/story-WPvzyeloaF3D1JDrTRRzNN.html

According to a note recovered from them, the family was under debt and was harassed by lenders. Additional deputy commissioner of police (East) Manoj Choudhary said that the man was 45 years old while his wife was 41. The elder son, 23, was preparing for the recruitment exam of police constable and the younger, 20, had taken the medical entrance examination on September 13.Choudhary said that the police came to know about the incident around 9 am. A team of forensic science, police from Kanota police station, and other senior officials rushed to spot.“The family belonged to Alwar and was living in Jamdoli area of Jaipur for last five years,” the police officer said. He said that debt and pressure from lenders were the reason behind their extreme step.“Probe hints that the jeweller was under pressure as those who had purchased gold from him are not paying him the money and those from whom he had taken money were creating pressure on him and were allegedly threatening him. The exact amount of money taken is yet to be verified. A case has been registered under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code against four persons who were called at the police station and are being quizzed,” Choudhary said. Also read: Rajasthan govt to legalise mines supplying stone for Ram temple construction in AyodhyaA suicide note has also been recovered from the spot in which the jeweller had shared his ordeal. “I am taking my life in all my senses and so is my family. Due to loss in my business, I had taken money from some people but they were creating pressure on me and even after demanding they were not giving me extra time to repay the money because of which my entire family is under severe mental stress. Nobody is listening to us. I am responsible for all the loss and not any other family member,” the note read.It further added, “Those whom I had lent money are not returning while my lenders come home and abuse us.”One of the family members said that his nephew had suffered a severe loss in business and was planning to sell his shop to repay the loan. “One can only repay the loan once the shop is sold and somebody pays the money. Few lenders, including a woman, had come yesterday and abused the family members,” the family member added.The police said they are recording the statements of neighbours and other family members to find out who all were visiting the victim family. The call details of the suspects would be obtained to check the frequency of calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harassed-by-money-lenders-jaipur-based-jeweller-kin-end-life/story-u1ymY9sMAxoo0Ry08utNtN.html

19-09-2020||India||Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, NC says ‘declare medical emergency in Jammu’||National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana on Saturday sought declaration of medical emergency in Jammu in view of the ever-rising cases of Covid-19 and inadequate infrastructural facilities to tackle the crisis-like situation.“The overall scenario is quite grim and there is no room for complacency. It can prove catastrophic unless an emergent and proactive response is taken to save precious lives,” Rana said in a statement.Rana referred to reports where patients either not find beds for treatment or were in need of oxygen and ventilators. He said the government should have anticipated such a situation and taken necessary measures to ramp-up bed strength by earmarking the maximum number of available beds in each hospital. Private hospitals and nursing homes should have been roped in, besides setting up a hospital with at least a thousand beds, Rana said giving the example of such a facility created by the Punjab government.Also read: L-G announces Rs 1,350 cr economic package for Jammu and KashmirWhile lauding the frontline warriors for risking their lives by putting in best efforts to treat Covid-19 cases, he slammed the “poor infrastructural backup” in Jammu.

19-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha passes Bill to protect doctors, healthcare workers battling Covid-19||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed a legislation that provides for up to seven years in jail for those attacking doctors and healthcare workers battling an epidemic, including the current pandemic Covid-19.The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which was introduced by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the Upper House) got support from across party lines.The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020, will replace an ordinance issued in April by the government. The government had brought the ordinance on April 22 to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to make incidents of violence on health workers treating Covid-19 patients a non-bailable offence with provisions of a penalty and a jail term of up to seven years.Under the proposed Act, the commission or abetment of such violence will be punishable with imprisonment for a term of three months to five years, and with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2,00,000. In case of causing grievous hurt, the imprisonment shall be for a term of six months to seven years and with a fine of Rs 1,00,000 to Rs 5,00,000.Vardhan explained that the ordinance had to be brought as incidents of harassment and violence against health workers were rising amid a lack of awareness about coronavirus. “We have all noticed that there has been a dramatic decline in the incidents of violence against health workers all over the country,” he said.He said the step had to be taken in very unusual circumstances and when the government reviewed, it found there were minimal laws and powers in some states.“There was a need to have a central law to put in place a prohibitory mechanism to stop such activities,” Vardhan said.Several members raised issues related to hospitals turning Covid-19 into an opportunity to issues related to federalism.Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India (CPI), who moved a statutory resolution on the Bill, said it did not address the issue of violence on health professionals within the hospitals.Many hospitals are not paying the salaries to doctors and nurses, PPE kits are not being given and safety concerns are being ignored -- these issues have not been addressed by the Bill, he added.Participating in the debate, Congress’ Anand Sharma said there is a need to expand the protection to include the police and personnel of various other services, engaged in providing relief.“There are personnel from various other services, who are engaged in providing relief, managing the quarantine shelters. They should also be for the future included into the expanded list of people, who need support and protection,” he said.He also suggested to immediately set up a national task force for stakeholders consultation, with the states and institutions, including the scientific community and medical fraternity, for a comprehensive review and amendment to make the proposed Act contemporary and add lessons learnt during the crisis.Derek O’Brien of the TMC charged the Centre with interfering in the functioning of states through the Bill. “There are sinister provisions in the Bill. The states must be authorised to take decisions.” Ram Gopal Yadav (SP) stressed the need for special provisions to penalise people and private hospitals thriving on the Covid-19 crisis and taking it as a business.Vandana Chavan of the NCP suggested adding ASHA workers also.Replying to the discussion, Vardhan said various issues related to biological emergencies are covered under the National Disaster Management Act.

Opposition debates in Lok Sabha||Opposition leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury criticised the government on Saturday in the Lower House regarding the setting up of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund questioning the government over the need of it when there was an existing Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF).The Congress lawmaker, while debating the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020 in Parliament, said, “I want to ask our finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman what is the need for creating a parallel fund when we already have PMNRF?”Chowdhury further questioned the government asking if they had taken loans from Chinese banks amid the standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The Congress MP from Bengal said, “I also want to ask our FM if it’s true that you took a loan from Chinese banks even after our Indian Army personnel were fighting in the Galwan valley. How much loan has been taken from China since April?”A day after his comment and the uproar over it led to several adjournments in the Lok Sabha, Union minister Anurag Thakur lashed out at the opposition and said unlike the PMNRF, the PM CARES is a registered trust. He targeted the Congress and said that one ‘family’ manages the trusts.Thakur said, “The first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru constituted PMNRF in 1948. PMNRF is still not registered. The members of the trust were Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the President of Indian National Congress and a nominee of Tata Trust.”Drawing comparisons between the PMNRF and PM CARES, he said, “The PM-CARES fund was registered on March 27, 2020, under the 1908 Act. An independent auditor was appointed. Nobody is forced to donate to this fund. The members of the trust are all ex officio members such as Prime Minister, minister of defence, minister of home affairs and minister of finance”Congress has targeted the government on the issue of PM CARES even before the Monsoon Session began. On September 13, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh cited the lack of transparency in the PM CARES fund in a virtual press conference.N K Premachandran, a lawmaker from Kerala’s Revolutionary Socialist Party, said he does not understand the necessity of the PM CARES fund. “I can’t understand the logic to have a separate fund. What is the difference between the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and the PM CARES Fund,” he said.Congress’ Manickam Tagore said that the PM CARES lacks transparency. The Tamil Nadu lawmaker questioned why the trust was outside the ambit of the Comptroller Auditor General of India and Parliament.Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra also highlighted that since 38 public sector companies donated Rs 2,100 crore to the fund, which makes 70% of the corpus, the government should be answerable to the people of the nation. She also questioned the government why they had not returned the money donated by Chinese firms like TikTok to the PM CARES.

Employees of nationalised banks are already allowed to travel by trains. Essential staff, which includes nationalised bank employees, and lawyers could travel on the local trains so far — since the suburban railways resumed operations from mid-June. On the Maharashtra government’s request, 10 per cent of the total staff strength of co-operative and private banks will be permitted to travel by local trains, a joint release issued by the Central and Western Railways stated.The selected 10 per cent staff will need to obtain QR ID codes from the state government. Until then, those with valid identity cards can buy tickets and travel.The railway authorities allowed aircraft maintenance and repair staff to travel on local trains.The railways also said that additional booking counters will be opened at important stations, and appealed passengers to follow social distancing. From September 21, 500 local trains instead of 350 will be running in Mumbai. “The number of daily special suburban services will be increased from 350 to 500 on Western Railway from September 21 to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding.

19-09-2020||India||CBI’s new salvo to oppose Lalu Prasad Yadav’s bail may spell trouble for others||For the first time in over two-decades-old fodder scam cases, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took recourse of a new legal provision to oppose RJD chief Lalu Prasad bail plea even as it may bring troubles to several other convicts.According to the CBI, the court had never ordered that the sentences awarded to Prasad in four separate fodder scam cases would run concurrently. Hence, Section 427 (1) of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC) would apply and Prasad’s custody in subsequent cases would start only after the completion of the sentence in previous cases, the agency said.Section 427 (1) of the CrPC says, “When a person already undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment... such imprisonment... shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been previously sentenced unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous sentence...”Also read: Covid-19 vaccine - Serum Institute to start final phase of trial next weekFormer Bihar chief minister, Prasad, had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was granted bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.His trouble renewed again after December 23, 2017, when he had been convicted and sentenced to 3.5 years, 5 years and 14 years of jail terms in three other fodder scam cases in quick succession. Since then, he has been in jail.Of these three cases, he had secured bail in one of them last year from Jharkhand high court on the ground that he had served half of the 3.5 years imprisonment awarded to him.“The CBI has already challenged the above HC’s order in Supreme Court and it is pending there,” said assistant solicitor general and CBI’s counsel Rajiv Sinha.In July this year, Prasad filed a bail application in the high court in the second case on similar ground that he had completed half of the 5 years jail term. But, the CBI, for the first time, took recourse of aforesaid Section 427 (1) of the CrPC to oppose his bail plea contending that Prasad’s custody, in this case, was yet to commence as he had not completed the full custody of previous cases.Prasad’s advocate Prabhat Kumar said, “The court, in last hearing on September 11, had not appreciated CBI’s argument saying that it was a premature stage to raise such contention. The court said the issue would be decided in the final hearing of pending appeal petitions.” He added that Prasad’s bail application would be heard next on October 9.Also read: J-K gets Rs 1,350 crore economic package, 50% rebate on power, water billsKumar explained that fodder scam cases involve nearly 200 accused and majority of them had been convicted in more than one cases. “Some of the accused suppliers were convicted in more than 25 cases and got different terms of imprisonment. If an individual’s total sentence is taken into account, it may be over 100 years,” he said.Advocate Indrajeet Sinha, practising in Jharkhand high court, said, “The appellant court has the power to order that sentences of different cases would run concurrently. I think this is a weak argument taken by the CBI in bail matters.”He added, “The appeal of fodder scam convicts are still pending in high court. If court goes by the mandate of Section 427 of the CrPC in bail matters, then accused, convicted in four or five cases, would have to serve half of the total sentences (27.5 years in case of Lalu Prasad) for his/her release on bail. But, it would be an injustice to him/her for keeping so long in jail in case the court, later on, acquits him/her after deciding the pending appeal petition.”Prasad’s current bail plea is related to the case of fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 33.13 crore during 1992-93 from Chaibasa treasury over fictitious spends on fodder and other expenses for cattle. He, along with 49 others, was convicted in this case. Prasad was sentenced to five years of jail term and was fined Rs one million. After spending the initial two months from - December 2017, to February 2018 - in Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi, Prasad had developed health complications in March 2018 and was shifted to a hospital. Since then, he never returned to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-s-new-salvo-to-oppose-lalu-prasad-yadav-s-bail-may-spell-trouble-for-others/story-KbKirJ7dGQwTeDX4AOQsZM.html

19-09-2020||India||After setback in high court, YSRC enters into virtual conflict with judiciary in Andhra||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh has entered into a virtual confrontation with the state judiciary following a series of judgments against the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the recent past. For the last three days, the YSR Congress party parliamentarians have been openly raising objections inside and outside Parliament over the recent orders of the state high court stalling the investigation into the alleged land scam in Amaravati, the capital region of Andhra Pradesh during the Telugu Desam Party regime. The YSRC leaders have been severely critical of the alleged gag order issued by the high court on Tuesday night restraining the media from publishing the contents of the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau into the alleged Amravati land scam involving a former advocate general of the state and daughters of a serving Supreme Court judge. YSRC general secretary and parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy questioned the legitimacy of the high court order stalling the probe into the alleged land scam in Amaravati and gagging the media from reporting the contents of the FIR registered by the ACB. “The judiciary in Andhra Pradesh is not impartial and is biased against the state government. The high court has taken some quite unusual and legally questionable decisions. There appears to be no material to justify such censorship other than the allegation by the petitioner that it has foisted the case. This is political vendetta being practiced by someone who has served during the previous regime,” Sai Reddy said. YSRC floor leader in Lok Sabha P Mithun Reddy said one cannot expect impartial judgments from some judges who had earlier served as legal advisors to the Telugu Desam Party. He demanded that the whole process of appointing judges through collegiums should be re-examined. The MPs also expressed concern that the courts were obstructing the development work of the people. He said it was strange that the courts were obstructing investigations into the scandals instead of uncovering the scams. The MPs urged the Centre to intervene over the orders of the state high court. While declaring that the Jagan government would move the Supreme Court challenging the state high court orders, the YSRC leaders also demanded that the Centre order a comprehensive probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the alleged purchase of over 4,000 acres of lands by several TDP leaders in and around Amaravati between June and December 2013 in anticipation of the declaration of the capital region. At the same time, the YSRC party has also brought out a government order issued during the Chandrababu Naidu government a few months before the 2019 general elections, allotting housing plots to as many as 14 judges in the prime area of Amaravati. “Naidu had given prime lands to judges free of cost. Some judicial officers and their family members had bought lands in the capital region. How is it justified? The same TDP is opposing the allotment of house sites for the landless poor in Amaravati,” state deputy chief minister K Narayana Swamy criticised. TDP strongly rebutted the criticism of the YSRC on allotment of lands to judges in Amaravati. “There is nothing new in this. During the Y S Rajasekhar Reddy regime, too, house sites were allotted to judges as a matter of policy. The TDP government had allotted lands not just to judges, but also to All India Service officers and journalists,” TDP official spokesman Bonda Uma Maheshwar Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-setback-in-high-court-ysrc-enters-into-virtual-conflict-with-judiciary-in-andhra/story-4R4puic3p0TwUyS8cFdscK.html

He was replying to a question on whether the defence ministry will consider using and selling only “Made in India” products in its stores in light of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus on self-reliance and “vocal for local”. In an address to the nation in May, Modi spoke extensively on the need to focus on a “self-reliant India” and called for promoting products made in India with a larger aim of making Indian economy stronger. In his reply, Naik also said that the total turnover of defence canteens in 2017-18 was Rs 17,190 crore and it went up to Rs 18,917 crore in 2018-19. The total turnover was reported at Rs 17,588 in 2019-20. In the current fiscal, the figure has been recorded at Rs 3,692 crore till August, he said. In reply to a separate question on whether government signed a contract with a private company to modernise 37 airfields, he replied in the affirmative. “Modernisation of airfield infrastructure has enhanced the capability in terms of facilitating operation in poor weather conditions including night operations, enhanced enroute navigation infrastructure and enhanced traffic handling capabilities,” he said. To a separate question, Naik said 86 military airbases are functioning in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-decision-on-selling-only-made-in-india-products-in-military-canteens-govt/story-PTahKMusXBxF4Sr5EqY77M.html

19-09-2020||India||NCR states prepare to avert severe air pollution ahead of winter||Principal secretary to the Prime Minister, PK Mishra has asked the Delhi government to ensure that local sources of air pollution such as open burning of waste, road construction and demolition dust; industrial emissions is managed carefully before air pollution levels spike as we approach winter, according to a statement issued by the environment ministry on Saturday.Mishra also called for plans for air pollution hotspots at a high-level task force meeting on Friday which was attended by chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, secretaries of different departments including ministries of environment, agriculture, road, petroleum and the Central Pollution Control Board. It was decided that similar site-specific plans will be implemented in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.He emphasized that the measures should be implemented well before the onset of severe air conditions and should focus on compliance of emission norms by industries in satellite industrial areas.Mishra noted that the incidence of stubble burning has reduced by more than 50% in last two years and the number of “good” air quality index days has gone up. It was observed that after the recent inclusion of residue-based power and fuel plants under priority sector lending by Reserve Bank of India, both state and central governments should jointly work out action plans for rapid deployment of such units. Measures related to diversification of crop and strengthening of supply chains were also discussed.Mishra stressed that teams should be deployed in Punjab, Haryana and UP to ensure that no stubble burning takes place. These states will need to provide appropriate incentives especially in the relevant districts.“We have to enforce the rules but enforcement becomes a challenge if systems are not in place. We have to do capacity system audits to understand what kind of waste generation and management is happening. Small scale industrial units, unauthorized industrial units will have to be monitored for the kind of fuel they are burning. Learnings from the lockdown will also have to be systematically implemented. For example, work from home can give us clues to develop a systemic approach of reducing the need for travel,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. Delhi recorded moderate AQI at 118 on Saturday.Delhi has recorded “moderate” air quality days consecutively since September 9. The city had recorded 4 “good” and 27 “satisfactory” air days in August with air quality not falling to moderate levels even once.But meteorological and air quality scientists said the season is changing gradually leading to meteorological conditions that are unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncr-states-prepare-to-avert-severe-air-pollution-ahead-of-winter/story-y6qpLk9KP7Agyb7SiFT1tO.html

He also accused the state’s director general of police of taking an ‘Ostrich Stance’ which he said is ‘very disturbing’. “State has become home to illegal bomb making that has potential to unsettle democracy. Police @MamataOfficial busy in carrying out political errands and taking on opposition,” Dhankjar tweeted after the National Investigative Agency (NIA) arrested six alleged Al-Qaeda operatives from Murshidabad district who were planning a series of terror attacks.“How far distanced is DGP @WBPolice from reality is cause of worry. His ‘Ostrich Stance’ is very disturbing,” Dhankar tweeted. Meanwhile, the political blame game over the arrest took began with the Bhartiya Janata Party and the Congress attacking the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state. “This hints at intelligence failure of the West Bengal police. Such is the political interference of the ruling party that the police’s force has started showing signs of decay,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Congress MP and party floor leader in Lok Sabha. Flaying the TMC government in West Bengal, the BJP said that the state should take the help of central agencies because the law and order has reached the rock-bottom.  State has become home to illegal bomb making that has potential to unsettle democracy.

The state government is trying to reactivate the Maoists before the 2021 assembly elections,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s president in West Bengal. TMC leaders, however, said that central agencies should have been more careful. TMC leaders even attacked BJP-ruled states and said that law and order has declined in those states. “They (the Congress and the BJP) are playing politics over national security. Such people cross the international border to enter the country. The BSF, which mans the border, should have been more careful.

Also read: Stop selling fake Khadi products - Centre to Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal“The tiger sat at the area, just adjoining the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, after the kill for a long time before locals could retrieve the body and send it for a post mortem to a district hospital in Pandharkawada. During the first week of September, a similar attack was reported nearby where a farmer luckily escaped with injuries,” said a forest official.“Saturday’s incident has sparked fear in both villages. Residents have been asked to be vigilant,” he added.Subhash Dumare, assistant conservator of forest (Pandharkawada) said, “We have collected scat and hair samples of the tiger and sent it for DNA analysis to identify the gender and age of the animal.” Following the first attack, forest minister Sanjay Rathore had directed necessary measures that were needed to curb further incidents. “We have deployed camera traps, eight Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) persons from Melghat Tiger Reserve, rapid rescue units, and staff from three ranges at the site,” said SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forest (Yavatmal).Ramarao said that the committee, empowered to assess whether the tiger should be captured, discussed the matter on Saturday. “Based on the evidence and exact reason they submit for its capture, I will study and forward the proposal to the chief wildlife warden by Sunday for final recommendation,” he said.Pandharkavada forest reserve is the same region where tigress T1 or Avni was killed in 2018 after she was said to have killed 13 people.There have been 45 human deaths due to wild animal attacks in Maharashtra this year with 27 deaths involving tiger attacks, the forest department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-year-old-woman-mauled-to-death-by-tiger-in-maharashtra-s-yavatmal/story-uxM6twpCv2oqyz2X2w4DfL.html

This is very important,” he said, adding that the second most important thing is maintaining a safe distance.The third important thing is maintaining hygiene by washing hands.“The fourth thing is about the need to keep immunity levels of your body. That is possible by healthy food habits, a healthy lifestyle and also some amount of exercise,” he said.Naidu also said members should keep distance while interacting with each other. “Do not cross that six-feet limit and do not bend on other member’s side and try to wish him. If it is very important, send a slip. Otherwise, you can go out,” he said asking members not to physically reach out to officers or the Chair.The members can convey their problems or grievances by writing, he said. “That is the best way. I hope everyone of our members will remember these four things that have been stated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), health ministry and the home ministry and cooperate so that we can operate and complete our business at the earliest, and go back to serve our people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wear-masks-follow-safety-norms-and-maintain-distance-venkaiah-naidu-to-rs-members/story-EvK2JfOEQn0wRqwSCpl3iN.html

Angioplasty and stent placement was done on Saturday morning. He is stable now, “ said RIMS public relation officer Dr Nishit Ekka.He added, “The medical superintendent was found infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus, that causes Covid-19, two days ago. The team of doctors, who performed the angioplasty, took all precautions as per Covid-19 protocol.”Since the Covid-19 outbreak, nearly 200 doctors, nurses and paramedics of this lone tertiary hospital of the state have tested positive for the virus.Also read: Stop selling fake Khadi products - Centre to Flipkart, Amazon, SnapdealDuring the pandemic, the state health department has designated RIMS as the nodal agency for the centre of excellence to support the district for hospital management and treatment protocols.It is a challenge for the hospital to maintain smooth treatment of Covid-19 patients thronging from across the state, especially when its frontline workers are getting infected.“It’s true that a large number of doctors and other frontline workers have been infected by Covid-19. But, we never allowed this to impact the hospital’s smooth functioning. In fact, we have done emergency surgeries of many Covid-19 patients including in neuro and gynaecology departments,” said Dr Ekka.RIMS is currently facing a dearth of doctors and paramedics as nearly half of the sanctioned posts are lying vacant. Out of 322, 846 and 183 sanctioned posts of doctors, nurses and paramedics respectively at RIMS, 85, 469 and 75 posts are lying vacant respectively.The Jharkhand high court had earlier praised the doctors and other staff for working tirelessly to serve patients during the ongoing pandemic. It, however, blamed administrative inaction for the hospital’s ‘mismanagement’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rims-medical-superintendent-tests-positive-for-covid-19-suffers-cardiac-arrest/story-aHy1BY6oMSGcnrTYxfHxuK.html
19-09-2020||India||Kin of alleged al Qaeda operatives arrested from Bengal still puzzled about offence||When Asura Khatun woke up and saw policemen entering her house to arrest her husband in the early hours of Saturday, it was a bolt from the blue for her. “I asked them what my husband Al Mamun Kamal had done. They didn’t reply and instead told me to ask my husband what he had done. I asked my husband. Even he didn’t reply. He just told me not to worry and that if he was innocent, he would return soon. Else he would be punished,” Bibi said. Kamal was picked up from his house at Jalangi in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district by the National Investigative Agency (NIA). He was one of the six men accused of being radicalised by a Pakistan-based al Qaeda module to carry out terror attacks in India. “I still don’t know why he was picked up. He was earlier in Kerala for work. He returned home around two years back and since then has been working as a wage labourer here. I have a seven-month-old daughter,” Bibi said. The NIA also arrested three more accused from Kerala’s Ernakulam. Murshidabad is one the three Muslim-dominated districts in West Bengal and is located along the Indo-Bangla international border, one of the most porous international borders in India. Even the family members of 22-year-old Najmus Shakib are still in the dark as to why he was nabbed by sleuths of the central agency. “First they questioned my elder son. My younger son (Najmus Shakib) was standing next to him. He had a beard. They asked him why he has kept beard. Then they took him upstairs and searched the room. They seized a few documents, arrested him and took him away. We still don’t know why he was arrested. He was not earning anything. He only used to study and went to the mosque regularly,” Toumana Bibi, the accused’s mother and a resident of Domkal said. This is, however, not the first time that people with links to terrorist organizations have been picked up from the district. Earlier this year, a top Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) operative, allegedly involved in the January 2018 Bodh Gaya blast case, was arrested from a hideout in Murshidabad. Earlier in February 2018, another JMB operative was arrested from the district. “I don’t know what he did. Police didn’t tell us anything. They (cops) just came around 2 am and arrested him. He was a graduate and worked as an electrician. He was not into any criminal activities,” said Sariful Islam, father of Leu Yean Ahmed, 34, a resident of Domkal area in Murshidabad. According to data from the 2011 census, Bengal ranks fourth among the states from where people migrate. Between 2001 and 2011, 5.8 lakh people had migrated from Bengal. The number is now over 11 lakh, according to the state government. Murshidabad accounts for the most migration among all districts. All six arrested men – Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Atitur Rehman along with Shakib, Kamal and Ahmed - were produced in a special NIA court in Kolkata on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-of-alleged-al-qaeda-operatives-arrested-from-bengal-still-puzzled-about-offence/story-qcdtbnlCbpXB6jTeEu08fO.html

In past nine months no nutrient has been sprinkled on the tree,” said Chalinda Bhante, chief monk at Mahabodhi temple.Scientists at the FRI said the tree has got an advantage due to less or no footfall during the lockdown period. Besides, less or no light was used in the temple premises during the period because of which the tree gained natural advantage, they said.Also read: Stop selling fake Khadi products - Centre to Flipkart, Amazon, SnapdealAfter the end of complete lockdown, the temple was opened for devotees from June 8 to July 15, however, following Centre’s and Bihar government’s directive, it was shut again, said a temple management official at Bodh Gaya. He said the temple would reopen for visitors again from September 21.Dr Amit Pandey, FRI scientist, said no or less footfall of the tourists at the temple premises benefitted the peepal tree as the soil aeration in its roots increased. “The air between soil and roots increases due to less pressure on the earth surrounding the tree because of which the tree has benefitted and become quite healthy,” he said.“However, the scientific evidence of the benefits of less human interference because of the lockdown will be collected after our team visits the temple when things normalise,” he said.Pandey said the BTMC officials had contacted them during the complete lockdown period when the tree started shedding leaves. “We asked for video clippings and photographs of the tree’s condition to access its condition,” he said.“When trees get less moisture, they adopt a tactics of shedding leaves. We suggested certain measures which were adopted by the BTMC and leaf shedding stopped,” he said.A BTMC official said the FRI scientists suggested a solution of compost and water on the western side of the root besides sapling plantation which was carried out and the tree regained its health and new leaves started to branch out.Also read: Bodh Gaya’s Mahabodhi temple to reopen from September 21 with restrictionsHe added, “The FRI had sent a pack of nutrients during the lockdown period but the need of its sprinkling has not been felt and even the scientists did not suggest it seeing the healthy condition of the tree.”Retired head of department of botany and biotechnology department at Gaya College, Arvind Kumar Sinha, said less human interference generally give advantage to trees. “This is the reason the trees in forests grow naturally. The lockdown could have aided the natural growth of peepal tree at Mahabodhi temple complex and its roots could have got more air particles. Its leaves received a clean environment to absorb oxygen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahabodhi-temple-s-legendary-peepal-tree-gets-natural-advantage-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-MWbYNBdlIdVngfw2upoT0N.html

ICU beds are being increased in the government hospitals as well. We are watching the capacity of all the hospitals regularly. Over 8,000 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients are still vacant. If need be, we will increase it further,” said Jain.“Even on the beds with ventilators, not many need it. As the number of ICU beds will go up, the ventilator beds will slowly get free,” he said.At present, there are 15,323 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients across government and private hospitals in the national capital. Of these, 7,025 or 45.8 percent beds were occupied as on Saturday evening, according to data from the government’s Delhi Corona app. There are a total of 2,909 ICU beds earmarked for Covid-19 in the city, of which 66.6 percent are currently occupied, data shows.Also read: Schools reopen from September 21 - Are states ready?With the government scaling up testing for Covid-19, Delhi has been recording over 4,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day for nearly ten days now. However, the cumulative positivity rate – total number of positive cases among the total number of people tested in the city so far – dipped below 10 percent on Friday, the health minister added.“The cumulative positivity rate of the cases reported so far has came down below 10 percent for the first time yesterday. So far, the positivity rate is 9.83 percent, earlier this was between 11 and 12 percent. The case fatality ratio (fraction of people who die among those tested positive) stands at 0.69 percent in the last ten days, and 2.05 percent cumulative for all deaths so far,” Jain said.He also said that the proportion of RT-PCR looks skewed because Delhi government has scaled up testing. “Show me one case in Delhi where a person wanted to get tested but could not. Even if they want RT-PCR test they can get it. But for surveillance in people without symptoms, rapid antigen tests can be done in bulk. The testing guidelines have also been revised to remove the need for doctors’ prescriptions,” the minister said.“In the last 10 to 12 days, we increased the number of tests, and in the last two days we have seen a downward trend in the positivity rate. The impact will be visible in the coming week,” he added.When asked whether there was community transmission in Delhi, he said, “Community transmission is a technical term, but with so many cases being reported from Delhi and other parts of the country community transmission should have been accepted. But, it is only the Centre and scientists from ICMR who can say so, however the infection is spreading in the community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-500-icu-beds-added-for-covid-19-patients-in-a-week-delhi-health-minister/story-y1Ln88PLdmlVmFfkgSzYOL.html
19-09-2020||India||In setback for TDP, another Andhra lawmaker shifts loyalties to YSR Congress party||The beleaguered Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh received yet another setback on Saturday when another lawmaker Vasupalli Ganesh from Visakhapatnam shifted loyalties to the ruling YSR Congress party. The TDP legislator representing Visakhapatnam (South) assembly constituency met YSRC president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at the latter’s camp office in Tadepalli in Amaravati in the afternoon and extended his support to the ruling party. Ganesh, however, did not officially join the YSRC, apparently to avoid being disqualified from his assembly membership under the Anti-Defection Law. However, he got his two sons admitted into the YSRC. A businessman by profession, Ganesh entered politics in 2009 and unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections on a TDP ticket. However, he won the elections in 2014 and 2019 and had been loyal to the TDP for a long time. However, for the last few months, Ganesh has been differing with the stand taken by party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu opposing the shifting of administrative capital of the state from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. Speaking to reporters later, Ganesh described Jagan as a dynamic leader and said he was confident that the state would achieve progress under the latter’s leadership. “The welfare schemes launched by the Jagan government have been attracting people and I don’t think the TDP can make any headway in the future,” he said. The MLA hoped that he would be able to take up several developmental work in his constituency during the Jagan regime. “We shall strive to win in the Mayoral elections and present it as a gift to Jagan,” he said. Ganesh is the fourth MLA to leave the TDP in the last 15 months. Earlier, Gannavaram MLA Vallabhaneni Vamsi Mohan and Guntur (West) MLA Maddali Giridhar also distanced themselves from the TDP and announced their support to the YSRC. With this, the strength of the TDP in the 175-member assembly has come down to 19. Technically, however, the strength of the TDP remains 23, as the three MLAs did not officially quit the TDP to avoid getting disqualified. All the three defected MLAs have been allocated separate seats in the assembly by Speaker Tammineni Sitaram, following their request. Ganesh is also likely to follow the same procedure. In the last few months, several senior leaders like MLCs Dokka Manikya Varaprasada Rao, Pothula Sunitha and D Sivanath Reddy, former deputy chairman of legislative Council S V Satish Reddy, former minister P Ramasubba Reddy, former MLAs Panchakarla Ramesh Babu, Kadiri Babu Rao, Thota Trimurthulu Beeda Mastan Rao and S A Rahman and former MLC Jupudi Prabhakar Rao, had quit the party and joined the YSRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-setback-for-tdp-another-andhra-lawmaker-shifts-loyalties-to-ysr-congress-party/story-oL3AMZt9zgAnrSNeqIxKEI.html

However, the government is intent on passing the rest of the legislations scheduled for this session. “There is a consensus on curtailing the Parliament session. We left it to the discretion of the Speaker while adjusting business of the house,” a participant of Parliament’s Business Advisory Committee meeting said. The Speaker will announce the last working day of the House.The session started on September 14 and was supposed to end on October 1.So far, around 30 MPs, including Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel, have tested positive for Covid-19 after the Monsoon Session began amid strict protocols. After Prahlad Patel, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Nitin Gadkari tested positive, the Covid-19 testing protocol in Parliament was tweaked.

19-09-2020||India||NIA arrests three al-Qaeda operatives after raids in Kerala’s Kochi||In a swift operation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) raided a migrant workers’ settlement in Kochi in the early hours of Saturday and arrested three alleged al-Qaeda operatives who were planning a series of terror attacks. The NIA said the terror module was operational for some time and they were planning a series of attacks in major cities including Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi. It said raids were carried out at the same time in Kerala and West Bengal-- six people were arrested from Murshidabad  also. Kerala police chief Loknath Behra said the state police was informed and they helped the premier agency in the raid. All three arrested in Kochi-- Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas and Mosaraf Hossen-- hailed from West Bengal and they were discreetly staying as migrant workers. They were staying separately to avoid detection but they were in constant touch, NIA officials said. Some of the workers staying with them told the NIA that they never had any idea about their dubious activities but they were very religious and always hooked to their phones. But the NIA suspects that they might have got local support. Hasan is reported to be the leader of Kerala module and they were planning lone wolf attacks and suicide bombings. They also planned to target vital installations like southern naval command and Cochin Shipyard, officials said. Though in Kerala many Islamic State sympathisers were arrested earlier, this is the first time an al-Qaeda module has been busted. According to officers investigating the case, those arrested were radicalised by al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and they were in touch with some of them through encrypted Telegram app. Some of the workers told investigators that they were not regular at construction sites and they spent enough time on their phones. A laptop, terror leaflets and bomb-making materials were seized from their hideouts. One of them, Murshid Hasan, was staying in the state for more than five years and another Biswas had worked in a tea shop in Idukki for eight months before shifting his base to Kochi. “They led a normal life and produced all papers before their stay. One of them was staying with his family. We are really shocked to hear their terror-related activities,” one of the locals said adding Kochi will have to be on high alert as around five lakh migrant workers are working in the city and outskirts. Kerala police also suspect that some local people might have extended help to them. “We are keeping a close vigil on all migrant camps and employers have been instructed to keep personal details of all employees,” said a senior police officer. In 2016, at least 21 people from the state had slipped out of the country to join the Islamic State and most of them have reportedly died in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some of their widows and children are reportedly lodged in prisons in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-three-al-qaeda-operatives-after-raids-in-kerala-s-kochi/story-WEmHOGY1Sa9ASLkUaeHxxL.html

The party later added ‘sab ka vishwas’ (confidence of all) to it to showcase its intent of winning the trust of minorities, especially Muslims.“The funds allocated to Uttar Pradesh for the year 2015-16, the first year of the Modi government, was Rs 32,462 lakh and the state utilised Rs 20,248.16 lakh (62 percent). Next year (2016-17), the allocation by the Centre was reduced to Rs 14,364 lakh i.e., 44.2 percent and when BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh during 2017-18, the utilisation declined to 39 percent,” the BSP MP said. He added that the details came in response to a written reply to his query in the Lok Sabha.Also read: Uttar Pradesh police adds sedition to case against AAP MPThe query was regarding the allocation of funds to UP for the welfare of minorities during the last five years for various programmes, details of funds utilised by the state during the period and how the funds were used under the multi-sectoral development programme for the welfare of minorities during the period, he said.“During the election year (2018-19), the allocation was increased to Rs. 37,653.07 lakh, but on ground, the utilisation further declined to Rs 11,811.60 lakh (31 percent). I was shocked and surprised to know that during the year (2019-20), it has gone down to only 9.9 percnt,” Ali added.“The total allocation of funds from 2015-16 was reduced to less than 50 percent and the UP govt utilized less than 10 percent out of the allocated funds,” he said.In order to win the trust and confidence of the minorities, the Centre must be honest and true to its election slogan and promises, he added.“The Centre must allocate sufficient funds required for the welfare of the minorities and the UP government must fully utilise them without any sort of negligence and discrimination,” he said.BJP denies Ali’s allegationsWhile UP minority affairs minister Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’ and Mohsin Raza, minister of state for minority welfare, weren’t reachable despite repeated attempts, the ruling BJP denied Ali’s charge.“Often, attempts are made to discredit us by citing statistics indiscriminately. Everyone knows how Muslims had been reduced to a mere vote bank in the past. Now, with progressive measures, which include ending triple talaq practices and allocating funds for development and modernisation of madrasas, our government is trying to ensure an all-round development,” said UP BJP secretary Chandramohan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-grant-for-minority-welfare-in-up-cut-by-50-in-5-years-bsp-mp/story-gopp3b5KDxXLWT4O3GOpTO.html

Five minutes later, the commissioning pendant of the longest-serving aircraft carrier in the world was lowered onboard INS Viraat marking the end of a glorious tenure for the naval vessel that served for 56 years both the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy since it was commissioned in 1959. During its tenure, its commanding officers including admirals Madhvendra Singh, Arun Prakash, NK Verma and DK Joshi went on to head the navy.On Saturday, after numerous pleas and offers to convert the iconic vessel into a naval museum went unheard, the ship was towed to the breaking yard at Alang in Bhavnagar in Gujarat. The ship was brought by Shree Ram Group for Rs 38.54 crore in an auction conducted by the Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited last month.Watch: INS Viraat’s final journey, served Indian Navy for 29 years Also read: Old jet lands in Bandra; on display soonAndy Trish, who joined the Royal Navy as a Naval airman in 1981 and served on INS Viraat, which was then HMS Hermes, termed the vessel’s journey memorable, and quipped in a lighter vein: “I would like to take her with me.”Mark Shepherd, another British national who was posted on the ship as a 16-years-old during the Falkland War, wanted the ship to be turned into a museum for future generations.David Campbell Bannerman, a former Member of the European Parliament, wrote to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking his intervention to postpone the auction till March. “Our plan would be to turn the ship back into INS Viraat form for key weeks in the UK so that the large Indian diaspora in the UK can attend events on board. This includes Republic Day in January and Diwali in autumn, and possibly Independence Day on 15th August,” Bannerman then told HT.Bannerman, who was prepared to pay 5 million pounds, had said that he had been writing to Indian authorities since June 2019 but there been no response.“INS Viraat could not be handed over to any state government because of non-receipt of a self-sustaining financially complete proposal. Thus, in view of considerations of safety, security etc, a decision to scrap INS Viraat has been taken in due consultation with the Indian Navy,” minister of state for defence Shripad Naik said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha in July 2019.Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh had shown interest in turning the ship into a museum.Many in the Indian Navy still want the ship to be turned into a museum.“I want to try one last attempt to save #INSViraat Flag of India. Wud Reliance, TATA, Adani, Wipro, HCL, Mahindra, Uday Kotak, Poonawalla, Tech companies like Infosys consider contributing to a trust to preserve our history? I rqst my media friends to amplify this appeal,” Bharatiya Janata Party MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar tweeted.Commissioned into the Royal Navy in November 1959, the vessel served the British for 27 years before being decommissioned in 1984. India then bought the vessel and named it INS Viraat. It was commissioned into the Indian Navy on May 12, 1987, and became its flagship.Four Naval Air Squadrons operated out of the aircraft carrier to undertake anti-submarine, search and rescue operations, etc.The vessel became a part of Operation Jupiter in July 1989 as part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka. It was last deployed for operational duty for the International Fleet Review in Vishakapatnam in February 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iconic-ins-viraat-makes-final-journey-to-alang-ship-breaking-yard/story-APpVTW4yZatItm9Vj8ZVbI.html

19-09-2020||India||Bengal to map its forgotten religious institutions in remote areas for conservation||In a bid to conserve all the lesser known and forgotten religious institutions – temples, mosques, gurudwaras and churches – that are lying in a dilapidated state in remote corners and need immediate attention, the West Bengal government has decided to map them. This is the first step before the government can initiate efforts to conserve them. While some could be conserved by the government, others may need a public private partnership, a senior official said. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that a decision to map all these religious institutions has been taken by the information and cultural affairs department under two programs - ‘Maha Tirtha Bhumi’ (Great Pilgrimage Land) and ‘Maha Punnya Bhumi’ (Great Sacred Land). This is over and above the religious institutions that are already conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the state government’s directorate of archaeology and museums. “There are many ancient temples and mosques spread across the state and some are tucked away in remote areas on private lands. Many are in a dilapidated state as no efforts have been made to conserve them. The government has decided to map all these institutions,” Banerjee said. Citing at least two examples she mentioned the name of the Devi Chaudhurani temple in north Bengal and the temple of Bon Bibi in the Sunderban mangroves, the world’s largest delta inhabited by tigers. Legend goes that bandit queen Devi Choudhurani had established the Kali temple deep inside the forest where she used to take shelter. Bon Bibi is a forest deity revered both by Hindus and Muslims in the Sunderbans. “It is not an easy task and it would take time to come up with such a map. But this would help us to conserve our heritage. In future a decision could be taken whether the government would take these up for conservation, or go for a public private partnership or may be involving the community for their conservation. The government will plan for this in the next stage,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-map-its-forgotten-religious-institutions-in-remote-areas-for-conservation/story-KiG03THPKIAkTdK5tGRcSN.html

Police @MamataOfficial busy in carrying out political errands and taking on opposition.Those at helm @WBPolice cannot escape their accountability for this alarming decline in law and order.He appealed to the law enforcement agencies to not escape accountability. Dhankhar’s comments came after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested 9 individuals from West Bengal’s Murshidabad and Kerala’s Ernakulam for their association with a Pakistan-sponsored module of the al-Qaeda on Saturday.How far distanced is DGP @WBPolice from reality is cause of worry. His ‘Ostrich Stance’ is very disturbing. Appreciate role of policemen in general-they r working in difficult situations. Problem is with those at helm who r unmindful of conduct and r politically guided.The governor also wrote on Twitter that the West Bengal’s director general of police is holding an ‘ostrich stance’ and is unaware of the ground reality. Dhankhar said he understands the constraints of the policemen who are working under the shadow of the pandemic but highlighted that people at the ‘helm are unmindful of conduct and are politically guided’.Two people died in west Midnapore district in south Bengal on Thursday as crude bombs were hurled when two groups of miscreants clashed with each other. In August, a Trinamool Congress worker died while making crude bombs in Shamsergunj area of Bengal’s Murshidabad district.

19-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: Char Dham road project not referred for appraisal, says ministry in Rajya Sabha||The Union environment ministry on Saturday told Parliament that the Char Dham road project to connect four Hindu pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand has not been referred to it for appraisal as it did not need to be appraised even as it has involved the loss of trees and ecological damage to the fragile Himalayas.It cited an August 2013 notification exempting all projects related to the expansion of national highways up to 100 km from the preview of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The exemption was granted on the recommendation of a high-level committee constituted to review the provisions in the notification related to environmental clearance for roads, buildings, and special economic zone projects. Also read: 97 people died on-board Shramik trains, govt tells Rajya Sabha“In view of the... thresholds applicable to roads in Char Dham projects, no project has been referred to the MoEFCC [Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change] for appraisal,” the ministry told Rajya Sabha.The ministry was responding to a question on whether mandatory Environment Impact Assessment was avoided to fast-track the project and the reason for fast-tracking it in hilly and mountainous terrain.The 900-km Char Dham project will connect pilgrimage sites in Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri.A Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee has flagged environmental violations in the execution of the project, including felling of thousands of trees without approval and unsafe construction practices. The violations may have activated landslides in certain areas, it said.The Supreme Court on September 9 ruled the width of the Char Dham highway shall not exceed the 5.5 metres the Union road transport ministry has specified in 2018 for the construction of roads in the mountainous terrain.The ministry separately told Rajya Sabha that forest land larger than Delhi and slightly smaller than Goa has been approved for non-forestry purposes like mining, irrigation, and hydropower from 2008 and 2020.It said 247843.49 ha of forest land has been approved for diversion under the Forest Conservation Act. The ministry added certificates of compliance with the Act for diversion of forest land are obtained from district collectors. It added the proposals for such diversions have been placed before concerned village councils and forest-dwellers. The ministry said they have certified all processes under the Act and given their consent for the diversion and compensation, etc.“We have to start moving away from hyper-legal and technocratic approach to protecting the environment. Environment regulation requires a much more reflexive approach and defensive one. The approval of the Char Dham project is yet another case in point when poorly thought out and hasty decisions have resulted in severe and irreversible damage. Acknowledging it will not just help taking project specific remedial action, but also allow us to bring back progressive legal measures that may have been undone through numerous exemptions introduced by successive governments,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-char-dham-road-project-not-referred-for-appraisal-says-ministry-in-rajya-sabha/story-gLHdPXyZw3Ie5PvAsxNk9N.html

19-09-2020||India||Rajasthan govt to legalise mines supplying stone for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya||The Rajasthan government has started the process of legalising mining in Banshi Pahadpur area of Bandh Banetha wildlife sanctuary in Bharatpur district from where stones are being sent to Ayodhya for building Ram temple. This comes days after seers in Ayodhya warned the Congress of facing people’s wrath if the supply of stones from Rajasthan slows down.Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the Bhoomi Pujan ceremony for Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5, 2020, seven months after the Supreme Court resolved the Ram Janambhoomi dispute in Ayodhya and allowed the constructed of the temple. The temple is to be constructed in three years.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been sourcing stones from Banshi Pahadpur for some time now, had complained of supply getting stalled because of a crackdown on September 6 and 7 by Bharatpur district administration. The district administration had claimed the stones were being illegally mined from Banshi Pahadpur, a forest block in the north-east corner of the wildlife sanctuary. “The state government will send a proposal to the ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) by the end of this month for denotification of the forest land to legalise mining there (Banshi Pahadpur). This will provide employment to people and the state will earn revenue,” said additional chief secretary of mines department, Subodh Agarwal. Also read: Covid-19 - Red tape delays Bihar CM’s Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia to kin of deceased“The Bharatpur collector is working on the proposal. We should be able to prepare the report in a few days; and then after the state approvals, the proposal will be sent to Centre,” he said.According to the state mines department, until December 1996, around 42 legal mines of pink, red and yellow sandstone operated in the Banshi Pahadpur forest area. The Supreme Court, by its order on December 12, 1996, prohibited non-forest activities in forest areas without diversion under section 2 of the Forest Act, 1980.Later when the concept of eco-sensitive zone was introduced, again by the apex court, mining was banned within one km of boundary of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks.The MoEF mandated environment clearance for mines from June 1, 2016. These developments led to the closure of legal mines in the area but the famous pink stone continued to be mined illegally, said forest officials.“The pink and yellow sandstone is in high demand. Illegal mining activity in the area feeds processing units in the district. The district administration takes action against illegal mining randomly,” said Bharatpur collector Nathmal Didel.On September 6-7, joint teams of forest, mines, and police departments seized 27 trucks full of stones. Each of these trucks had 5-8 blocks of stone. “We have sent notices to owners of these trucks as part of process for confiscation under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953,” said Mohit Gupta, deputy conservator of forest in Bharatpur. He said the forest produce –the stones in this case – will also be confiscated. According to mines department officials, each of the blocks seized during the crackdown weighed more than 1,000 kilograms and cost around Rs 50,000 in the local market. Gupta said earlier the department caught tractors during action against illegal mining but the use of trucks to transport stone is a recent phenomenon in this forest area.Narpat Singh Shekhawat, central joint secretary and Rajasthan president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, said there is enough stock of the Banshi Pahadpur stone in Ayodhya for building one storey of the temple.Also read: ‘Malicious actors trying to exploit digital payment platforms’ - NSA Doval“We will talk to the state government to find a way out if mining activity continues to be hit in Bharatpur,” he said, adding the Ram temple is being built with the sandstone from Banshi Pahadpur because of its unique colour and texture. The VHP and seers of Ayodhya on Saturday welcomed the Rajasthan government’s decision and said the decision would fasten Ram temple construction.Earlier this week, saints of Ayodhya and the VHP had warned the Rajasthan government to resolve mining issue in Bansi Paharpur else be prepared for a nationwide stir. “Any obstruction in supply of stones by the Rajasthan government will be construed as another ploy by the Congress party to stop the construction work of Ram mandir,” said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya.“The Rajasthan government’s decision to make mining legal in Bansi Paharpur is commendable,” said Sharma and added that the Rajasthan government’s decision will ensure a steady supply of stones for Ram mandir. Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust,” also welcomed the Rajasthan government’s decision. “The Rajasthan government has taken a wise decision. Lord Ram belongs to everyone. So, everyone must help in the construction of Ram mandir,” said Das. The temple trust, on September 11, had started the piling work for testing foundation - pillars for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Around 1,200 pillars will be laid about 100 feet below the surface to prepare the temple’s foundation. In technical terms, this process is called piling. From around October 15, after all the testing work is done, remaining pillars will be laid. Bandh Banetha, spread across 198 square kilometres, was notified as a wildlife sanctuary in 1985. Local traders said mining has been going on in the forest area since the 1960s. “Bharatpur and Dholpur are famous for red sandstone; the stone in Banshi Pahadpur has a pink shade, which makes it more beautiful and it is also stronger,” said a trader requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-govt-to-legalise-mines-supplying-stone-for-building-ram-temple-in-ayodhya/story-DBiqZHQXUFqVaOAYJWrMmN.html
19-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha passes Epidemic Diseases Amendment Bill, 2020 to protect healthcare workers||The Upper House on Saturday passed the Epidemic Diseases Amendment Bill, 2020 to bring a law that punishes those who attack health workers or doctors who are fighting the coronavirus outbreak or during any situation similar to the current Covid-19 pandemic. The legislation provides for up to five years in jail for those who attack doctors and health care personnel. The Centre implemented the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 in order to provide protection to health care service personnel, their living premises as well as their workplaces against any violence during the course of a pandemic.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan while introducing the Bill in the Upper House said that the ordinance introduced in April led to a fall in cases of violence against healthcare workers. He said, “We have all noticed that there has been a dramatic decline in the incidents of violence against health workers all over the country.”Addressing the issue of the stigma attached to Covid-19, Harsh Vardhan said, “Many healthcare workers, including doctors, paramedics, were insulted in some form or the other, due to the stigma attached to Covid-19. The Central government acted on this situation and found that there was a need for a law, a prohibitory mechanism against such incidents.”The legislation intends to make sure that there is an attitude of zero tolerance towards violence against people working in the healthcare sector. The service personnel who will be protected under the new legislation include “public and clinical healthcare service providers such as doctors, nurses, paramedical workers and community health workers; any other persons empowered under the act to take measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease or spread thereof; and any persons declared as such by the state government, by notification in the official gazette.”Trinamool Congress leader and MP Derek O’Brien said the Bill allows Centre to ‘cross constitutional bars’ and interferes with how the chief ministers run their states. He said, “Remember states of West Bengal, Punjab, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan rejected you. Chief Ministers there have been elected to run the states. You cannot cross constitutional bars. There are sinister provisions in the Bill. The states must be authorised to take decisions.”The MP from West Bengal called it an ‘imposition of Centre’s will on states’. “The Centre cannot impose its will on states. It is unconstitutional,” he added.If any damage is done to clinical establishments, quarantine and isolation facilities of patients, mobile medical units or any other property associated with healthcare personnel during a pandemic, penal provisions can be provoked.Penalty ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2,00,000 can be slapped on any individual who is involved in commission or abetment of such acts of violence. It can also be punishable in the form of an imprisonment for a term of three months to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-epidemic-diseases-amendment-bill-2020-to-protect-healthcare-workers/story-mwYPMzODJiG69YljdIwGyO.html

He drew inspiration from Bhagvad Gita and the Krishna-Arjun dialogue while reiterating the concept of free communication and discussion between the teacher and the student. The NEP also seeks to encourage critical thinking and spirit of enquiry.“Effective implementation of the NEP 2020 is likely to restore India’s glory as a great centre of learning as during the times of Takshashila and Nalanda,” Kovind said.He said a key feature of the NEP is the system of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). It would digitally store the academic credits earned from various higher education institutions so that degrees can be awarded, taking into account the credits earned by students.This would allow students the freedom to take courses as per their vocational, professional or intellectual requirements in addition to giving flexibility of suitable exit and re-entry points, he said. The need for strict monitoring of BEd., vocational and distance-learning courses is also being taken care of in this policy, he added.Kovind also highlighted that the target of the NEP 2020 is to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio or GER in higher education to 50% by 2035. He observed that the online system of education can also be utilised to reach this target, especially while catering to the female students or those who do not have physical access to educational institutions as well as international students. Citing statistics, he added that according to All India Survey of Higher Education for 2018-19, GER for females is slightly higher than that for males. However, the share of female students is extremely low in Institutions of National Importance and particularly low in technical education. Emphasising that NEP has focus on equity and inclusion, he said that such gender disparity in higher education should be corrected.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said the aim to strategise the implementation of this policy was initiated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This policy has given access to foreign universities to open campuses in India and vice versa which will be instrumental in the process of making India a soft power, the minister added.The conference saw the participation of vice chancellors of all Central universities and directors of IITs, NITs, SPAs etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-will-help-restore-india-s-glory-as-learning-hub-president-kovind/story-UDebyo45dl82B5jlJOQZFP.html

19-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: Rajya Sabha passes bill to protect corona warriors||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed a legislation that provides for up to five years in jail for those attacking doctors and healthcare workers fighting the Covid-19 outbreak or during any situation akin to the current pandemic.The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced by health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan in the Upper House on Saturday to replace an ordinance issued by the government in April.The Union Cabinet had promulgated The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to protect healthcare service personnel and property, including their living/working premises against violence during epidemics. The bill intends to ensure that during any situation akin to the current pandemic, there is zero-tolerance to any form of violence against healthcare service personnel and damage to property.Moving an amendment bill in this regard for passage in the Upper House, the health minister said after the ordinance, such incidents against healthcare workers have declined.“We have all noticed that there has been a dramatic decline in the incidents of violence against health workers all over the country,” he said.Vardhan explained that the ordinance had to be brought as there was a rising number of incidents of harassment and violence against health workers while they were returning from their duty due to a lack of awareness about coronavirus.They were treated with stigma and not allowed to enter their houses or residential societies. They were beaten up and chased away when they went out for surveillance, he said, adding that this had significantly reduced the morale of the health workers.“Everyone was feeling sad and bad. That was the time the government thought of taking a proactive step. The government found that there were minimal laws and powers in some states. There was a need to have a central law to put in place a prohibitory mechanism to stop such activities,” Vardhan said.Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India (CPI), who moved a statutory resolution on the bill, said there are serious lapses in it as it does not address the issue of violence on health professionals within the hospitals.Healthcare service personnel include public and clinical healthcare service providers such as doctors, nurses, paramedical workers and community health workers; any other persons empowered under the Act to take measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease or spread thereof; and any persons declared as such by the state government, by notification in the official gazette. The penal provisions can be invoked in instances of damage to property including a clinical establishment, any facility identified for quarantine and isolation of patients, mobile medical units and any other property in which the healthcare service personnel have a direct interest in relation to the epidemic.Offences will be investigated by an officer of the rank of inspector within a period of 30 days, and trial has to be completed in one year, unless extended by the court for reasons to be recorded in writing, the bill proposes. As per its provisions, the commission or abetment of such acts of violence will be punishable with an imprisonment for a term of three months to five years, and with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2,00,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-rajya-sabha-passes-bill-to-protect-corona-warriors/story-S8Lzs9bC4VymQNVfzn8JWK.html

While we are able to manage our affairs online to a certain extent, malicious actors also found in it, a new opportunity,” Doval said.Doval said there was an increase of 500 per cent in cyber crimes due to limited awareness and cyber hygiene.“Financial frauds have seen exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms. The adversaries are tempted to exploit the crisis situation through various misinformation, fake news etc. The huge cyber data floating in the cyber space is a gold mine for extracting information that can undermine the privacy of our citizens..,” Doval said. He cautioned citizens while being online and said a responsible approach should be there while using internet.The NSA complimented the state government and the Kerala police for the initiative.Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said with the increased reliance on the internet becoming a permanent feature of people’s lives due to COVID- 19, citizens need to be extra cautious while being online.This edition of the conference was on the virtual platform this year due to the pandemic scenario .“Various types of cyber crimes are happening in our country and it’s high time that we take proper precautions against such crimes...,” Khan said.Senior police officials, including state police chief Loknath Behera, participated on the first day of the two-day conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-asks-citizens-to-be-cautious-as-financial-frauds-surge-due-to-dependence-on-digital-payment-platforms/story-cTW8i4JrP3pXmnTKje42RN.html

It had served in the UK’s Royal Navy as HMS Hermes and named INS Viraat after being inducted in the Indian Navy.There were attempts to convert ‘Viraat’ into a museum or a restaurant, but none of the plans fructified.Alang-based Shree Ram group has won the bid for dismantling the ship. The company’s high capacity tugs are towing the vessel to Alang and it would take two days to complete the journey, an official said.Alang, a beach town, houses the world’s biggest ship breaking yard.“#Viraat Callsign “Romeo Two Two” - End of an era, a glorious chapter in the history of @indiannavy. She departs #Mumbai today for her final journey. Old ships never die, their spirit lives on,” tweeted PRO Defence Mumbai.Many social media users lamented the failure of successive governments to preserve Viraat and another aircraft carrier Vikrant as maritime muesums to depict India’s rich naval heritage, instead of allowing them to be broken down and sold as scrap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decommissioned-aircraft-carrier-viraat-sets-sail-for-gujarat/story-YFe5Lhk3t92JC2MxT5VVyO.html

Mahabodhi temple is the site where Lord Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment under a Peepal tree. “This arrangement will continue till September 30 and from October 1st, the visiting hours will be restored to the original routine, that is from 6 am to 9 pm,” N Dorje, BTMC (Bodh Gaya temple management committee) secretary, said.Also Read: On eve of polls, Bihar parties underline importance of ecological issuesBut all the protocols of the Covid-19 pandemic will be strictly followed, he added.“Things seem to be getting back on track after a long time. Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, the Budh Purnima festival was turned into a low-key affair. Only the rituals were performed at the temple while the devotees in different countries could attend it virtually on Mahabodhi’s Facebook page. Hope things will remain stable this time,” he said.Rakesh Kumar, president of the tourist guide association, said the reopening of Mahabodhi temple has raised hopes of better days in the coming months. “Tourism season is to start from October and though foreign tourists may not come here as international flights from Gaya airport have remained suspended, domestic tourists may turn up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodh-gaya-s-mahabodhi-temple-to-reopen-from-september-21-with-restrictions/story-xqbuJKIEvm07FNkahWHjPO.html

Speaking in Parliament after moving the motion, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, the intention of the insolvency and bankruptcy code is to keep companies a “going concern” and not liquidate them.The bill will replace an ordinance promulgated in this regard in June. It was supported by most opposition members as they expressed hope saying it would help achieve an early revival of the economy.Here is what you need to know about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill:* The bill was moved with an aim to give immunity to stressed companies during the Covid-19 period as the businesses and livelihoods have been severely hit by the pandemic.* The bill prohibits any insolvency proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from March 25, 2020. The central government may extend this period for one year.* To prevent business being pushed into insolvency, the government suspended certain sections including the corporate insolvency resolution process, (CIRP) of the insolvency and bankruptcy code.* Speaking in favour of the bill, Praful Patel of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), said there is nothing in the bill to object to. However, he also called for relief in the form of interest subvention for tourism, transport and airline sectors as they are also reeling under financial stress.* The Janata Dal (United) leader Ram Chandra Prasad Singh called the bill progressive and said that it will help revive the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code-bill-gets-rajya-sabha-nod-all-you-need-to-know/story-0ZTQYE2nGVTIdPmasi04uL.html
19-09-2020||India||Covid-19: UP govt gave Kanpur hospitals 42 ventilators, 28 returned for being defective||Of the 42 ventilators provided by the Uttar Pradesh government for Covid care in Kanpur only last month, at least 28 ventilators were found riddled with glitches. These are now being returned amid fears that using them could harm patients’ lungs.This comes at a time when Level 3 -- where critical patients are treated-- and Level 2 -- where patients will mild symptoms are treated-- hospitals are anyway struggling with beds and ventilators as the number of patients continues to surge. The ventilators were manufactured by a private company and their engineers tried to fix the machines but failed, said health authorities.Dr Richa Giri, superintendent in chief at the government-run Lala Lajpati Rai Hospital, said, “The company engineers worked for several days to fix them. They (the ventilators) are being returned now and a proposal would be sent for the new ones. We have made the engineers’ report available to the government.” LLR Hospital is the only hospital in the city where critically ill Covid patients are treated.Out of the 42 ventilators, 34 were for LLR Hospital and the remaining for Kanshiram Memorial Trauma Centre, a Level 2 Covid1-9 facility.Initially, all the ventilators at LLR could not be operated because of technical difficulties and the absence of supporting equipment. The ventilators were kept in the anaesthesia department, said health officials. The LLR administration wrote to the company several times and a team of two engineers was sent.The team managed to repair 14 ventilators, but could not rectify the others and declared them ‘condemned’. A health official said these ventilators could harm Covid patients.Similarly, eight ventilators at Kanshiram Hospital were marked as ‘useless’ by the engineers. Chief medical superintendent Dr Dinesh Sachan confirmed that the ventilators were not working.Sources said there were serious issues with the software and the valves of the ventilators, which could double the oxygen supply rate and damage the cells in the lungs. In addition, most of the ventilators did not have humidifier kits without which they could not be run, they said.The kit is essential as it provides moisture to the patients breathing through it. The process helps in doing away with the dryness and clearing throat and lung congestion.LLR Hospital has 30 ventilators at the neuro Covid wards, which has a capacity of 90 ICU beds. Health authorities are not forthcoming as to when new ventilators would arrive to ease the immense pressure on the existing lot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-up-govt-gave-kanpur-hospitals-42-ventilators-28-returned-for-being-defective/story-68P4D3IX4OYGNiPdMGOLKK.html
19-09-2020||India||Bombay HC upholds acquittal of 6 accused in 2009 Goa blast case||The Bombay high court at Goa has upheld the acquittal of the six persons charged with procuring, assembling and transporting a bomb to Margao in South Goa, where it prematurely exploded killing two persons who were allegedly ferrying it on the eve of Diwali in 2009. The two deceased -- Malgonda Patil and Yogesh Naik -- were allegedly carrying the bomb in their scooter with the intent to place it at a site where a Diwali eve competition was being held on October 16, 2009. Besides Patil and Naik, who died while ferrying the bomb, no one else was injured in the blast that took place behind Grace Church in Margao. Besides Patil and Naik, six others were charged by the NIA including Vinay Talekar, Dhananjay Ashtekar, Prashant Ashtekar, Vinayak Patil, Prashant Juvekar and Dilip Mazgaonkar, all hailing from Maharashtra and with connections to the Sanatan Sanstha. They were charged by the Goa Police crime branch. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency. “Today the HC has passed a judgement [in the] appeal filed by the NIA challenging the judgement passed by a special judge acquitting the accused in the blast case. The High Court has considered [the case] in larger detail [and has] now held that the benefit of doubt is given,” Advocate for the NIA Pravin Faldessai, said. “The special judge had said that there were malafides (bad faith) by the investigating agency... those remarks are now expunged,” he added. Also Read: Goa: German woman found dead by daughter in her flatA total eleven persons were named as accused in the case including the two who died when the bomb exploded prematurely. Besides Naik, who died, all the others hailed from Maharashtra and were associated with the Sanatan Sanstha, a far-right organisation accused of organising the bomb blast with the motive to disrupt the Narakasur celebrations that are held on the eve of Diwali. Three accused are absconding. Only six accused faced trial. On the day prior to Diwali, giant effigies of the demon king Narakasur, are erected with pomp and loud music before they are consigned to flames in the wee hours to signify the victory of good over evil.Also Read: AAP’s Goa convener steps down, calls it ‘strategic decision’“We had to prove that this particular Sanstha had the motive to conduct this blast so that there is an (environment of) terror formed in the state of Goa and in the Union of India, but the court said that there (was) no proof and there is no strong proof that we could submit before the court,” Faldessai added. “What we had produced before the special judge was that their intention was to stop this competition not because they didn’t want competition at all, but that their intention was that Lord Krishna should be given more importance and not Narakasur,” Faldessai said. “Their thing was that Hindu Sanskriti has to be protected and Diwali has to be celebrated in a better manner and not in Narakasur competitions etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-upholds-acquittal-of-6-accused-in-2009-goa-blast-case/story-bNKm7El2zWABx22VpmLu7K.html

In a set of two tweets from @KanganaTeam on Saturday, Ranaut said, “People’s perception that the top film industry in India is the Hindi film industry is wrong. Telugu film industry has ascended itself to the top position and now catering films to pan India in multiple languages, many Hindi films being shot in Ramoji (film city) Hyderabad. I applaud this announcement by @myogiadityanath ji. We need many reforms in the film industry first of all we need one big film industry called Indian film industry. We are divided based on many factors. Hollywood films get advantage of this. One industry but many film cities.”Ranaut’s comments are significant due to her ongoing war of words with Shiv Sena over her comments on an alleged drugs culture in Bollywood and a legal battle with the Mumbai civic body over the demolition of her office in the city. Ranaut, recently said she was leaving Mumbai with a heavy heart after visiting the city for a few days under protection of Y category security provided by the centre in the wake of alleged threats by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut warning her against coming to Mumbai.In a video message, Jalota said, “I thank and congratulate UP CM Yogi Adityanath on the announcement of film city in UP.

19-09-2020||India||China wants 50 PLA soldiers to stay back at Pangong Tso bank. India says no: 10 Points||With India’s China Study Group (CSG) meeting on Friday, the stage has been set for a meeting of military commanders of the two countries in the coming week, to discuss disengagement and subsequent withdrawal of PLA troops from Ladakh.The outcome of the military commanders’ meeting will largely depend on PLA’s posture along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and its deployment in occupied Aksai China.Consider the following :1. The PLA continues to build-up troops in occupied Aksai Chin and has started rotating troops on the LAC, indicating that it is preparing for a long haul on the border.ALSO WATCH | Ladakh: How Army, IAF are boosting troops, supplies amid China tension 2. A disengagement and de-escalation have been discussed and agreed to at the levels of Special Representatives (July 5) and Foreign Ministers (September 10), but the PLA has made the restoration of status quo ante on LAC conditional, thus putting the entire exercise at jeopardy. Rather than withdraw in toto to base camps, the PLA wants to have a toehold on the territory on the north bank of Pangong Tso to show its stamp of authority. During discussions, the PLA has talked about withdrawing to the pre-April position of Finger 8 spur on the lake but wants to leave 50 troops at the present position, eight-kilometre up at finger 4. At certain places, it wants to place cameras to monitor Indian movements. Basically, it wants to earmark the territory for future negotiations. This has been rejected by the Indian side.3. Just as the PLA has reached its perceived LAC on the north bank of the lake, the Indian side has reached its perceived LAC on the south bank, thanks to courageous pre-emptive action by the Indian Army on August 29-30. The only option to restore peace and tranquillity is for both sides to return to their base camps and stop contesting on friction points all over the 1597 km LAC in Ladakh. While the Indian side is willing to do this, the PLA sees this as a loss of face for a rising global power and would rather create a new normal on the LAC.4. There is a serious element of distrust about China’s intent. The Indian army is convinced the PLA wants to stay-put on the encroached territory — a sort of reward for initiating aggression against India on the LAC in May. This is unacceptable to the Narendra Modi government.5. With the weather taking turn for the worse, both armies will go into survival mode this winter rather than initiating operations against each other. The wind chill is a killer in these areas with temperatures touching 25 below zero routinely at Pangong Tso and Chushul. High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPO) and acute mountain sickness will turn killers this winter — not bullets.6. The Pakistan move to create a fifth province in disputed Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the occupied northern areas is being pushed by the Chinese through the Pakistan Army as Beijing wants security for the CPEC corridor, which it also wants to expand. This means that the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan will become the border, with GB being assimilated into the Islamic state. The main reason behind the GB move is to expand the CPEC corridor as China wants to create an alternative to the Malacca Straits sea-route by pushing hydrocarbon and mineral supplies from West Asia, Africa and Afghanistan through the new route. With India blocking all Pakistani proposals at the World Bank for infrastructure development in Occupied Kashmir and Northern Areas on the ground of the areas being disputed, usurping the Shia dominated GB by Sunni Pakistan will help in the expansion of CPEC, and also protect the already sunk Chinese investment in CPEC.7. The expansion of CPEC will also help China in controlling the restive populations of Buddhist Tibet and Muslim Xinjiang as the economic growth will feed into the militarization of both the autonomous regions. Already, China has started an expansion of its airbases in Tibet and Xinjiang by building underground pens for fighter aircraft as well as the deployment of top of the line missiles.8. The PLA aggression from Daulet Beg Oldi to Chumar in Ladakh is part of a two-pronged strategy designed to ensure the depth to highway number 219 from Lhasa to Kashgar as well as to push India to yield to the construction of a parallel highway through Karakoram Pass to rival the one running through the Khunjerab pass north of Siachen Glacier.9. It is because China has grand plans for CPEC, that it has no incentive in settling the boundary issue with India as this will permanently block Beijing’s ambitions in South Asia.10. With Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar now close allies, China’s next move could be to settle the border ostensibly in favour of Bhutan like it did with Yangon. Once the border is settled, it will open diplomatic ties with Thimphu and then, the kingdom may go the Nepal way. If this happens, India’s ring-fencing is complete.This may sound like a complete plan for China except for the fact that the Modi government will contest Beijing on each and every point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-gilgit-to-pangong-tso-10-factors-to-decide-outcome-at-military-talks/story-LTJSLWYnBuxnaU2H48DLEP.html

19-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: RS passes insolvency, bankruptcy bill||The Rajya Sabha on Saturday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020 by voice vote.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had moved the Bill for consideration and passing in the Upper House. The bill is aimed at replacing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance 2020.The Ordinance was promulgated on June 5 to provide relief to companies from initiation of insolvency procedure due to sudden outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and consequent 68-day hard lockdown that disrupted the economy.The ordinance prohibited the initiation of insolvency proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from March 25, 2020 and extendable up to one year. Thus, it prohibits initiation of any insolvency proceedings by either any creditor or the corporate debtor.The government proclaimed the ordinance in response to the sudden outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic that battered businesses and put enterprises into stress for reasons beyond their control. The relief was also provided to stressed units as meaningful resolution was not expected in this kind of adverse business environment.The government suspended certain sections of IBC to prevent business into being pushed into insolvency. The government’s intention was to give immunity to stressed companies during this Covid-19 period through this ordinance.Among the speakers on the bill was Congress MP Vivek Tankha who said the ordinance, which was the precursor to the bill, was brought hurriedly. He sought the government look into certain provisions including the one year period clause.Responding to the point raised by Congress member, Sitharaman said not “exceeding one year” if removed would naturally mean excessive delegation to the executive.Sitharaman also listed how the government steps towards insolvency law had led to a large number of resolutions.The Bill was passed by a voice vote. Among other members, K K Ragesh (CPI-M) said why relief was not being provided to farmers who were also facing economic hardships.

19-09-2020||India||Odisha management graduates start home-cooked food delivery platform||The Covid-19 pandemic may have turned the world of several firms in the gig economy upside down, but it could not deter two graduates of business management in Odisha’s capital city of Bhubaneswar from starting their own food ordering platform amid an environment of overwhelming gloom.In August, 20-year-olds Suryanshu Panda and Epari Pritam, graduates from Bhubaneswar’s Xavier’s University of Business, started www.chefjunction.in, an online food ordering platform that fashions itself as the only platform that delivers food prepared at home.“Unlike Swiggy, Zomato or UberEats, our food ordering platform delivers food prepared by people at home. Due to the high amount of spices and poor quality of cooking oil used by restaurants, food quality in local restaurants have always been a matter of concern. During the pandemic, when immunity is the biggest issue, we realised a business opportunity exists as many people may not be ready to order such food from restaurants. After some brainstorming, we decided to start a food ordering platform that would connect customers to people cooking food in their homes,” said Panda, who did his Bachelors in business administration this year with specialisation in human resources.Panda’s batch mate Pritam, who did his BBA in marketing and shared his love for food, was too enthused to join. “Before the pandemic, both of us were planning to launch a start-up in advertising. But after some research, we realised that we may not get the clients we desired. As both of us were foodies and faced issues in getting quality food during college days, we agreed on a food start-up after 5 months of planning,” said Pritam, who hails from a businessman family.The two friends then pooled in Rs 1.5 lakh, rented an office space opposite a mall in the city and hired around half a dozen people. They then contacted several people in the city whose culinary skills were known in their small social circles and signed them up for the food platform.“Before we sign in a person for cooking food for our customers, the first thing we see is what kind of oils and spices they are using. If a home cook wants to join, they call us and we get to taste their food. If we like it we get them a licence under the food safety & standards authority of India (FSSAI) which is mandatory for any food business operator under the Foof Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The licence remains valid for 1 year,” said Panda. “For ensuring quality, we conduct surprise checks by ordering from the cooks without them recognising us.”Also Read: Odisha JEE 2020 Date: Exam to begin from October 12The start-up has so far signed in 30 home cooks across the city and has hired a dozen delivery boys who bike around the city wearing gloves and masks to deliver the food at doorsteps. Till September 6, the platform has delivered more than 1200 orders.“At a time when most of the business is not seeing much uptick, we are doing pretty decently. In the last one month, we have managed Rs 1.7 lakh turnover. We keep 15-20 per cent margins on the food and fix costs of each item so that they are affordable. As the food is being cooked by our chefs at their homes, the customer is relieved about the hygiene and taste. For many of our home cooks the platform has brought in extra income at a difficult time,” said Panda.Also Read: Death of two sloth bears in Odisha’s Nandankanan zoo spreads panicThe duo aims to expand their food business to Cuttack in the next 2 months and then take it to southern cities in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They also want to make it available on a mobile app like Zomato and Swiggy soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-management-graduates-start-home-cooked-food-delivery-platform/story-tGmERc2jDrb48M9bjddQAP.html

The first charge-sheet in the case was filed in September 2017 and named former IAF chief SP Tyagi.’Also read: Ex-defence secy played key role in AgustaWestland deal, says CBIThe agency in March sought prosecution sanction against former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, Air Vice Marshal (retired) Jasbir Singh Panesar and three other IAF officers, S A Kunte, Wing Commander Thomas Mathew and retired Group Captain N Santosh. But it decided to file the charge-sheet without naming them as a sanction is awaited from the ministry of defence (MOD).Officials familiar with the matter said another supplementary charge-sheet will be filed against Sharma and others when the sanction is accorded.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) made Saxena, who was brought to India from Dubai in January 2019, an approver in the case. But the agency later sought revocation of this status saying he misled the investigators.ED has accused Saxena of being a “hawala operator” who ran accommodation entry business in Dubai through companies like Matrix Group. Saxena is accused of laundering proceeds of crime in the scam.Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland allegedly paid Michel, who was extradited to India in December 2018 from Dubai, Euro 42 million (Rs 295 crore) to bribe politicians, bureaucrats and defence ministry personnel for swinging the deal for 12 VVIP choppers in favour of the company.“He was a frequent visitor to India and was operating as a middleman for defence procurements through a wide network of sources cultivated in the IAF and Ministry of Defence at different levels including retired and serving IAF officials. He was tracking the movements of the procurement process files and was sending periodical reports/despatches on the developments to the accused persons connected with M/s AgustaWestland. In this process, he shared the information collected from IAF and MoD with his associate(s), who used to transmit the despatches through FAX to the other counterparts sitting abroad in Italy and Switzerland,” said a CBI officer, who did not wish to be named.A second CBI officer said Michel was imposed as a controller on the other two middlemen, Ralph Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, as they had no specific knowledge in the specific sector of helicopters.According to CBI’s investigation documents accessed by HT, at a meeting held in Cascina Costa (Italy) in July 2006, it was proposed that Michel will join Haschke and Gerosa in monitoring activities with regard to the acquisition of helicopters in India, keeping in view of his knowledge of Indian military operational mechanism. “During this meeting, they had negotiated a comprehensive fee equal to 7% of the supply contract amount to cover the expenses and fees of both of them,” said the second officer.Michel signed 12 contracts through two of his firms with Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland, Westland Helicopters UK etc to legitimise the illicit commission on the procurement of VVIP helicopters.“Finmeccanica paid total Euro 42.27million [Rs 295.00 crore approx] to the firms of Christian Michel as kickbacks/bribe without undertaking any work against the receipt of such amount,” said the second officer.Michel had prepared a note in which alleged bribes worth Euro 30 million meant for politicians and bureaucrats were mentioned. CBI pinned hopes on his interrogation, particularly to identify individuals who were referred to as “AP”, “Pol”, “Bur” and “AF” in the note.The note used abbreviations of designations like “DCH”, “PDSR”, “DG Maintt” and “FTT” under the head “AF (air force)”. Under the head “BUR”, it had entries like “DS”, “JS Air”, “AFA Air”, “DG Acq”, “VC” and “Auditor Gen” and under the head “POL”, it had “AP”. The note had a separate entry “Fam”, believed to be S P Tyagi’s family – his three cousins Sanjeev, Rajiv and Sandeep Tyagi. It mentioned that Euro 6 million were for “AF” (Air Force), 8.4 million for “BUR” (bureaucrats), 3 million for “AP” and 15-16 million for “Fam”.In its first charge-sheet, CBI said it had established the “money trail” of Euro 62 million (around 415 crore) out of suspected 67 million (Rs 452 crore) bribe paid to Indians through middlemen.The irregularities in the award of the contract to AgustaWestland led to an estimated loss of Euro 398.21 million (around Rs 2,666 crore) to the government in the Euro 556.262 million (Rs 3726.9 crore) contract, according to CBI.The contract was cancelled in January 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vvip-chopper-scam-cbi-files-supplementary-charge-sheet-against-michel-saxena-others/story-OES0O0YI6VcWXrUZbw6iqK.html
19-09-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session: 97 people died on-board Shramik trains, govt tells Rajya Sabha||A total of 97 people were reported dead till September 9 while travelling on-board Shramik Special Trains deployed by the Centre to ferry migrant workers during the lockdown period, government said in response to a question in the Rajya Sabha.On May 30, Hindustan Times reported that almost 80 deaths took place on-board Shramik Special trains between May 9 and May 27, citing data from the Railway Protection Force. Also read: ‘Like this condescension,’ says Nirmala as she takes on Opposition over ‘Act of God’ remarkIn response to a question raised by Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien in the Rajya Sabha on Friday on details of total deaths that occurred on-board the Shramik Special trains since they started operating, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said: “Out of these 97 cases of death, State Police sent dead bodies for post mortem in 87 cases. 51 post mortem reports have been obtained from respective State Police so far, in which the reasons for deaths have been shown as cardiac arrest/heart disease/brain haemorrhage/pre-existing chronic disease/chronic lung disease/chronic liver disease etc.” The railways minister’s response comes amid a political storm caused earlier this week by labour ministry’s response in the Lok Sabha on Monday stating that no data is available on the number of migrant workers who lost their lives during the 68-day lockdown enforced on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Shramik Special Trains began operation on May 1 to ferry migrant labourers back to their home states during the lockdown period. In all, 4,621 Shramik Special Trains have been operated between May 1 and August 31, carrying 6,319,000 passengers to their home states, the ministry said in Parliament. “Policing on Railways being a state subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP/District Police to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers and for related matters. Based on the data provided by State Police, 97 persons have been reported dead till 09.09.2020 while travelling on board Shramik Special Trains during current Covid-19 situation/crisis. The State Police registers case under Section 174 of Cr.PC in cases of unnatural deaths and follows further legal process,” Goyal said.In an interview to HT on June 1, Goyal had said that the Indian Railways has been transparent about the deaths, and insisted on compiling a list of them, and finding out causes even as news reports suggested that “eight or nine migrants” died on trains. The real number has emerged only because of this, he suggested. Goyal had said some of the deaths could have been prevented with better medical screening but the doctors who were dealing with a heavy flow of people could not be blamed.“Indian Railways has a control system were the train is immediately stopped if someone is found ill and they are sent to the nearest hospital base to try and save their lives…In case of deaths, the local zones investigate the reason and without an investigation, there are allegations that they died of hunger when there was no shortage of food. Some deaths occurred and we are compiling the figures... we will issue the figures in a few days.” Railway Board CEO VK Yadav had said in May.A total of 113 complaints have been received by IRCTC from passengers travelling on 4,621 Shramik Special Trains on unavailability of food and water during the journey, Goyal said in response to a separate question on Shramik Trains in the Rajya Sabha. Goyal also clarified that Railways did not collect any fare directly from passengers for the Shramik trains. “Railways has collected fare for Shramik Special trains from State Governments or their authorised representatives. Railways did not collect any fare directly from the passengers,” he clarified.“Railways could recover only a small fraction of expenditure incurred on running of Shramik Special trains, thereby incurring a loss in the operation of these trains,” he added. Fare collected from state governments for running of Shramik Special Trains for May 1 to August 31, 2020 is approximately Rs 433 crore, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-monsoon-session-97-people-died-on-board-shramik-trains-govt-tells-rajya-sabha/story-AvX2CNUL3QQnQKnkcSC0yM.html

BSP supremo Mayawati had supported the government on the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year in hope that central policies such as that on reservation will get fully implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.But even after more than a year, the reservation for OBCs is stuck at two per cent and that for SCs at eight per cent, well below the national average, he said.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy to find out if the reason for the delay was administrative or due to pending census.Priyanka Chaturvedi of the Shiv Sena sought that relaxation in the age limit for candidates from reserved categories in educational institutions and jobs be also extended to those from the economically weaker sections (EWS).The EWS is provided 10 per cent reservation but no relaxation in the age limit is given to them, she said.Derek O’Brien (TMC) wanted the Central government to replicate the West Bengal model of paying cash to artists and artisans to support the informal sector ahead of the festive season.Neeraj Shekhar (BJP) demanded inclusion of the Bhojpuri language in the 8th Schedule as it is spoken by 20 crore people in India and 7-8 crore in countries such as Mauritius, the Maldives, Uganda, Surinam and Nepal.Ahmed Patel of the Congress sought the constitution of a task force to frame rules for conducting online classes for schoolchildren and provide help to those from the weaker sections of society who cannot afford digital education mediums such as computers or smartphones.K J Alphons (BJP) wanted the government to not slow down the fight against TB because of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead intensify tracking for Tuberculosis cases.

The health ministry’s dashboard showed at 8am that there were 1,013,964 active cases of Covid-19 and the death toll has risen to 85,619.The health ministry said on Saturday that India has overtaken the United States to become No 1 in terms of global Covid-19 recoveries. According to the ministry, there are now 4,208,431 people who have been cured of the viral disease after 95,880 patients were discharged between Friday and Saturday. The recovery rate is now 79.28%.India, the second worst-hit country in the world, has been reporting daily recoveries of more than 70,000 since the past 11 days. The government said on Friday that recovered cases are 4.04 times the number of active cases. The top five states with high active caseload are also the ones which are presently reporting a high level of recoveries, it added.There were 59.8% of active cases being reported from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. These states are also contributing to 59.3% of the total recoveries.

Sahu, daughter of a business magnate in Sagar district, announced joining the Congress in presence of state Congress president Kamal Nath and a horde of other party leaders and workers at the state Congress headquarters. “People of Surkhi assembly constituency (in Sagar district) want me to become their voice and fight against (an atmosphere of) arrogance and fear in the constituency,” said Parul Sahu in her brief address. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, “The by polls are not meant for only certain assembly constituencies but the entire state is looking at these bypolls as it will show how people give a befitting reply to the politics of manipulation as practised by the BJP.” Also Read: MP govt to rechristen Ladli Laxmi scheme, aims to make girls self-reliantParul Sahu represented Surkhi assembly constituency as a BJP MLA from 2013 to 2018. She had won the seat against the Congress candidate and now the minister for transport and revenue, Govind Singh Rajput (59), by a narrow margin of 141 votes in 2013 assembly elections.

He was one of the 22 Congress MLAs who resigned from the state assembly in March this year in an act of rebellion against the then chief minister Kamal Nath. They later joined the BJP. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Decision of Parul Sahu to join the Congress is not surprising. She was in touch with Congress for a long time.

Their targets included the Kochi naval base and shipyard, they said, adding that weapons and bomb-making material were also seized from the men.Six of them were arrested from Murshidabad and three from Ernakulam were planning single wolf attacks as human bombs, officials said.“NIA had learnt about an inter-state module of Al-Qaeda operatives at various locations in India including West-Bengal and Kerala. The group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people and strike terror in their minds,” the agency said in a statement.The agency has registered a case and initiated an investigation.“As per the preliminary investigation, these individuals were radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Region. For this purpose, the module was actively indulging in fundraising and a few members of the gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country,” it added.It added that a large quantity of incriminating material including “digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devices” have been seized from their possession.NIA is looking into whether any locals supported these operatives and is collecting details from their encrypted Telegram service.The three arrested in Kerala are also Bengalis but settled among migrant labourers. The raids by NIA are underway in Ernakulam and Murshidabad. More arrests are likely, said people who are part of the investigation.Kerala police were put on high alert following the arrests and are keeping a close tab on migrant workers’ camps, officials said. In Kerala, there is an estimated 25 lakh workforce from other states mainly engaged in construction, small scale units and hotels.The arrested men will be produced before courts in Kerala and West Bengal for police custody and further investigation, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-al-qaeda-operatives-arrested-by-nia-in-raids-conducted-in-west-bengal-kerala/story-LZsoOiUxyPZjh1HCfsQ7kI.html

19-09-2020||India||Heavy rain to persist in south, northeast India till October||Heavy and widespread rain in peninsular and northeast India will persist till October, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said in its weekly weather report. Northwest India will continue to remain dry and Rajasthan is likely to experience dry weather but weather models are not showing monsoon withdrawal commencement from northwest India as yet.Due to heavy rain over south India and parts of northeast India, rain deficiency of 30% in the week ending September 9 was not only compensated last week but an excess of 7% was recorded this week, according to the weekly report. “A change in weather patterns which resulted in above normal rain in the past week from -30% we reached 7% excess as far as weekly rain is considered. This change was possible because of a low-pressure system that formed over Andhra Pradesh coast, a cyclonic circulation over west coast of India which brought rainfall throughout south peninsular India. Monsoon trough shifted to the foothills during the end of the week, causing heavy to extremely heavy rain in parts of northeast India,” said Soma Senroy, scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre of IMD.Also read: Monsoon misses north India in September, hits south and east hardA fresh low-pressure area is likely to develop over northwest Bay of Bengal around September 20 which will bring heavy and widespread rains to east, northeast and peninsular India till end of September while northwest India is likely to record large deficiency. Between September 18 and 24, above normal rain is likely over west peninsular coast as westerlies strengthen due to development of the low-pressure area.There is a 12.6% deficiency in rain over the country in September; 52.8% deficiency over northwest India; 33.2% deficiency over central India; 1.9% deficiency over east and northeast India and 75.6% excess rain over peninsular India. In the monsoon season since June 1 there is 6.7% excess rain over the country; 15.1% deficiency over northwest India; 13.7% excess over central India; 1.9% excess over east and northeast India and 27.7% excess over south peninsula.“The circulation patterns are not suggesting withdrawal of monsoon yet. We are not seeing significant reduction in moisture. Westerly winds will strengthen next week due to development of low pressure area,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-to-persist-in-south-northeast-india-till-october/story-oP7frH8PtDtrKg9g1WGFlN.html

19-09-2020||India||No conclusive evidence of foodborne transmission of Covid-19: Lok Sabha informed||A committee constituted by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has opined that as of now, there is no conclusive evidence for foodborne transmission of Covid-19, Lok Sabha was informed on Friday.   It was also informed that food imported into India from Covid-19 affected countries is safe for human consumption. Consequent upon the Covid-19 outbreak in China and other countries and concerns raised regarding safety of food items imported from these countries, the FSSAI had constituted a committee of experts to examine the possibility of presence of Covid-19 in food imported from these countries and address the concerns in this regard.“The committee, in its report, opined that as of now, there is no conclusive evidence for foodborne transmission of coronavirus and concluded that food imported into India from coronavirus-affected countries is safe for human consumption,” Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe committee agreed with the advisories of global organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that the predominant routes of transmission of Covid-19 appear to be human-to-human.  In light of findings of the expert committee, a press release was issued by the FSSAI on March 5 to address the concerns of consumers and general public in this regard.  Commissioners of Food Safety of all states and union territories were also advised vide letter dated March 6 to take appropriate steps to disseminate correct information to consumers and general public to counter any false propaganda.During the lockdown period, import clearance of food items and food testing laboratories (National Food labs at NCR and Kolkata and FSSAI accredited private labs) were classified as essential services and regular import clearance procedure was followed.To guide the public and Food Business Operators (FBOs) about safe food practices and facilitate the FBOs to ensure that the food supply chain is not affected, a number of steps have been taken by the FSSAI as part of which a detailed guidance note ‘Food Hygiene and Safety Guidelines for Food Businesses during Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic’ has been released.An e-handbook on ‘Eat Right during Covid-19’ for citizens highlighting safe food practices to be followed and tips on health and nutrition has been released. The FSSAI is using its social media extensively to disseminate information amid Covid-19, including public awareness material on eating right during coronavirus.  To avoid delay in issuance of license where licensing authority decided to conduct inspection prior to issue of license, licensing authorities were asked to conduct it by way of inspection. This has been extended up to December 31 this year.  The FBOs, other than manufacturers, were allowed to temporarily operate their businesses on the basis of application for license/registration submitted online. This facility has been extended up to December 31 this year.  The FBOs, whose FSSAI license/registration expired with effect from August 1, 2019, have been given grace period and allowed to continue their food businesses with their existing license/registration number without any late fee.The FSSAI also initiated through its flagship Food Safety Training and Certification (FoSTaC) programme, an online training module for food handlers on the essentials of food safety and hygiene practices during Covid 19 through its empanelled partners.The food authority interacted with top leaders of the food industry on May 12 with an aim to ensure uninterrupted food supply while minimising the risk of Covid-19 for workers, customers and players in the food supply chain. The discussions helped address most of the concerns and challenges voiced by the food industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-conclusive-evidence-of-foodborne-transmission-of-covid-19-lok-sabha-informed/story-4b5z2lLVx6wdTAcEqazawL.html
19-09-2020||India||Death of two sloth bears in Odisha’s Nandankanan zoo spreads panic||Death of two sloth bears in two days in Bhubaneswar’s Nandankanan Zoological Park, among the 14 big zoos of the country, has sent the zoo authorities into a tizzy with the officials worried over the possible spread of some sort of bacterial or viral infection.On Thursday, a 25-year-old female sloth bear named Aarti died with multiple haemorrhages, a day after a 7-year-old male sloth bear Debashish had died with similar symptoms. Aarti, brought from Ranchi zoo in September 2013, was the centre of attraction in Nandankanan as she often climbed trees and played with her off-springs when visitors crowded around her enclosure.“The exact cause of deaths of these two bears is not yet known. The post-mortem reports said it could be bacterial and viral infections. We are waiting for more confirmation about the deaths from the centre for wildlife health in Odisha University of agriculture and technology in Bhubaneswar,” said Shashi Paul, director of Nandankanan Zoological Park. “The female sloth bear did not have any issues till the previous evening. It suddenly developed symptoms and died the next day. The male sloth bear was quite sick for some time.”Paul said though the zoo was left with 15 sloth bears that are housed in separate enclosures, there is some concern over a communicable disease spreading around. “Two more bears which showed mild symptoms earlier have been isolated and necessary bio safety measures are being taken. We have sent the samples of the two dead sloth bears to Indian veterinary research institute (IVRI) Bareilly for more tests and confirmation about any viral disease,” he said.On August 30, a 28-year-old Himalayan black bear named Chulu had died. But officials said it probably died due to old age as bears are known to live for about 30 years. With over 3,000 wild animals, Nandankanan zoo is among the 14 big zoos of the country.Last year, Nandankanan had a big scare when four of the eight elephants died in a span of a month due to Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus that decreased the platelet count in elephants, leading to internal bleeding.Also Read: International Coastal Clean-up Day: Eight Indian beaches vie for international eco-labelThe zoo, shut for over 6 months due to Covid lockdown, has seen around half a dozen deaths including that of a king cobra, an anaconda, a monkey and Brahminy kite among other animals. With no visitors in the last 6 months, the zoo has lost around Rs 6 crore in revenue that it would have earned through ticket sales. It sees footfall of around 30 to 35 lakh people in a year.Also Read: Odisha plans social registry to weed out ghost beneficiaries using AadhaarHowever, the revenue shortfall has not affected the supply of meat and other food items as budgetary provisions have already been made before the lockdown started. The zoo authorities took a number of steps including isolation of the animals that were to be slaughtered for the meal of the carnivorous animals.Officials said the zoo is likely to be reopened in the first week of October under strict Covid-19 guidelines and a fixed number of visitors would be allowed. “We would not start a safari ride and there would be no battery-operated vehicles due to social distancing guidelines,” Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-of-two-sloth-bears-in-odisha-s-nandankanan-zoo-spreads-panic/story-KsBtaHAcswn4JW9aJckkRK.html

19-09-2020||India||Pakistan rejects India’s demand for Queen’s counsel to represent Kulbhushan Jadhav||Pakistan on Friday rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in this country. Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, replying to a question during a media briefing, said India has been consistently making the “unrealistic demand” of allowing a lawyer from outside Pakistan to represent Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying.Also read: Pak parliament extends ordinance enabling Kulbhushan Jadhav to appeal conviction “We have informed India that only those lawyers are allowed to appear in Pakistani courts who have a license to practice law in Pakistan. This is in line with international legal practice. There can be no change in this position,” he said. Queen’s Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Earlier this month, the Islamabad High Court in Pakistan directed the federal government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav and adjourned hearing for a month. Pakistan’s Parliament on Tuesday extended for four months an ordinance that allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the government of Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit.Also read: Kulbhushan Jadhav should get an Indian lawyer: Govt “It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel to ensure a free and fair trial,” he said at an online media briefing on Thursday. In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order. Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. To a question about elevating Gilgit-Baltistan’s status to that of a full-fledged province, the Foreign Office spokesperson said that reforms in GB were an ongoing process that include political, administrative and economic reforms. “It (granting status of a province) has been a long-standing demand of the people of Giligit Baltistan. These reforms will continue in line with the needs of the people of Gilgit Baltistan,” he said. India has clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-rejects-india-s-demand-for-queen-s-counsel-to-represent-kulbhushan-jadhav/story-rn9hSyBkOslJKN51NZ4ZKP.html

Our Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar will be participating in this summit,” he said.Tirumurti stressed that India is one of 10 mega biodiverse countries in the world and the country has taken a leading role in the field of biodiversity.“India recently held the Conference of Parties of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in February this year. We had also organised the Conference of Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in September last year in Delhi, which saw the adoption of the ambitious Delhi Declaration,” he said.He also informed that an important event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women will be held on October 1 and the adoption of the Beijing Platform for action, which is “widely acknowledged as the most comprehensive plan for advancing rights of women and girls”.The event will be attended by Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani, underlining India’s strong commitment to women empowerment and gender sensitivity.Furthermore, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will be participating in some of the ministerial meetings which will be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, said Tirumurti.“On October 2, the UN will be holding International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will be delivering India’s remarks at this event,” he further informed.Tirumurti said the theme of the current UN General Assembly session is -- ‘The Future We Want, The UN We Need’, “reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism, confronting Covid-19 through effective multilateral actions”.He also said the UN General Assembly session will be different this year from all previous seasons as the world is still in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We hope that member states take Covid-19 as an opportunity to opt for reforms and change in order to have the future we want.”The diplomat stated that in view of the Covid-19 travel restrictions, most leaders will not travel to New York and the high-level debate will be conducted virtually.“World leaders will be delivering their national statements through pre-recorded videos. The hall of the General Assembly will not be empty. One representative per delegation will be allowed in the General Assembly hall. If they wish, they can introduce the video of their respective heads of state or government,” Tirumurti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-attend-two-debates-in-this-year-s-historic-unga-session-ts-tirumurti/story-SnyU73ejNrhR9EoMw6wZeO.html

19-09-2020||India||Effective Covid-19 vaccine likely to be available by first quarter of 2021: Minister||If the advanced clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccine succeed, then an effective vaccination is likely to be available by the end of first quarter of 2021, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey informed Lok Sabha on Friday. He was responding to a question about the time by which an effective Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be commercially launched. The minister further said that no advance purchase agreement with any vaccine manufacturers has been entered into. Responding to another question, Choubey said that the phase-I of clinical trials have revealed excellent safety of the two candidate vaccines indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Cadila Healthcare Ltd, and now their immunogenicity testing is in progress. Their phase II clinical trials are ongoing.   The government of India has formed a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 chaired by the Member (Health) of Niti Aayog, which is creating a strategy on the procurement mechanisms for vaccine, including both indigenous and international manufacturing, along with guiding principles for prioritisation of population groups for vaccination, Choubey said. The Expert Group has deliberated on broad parameters guiding the selection of Covid-19 vaccine candidates for the country and working in close coordination with Standing Technical Sub-Committee of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), he said in a written reply to Lok Sabha. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted test license permission for manufacture of Covid-19 vaccine for preclinical test, examination and analysis to the seven manufacturers in India. These are Serum Institute of India in Pune, Cadila Healthcare Ltd. in Ahmedabad, Bharat Biotech International Ltd in Hyderabad, Biological E Ltd. in Hyderabad, Reliance Life Sciences Pvt Ltd in Mumbai, Aurbindo Pharma Limited in Hyderabad, and Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited, Pune. The ICMR is facilitating studies related to Covid-19 vaccines. An inactivated whole virion candidate vaccine (BBV152) for SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd using the virus isolate provided by ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.  “Phase I clinical trials along with parallel studies in hamsters and rhesus macaques have been completed and have revealed excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress. Phase II of clinical trials are ongoing,” Choubey said.  A DNA vaccine has been developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Pre-clinical toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. “The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. Cadila has partnered with ICMR for conduct of parallel pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques. Phase I clinical trials have been completed. The trial has revealed excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress. Phase II clinical trials are ongoing,” he said. Serum Institute of India (SII) and ICMR have partnered for clinical development of two global vaccine candidates, including ChAdOx1-S, which is a non- replicating viral vector vaccine developed by University of Oxford/AstraZeneca. This vaccine is undergoing phase III of clinical trials in Brazil. Phase II and III bridging studies have been initiated by ICMR at 14 clinical trial sites, the minister said. The ICMR and SII have also partnered for clinical development of a glycoprotein subunit nanoparticle adjuvanted vaccine developed by Novavax from the US. The trial will be initiated in the second half of October after the vaccine is manufactured by SII.  The trial is led by ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) are also supporting more than 30 vaccine candidates which are in different stages of development.  The government of India conveyed its intent to be part of the Vaccine Pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which may be beneficial in providing access to the global vaccine candidates in advanced stages, for their further utilization in the country. Under this pillar, COVAX facility has been created, which is led by GAVI and the World Health Organization (WHO), for fair and equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine across the world, Choubey informed. The DBT through the IND-CEPI Mission is involved in key partnerships with ‘Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)’ for supporting Indian researchers for development of clinical immune assays to advance vaccine research.  “No advance purchase agreement with any vaccine manufacturers have been entered into,” the minister said.  ICMR has so far spent more than Rs 25.00 crore from its intramural budget for undertaking work related to development of vaccine candidate and pre-clinical studies, Choubey said. The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body under the DST, has supported three projects under Covid-19 on vaccine research under Intensified Research in high priority areas (IRHPA). The sanctioned expenditure is Rs 22,27,579 and the committed expenditure is Rs 3,20,78,161.  The Department of Biotechnology is also supporting 08 proposals by Industry and academia for candidate vaccine development and associated research resources at a total cost of Rs 75 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/effective-covid-19-vaccine-likely-to-be-available-by-first-quarter-of-2021-minister/story-urz5Yft0DVY1u1FHwQm7nI.html

19-09-2020||India||Why farmers are opposing ‘pro-farmer’ reforms||In May this year, the government announced important reforms in agricultural markets. These included deregulation of farm foods from the Essential Commodities Act (ECA). Farmers were also allowed to sell their produce outside government-regulated markets, or Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Another set of changes allowed farmers to enter contract farming. While the government claims that these reforms will help farmers in getting a better price for their products, farmers’ groups have been agitating against these changes. Why are farmers opposing policies which are designed to help them? There are three factors which could explain these protests. Farmers do not trust big capital, and for good reason The entire logic of abolishing the monopoly of APMCs is that they artificially depress prices for farmers; allowing corporate players will guarantee better returns to farmers, the argument goes. Whether or not this happens cannot be said today. But farmers have a good reason to be circumspect about claims of growing presence of corporates being unambiguously good for them. Agricultural input markets , such as seeds, pesticides etc. have seen a large-scale corporatisation in the past decade, but this has been accompanied by a sharp rise in prices of intermediate inputs in agriculture. Data from the ministry of agriculture shows that a rising cost of intermediate goods has been the biggest reason for stagnation and eventual decline in terms of trade for farmers. Given this experience, the suspicion towards growing footprint of big capital leading to a squeeze in earnings cannot be dismissed just as dogma. It is not very difficult to understand why this happens. Farmers are often hard-pressed for resources against traders and end up selling their output when prices are lower. Replacing local traders with big capital will only increase this gap in bargaining power.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Farmers were never very anti-APMC to begin with The claim that agricultural markets were completely shackled before these reforms is factually incorrect. A National Statistical Office (NSO) report based on a 2012-13 survey found that farmers have been selling large part of their produce to private traders outside APMCs even earlier. For 31 crops sold between July 2012 and June 2013, local private traders were the single biggest buyers in the case of 29 crops. Mandis, not all of which were under APMCs, were the biggest buyers in just two crops; arhar in the kharif season and gram in the rabi season. Except in soybean, the share of farmers selling their crops to mandis did not even exceed 25% for any crop. In fact, farmers want more rather than less government intervention. A Reserve Bank of Indiastudy based on a survey of farmers and traders in 2018 found that more than 50% farmers found Minimum Support Price for crops to be the most beneficial scheme for farmers. This number was just around one-fifth for e-NAM, a pan-India trading portal introduced by the Modi government. Even on the priority list of measures that may help in right cropping decisions/better price realisation and abolition of intermediaries (which is what doing away with monopoly of APMC would achieve) was ranked way below facilities such as reliable weather forecasts and storage facilities.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The political economy of big-farmer protests There is merit in the criticism that the prevailing APMC model perpetuates some form of rent-seeking behaviour, both public and private, especially in the so-called green revolution areas. APMCs levy commission on the produce which is sold on their premises. This is a source of income for both governments and licensed traders. States such as Punjab and Haryana charge a higher commission than others. For example, the Shanta Kumar committee on restructuring the Food Corporation of India noted that Punjab and Haryana were charging a commission of 14.5% and 11.5% on wheat while this was just 3.6% in Rajasthan. This commission is a valuable source of revenue for these governments. The local elite, which have diversified interests in both farming and trading also benefit from the process. Any move to suddenly do away with these benefits, irrespective of its merits or demerits, is bound to trigger a political backlash.The resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) from the union cabinet is a case in point. According to the CSDS-Lokniti National Election Study, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SAD-BJP alliance had a lead of 25 percentage points over the Congress among Jat-Sikhs in Punjab. The SAD-BJP had the biggest support among this community, which represents the landed elite in Punjab, and which has also been the traditional supporter of SAD’s politics. By 2019, this massive lead had turned into a four percentage point deficit vis-a-vis the Congress. Also, in the 2019 elections, the SAD-BJP alliance polled the most votes among Hindu upper castes, who are more of an urban demography in the state. With the Congress government in Punjab attacking these reforms, the SAD clearly fears losing its support among its traditional loyalists, the Jat Sikhs. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-farmers-are-opposing-pro-farmer-reforms/story-yE7N4HT8vG6d8ZsEB8McZN.html
19-09-2020||India||Bengal allows tourism in its national parks, sanctuaries; no elephant safari for now||The West Bengal government will be opening up its national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves from September 23 for tourists once again after a gap of more than six months. There will be, however, no elephant safaris for now. The festive season has started with Mahalaya and Viswakarma Puja on Thursday and only a month is left for the Durga Puja, the biggest festival in West Bengal. This is the time when usually the flow of tourists increases and reaches its peak during the winter - October to January. The decision to allow tourists was taken in a meeting held by the state forest minister Rajib Banerjee earlier this week. On Friday, the forest department released a set of dos and don’ts on how tourism would be allowed in the forests. Here are some of the points which you wouldn’t want to miss out. * All entry tickets and bookings will be made online. You may not be allowed to enter if the thermal scanner detects that you have a higher body temperature. No refund would be given. * You need to wear masks and maintain social distance. Hand sanitizer is mandatory in vehicles and boats. Staff and entry gates will ensure these things. * One seat would be left vacant between two visitors. Limited number of vehicles would be allowed at a time so that not more than 20 people can enter watch towers at a time. * All safari vehicles, watch towers, rooms would be sanitized. Only 30% guests would be allowed at a time in closed spaces such as dining rooms. Cultural programs can be held in open spaces only, else not at all. * Zoos to open from October 2. Stress on proper sanitization every day. Things which visitors usually touch such as door knobs of wash rooms, handles, railings and barricades among others are to be sanitized every day. West Bengal has six national parks, 12 wildlife sanctuaries, two tiger reserves, two elephant reserves and a biosphere reserve. The tigers in the Sunderbans, the only tigers to inhabit any mangrove, elephants, gaurs, crocodiles, deer, leopard and rhinoceros are among the few animals that attract more than 2.5 million tourists visit to these national parks and sanctuaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-allows-tourism-in-its-national-parks-sanctuaries-no-elephant-safari-for-now/story-mNi7Cv3XSniXZYPbqaXKiM.html
19-09-2020||India||Andhra BJP leaders put under house arrest for planning rallies against attacks on temples||Scores of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Andhra Pradesh were placed under house arrest and hundreds of activists were taken into preventive custody on Friday in a bid to thwart their attempts to hold Chalo Amalapuram and Chalo Antarvedi rallies in protest against the recent attacks on temples in the state. State BJP president Somu Veerraju, former president Kanna Lakshminarayana, former Union minister Daggubati Purandeshwari, party general secretary P Vishnuvardhan Reddy and former state minister Ravela Kishore Babu were kept under house arrest in their respective residences since Thursday night. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police in Eluru of West Godavari district, K V Mohan Rao told the media that no permission was sought for holding the protest rallies. “Some political leaders were kept under house arrest as they were trying to disturb peace in the Konaseema region. In those areas, Section 144 (prevention of Unlawful assembly) of the Criminal Procedural Code (CrPC) is already in place,” he said. Tension prevailed in Amalapuram area, as hundreds of BJP activists courted arrest after raising slogans against the government for not protecting the properties of temples and hurting the sentiments of the Hindus. The police made massive security arrangements in the region to prevent any untoward incidents. Speaking to the media, the state BJP president said the party would take up the issue of attacks on temples to all parts of the country. “The police are trying to suppress a democratic and peaceful agitation,” Veerraju alleged. Meanwhile, BJP Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting that strict instructions be given to the state government to prevent attacks on Hindu religious institutions. “The Jagan government is resorting to undemocratic means and is hurting the sentiments of the Hindus. We requested the home minister to intervene and rein in the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-bjp-leaders-put-under-house-arrest-for-planning-rallies-against-attacks-on-temples/story-evPKlW43PNnudsEX1KGBdI.html
19-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||By October or November, Moderna will, on the basis of an ongoing study of tens of thousands of people, decide whether its vaccine is safe and effective – with the only thing holding it back at this time being the fewer infections the US is seeing (the study is comparing rates of infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated people). The company’s chief executive Stephane Bancel, who said this in an interview to The Wall Street Journal, added that if the results are positive, Moderna could seek emergency authorisation for its vaccine from the FDA. Interestingly, Bancel’s estimate seems aggressive, even when compared to details in the 135 page-long protocol his company released on Thursday on the clinical testing of its vaccine. The protocol also contained a timeline, which differed from Bancel’s own estimates; it expects initial data to become available for analysis only in December, and the final study (not the Year 2 study) to be ready only by the middle of next year.Pfizer, which is developing a vaccine with BioNTech, is also testing it on tens of thousands of people, and it too expects initial data to come in by late October. In an interview to The Washington Post, Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla dramatically said that in October “the truth will be revealed”. On Thursday, Pfizer too released a detailed note on the protocol being followed in its clinical tests.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe world is pinning its hopes on a vaccine. Sure, cases are down in the US and Brazil, two of the top three countries in terms of case count (both have seen a slight spike upwards in the past week, though), but they continue to rise in India (which is #2 in terms of cases). Worse, Europe is seeing a roaring second wave. France’s current seven-day average of new daily cases, at around 8,800 according to the New York Times database, is twice that seen in the peak of its first wave (in early April). Things aren’t as bad in the UK, although they are still worse than they were through much of the past three months. Daily new cases, at a seven-day average of around 3,400 cases, are at levels not seen since mid-May. The situation in Spain is as bad as in France, though – a seven-day average of almost 10,000 new cases a day, around 2,000 more than the peak of the first wave (in early April). Germany and Italy are better off, although both are seeing a second wave (Germany is where it was in late April; Italy, early May).Hardly any country, not the US, not France, and not even India, is talking about lockdowns though. It’s almost as if they were one-time-use-only weapons (and the jury is out on whether the timing of their use was right). Now everyone is talking about living with the virus – something that’s possible with strict adherence to the wearing of masks and social distancing. It’s probably the main reason cases are continuing to rise in India. If everyone wore masks outside their homes, and practised strict social distancing and hand hygiene, the number of daily cases in the country would drop drastically in perhaps the next four to five weeks. By how much? My guess (and it is that, not a scientific assessment; but remember, this is Dispatch 162) is to between a fifth and a tenth of the current number of daily new cases. And, of course, a vaccine is the perfect solution.India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan told Parliament on Thursday that a vaccine may be available by early next year, although he caveated that one may not be available in large-enough quantities immediately, and that people should continue to wear masks, follow social distancing rules, and wash their hands often. His estimate on vaccine availability is similar to the one offered by Robert R Redfield, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, who said this week that he expects a vaccine to be widely available only by the middle of 2021. In late July, White House coronavirus adviser Dr Anthony Fauci offered a similar timeline – that a vaccine won’t be widely available till “several months” into 2021.Also read: India talking to Russia for possible advancement of Sputnik V here, says health ministryIt has always been clear that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be found. Dispatch 111 on July 22 cited research, and indulged in a bit of extrapolation, to arrive at a 50% probability that a vaccine candidate in Phase 2/3 trials will be found efficacious and safe. There are now 18 candidates in Phase 2 trials; six in Phase 3; and five approved for emergency or limited use (according to HT’s vaccine tracker).The challenge has always been wide availability. And it could take till late 2021, perhaps early 2022, for at least half of India’s population to be vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8ql215KHgajB9aIxYalhtL.html
19-09-2020||India||‘Like this condescension’: Nirmala takes on Opposition over ‘Act of God’ remark||Taking on critics, Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said a “simple woman finance minister saying Act of God is taken sarcastically” while latin word ‘force majeure’ is well accepted. Speaking in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman -- who is also the country’s first woman finance minister -- said her remark is being criticised also because she “looks like a neighbourhood aunty” and asserted that twisting her comment is irresponsible. On August 27, she said the economy has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an ‘Act of God’, and it will see a contraction in the current fiscal. Her comment has been criticised by various political parties. “Many people spoke on GST compensation issue (and) my statement of Act of God was referred several times. I happy for that. People like using latin expression of force majeure, for expressing extraordinary situation. But simple woman finance minister saying Act of God is taken sarcastically. What is this sir?,” she said while replying to the debate on the first batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2020-21. Noting that force majeure in the court for clients is very well but not “Act of God”, she said, “because this woman, who is minister, looks like neighbourhood aunty. So, how can she ever say this”. “I like this condescension,” she said in an apparent dig at the Opposition. Defending her remark on GST compensation to the states, Sitharaman said that to twist what she has said to “say the Centre is reneging its responsibility is absolutely irresponsible comment towards a responsible government which is being led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”. “I am ready to listen your suggestions but not sarcasm. Tell me one state government, which can tell me, no no we will manage it (current situation due to COVID-19),” she said. Referring to the current tensions between India and China at eastern Ladakh, the finance minister said that she does not want to speak in detail about the national security issue but despite the Ladakh situation, the government is not cutting down on devolution of taxes to the states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-this-condescension-nirmala-takes-on-opposition-over-act-of-god-remark/story-iAh74qaPInCMf5VDXW9UvI.html

She wanted a son||A 21-year-old woman was arrested in Bhopal on Friday for allegedly killing her one-month-old daughter since she wanted a male child, according to the police. The woman, Sarita Mewada, a resident of Dehriya Khajoori village of the district was arrested under Section 302 (murder) of IPC after the police found inconsistencies in her statements. She confessed to the crime later, the police said. Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Bhopal, Irshad Wali said, “The father of the baby, Sachin Mewada, lodged a complaint with the Khajoori police station on Thursday about his daughter reported missing from inside his house. A police team recovered the body of the baby from inside a 500 litre water tank kept inside a room of the complainant’s house with the lid shut from the top.” “During the investigation police got to know that the child and her mother Sarita were alone in the house when the child was reported missing by the mother,” he added. Police interrogated Sarita Mewada and she confessed to having committed the crime. The DIG said, “In her statement given to the police, Sarita said she married Sachin Mewada a year ago. In August, she gave birth to a girl child but she was not happy as she wanted a boy. Sarita said her in-laws were also unhappy over the birth of the girl child. On Thursday, the baby was crying when she got upset and dropped her in the water tank. Then, she closed the lid of the tank.” The woman was produced before the district court from where she was sent to jail under judicial remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-held-for-dropping-month-old-daughter-into-water-tank-she-wanted-a-son/story-mztZvLwv3LSOZi2DRuP6nJ.html
19-09-2020||India||‘A protective shield’: PM Modi backs farm bills||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took on critics of his government’s farm-liberalisation plan, a day after the Lower House passed two of the three farm bills, accusing detractors of spreading “misinformation and lies”, while reassuring farmers the reforms were in their best interests. Modi called the reforms a “protective shield” around farmers, which would bring “more options and opportunities”. His comments, made in a video address dedicating a railway bridge in Bihar and also on microblogging site Twitter, came after Lok Sabha passed by a majority voice vote the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. On Tuesday, the Lower House passed a third legislation, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. Modi addressed concerns about prices and the country’s procurement system, under which the government buys farm produce at federally-fixed minimum support prices (MSP) from farmers. There’s disinformation that the government would withdraw benefits of support prices, he said. The Prime Minister said the country’s procurement system will continue to run as usual. “People who ruled this country for decades and were in power… such people are trying to mislead farmers. They are telling lies to farmers,” Modi said. “Disinformation is also being spread that wheat and rice, etc, will not be procured by the government from farmers. This is an absolute lie, completely wrong and an attempt to cheat farmers,” the Prime Minister said. Modi said the government is committed to give farmers “appropriate prices” through the support-price mechanism. “I want to give farmers a message. Don’t fall for lies.” The main opposition Congress and a clutch of smaller parties are opposed to the reforms. A key opposition to the bills on Thursday came from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, whose minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union Cabinet, exposing a crucial rift between the two parties over efforts to unshackle the farm sector. India’s agricultural trade still requires licenced traders who must operate out of notified markets allotted to them. The bills aim to sidestep this system, called agricultural produce market committees (APMC), free up market restrictions, enable farmers and agribusinesses to engage more confidently under a new contract farming law and help to create modern supply chains. Critics argue the new system will lack adequate oversight in its current form. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows buyers of farm produce to trade outside the mandi system or wholesale markets run by states under APMCs, which have become cartelised over time. “The reforms will give new freedom to farmers. They will bring more options and opportunities for farmers to sell their produce,” Modi said. Also read| Failed to convince govt about farmers’ grouse: Harsimrat Kaur BadalCongratulating farmers of the country over passage of this bills in the Lower House, Modi said the reforms would “protect farmers” from “middlemen”. “Middlemen stand between farmers and their customers; these middlemen take a big chunk of a farmers’ income. These reforms have come as a protective shield for farmers.” APMC laws require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where the farmers reside, rather than in open markets, which economists say scuttles price discovery, hurting farm profits. The bill enables farmers and buyers of their produce to trade outside these markets without any taxes and will therefore open up APMCs to competitions.“The agriculture sector will benefit from modern technology and our farmers will also be empowered,” the Prime Minister said.Modi made a veiled but sharp attack on the Congress for opposing the reforms. “These people who would make big promises to farmers during election time, would do it in writing, and in their manifestoes, forget these promises after elections,” he said. “Now when the BJP-NDA (the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-National Democratic Alliance) government is implementing those promises, which others have mentioned in their manifestoes, these people are wantonly spreading misinformation.”The Congress’s 2019 manifesto promised to liberalise agricultural markets. Modi said “people” who were opposing the reforms had promised them in their party’s election manifestoes. “The same APMC Act over which they are doing politics and opposing changes to provisions of agriculture marketing…these people mentioned these changes in their own manifestoes, but have now come down to spreading lies.” Major farmer organisations, such as the Bharatiya Kisan Union and the umbrella All-India All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a front for nearly 200 farmers’ groups, have opposed the bills. Modi said people trying to “mislead” farmers didn’t know how “aware” farmers of the country were. “They are watching; they know who is standing with middlemen.” Producers of items such as clothing, utensils and shoes, etc, have the freedom to sell where they want, Modi said, adding: “Only farmers were deprived of this freedom. Now they will have the freedom to sell wherever they want in the world.” Referring to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who was present on the occasion, Modi said Kumar knew the problems of farmers. “That is why he had reformed agriculture to remove the APMC law when he first came to power.” Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the government itself was spreading lies. “Tell me which farmer is happy? Look at the state of farmers in states like Bihar which have junked the APMC system and compare them with farmers of Punjab and see the difference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-protective-shield-modi-backs-farm-bills/story-e44mdpmxrXUzQlcapsbjCO.html

19-09-2020||India||Altitude begins to take a toll in Ladakh||The Indian Army has observed Chinese medical teams evacuate a few soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on stretchers from heights in the Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso to a nearby field hospital, officials familiar with the developments said on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Some Chinese troops have been evacuated from the Finger 4 heights to a field medical facility ahead of Finger 6 during the last two to three days due to health complications linked to high altitude, the officials said, with the development turning the spotlight on the challenges of high-altitude warfare. The Finger Area, a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, is among the friction points in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. Indian soldiers are barely a few hundred metres from Chinese troops who are holding positions on the Finger 4 ridgeline. As a harsh winter draws closer in eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese soldiers are holding towering heights and already exposed to sub-zero temperatures, both armies will face the challenge of ensuring that casualties related to high-altitude illnesses are kept at their lowest, the officials said. “Extreme weather at those heights of 16,000 to 17,000 feet is bound to create health complications for soldiers --- both Indian and Chinese. And the harsh winter is yet to set in. The conditions will only get worse in the coming weeks and months,” said one of the officials cited above. Also read: No power can stop Indian forces from patrolling Ladakh areas, asserts Rajnath SinghIndian soldiers occupying positions in the eastern Ladakh sector have undergone the necessary acclimatisation to be deployed at high altitudes and adequate forward medical facilities are available to cater for any emergency, said a second official. “Indian soldiers have held positions at even higher heights on the Siachen glacier. But high-altitude warfare comes with its own unique challenges,” the official said. Prepared for the long haul in the Ladakh theatre, India has made arrangements to provide logistics support, including medical facilities, to its soldiers deployed in forward areas -- more than 50,000 Indian troops are likely to remain stationed in the theatre through the winter months to deal any provocation by the Chinese forces. “It will be best for soldiers to lie low at those heights and avoid any unnecessary manoeuvres or activities that could trigger severe health complications. Troops from both sides will face the same set of challenges as far as weather goes,” said Lt General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of armed forces medical services. Chopra said high-altitude cerebral oedema (Haco) and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (Hapo) are among the serious illnesses that soldiers can develop at those heights. Around 1,000 soldiers have died guarding Siachen since the army took control of the inhospitable glacier in April 1984, almost twice the number of lives lost in the Kargil war. Almost a fifth of the casualties were linked to enemy fire before the November 2003 ceasefire between India and Pakistan kicked in. The remaining deaths were because of nature’s fury, accidents and medical reasons.Advancements made in high-altitude medicine, better gear, best possible training, in-house innovations, and following proper drills have helped the Indian Army keep the casualty rates low in high-altitude areas, experts previously told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/altitude-begins-to-take-a-toll/story-uSlcDjGzhv6QetoEetlrwI.html
19-09-2020||India||Govt, Opposition spar over PM CARES Fund||Questions raised by opposition parties on the alleged lack of transparency in the PM CARES Fund, and a comment by minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur about the alleged lapses in the paperwork of the PM National Relief Fund created by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948, led to the first major disruption of Parliament’s pandemic-hit monsoon session, leading to at least four back-to-back adjournments on Friday.Amid protests and heated exchanges between members from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held meetings with both sides to come out with a compromise formula. “It is my responsibility to protect all the members, I would request Mr Anurag Thakur to say a few words on the objections raised by the other members, whatever I said was aimed to run the House effectively, if anyone’s sentiments got hurt, I personally apologise for it,” Birla said. Following the direction, Thakur expressed regret over his remarks. “I had no intent to hurt the sentiments of anybody. If anyone is hurt, then I regret it,” Thakur said. Some other remarks made by the minister about the current Congress leadership were expunged, and are therefore not being included in this report.During the introduction of the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill in the Lower House quickly turned into a debate about the PM CARES Fund on Friday, as Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and former ministers Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari criticised the charitable trust while opposing the bill.The bill seeks to provide the same tax treatment to the PM CARES Fund — created for emergencies and disasters such as Covid-19 — as is available to the Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF). Also read: Lok Sabha adjourned 4 times after row over Anurag Thakur’s remark on Nehru-GandhisAdhir said when Nirmala Sitharaman started speaking, we heard her patiently. “We didn’t say anything unparliamentary. We didn’t even referred to the prime minister. How could he (Thakur) take these names?”Opposition parties have previously demanded that the government be more transparent about the PM CARES fund, a charitable trust set up to deal with emergencies such as that posed by Covid-19 pandemic.Thakur, who stood in support of the bill, said in response: “In 1948, the PM ordered like a king for the formation of the PMNRF. But the fund has not been registered so far... How did the fund get FCRA clearance? How did it become a trust without registration? How did you give exemptions under ATG? I want to ask you all these questions,” Thakur said as massive protests erupted.Chowdhury lashed out at Thakur. “There was no problem when [finance minister] Nirmala Sitharaman was speaking. But [the minister] came and spoiled the situation. When Nehru is no more, why is he trying to defame him?” he asked.Other MPs also stood up, and some left their seats to stand in the aisles, demanding an apology from Thakur. The Lok Sabha was adjourned and a meeting of floor leaders to resolve the disruption was called. Later, defence minister Rajnath Singh praised the Speaker for having resolved the differences.During the arguments after the bill was introduced, Congress leader Tharoor said: “This (the bill) would permit the Government to retrospectively validate its failure and extend the time limit indefinitely while disbursing compensation to states. That is an unconstitutional violation with government undertakings in the name of ‘Act of God’.” Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Ray demanded that the PM CARES Fund be abolished and all the money be transferred to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. “Whoever wants to be benefited from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, let them apply to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, and not to the newly formed entity called the PM CARES Fund,” he said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was involved in the ending the logjam, described Anurag Thakur as a good speaker and young leader. “The minister has clarified and now the House should run properly,” he said.During the debate, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jayant Sinha defended the bill saying, “Credit is the life blood of the economy and if during this time of Covid-19 pandemic emergency, our financial sector suffers and the life blood of our economy is not available, it will be very difficult for our economy to recover, for companies to get the credit that they deserve, for MSMEs to be able to get working capital loans and also for smaller entrepreneurs to be able to fund their activities and prosper.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-oppn-spar-over-pm-cares/story-4FWTQvhz2R2q7SgJizQBeK.html
19-09-2020||India||Top govt panel reviews latest developments in eastern Ladakh||A high-powered panel on China reviewed the latest developments in the eastern Ladakh theatre on Friday with a focus on charting the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), officials familiar with the developments said, requesting anonymity.The officials said the agenda for the next round of military talks between Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers — expected to take place shortly — was discussed at the high-level meeting attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane and other top officials.The meeting took place a day after Singh told Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling its borders, signalling a resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC.While the date is yet to be finalised, the corps commander-ranked officers could meet in the next few days to take the military talks forward, the officials said. The situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area.Corps commander-ranked officers have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. The upcoming meeting will be their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied key heights to prevent the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other.“The recent developments have increased India’s bargaining power as there will definitely be an element of quid pro quo in the talks,” one of the officials said.Tensions flared up in early May and subsequent developments saw Indian and Chinese troops coming face-to-face at multiple points along the de-factor border, known as the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang in Ladakh, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching areas they could previously patrol.“No force in the world can stop Indian jawans from patrolling. If our soldiers have made sacrifices, it is for this reason that they have laid down their lives,” Singh told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-discusses-ladakh-situation/story-AT755iW5m8J3LM9YjCR4nN.html
19-09-2020||India||Nod to bill On 30% Pay cut for MPs; Oppn seeks restoration of MPLADS FUNDS||Rajya Sabha on Friday passed two legislations to reduce the salary and allowances of Union ministers and Members of Parliament (MPs) by 30% in view of austerity measures following the Covid-19 pandemic with the support across the political divide even as several members demanded restoration of the MPLADS funds. Parliament Affairs minister Prahlad Joshi moved the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 2020, while minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy moved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Lok Sabha had cleared the bills on Tuesday. Both the bills, which aim to reduce the salaries and emoluments of ministers and MPs in view of the resource crunch because of Covid-19, were passed with a voice vote in the upper house. Earlier during discussions on the two bills, several members raised questions on the government decision to do away with Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds for two years and demanded that the funds be restored, arguing that the money was spent on the needs of the people especially on local demands which would otherwise be ignored. Leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said it was praiseworthy that MPs were willing to take a salary cut even though a majority of them were solely dependent on their pay. “I would request that looking at the feelings of MPs, it (MPLADS) should be done away with only for one year and that too only half of it and the rest should be provided to the MPs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nod-to-bill-on-30-pay-cut-for-mps-oppn-seeks-restoration-of-mplads-funds/story-K2QAF5QbJWuVvou2oZskvM.html
19-09-2020||India||680 projects in protected areas given wildlife clearance in 5 years||The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has never met during the past five years with all its 47 members in attendance. Only the standing committee of the NBWL, which the board constitutes and is authorised to exercise its powers, met 23 times between 2015-16 and 2019-20, a period during which 680 projects were granted wildlife clearance, the environment ministry informed the Rajya Sabha on September 14.These projects are located in protected areas or wildlife-rich areas, and the fact that such a large number of projects were cleared without the full board meeting even once raised questions whether the NBWL was carrying out its mandate of promoting conservation of wildlife and development of forests, “As per law it is the NBWL that constitutes the standing committee. If NBWL hasn’t even met in the past five years when and how did they constitute the standing committee? The standing committee is supposed to work under the direction and supervision of NBWL, if they never meet there is no way of exercising supervision,”said environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta.“There is no power vested in the standing committee or even NBWL to approve projects inside protected areas unless it is for the benefit of wildlife. The law is very clear on that. The standing committee and its approval of various projects which can cause immense damage to wildlife are illegal,” Dutta said.The Prime Minister is the chairman of the 47-member NBWL, whose members include three MPs; five representatives of non-government organisations; 10 eminent conservationists or experts; and heads of the Central Zoo Authority; National Institute of Oceanography; Zoological Survey of India; secretary of the ministry of tribal affairs; and one representative each from 10 states and UTs on a rotational basis. The board is mandated to promote conservation of wildlife and development of forests, according to the Wildlife Protection Act.“We need to analyse data to see if there is an increase in wildlife clearances compared to previous years,” said a senior environment ministry (forest division) official on condition of anonymity. An analysis of total wildlife clearances recommended or granted between 2010 and 2015 was not available, but according to a paper published on June 26, 2010, in the Economic and Political Weekly titled Diversion of Protected Areas: Role of the Wildlife Board, the standing committee of NBWL considered 244 projects for diversion of forests in wildlife areas between 1998 and 2008. Out of the 244 cases considered between 1998 and 2008, 25 cases were approved, 17 rejected and 202 cases were kept pending. These proposals were for the non-forest use of 2,75,875 hectares within protected areas.The NBWL was constituted in 2003 after the amendment of Section 5A of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Its predecessor was he Indian Board for Wildlife, which was also headed by the PM. In addition to areas within protected areas, any project requiring environmental clearance (under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006) or any activity within 10 kilometers of a national park or sanctuary needs the permission of the NBWL.According to NBWL’s meeting minutes uploaded on the Parivesh website, 24 members met on July 3; but on June 11, only five members met and on April 7, 26 members participated in a meeting through video conferencing.According to an analysis by the Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment, a legal and environmental organization, the standing committee of the NBWL considered 59 proposals between January and July this year out of which 28 proposals were for diversion of land within wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. A total of 212.23 hectares was diverted in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks and conservation reserves; no proposal was rejected. Around 74% of diversion was due to linear projects (transmission lines, roads and bridges) and 222.67 hectares was approved for diversion within tiger habitat for linear projects, defence projects and infrastructure development.“The NBWL has the mandate to inform and push the government to prioritise conservation of wildlife and forests; take measures to contain illegal poaching and wildlife trade and even publish a status report on wildlife in India every two years. This mandate has gone missing in the recent years. Instead the NBWL and its standing committee have unfortunately been in the news for letting go of areas important for wildlife for linear and area based infrastructure projects like roads or hydro power,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.Some contentious approvals granted recently include allowing coal mining in the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve; expansion of the National Highway 4-A, double-tracking an existing railway line and laying a 400 KV transmission line in Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, Goa; the nod given to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project for which forest land will be utilised from the eco-sensitive zone of Sanjay Gandhi National Par, Tungareshwar wildlife sanctuary and Thane creek flamingo sanctuary .In reply to another query, the environment ministry said it had received 31 coal mining projects for environmental clearance this year. Out of these, 14 projects have been granted environment clearances while seven project developers have either withdrawn their applications or not participated in the appraisal process. The rest are pending because of additional queries raised by the appraisal committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/680-projects-in-protected-areas-given-wildlife-clearance-in-5-yrs/story-xw4fTYNZtsGxyX5wSLJCuK.html
19-09-2020||India||New ECI database to track settlements of ex-gratia payment: Report||The Election Commission of India (ECI) is looking set up a national database to track settlements of ex-gratia payment, according to documents accessed by HT.At present, the poll watchdog pays Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of those who died in poll duties through cheques. A system of making the payment immediately using bank transfers is being considered. Last month, Pramila Devi, the wife of late Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan Ramesh Kumar, 31, wrote to chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora, highlighting the delay in such payments.Kumar died in a grenade attack during the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir elections.In her letter dated August 10, Devi said she had not received the payment; she was entitled to Rs 5 lakh as per the allotment 18 years ago.Arora sent an email to Devi on August 26, apologising for the delay. The commission ordered the transfer of Rs 20 lakh to her bank account.“Although money cannot compensate for the loss of his, but I would like to apologise for the delay and assure you that your husband’s sacrifice will not be forgotten,” Arora wrote in his email.The poll watchdog also sent a strong message to state election commissions to assess if any such cases were pending with them.“A stern view has been taken of the institutional failure and lack of sensitivity, bordering on apathy, on part of the administrative machinery, which failed to respect the memory of the departed,” ECI said in the letter to chief electoral officers (CEOs). HT has seen a copy of the letter.The letter asked CEOs to create a digital database to track the settlement of such legacy claims and all future claims. A national level database will also be created by the commission. According to officials, only two such cases were found in Jammu and Kashmir, and they were being immediately addressed.ECI is also working out the modalities of how payments will be expedited to reduce any kind of inconvenience to the families.“The idea is that once death on duty is confirmed, ECI will directly transfer the compensation into the bank of account of the next of kin if available,” said an official.According to former CEC SY Quraishi, ex-gratia payments should be completed as soon as possible. “Such cases of severe delay are rare,” said Quraishi. “Bank transfers make sense, as salaries and other benefits too have moved to that platform.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-ec-database-to-help-poll-staff/story-2o6k8RL2xeam1zsLXUGV1I.html
19-09-2020||India||Failed to convince govt about farmers’ grouse: Harsimrat Kaur Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who resigned from the Narendra Modi Cabinet on Thursday in protest against three farm bills, spoke to What does your resignation from the Union Cabinet really mean for the alliance between the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party? These are matters concerning the party high-ups and the core committee. I can only say that alliance is intact and I have moved out the government because I failed to convince my Cabinet colleagues over a very sensitive issue concerning my state. Did you ever expect that the matter will reach a flashpoint and you will quit?I’ve been very fortunate that I was a part of the Modi Cabinet for six years. We took several historic decisions in favour of Punjab and its people, such as the opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, the elimination of the black list, waiver of GST on langar, allowing foreign donations for Darbar Sahib, road infrastructure, IIM, and much more. I can name a multitude of things, and for that, I am really grateful to the Prime Minister. But I think I failed to convince the government about the farmers’ grouse on the farm ordinances. When I realised that because of sheer numbers, these ordinances will be passed. I decided to stand with the farmers of my state, as they were petrified because their future is at stake due these ordinances. Why did you fail to convince the government of which you were a part? I could not make my Cabinet colleagues understand that my apprehensions related to the farm bills were different from those in other parts of the country. In Punjab, middlemen, or arhtiyas, play a key role in the procurement which may not be a case in other states. I took up their issue at every level and at every forum I could, but I couldn’t convince them, so, I took onus on myself. Also, I think I was probably the lone voice who came from a 100% agrarian state. The officers who made the ordinances were unable to see Punjab differently from rest of the country. What is next course of action for you? My party will decide that. I will stand with the farmers shoulder to shoulder and do whatever needs to be done to get them justice. Do you plan to join them in protests? If required, Yes. Your opponents say that the SAD has changed its position after it had fallen into a trap by supporting the ordinances. It doesn’t matter what my opponents say. They need to first answer why they got the APMC Act amended in Punjab. Why, in 2017 and 2019, the Congress manifesto promised laws similar to the ordinances? Why the doublespeak? They opposed in Parliament and implemented in Punjab... the corrupt Congress government can’t raise aspersions on us. What role do you see for yourself in Punjab when the state is 18 months away from the state polls in 2022? I will play an active role that my party gives me.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/failed-to-convince-govt-about-farmers-grouse-harsimrat-kaur-badal/story-GcoCtZqPcNy1ATcmyGKPfO.html
19-09-2020||India||Self-regulation of TV news requires strengthening, says Supreme Court||The existing mechanism governing self-regulation of media is ineffective and needs to be strengthened so that media freedom is not used to the detriment of human dignity, the Supreme Court observed on Friday, taking exception to the contents of a television programme, Bindas Bol, aired by Sudarshan News.A three-judge bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said that the court will not stand in the way of media discussing dubious funding of NGOs or issues concerning national security, and it is fully conscious of the dangers of restricting media freedom after the excesses of the Emergency in 1975. But free speech rights and media freedom cannot be used to the detriment of human dignity, the court added.The court was responding to the defence put up by Sudarshan News, which claimed that it had through its programme only intended to highlight the alleged dubious sources of foreign funding received by an organisation, Zakat Foundation, which supports and provides coaching for civil service aspirants.“We know what happened during Emergency (when media was censored by the ruling dispensation). So we have to ensure there is free flow of information. But we have to also ensure human dignity is protected and human dignity should be balanced with free speech,” Justice Chandrachud remarked.Experts said that a verdict in the case, which has taken a larger dimension over the course of its hearings and sparked a debate on media freedom, could have larger implications on TV journalism at a time when news content has become a divisive issue.Also read| Digital media may require regulation, TV doesn’t: Govt“It is a loud clarion call to the media to self-regulate and engage in responsible journalism. The court has exercised maximum restraint and has expressed disinclination against prior restraint. If the court passes directions, it could have a significant impact on TV media. In the prevailing conditions, such guidelines will be momentous for Indian media. Self-regulation has been found wanting,” said Supreme Court lawyer, MF Philip.The Supreme Court on Friday told Sudarshan News that targeting an entire community on the basis of dubious funding of one organisation is not acceptable, and calling for a more robust self-regulation mechanism. It directed the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) to come up with concrete suggestions on strengthening the body and its self-regulation mechanism.NBA, which is a private association of 26 news and current affairs broadcasters, has framed a code of conduct for self-regulation of media. It can hold inquiry against broadcasters for violation of the code and can impose fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. The court, however, took a grim view of NBA’s functioning, calling it “toothless”. “NBA says they have a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. They can impose a maximum fine of Rs 1 lakh. This shows how toothless you are,” justice Chandrachud said, underscoring that the fine will not have any impact on a news channel.He also pointed out that the NBA’s jurisdiction extends only to those broadcasters which are its members.Advocate Nisha Bhambani, representing NBA, said that it was not a toothless organisation, and several news channels have apologised and published retraction after NBA’s intervention.“Several Supreme Court and high court judgments have commended our regulations,” she said.“Do you watch TV? Are you able to control it?,” justice Chandrachud asked.Bhambani replied that the situation has improved significantly, but admitted that many news channels were not members of NBA which meant it could not exercise jurisdiction over such channels.Sudarshan News, which is not a member , in its programme Bindas Bol had made allegations regarding the entry of Muslim candidates in civil services. In the programme’s trailer, which was widely shared on social media platforms, the anchor and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan news, Suresh Chavhanke, was seen questioning how there has been a sudden increase in the number of Muslims succeeding in IAS and IPS exams.Chavhanke went on to ask about what the consequences would be if “Jihadis from Jamia [university]” would hold positions of authority and power like that of Collector and Secretary.A lawyer, advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan, approached the top court, which, on September 15, barred further telecast of the controversial programme after it expressed its disapproval of the first four episodes of the show.Senior counsel Shyam Divan, representing Sudarshan News, said that the programme raised serious concerns regarding terrorist organisations funding Zakat Foundation. He pointed to a recent media report about surveillance of Indian leaders by a Chinese company arguing that media has to bring out such stories in national interest.The bench which also comprised justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph, said that national security is of paramount importance but took exception to the manner in which the controversial programme depicted THE Muslim community, particularly by showing stereotyped representative images.The bench repeatedly referred to the visual which formed part of the programme which showed flames of fire along with a person in a green t-shirt and skull cap, and described some of the images as “hurtful”.The court asked Sudarshan News to file an affidavit giving details of what changes it proposed to make regarding the programme so as to convince the court to lift the injunction imposed on September 15.The case will be heard next on September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-regulation-of-tv-news-requires-strengthening-sc/story-Kmgag13gWIzcPgdgII7rsJ.html
19-09-2020||India||Farm bill row: How will the new laws work?||The government’s ambitious farm-liberalisation agenda in the form of three bills, currently being enacted into laws, could see new ways of engagement between producers of food and their buyers. How will the new system work? “The government’s design is that all three bills will work towards the same goals i.e. removing inefficiencies through efficient investment and enabling freer trade. Big companies will meet small farmers,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. The three bills are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. The first two were passed by a majority voice vote on Thursday in the Lok Sabha, while the third had already been passed on Tuesday. They will now have to be passed by Rajya Sabha. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 is a law that creates a new legal framework for contract farming. It is this law that has the biggest potential to change the game. The contract farming bill provides for a national framework on farming agreements. According to the bill’s preamble, it seeks to protect and empower farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services and sale of future farming produce at a mutually agreed remunerative price. Also read: Why farmers are opposing ‘pro-farmer’ reformsContract farming is not new to the country but has seen limited success. Snacking firms, for instance, often enter into contracts with farmers for produce for potato wafers and crisps. However, the new legislation seeks to create a new legal framework. Currently, in states permitting the practice, contract farming requires registration with the agricultural market produce committees (APMCs), which also act as dispute settlers. Market fees and levies are to be paid to these APMCs. The new law frees up farmers and agri-business companies to engage directly, bypassing APMCs. Agribusinesses are quite cautious about entering into contracts because of the way the political economy works. “They feel if farmers fail to deliver or violate the contract, the political system will always side with farmers. There are issues with prices agreed to be paid. If they are set too low, it could attract political criticism,” said Amira Tandon, partner, Agstock, a firm that offers agri-consultancy. Last year, PepsiCo sued Gujarat farmers for almost Rs 1 crore for illegally growing and selling a potato variety registered by PepsiCo. PepsiCo withdrew the cases after the state government intervened. The new contract farming law’s intent is to make sure investment flows into farms. By clearly defining the legal framework, the new law could inspire confidence of both the farmers and agribusinesses. Once contract farming becomes mainstream, agribusinesses will pool farmers together, invest in their land, provide them with know-how and technology without farmers having to fear adverse impact on land titles or corporations fearing sunk investments. According to the government’s report on doubling farmers’ income, the Dalwai committee report, contract farming “will allow smallholders to integrate their production into the supply chains of processing plants” leading to efficient supply chains. The report notes that the poultry business in India already runs on a successful contract farming model. According to the Dalwai committee’s report, 66% of poultry production in the country is under contract farming. Under the new law, a dispute mechanism can be triggered with the local magistrate, who can then call for the dispute to be settled through reconciliation or settle the dispute within 20 days. The main operative clauses of the contract farming law are that a farmer may enter into a written agreement to supply produce at a future date at a mutually agreed price. The contract can range from 1 to 5 years. The agreement must include the price or a price band. If any extra amount over the agreed price is to be paid, the prevailing price in APMC markets will be counted. A big advantage of contract farming is that investments in the farm will come from the agri-business company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bill-row-how-will-the-new-laws-work/story-An3EcV7sbgebbc0yu6PjhO.html
19-09-2020||India||PMC bank fraud case: ED attaches three Delhi hotels worth ₹100 crore||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached three hotels in Delhi, worth Rs 100 crore, in connection with its money laundering probe into the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) bank fraud case, officials familiar with the development said. So far, properties – belonging to HDIL promoters Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan – worth Rs 360 crore have been attached by the agency, officials said.This is the first such case of money laundering when the ED has not touched properties which are free from any encumbrance or are mortgaged with the bank. This was done in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, which had taken control of PMC Bank in September last year over concerns expressed by depositors. ED had given a no-objection certificate (NOC) in November 2019 for the bank to recover the money from HDIL’s mortgaged properties, said an officer cited above. Among the assets attached on Friday include - Hotel Conclave Boutique at A-20, Kailash Colony; Hotel Conclave Comfort at D-150, East of Kailash and Hotel Conclave Executive at C-22, Kalkaji, which are allegedly owned by Libra Realtors Pvt Ltd, M/s Deewan Realtors Pvt Ltd, Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Romy Mehra, and M/s Libra Hotels Pvt Ltd and its Directors; companies linked to HDIL, according to a second ED officer. The second officer said that three hotels are now known as Fab Hotels.“Investigation revealed that proceeds of crime totaling Rs 247 crore were obtained fraudulently by M/s Libra Realtors Pvt Ltd, M/s Deewan Realtors Pvt from PMC Bank in the guise of loans. These loans are part of the Rs 6117 crores owed by HDIL group of Companies to PMC Bank,” the anti-money laundering probe agency said in its statement on Friday.The ED had initiated a probe under prevention of money laundering act (PMLA) in the case in October last year against Housing Development Infrastructures Ltd (HDIL), it’s promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Sarang Wadhawan, PMC bank’s chairman Waryam Singh and then Managing Director Joy Thomas and others on the basis of an FIR filed by the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police. The ED found that Wadhawans laundered more than Rs 2500 crore out of a total Rs 6600 crore the company - HDIL - had taken from PMC Bank between 2007 and 2013. Earlier, assets belonging to accused Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan and Wadhawan Family trust totalling to Rs 193 Crore were also attached and jewelry worth 63 crores was seized. Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan and his son, Sarang, were arrested by ED on October 17, 2019 and they are presently in judicial custody.HDIL’s lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he or his clients were not aware of latest ED attachments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-case-ed-attaches-three-delhi-hotels-worth-100-cr/story-SgDAzMsl9nytsPYd7sQ8oI.html
19-09-2020||India||Doctor who pioneered ORS use dies: Dhiman Barua (1920-2020)||Dr Dhiman Barua, who died two months short of his 100th birthday, was a cholera and diarrhoeal diseases expert whose work on promoting oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution -- called “potentially the most important medical advance” of the 20th century by The Lancet -- is continuing to save millions of lives every year.Born to a family of doctors and traditional medicine practitioners in Rangoon, Burma (now Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar), which was then a part of undivided India, his family moved to his ancestral village near Chittagong, then a part of undivided India, when he was four years old.A scholarship to study for a medical licence in Chittagong Medical School in the late 1930s changed his life, and he witnessed first-hand the effects of the Bengal famine. He held a short-commission posting during World War II and served in Malayasia, India and Burma with Indian Army Medical Corps. On his commanding officer’s advice, he joined Calcutta Medical College for a medical degree, did his doctoral work in Lucknow, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at The Pasteur Institute in Paris and The London School of Tropical Medicine. Dr Barua began working for the World Health Organization in 1965 with the cholera control team based in Manila,and in 1966, he moved to the WHO head office in Geneva as a medical officer working on cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. In 1978, he established the Diarrhoeal Diseases Control Programme, under which health workers were trained in the use of ORS to save lives.“My first memory of cholera was when I was eleven. The village in what is today Bangladesh was dying of cholera. I asked the doctor why and he told me that the only treatment was intravenous saline (IV) and that, without it, people die. And before my eyes, the doctor, his wife – who was related to me – and their two daughters died. Our household was not affected, but most households in the village were affected. People died like flies. That was really shocking,” he said in an interview to WHO in 2009. Till the late 60s, intravenous (IV) saline in glass bottles was the standard treatment for cholera and diarrhoeal disease. “A one-litre bottle was so heavy that to transport it by air was many times more expensive than the fluid itself. These circumstances obliged us think about alternatives to IV fluid in oral rehydration,” said Dr Barua, who, along with Dr Dilip Mahalanabis at the Johns Hopkins International Center for Medical Research and Training in Kolkata, struggled for years to convince sceptical clinicians that ORS could be administered by people with no medical training. Things changed at the end of 1970, when a Swiss company succeeded in packaging the ingredients in aluminium foil bags to prevent absorption of moisture and caking of the powder. Dr Barua described this a great discovery, because of long shelf life and easy transportation, without which they would never have succeeded. “After retirement, he embraced IT and with the help of many helping hands, taught himself to read more widely online and enjoyed keeping meticulous notes based on his inquisitive pursuit of knowledge for knowledge’s sake. He developed a dementing illness in the last years of his life, but he steadfastly maintained a cheerful attitude to his devastating loss of autonomy,” said his son Dr Basab Barua, a retired general physician who lives in Windsor, UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-who-pioneered-ors-use-dies-dhiman-barua-1920-2020/story-AVMPQSkfYOlGjHPDVaXPSI.html
19-09-2020||India||Covid-19: Ensure free movement of oxygen, MHA tells states||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Friday asked all states and Union Territories to ensure free movement of vehicles carrying oxygen as it is an essential public health commodity and an important prerequisite for managing moderate and severe Covid-19 cases. In a letter to chief secretaries, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said some states were trying to curb interstate movement of oxygen supplies by exercising provisions of the Epidemic Disease Act, Disaster Management Act, Essential Commodities Act or other state/Union Territory specific law, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He added that some states mandated manufacturers or suppliers located in the state to restrict their oxygen supplies to hospitals within the state. “It is emphasised that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in the supply of medical oxygen in the country may critically impact the management of patients suffering from Covid-19 in other parts of the country,” the letter said. The home secretary said states/UTs should make sure there are no such restrictions imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between states and transport authorities should be instructed to allow free interstate movement of oxygen carrying vehicles. The MHA also told state governments they may constitute multidisciplinary teams, comprising representatives of the health, industry, transport and other related departments, to continuously monitor the availability of medical oxygen in their respective jurisdictions. “Any shortfalls or related problems that are encountered in this regard, should be immediately brought to the notice of the Central Control Room that has been established in the ministry of health and family welfare,” he said. The home secretary also referred to Unlock-4 guidelines that mentioned the lockdown was limited to Covid containment zones and all activities are permitted outside the containment zone, except a few prohibited activities. “Further, there shall be no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement of persons and goods,” the letter said.The letter came roughly a week after the Union health ministry asked states not to place restrictions on transport or supplies of medical oxygen. The letter was sent in response to a Maharashtra government order under the Disaster Management Act, that sought to prohibit movement of oxygen from outside the state. The Madhya Pradesh government reported shortage after Maharashtra stopped supplies on September 7, reserving 80% of production in the state for its Covid hospitals. At least three other states — Punjab, Karnataka and Telangana — reported problems in getting supplies.This week, the Madhya Pradesh high court ordered that oxygen supply would continue uninterrupted to the state without being influenced by the Maharashtra government’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-free-movement-of-oxygen-mha-tells-states/story-q5HlhyrQOSEUKYxknIIneN.html

The families of the three had blamed army for killing them in a fake encounter.Army spokesman Rajesh Kalia said in a statement that the inquiry ordered by army authorities into the operation at Amshipora in Shopian on July 18 has concluded. “The inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the Do’s and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened. Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable,” the spokesman added.He said the evidence collected showed that the three unidentified men killed in Amshipora are actually Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Ibrar, from Rajouri. “Their DNA report is awaited. Their involvement with terrorism or related activities is under investigation by the police. Army is committed to ethical conduct of operations,” the spokesman said. Last week, the families of the three wrote to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, seeking his intervention after the DNA reports were delayed.The three men, related to each other, were gunned down in an encounter on July 18. DNA samples from their families were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) Srinagar, and the FSL at Chandigarh. People familiar with the matter said the government has received the FSL report from the Srinagar lab, but its content had not been made public.“Our children left for Shopian on July 16, in search of work where one of our relatives, Imtiyaz Ahmed, works in the house of the ‘Lambardar’. After a couple of days, we lost contact with the children. So, we decided to lodge a missing complaint,” the letter from the families said, adding that on August 10, they came to know, via social media, that all three men were killed in an encounter.“We identified them from pictures of the bodies. On August 13, a Shopian police team collected DNA samples from us. We were assured that the DNA report would be out within 10 days. To date, we have not been informed about the reports,” the plea to Sinha said.“Our children had no connection with militancy. For this, we are demanding an inquiry. They were killed in cold blood, and were merely students and labourers. We are demanding an impartial and fair inquiry into the killings as well as the DNA reports, so that things can be made public,” read the letter. The families added in the letter that several of its members are still serving in the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afspa-exceeded-in-j-k-killings-army/story-sN9Dk939Aq3wPEoEVDUvzJ.html

19-09-2020||Editorials||Reform, but consult widely||Nearly three decades ago, India liberalised its economy after a severe balance-of-payments crisis. The country ended its “licence raj” and has pushed a growth agenda since to unleash the potential of various sectors of the economy, barring one — agriculture. Three bills in Parliament are the first attempt to unshackle the sector. These are the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020. The first two were passed on Thursday in the Lower House.Together, these laws seek to liberalise farm trade, enable modern supply chains, allow agribusinesses and farmers to engage with one another more confidently, break interlocked markets and create seamless commodities trade. Ideologically-motiv-ated farm activism and entrenched rural elite interests have created a fear among farmers, which in turn is leading to a political backlash — as seen in Akali Dal’s decision to have its sole Cabinet minister in the National Democratic Alliance government resign — on a “corporate takeover” of agriculture. But the reality is that farmers have always dealt with food buyers, only in grossly inefficient forms. Governments have long been forced to raise inefficient input subsidies over the years, which, in turn, have turned the tap off for new investment in agriculture. This has had the effect of choking off farm growth and slowing poverty reduction. Indian farmers have battled poor returns because the terms of trade have shifted away from farmers. They pay way more than they receive. The three bills will distinctly attack inefficiencies. The bill allowing freer inter-state and intra-state trade rightly ends licence raj in agricultural trade. The contract farming legislation will create an environment where agribusinesses can invest in cultivation without farmers being worried about prices or adverse effects on their land titles. The legislation to use the draconian Essential Commodities Act more sparingly, only when inflation rises beyond a pre-defined threshold, will make India a reliable supplier of agri-exports. But at the same time, the government ought to have agreed to the Opposition’s demand to send the bills to select committees for greater scrutiny of the reforms. This would have reassured agitating farmers, satisfied critics and made regulatory oversight more robust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reform-but-consult-widely/story-ye4N0XFf5oe85QkUpfe1XK.html
