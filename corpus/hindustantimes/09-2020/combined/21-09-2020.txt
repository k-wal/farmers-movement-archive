But gross value-added numbers show that agriculture grew by a respectable 3.4%, suggesting the rural economy will drive recovery. The Centre promulgated three agriculture-related ordinances in June, which were a break from the past when pernicious interventions by governments were justified in the name of farmers’ welfare. The supply chain in requires massive investment from warehousing, cold storage, transportation to infrastructure in retail distribution. This mega push can come from private sector alone. Agriculture has also been moving from shortages to surplus and the policy on essential commodities from 1955 is bound to be reworked and limitations removed for benefits of scale of operation and value addition. These reforms were similar to the 1991 moment for the economy and were hailed by experts. The Committee of State Ministers, in-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms emphasised the need to promote competition in the interest of the farmers and so had the of the Standing Committee on Agriculture in its 62nd report. This had the support of almost all parties. With the government replacing the ordinances by Acts of Parliament, the Congress, some other political parties, farmer unions affiliated to them, and representing the interests of the middlemen are raising a hue and cry. A misinformation campaign has been let loose. The most sinister of them is that the government will do away with the minimum support price (MSP), even though the Centre said that there is no question of dismantling the MSP mechanism. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) and Mandi Act are in the domain of states, and, therefore, there is no question of the Centre amending it unilaterally. Only inter-state commodity trade is in the Centre’s domain. The existing APMC infrastructure is not being dismantled; MSP as an administration mechanism implemented through the local mandis and procurements done by state governments will continue as usual. The Narendra Modi government, on Monday itself, announced the increase in MSP of many commodities. Though the purpose of MSP was to provide an assured floor price to the farmers, over time, it became the ceiling price. With the new Act on facilitating trade and commerce of produce, the government is making it legally and institutionally possible for farmers to explore the possibility of selling at an even higher price, while retaining the safety net of MSP. With competition from private markets, APMC markets will no longer enjoy the monopoly and the farmer will benefit from better services. As far as the argument of farmers losing their land to corporates is concerned, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 Act, talks about an agreement on the farm produce only, and not about the land. The Act has further safeguards for farmers on land; in case of loss of produce, farmers alone will get the benefit of insurance compensation and the infrastructure and equipment used at the farm land has been protected as belonging to the land owners. Even the dispute resolution within the Act has been delegated at the district level, with the formation of district boards, and farmers will not have to run from one court to the other to get justice. The lack of a responsible Opposition has been the bane of Indian politics since 2014. Anything that the Modi Government does must be opposed by the Congress. The Congress, in its recent election manifestoes, had asked for dismantling APMC, but we have abstained from doing so. The legislations will give options of new markets, attract private investments to build infrastructure, help in better price discovery, enabling information dissemination mechanism, and provide price assurance to the farmers. With the prime minister himself at the forefront and the Bharatiya Janata Party amplifying his messages, there should be no doubt about the future of farmers welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/agri-reforms-will-empower-farmers-the-opposition-is-wrong-opinion/story-R5d9E5rIkcvFseXpal5VgI.html
21-09-2020||News||The scientific enquiry on Covid-19 immunity||In eight months since the onset of Covid-19, over 47,000 scientific papers dealing with the disease have appeared in journals. This translates into about 5,875 papers per month. It took 20 years to have the same number of publications on the discovery of the human genome. This rate of scientific enquiry is unprecedented. More than half the publications deal with the key features of innate (pre-existing, ready to attack) and adaptive (more potent and desired) arms of the immune response, and towards ascertaining the long-term B- and T-lymphocyte immunological memory against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The data generated has been helpful in forecasting the outcome of the disease, and developing effective strategies to control it. Five takeaways from these immunology-focused studies deserve mention. First, on the antibody response. The initial burst of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) response that appears around day seven of the onset of symptoms starts to decline from week four onwards, reaching near zero levels soon after. The much-needed immunoglobulin G (IgG), which also acts as the virus neutralisation antibody, starts to appear by day 10, reaching a peak between weeks five and eight and then slowly goes on the decline, three months onwards. The short-lived antibody response, however, is no cause for concern. Antibody responses almost always decline following the initial phase of infection because most of the B-cells that secrete them or their precursors (called plasma cells) are short-lived. Yet, there is a small-but-effective pool of long-lived B-cells that maintain immunological memory to the same pathogen. These are enough to produce highly potent neutralising antibodies to protect against subsequent infection.The second is the question regarding the titer of antibodies — a test that measures the quantity and variety of antibodies — and whether this relates to the initial viral load or disease severity. This is relevant given the observed broad Covid-19 spectrum, with mild or asymptomatic disease on the one hand, and the more severe variety on the other, with overlapping clinical symptoms in between. A study published in Nature revealed that antigen burden is indeed a major driver of the magnitude of the immune response. The highest titers of neutralising antibodies were noted in recovered patients with more severe disease. Those with mild or asymptomatic disease ended up having antibodies with not only low titers but also low viral neutralising activity against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein. The third important issue relates to the cellular arm of the adaptive immunity to Sars-CoV-2, critical both for vaccine development and for instituting infection control measures. Like antibodies, the magnitude of T-cell response, encompassing both helper and killer T-cells, is also discordant among individuals and influenced by disease severity. Early on in the infection, virus specific T-cells start to appear reaching their peak within two weeks. However, their numbers start to decline in six to seven weeks by which time IgG antibody reaches its peak. Like antibodies, Sars-CoV-2 specific memory T-cells are generated across the disease spectrum, which remain in circulation in small but sufficient numbers for long periods, and mount a more aggressive recall response on further exposure to the same virus or during vaccination. They also exhibit antiviral cytokines and cytotoxic activities which are necessary for preventing recurrent severe infection. This might explain why re-infection in coronavirus is not common, barring a couple of anecdotal reports of mild illness. The fourth is the issue of “cross-reactive immunity” between different coronaviruses since this will have a bearing on planning vaccination strategies. Using multiple experimental approaches, a paper published in Cell identified memory T-cells in almost 100% of patients recovering from Covid-19. These investigators were able to detect Sars-CoV-2 reactive helper T-cells in 40%-60% of healthy, unexposed individuals, suggesting cross-reactive T-cell recognition between the circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Whether these cross-protective T-cells can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined. But experts argue that any degree of cross-protective coronavirus immunity in the population could have an impact on the overall course of the pandemic and the dynamics of epidemiology for years to come. The fifth question is how and when herd immunity can be achieved and at what cost. It literally means at least 50% of the population needs to get immune to the virus, either through overcoming natural infection or through vaccination, so as to stop a further outbreak. Past experience with flu epidemics indicates that natural herd immunity is usually attained with two to three cycles of infection with seasonal strains. Covid-19 does not fall in the same category because with an infection fatality rate of 0.3-1.3%, this could translate into several-fold more infections and at least 10-fold more deaths which would be a high price to pay. Vaccines alone are the safest way to achieve herd immunity to the virus. Until that happens, our safest bet is to adopt the MHD social vaccine — mask, handwash and social distancing — in our daily lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-scientific-enquiry-on-covid-19-immunity/story-wlgB3uD2ohMSGbLiQPTwKP.html
21-09-2020||News||At the UN, the quest for new multilateralism||Come September, the United Nations (UN) shifts gears. Open spaces at its premises give way to tightly-configured booths for backroom diplomacy. The General Assembly Hall becomes a platform for public diplomacy. This combination of hushed conversations in backrooms and loud proclamations from public platforms attracts more than 100 Heads of State and governments. These dual forms of diplomatic endeavours make the “High Level Week” or the “Leaders’ Week” unique. While the rhetoric of the “General Debate” makes for media headlines, it is individual and group meetings, away from the limelight, that add ballast. This year, things will be different. As the UN marks its 75th anniversary, all events will be largely virtual. After much speculation that United States (US) President Donald Trump may use the physical pulpit, he too, like most leaders opted to send a video. This is awaited with some trepidation. There is talk of announcements that could trigger a crisis at UN, as the US seeks to enforce “snap back” UN sanctions against Iran. The schedule provides for a 75th anniversary commemorative event on September 21. The “General Debate” begins on September 22 and ends on 29. A summit on biodiversity is on September 30. The 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women (Beijing + 25) is on October 1. With concerns aplenty, a virtual talk fest is in store. However, the usual allure will be missing.This at a time when global deaths from Covid-19 infections are comparable to that of major wars and unemployment is worse than at anytime since the Great Depression. The virus has exposed the failings of existing global arrangements. Some say that a globalised world without effective global platforms has made the virus more lethal. After all, the spread was accelerated by global connectivity. The adverse impacts have caused economic slumps, stoking States to focus internally, reducing international cooperation. Existing geopolitical tensions have exacerbated and global mistrust worsened. The global order is infected, with no vaccine for its ills is in sight. Historically, acute disorder provides opportunities for change. Crises catalyse states to rise above inertia, myopia, and narrow self-interest. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648; the Congress of Vienna in 1815; the Treaty of Versailles in 1919; and conferences at Bretton Woods and San Francisco in the 1940s followed crises. No peace-time crisis, even a “crisis like none other” that we now confront, has changed a global order. Hence, diplomats have banked on the resilience of the existing system and kicked the can of reform down the road. The 75th anniversary declaration, agreed amid the pandemic, provides for the UN Secretary General to “report back before the end of the 75th session of the General Assembly with recommendations to respond to current and future challenges.” Sometime in 2021, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will take a stab at suggesting a recalibration of the multilateral system in keeping with the session’s goal of, “The future we want, the United Nations we need”. For now, he will share the concerns and findings of consultations with civil society groups across the globe, including a global online Pew survey. The statements of leaders will be inputs for him to reflect on in future submissions.From an Indian perspective, this comes when Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, is displaying more of an internationalist orientation than our leaders have exhibited since the end of the Cold War. During the 50th anniversary of the UN in 1995, the then PM PV Narasimha Rao spent five days in New York. He met five or six leaders bilaterally, and spoke once for the specified five minutes. In contrast, at last year’s “Leaders Week”, the PM maximised bilateral meetings, principally with those who he had not engaged otherwise and had several pluri-lateral and multilateral conversations on global issues including the climate crisis, health, Sustainable Development Goals and cyber-security. For the first time, an Indian PM hosted an event at the UN to commemorate an Indian — Mahatma Gandhi. Some among us view the UN from an India-Pakistan prism. For example, after PM Imran Khan’s diatribe at the General Debate last year, Pakistani diplomats made statements against India in various General Assembly forums during the course of the year, without a single supportive statement from anyone else. The UN is a platform to address global issues. The global order is faltering in addressing transnational dangers of conflict, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, pandemics, climate crisis, cyber-security, and poverty. Advocating change of a status quo in turmoil, is a global good. Yet, there is no coherent vision of change. For India, the principal utility of the session is the opportunity to articulate the why, what, when and how of our conception of “Reformed Multilateralism” and work with others on reinvigorating multilateralism. We need to be beneficent in contributing to rejuvenate multilateralism, before we can be beneficiaries of it. Else, international cooperation and the global public good that we take for granted will decline, and, we will all be poorer for it.Syed Akbaruddin served as India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/at-the-un-the-quest-for-new-multilateralism/story-O8E5fGEIybCOkwIpKy2uUK.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Two more arrested for gang-rape at hotel, room was booked in name of two absconding businessmen, say police||The room at Shangri-La Hotel on Ashoka Road-Janpath roundabout, where a 27-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped by five men in the presence of another woman on Friday, was booked in the names of the two businessmen who are yet to be arrested, police said on Monday, after arresting two more suspects in the case.With this, three suspects have been arrested so far while the two businessmen and the woman remain at large. Those arrested on Monday were identified as Sanjay Chaudhary,46, a bailiff in Saket Court, and Jagdeep Singh,60, a businessman, said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal.The alleged prime accused, Manoj Sharma,48, a building contractor, was the first to be arrested on Sunday, a day after a case under Sections 376D (gang-rape) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code based on the rape survivor’s complaint.The rape survivor has alleged that the woman who was in the room had instigated and provoked the five men to sexually assault her, police said.There were unconfirmed reports that the room was booked and paid by the personal staff of a politician. The police, however, said the booking and payment were done online by one of the two businessmen. “At this stage of the investigation, all we can say is that the room was booked in the name of the two businessmen whose political links have not emerged so far in our probe. Further facts will be known only when we arrest and question the two businessmen,” an officer associated with the probe said, on condition of anonymity. The officer added that the names of the businessmen will be shared only after arresting them and verifying their role.An email with queries about the booking was on Monday sent to the spokesperson of Shangri-La Hotel who said, “The Delhi Police is currently looking into an incident which allegedly took place at our hotel. We are unable to provide any details as this is an ongoing investigation. The hotel is extending its full support to the authorities.”On Monday, the investigating team took the detailed statement of the rape survivor to ascertain the exact sequence of events. The woman told the police that she was introduced to Sharma by a woman friend. She had first met Sharma in the first week of September to seek a personal loan of ₹18 lakh from him, the police said. The rape survivor, the first officer said, told the investigating team that she contacted Sharma on Friday for the purpose of getting the loan. Sharma allegedly told her meet him outside the Shangri-La Hotel and that he will issue a cheque to her for ₹18 lakh.Sharma was with a woman at the meeting point and they both took her to a room in the hotel where four men were already present, the officer said, quoting the rape survivor’s statement.“The analysis of the hotel’s CCTV cameras shows that the complainant remained in the hotel for nearly two and a half hours. She left with Sharma who later dropped her home. She approached the police and filed the gang-rape complaint on Saturday night, a day after the crime. Her statement before the magistrate will be recorded on Tuesday,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-more-arrested-for-gang-rape-at-hotel-room-was-booked-in-name-of-two-absconding-businessmen-say-police/story-LwYgs2nlkmRoyTkt2cDWlL.html

While Ludhiana’s fire department had marginal respite during the lockdown, with more sectors resuming activity, the number of fire incidents are also increasing. Though industrial activity ceased and markets closed in March due to the lockdown imposed to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, an average 16 fire incidents a month were reported from March to August. During the lockdown, too, fire brigades had to be called in to douse factory blazes, gas cylinders catching fire, fire in vacant plots and garbage dumps, and electricity transformers to name a few incidents.Compared to last year, there was a 60% decrease in fire incidents in May and June, but the number of blazes are again increasing with the government relaxing lockdown restrictions in phases.In March and April, 12 and 13 fire incidents were reported, respectively. The number increased to 22 and 21 in May and June after industrial operations were allowed in designated industrial areas in the first week of May. Last year, 55 incidents were reported in May and 56 in June. The number of fires reported reduced to 18 in July. However, only 16 fires were reported in the same duration last year. The count reduced to 10 in August against 19 incidents reported last year. Twelve fire incidents have been reported in the city till September 18. Sub-fire officer Navrang Singh says,”The fire fighters had to remain on their toes even during complete lockdown as several fires were reported from the industrial area despite factories remaining closed. One such major incident was reported from Bahadurke Road after fire broke out at a hosiery unit in the first week of April. The number of fire incidents are again increasing with government relaxing restrictions.” “Subsequently, major fire incidents were also reported. In the last week of August, it took us around 22 hours to douse a fire that broke out at a hosiery unit in Sundar Nagar. On September 7, five members of a family, including three children,were injured after a gas cylinder exploded in Basti Jodhewal area,” said Singh. Unappreciated heros Apart from dealing with fire incidents, teams of fire fighters also conducted regular sanitisation drives in the city from March 25 to May 17. The fire fighters say they still take up sanitisation drives in affected areas when directed by authorities.“However, no appreciation letter was given to any employee,” said one of the fire fighters.Scorching statistics Compared to last year, there was a 60% decrease in fire incidents in May and June, but the number of blazes are again increasing with the government relaxing lockdown restrictions in phases.Month 2019 2020Jan 21 15 Feb 20 13March 18 12April 39 13May 55 22June 56 21July 16 18August 19 10September (till date) 16 12||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-incidents-keep-ludhiana-fire-brigade-s-siren-blaring/story-A3rUfkPfSSU4VyerZWyFaM.html

21-09-2020||Mumbai||MTDC to hand over 500-acre mangrove area in Manori-Gorai to Maharashtra forest department||The city will soon get a 500-acre mangrove area across the Manori-Gorai belt declared as reserved forest, the state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Monday. Two years after the Bombay high court (HC) directed various state agencies to handover mangrove areas to the forest department for better protection, the Maharashtra Tourism and Development Corporation (MTDC) became the first state agency to commence the transfer process.The decision was taken during a meeting held by the state tourism department with the forest department and mangrove cell on Monday to discuss the process of handing over mangrove areas under MTDC’s jurisdiction falling in close proximity to their resort areas.“The survey has begun to identify and come up with the exact area that can be handed over. The total area is approximately over 800 acres and it is with MTDC as of now. Of this, some have been declared reserved forest already. However, there are still about 500 acres which would be declared as reserved forest after being handed over,” said Thackeray adding that such zones would have adequate protection and biodiversity conservation once under the forest department’s jurisdiction. “The land cannot be used, and should not be used either. Not all such areas need human interference. So we would rather hand it over to the forest department according it the status and protection it requires,” said Thackeray.According to MTDC, of a total area of 1,074.05 acre across Manori and Gorai, 73.19 acre in Manori and 128.33 acre in Gorai have been reserved for playgrounds, tourist amenities and parking while 872.53 acre (612.33 acre in Manori and 260.2 acre in Gorai) has been demarcated entirely as mangroves. “Some of this mangrove area is partly notified by the forest department, but based on site verification to determine the exact area, we have decided to hand over at least 500 acre located along creek edges both at Gorai and Manori to the forest department ensuring it is free from encroachments and other threats,” said Ashutosh Salil, managing director, MTDC. He explained that following ground verification, the proposal to handover the land would be placed before MTDC board and then the tourism department, which would write to the revenue department for final handover to forest department. “We expect all formalities from MTDC’s side to be completed by October-end,” said Salil.In September 2018, the HC passed its final order directing all mangroves in Maharashtra, including land belonging to government agencies, to be declared as protected or reserved forests. “It is a welcome move that a large portion of mangroves will now be protected in Mumbai, and MTDC is the first government body to initiate this process,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell).The Maharashtra government has decided to declare a total of 1,100 acre reserved forest area with the announcement of 600 acres at Aarey Colony, Goregaon followed by 500 acre in the western suburbs.MANGROVE AREA IN MUMBAIMumbai currently has over 6,600 hectare (ha) mangrove area, according to the Forest Survey of India. Of this, 276 ha are in Mumbai city limits, which have been notified as reserved forest and handed over to the forest department. In Mumbai suburbs, 3,948.4 ha have been notified as reserved forest while 3,706.4 ha have been handed over the forest department. The mangrove cell identified that remaining 242 ha belongs to various state agencies, such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), and need to be handed over to the forest department. However, the latest decision by MTDC to hand over 500 acre was not included in the Mangrove Cell’s assessment, and will be declared as additional reserved forest area for Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mtdc-to-hand-over-500-acre-mangrove-area-in-manori-gorai-to-maharashtra-forest-department/story-xHRUUXtWFKmrgGYOzBFZ9J.html

On Monday, the prosecution completed examining an independent witness who was present when the police seized boxes that are critical evidence in the double murder. The boxes were recovered as part of the investigation of Vijay Rajbhar, a tempo driver and one of the accused in the case. The boxes were used to dispose of Upadhyay and Bhambani’s bodies and Rajbhar was party to the disposal. The witness, listed as prosecution witness no. 10, was first examined in March, but his testimony could not be completed due to the lockdown. The other accused, including artist and Upadhyay’s estranged husband Chintan Upadhyay, were produced before court through video conferencing. According to the police, Upadhyay and Bhambani were killed in a warehouse owned by Vidyadhar Rajbhar in December 2015 upon Chintan’s instructions. Their bodies were then packed in cardboard boxes and dumped in a sewer in Kandivli. Vidyadhar is still absconding. The prosecution also moved an application seeking to read the evidence against Vidyadhar. “We asked that the evidence recorded by the court so far in absence of the absconding accused be also read against him. This will be useful in case Vidyadhar is caught and put to trial,” said special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trial-in-hema-upadhyay-and-her-lawyer-s-murder-resumes-after-six-months/story-bCm1IhpIFWmtABYZcHWYLL.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Court quashes ED’s plea for intervention on closure report in case against Jet Airways||The Metropolitan Magistrate court on Saturday refused to hear the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea for intervention on closure report filed by MRA Marg police in a case against Jet Airways and its directors.MRA Marg police was probing a complaint by the chief financial officer (CFO) of Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL) against Jet Airways and its directors Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal for cheating. The complainant alleged that during 2018-19, ATIPL had done business of ₹900 crore with Jet Airways, of which ₹21.31 crore was yet to be paid by the airline. In addition, the complainant had alleged also made advance air ticket bookings of ₹23.87 crore for the airline which is due. The complainant claimed that Jet Airways is yet to pay a total of ₹46.05 crore to the company. The CFO further claimed that when he met the Goyals’ they assured about payment, but to no avail. He also said that the Goyals’ made ATIPL do business with them despite being aware of the financial crisis. The complainant had also shared details of bank accounts held by Goyals in other countries for further investigation.The police, after the probe, had filed a closure report claiming that they found no evidence that the complainant was cheated. The police, in its report, claimed the case is of civil nature and sought closure of the case.ATIPL through its lawyer Dharmesh Joshi filed a petition against the closure.Meanwhile, ED too filed a petition against the closure report saying the police left out various aspects in its probe and that it should be reinvestigated. The agency asked for intervention in the hearing on the closure report. ED, in their application for intervention in the hearing, claimed the police left out crucial facts. ED claimed that the police did not properly investigate facts about three meetings between the complainant’s representative and Goyals wherein ATIPL was assured of paymentThe agency also claimed that the police did not record statement of Naresh Goyal about the allegations in the complaint along with the details of accounts with foreign banks. Ed said, “Police has made undue haste in submitting the closure report dated March 9, to the court.”It is to be noted that ED had already initiated investigation into money-laundering allegations against Goyals. The probing agency claimed that during their probe, they unearthed numerous foreign bank accounts of Naresh Goyal and Anita Goyal and related entities in the UAE, UK, Switzerland, Singapore and USA etc. ED also mentioned that Anita Goyal holds eight properties outside India while the couple has around ₹180 crore in one of their several accounts outside India. In the plea, the agency asked the court to not accept the closure report of the police and asked the court to direct the police to reinvestigate the complaint with regards to undisclosed accounts and assets of Goyals and his family members.The court on Saturday rejected the plea of ED and will now hear complainant on the closure report on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/court-quashes-ed-s-plea-for-intervention-on-closure-report-in-case-against-jet-airways/story-HOfY8aCuchEW0deH35U6iP.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra files application seeking to vacate SC’s interim stay on Maratha reservation||Nearly two weeks after the Supreme Court (SC) stayed reservation to the Maratha community in jobs and education in Maharashtra, the state government filed an application seeking vacation of this order in the apex court on Monday. The state government has pleaded that the stay was unjust and that the state did not get a fair opportunity to argue the merits of the move.The three-judge bench of the Apex court has, on September 9, stayed the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education for 2020-21 and transferred the case to a five-judge constitutional bench. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 gives the community reservation of 12% and 13% in employment and education, respectively. The stay has sparked unrest among the community members who have started protests across the state for the restoration of the reservation. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is now hoping for damage control to avoid the wrath of the influential community.The state government counsel moved a request plea for the vacation of the interim stay which is expected to come before the five-judge constitutional bench by next week. The state has pleaded that the interim order given by the three-judge bench was unjust and should have been decided by the constitutional bench. “None of the earlier reservation-related petitions which were transferred to the constitutional bench under article 145(3) were stayed. There was no need for the stay while transferring the case to the larger bench. Secondly, the order talks about exceeding 50% reservation and lack of ‘exceptional and extraordinary conditions’ in giving such reservation. In fact, the reservation given and later upheld by the Bombay high court is based on the Gaikwad Commission’s report which has proved the situation. The three-judge bench had given us the direction to not argue on the merit of the case as our plea was for the transfer of the case to the larger bench. Despite this, the stay order talks about the merit. We have raised all these points in the plea,” said an official from the law and judicial department.The 35-page application filed by the state government has another 225-page annexure which include earlier orders and two chapters of the Gaikwad Commission that talks about the ‘exceptional and extraordinary situation’ in which the reservation was given.The officer said the application has also mentioned how the ongoing process of college admissions is being hampered and students are left in lurch owing to the order. Meanwhile, public works minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on reservation, met National Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Monday to discuss the issue. He reportedly briefed Pawar about the stand taken by the state government. Pawar had suggested the option of an ordinance to safeguard the reservation in college admissions. Legal experts and the law and judiciary department of the government have, however, advised the government against it. According to them, the ordinance is not maintainable on legal grounds and was likely to be struck down by the court. “The review petition, too, cannot be filed in an interim order. The plea for the vacation of the interim stay was the only valid way out and we have opted for it,” said a minister requesting anonymity.Chavan later said the state government will push for early decision on the reservation in the Apex court.Meanwhile, Dhangar community, too, has started a state-wide protest for their inclusion in the Scheduled Tribe category. After their protest in Parbhani, Bharatiya Janata Party legislator and community leader Gopichand Padalkar said they would intensify the protest if the government does not start issuing them certificates under the ST category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-files-application-seeking-to-vacate-sc-s-interim-stay-on-maratha-reservation/story-n4CTUmSOsB2ieHczqIMKwK.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to interfere with restrictions on online classes||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday refused to interfere with the restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra school education department on the duration of daily online classes for pre-primary to junior college students.“We are judges. We are not educationists with degrees in child psychology; how can we decide as to what should be the duration of online classes,” said the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni.The bench allowed the petitioner, Parent Teachers Association United Forum, which filed the petition challenging the government resolution (GR) issued by the school education department on July 22, to make a representation to the department. The department, in turn, is directed to decide on the representation, if so filed, as expeditiously as possible.The July 22 GR restricts online classes for pre-primary to junior colleges for five days a week from Monday to Friday. It allows just one session of maximum 30 minutes every day, in the form of more interaction with parents, for pre-primary section. For Class 1 and 2, it allows two daily sessions of 30 minutes including interaction with parents. For Classes 3 to 8, it allows daily two sessions of 45 minutes each, and four such sessions for junior college students.Counsel for the petitioner, senior advocate Mihir Desai, submitted that the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 requires certain minimum hours of schooling every day, and the duration of the online classes is one such area which the state government cannot touch.The state government had no power to restrict schools in such a manner, Desai submitted, adding that the parents want their children to learn more.Judges, however, said that online classes were required to be held because of the peculiar circumstances created by the Covid-19 pandemic and also noted that the GR was issued after parents approached the department complaining about unreasonably long duration of online classes and lack of schedule for the online classes. The bench held that the petitioner should approach the government and make a representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-restrictions-on-online-classes/story-rGqyjE1d5hxvG5IbvBnmfK.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt clarifies 100% attendance not binding; decision left to colleges or universities||Three days after the state government released a government resolution (GR) making 100% attendance compulsory for all teaching and non-teaching staff of colleges, the department of higher and technical education released a clarification on Monday.In its clarification, the state has specified that 100% attendance is not binding, and respective colleges or universities can decide how many staff members, especially from the examination department, need to be present in order to ensure smooth functioning of the upcoming online exams for final-year (summer 2020) students. It further states that institutes can also decide if physical presence of the staff is required for exams or whether they can smoothly conduct exams through online presence.The previous GR dated September 18 had highlighted that based on the Supreme Court judgement of August 28 to conduct final-semester exams and to conduct the same, teaching and non-teaching staff will be required in absolute numbers. It further stated that the practice of conducting examination includes several processes like question paper preparation, assessment of answer sheets, preparation of mark sheets and declaration of results; and all this work will require a large amount of manpower. “To complete the challenging task, 100% attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff is required henceforth,” stated the September 18 GR.This, however, received flak from the teacher community across the state and a petition of almost 2,000 teachers from across the state was sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office on September 19. “The call for 100% attendance at a time when the state is still witnessing spike in Covid-19 cases was unnecessary, and we are glad that the government understood our plight and clarified their stand on the GR,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president, Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO).Meanwhile, a delegation of college representatives has approached the Central government and railway ministry for help in this matter. “If at all any college in Mumbai plans to call their staff to work, the government needs to help us by ensuring that these teachers and non-teaching staff members will be allowed to travel by train to and from work,” said T Shiware, chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-clarifies-100-attendance-not-binding-decision-left-to-colleges-or-universities/story-VHYCjzfroTlgFzFdo4L6JN.html

The Commission will boost resources deployed on ground to ensure lesser gathering and maximum following of Covid-19 safety protocols. The Commission will also decide on visiting Bihar within the next two to three days, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said on Monday. Arora was addressing an international webinar on hosted by ECI on ‘issues, challenges and protocols for conducting elections during Covid-19.Stating total number of electors in Bihar – 72.9 million, Arora said conducting polls in India pose formidable challenges, given the vast electorate, geographical and linguistic diversity.The term of the 243-member Bihar assembly ends on November 29 and elections are likely to be held sometime in October-November.The Commission has reworked the guidelines to conduct the polls in Bihar by reducing the number of electors per polling station from 1,500 to 1,000 and increasing the number of polling stations by 40 per cent from 65,000 to 1 lakh, Arora said, adding that these changes entail huge logistics and manpower implications.The CEC added that the poll body will work on extending facilities to senior citizens, women, persons with disabilities to make the exercise more people-friendly. In a bid to include people infected by the viral contagion, Arora said the facility of postal ballot facility will be extended to Covid-19 patients who are in quarantine or are hospitalised.

21-09-2020||City||Restructure developers’ business loans to revive realty sector: RERA to RBI||The real estate regulatory authority (RERA) has requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow developers’ business loans to be restructured to help the sector, which is going through a severe crisis amid the economic slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of the around 600 promoters operating in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway are facing a liquidity crisis and are thus unable to deliver flats to homebuyers, the authority said in a letter to RBI.The RERA sent the letter in August  after it realised that work on most of the realty projects had been disrupted due to fund crunch, affecting the interest of homebuyers.In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway alone, there are at least 600 ongoing realty projects, in which thousands of homebuyers have invested at least R50,000 crore, said an estimate made by the developers.“The financial institutions are reluctant in providing last-mile funding to promoters. As a result, most ongoing realty projects are facing problems and are in dire need of funding to finish and deliver. Therefore, we suggested to RBI to ask banks to restructure the existing loans so that promoters start getting funds to spend on construction and the sector is revived. We hope for a positive outcome on this,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman of UPRERA.The RERA said the restructure will allow borrowers (promoters) to get relaxations in payment time, reduced monthly instalments, change in interest rate and an opportunity to borrow more, among other benefits.The developers’ groups -- the national real estate development corporation (NAREDCO) and the confederation of real estate developers association of India -- have been demanding restructuring of loans for a long time, a move they say can help deliver many stuck projects in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas.“The banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) have completely stopped giving new loans and are not keen to offer last-mile funding, which was earlier easier to get to deliver projects on an advanced delivery stage. Fund crisis was already there before Covid pandemic. But now without banks’ support, it is not easy to handle the crisis,” said RK Arora, president of Uttar Pradesh NAREDCO, which has written to the ministry of finance.The developers have requested UPRERA to help them deal with the financial crisis.“We have been requesting all government bodies, including UPRERA, that without the restructuring of the existing business loans, it is hard to tide over the crisis and deliver units to homebuyers. We hope restructuring will be expedited to help revive the realty sector. We hope the UPRERA will help in finding a solution to the financial crisis,” said Prashant Tiwari president of the Western UP wing of the confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI).“The RBI or the government should take much-needed and effective steps to address the financial crisis that the real estate sector has been facing for a long time. If this financial crisis continues longer, it will affect the homebuyers’ interest to a large extent because the developers are not delivering the projects,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of the Noida Extension flat owners welfare association.RBI couldn’t be reached for a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restructure-developers-business-loans-to-revive-realty-sector-rera-to-rbi/story-GhfZ5eshkypCgbCaizGuJN.html
21-09-2020||City||Five runways feasible at Jewar airport, PricewaterhouseCoopers inform Yamuna authority||International consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has suggested the possibility of three more runways, in addition to the two recommended earlier, at the Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar, scheduled to come up along the 165km Yamuna Expressway, said officials.According to the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), PwC has almost finished the techno-economic feasibility study into more runways proposed on the Airport.“The PwC gave a presentation on techno-economic feasibility report on Friday, informing us that three more runways are feasible on the 5,000 acres of land notified for the airport at Jewar, bringing the total runway capacity of the airport to five. The PwC will submit the report on this within a week’s time now, as the work is almost complete,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The Authority, on February 29 this year in its 67th board meeting, had approved a decision to expand the airport. The board had then hired PwC to work out the plan, which started work on the techno-economic feasibility report (TEFR) for the second phase for this mega project.The airport project has been divided in two phases – two runways in phase 1 and three runways in phase 2.For the first phase the state government has acquired 1,334 hectares of land. The concessionaire – Swiss firm Zurich Airport International AG – is likely to start work at the site soon after travel restrictions, imposed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease pandemic, are lifted.Land for the 3,666 hectares needed for the second phase will be acquired at a later stage. As per the original plan, the airport has been scheduled for completion by 2022.Once the techno-economic feasibility report is submitted, the state government will approve the same in the cabinet, before the land acquisition (for the second phase) for the three runways will begin on ground.“Once the report is submitted, in a week’s time, we will send the same to the state government, which will then send it to the cabinet for approval,” said Singh.Originally, the PwC had a mandate to prepare TEFR for four more new runways at this site.“However, only five runways can be developed on this land notified, as per discussions with PwC so far. If more runways are needed in the future, the state government can notify more land for the same, depending upon the requirement,” the CEO added.The Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) and Yeida hope that the airport concessionaire - Zurich Airport international AG - and the special purpose vehicle - the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited - sign the concessionaire agreement before October 15, given that restrictions over air travel are relaxed by that time.“Once the agreement is signed, Zurich AG will start work at the site,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-runways-feasible-at-jewar-airport-pricewaterhousecoopers-inform-yamuna-authority/story-8wPCOjMHX2jM39Sid1QahN.html

According to the police, the incident was reported in the morning around 4am, when the guard, Rishabh, alleged he was bound and injured by unidentified men.“There were two guards. Rishabh was posted at the main gate while the other guard, Sabir, was sleeping in a room next to the gate with the keys. Rishabh was injured while Sabir claims he was asleep the entire time and doesn’t know anything,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh. Police said there were no signs of forced entry in the building, which suggests that the burglars had insider help. The employees of the firm are being questioned and a search is on for the suspects, said the police.The factory has several CCTV cameras but the suspects decamped with the DVR, in addition to ₹20,000 from the owner’s office and another ₹30,000 from a printing press located on the first floor, said the police.“Based on the complaint of the owner, we have registered a case at the Sector 20 police station under Section 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the IPC,” said a police officer.According to Mehtab, the owner’s nephew, “The burglars entered the premises by jumping over the boundary wall, after which they held the guard at the main gate at knife point, before entering the building.”Police also said that a robbery had occurred in the same company almost a month back in which equipment worth ₹3.5 lakh had been taken.In a separate incident, a 24-year-old security guard was robbed of his duty rifle, in an area under the Bisrakh police.The victim, Akash Dixit, was on his way to work on Sunday night when three men on a motorcycle intercepted him, held him at gunpoint and robbed him of his rifle. Based on his complaint, a case of robbery (Section 392 of the IPC) was registered at the Bisrakh police station and a search is on for the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/security-guard-assaulted-during-robbery-at-factory-assailants-make-off-with-50-000-cash/story-v2UFukglkLq9M5aRnoC64O.html
21-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 2 dead in hit-and-run accident on Hindon elevated road||Two young men, who were on a motorcycle, died in an accident on the Hindon elevated road in a case of hit and run, on Sunday night. According to the police, their motorcycle was hit by an unidentified vehicle near Vaishali, and the erring driver fled the spot. The victims, both residents of Arthala, were identified as Mohammad Sakib, 23, and Mohammad Arshad, 22. “They both died after their motorcycle was hit by an unidentified vehicle. An FIR was lodged but so far, there is no clue about the erring vehicle. It was a case of hit and run. The elevated road, at present, is without any surveillance system and it becomes difficult for the police to track erring vehicles in accident cases,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). The 10.3km Hindon elevated road acts as a major bypass for commuters travelling between Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh, connecting Raj Nagar Extension to UP-Gate. The stretch, however, is without any CCTV cameras or surveillance systems in place to keep a check over speeding and erring vehicles in accident cases.The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) in 2018 had proposed the integrated traffic management system (ITMS) project for Ghaziabad city and it included the elevated road. The authority, at present, has set the speed limit for vehicles at 80kmph on the elevated road, against its design speed of 100kmph.“The elevated road has high volume of traffic but it is without any surveillance. We had filed an RTI application raising our concerns with GDA, to which they replied that the works will be taken up under ITMS project. Now, the project is dropped. However, considering risk to commuters, the authority must get the project executed,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners. Under ITMS, costing about ₹70 crore, the authority had identified 18 corridors where hi-tech traffic surveillance and traffic management systems were to be installed. Earlier in January, some work was initiated at the elevated road to Tulsi Niketan, but the project ran into rough weather. Officials from the GDA’s engineering department said ITMS was dropped due to various issues, which included problems with the firm which was given the contract. “ITMS has been dropped from our side. It was include the elevated road. ITMS was one of the priority projects of the CM. We have stopped the work as fund sharing with other agencies was also an issue,” said VN Singh, GDA’s chief engineer. “We have also written to the state administration. In case they wish to restart the project, the urban development department should take steps. In case the government asks GDA to do the project, state officials should provide us terms and conditions and also decide the funding pattern,” he added. The foundation stone for ITMS was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visited Ghaziabad in May 2018.For now, the elevated road is bereft of surveillance modes. “There were issues due to which the project could not take off. We had started the work for the first corridor of the Hindon elevated road but the authority stopped the project. There were also some funding issues and we got no payment. We have now sent representations to the office of the CM about the issues. Our firm has taken up as many as 10 projects in different cities across the country, including Lucknow,” said Neeraj Kushwaha, the director of the firm which was given the contract for ITMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-2-dead-in-hit-and-run-accident-on-hindon-elevated-road/story-00J1iLaDhhcaeaUIHt5O3L.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram conducts more than one lakh antigen tests since June, shows data||More than one lakh rapid antigen tests have been conducted in the district till now, as per the data shared by the district health department. Since June 24, when the first antigen test was conducted in Sadar Bazar, the district health department has conducted a total of 1,00,009 antigen tests till Sunday, while on Monday 1,004 additional tests were administered in both government and private facilities. Health officials, however, clarified that the target is to keep antigen testing below 40% of the total number of tests administered in a day. Till now, at least 2,31,468 tests have been administered in the district since the pandemic, including both antigen and the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Health officials said that in compliance with the revised guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the first week of September, the focus is on increasing the RT-PCR tests overall, while restricting the antigen tests largely to containment zones. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Rapid antigen test is a useful diagnostic tool for mass survey and active surveillance especially in containment zones. As per the ICMR guidelines, the population in areas having widespread transmission of infection should be tested through antigen testing kits for early detection. In other scenarios, RT-PCR is being administered as it is easily accessible and more accurate. We are going with 60:40 ratio to keep a check on spread of infection.”According to Yadav, for the last one month 38% antigen tests are being conducted regularly, while 62% RT-PCR is administered. On Monday, out of the 3,001 tests, 1,997 RT-PCR and 1,004 antigen tests were conducted. “Antigen tests will remain below 40% as it is restricted to only Covid-19 affected areas,” said Yadav. The antigen diagnostic test detects proteins attached to coronavirus or within it by testing the sample collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. One of the advantages of the antigen test is its speed as it delivers the results in 15-20 minutes. However, it may not detect all the active infections as it is not as sensitive as the molecular RT-PCR tests. It means positive antigen test result is accurate, but there are chances of false negatives as well. Therefore, the negative results have to be confirmed through RT-PCR, especially in symptomatic cases. Data shows that of the one lakh antigen tests, only 2,766 were confirmed true positive. “The positivity rate of antigen testing is almost 2.8%. To ensure active cases are not missed, nearly 13,000 antigen negatives were administered RT-PCR, out of which almost 800 people were confirmed Covid-19 positive. RT-PCR is conducted in only those cases where the person is symptomatic yet negative for the antigen test,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma. On the other hand, private labs are doing almost negligible number of antigen tests compared to government facility. Every day, less than 100 antigen tests are being conducted across the seven private labs in the city. On Monday, only 83 tests were conducted in private facilities. According to lab representatives, as reported by HT earlier this week, antigen test is not preferred due to false negatives. Following up with such patients also becomes challenging if they come without a prescription.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-conducts-more-than-one-lakh-antigen-tests-since-june-shows-data/story-DwikyJ7nutmXnTO9dx0jsI.html
21-09-2020||Noida||Noida lab tests samples of parliamentarians for Covid-19||Noida’s National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) in Sector 39A is testing samples for Covid-19 of all MPs attending the ongoing parliament session that kicked off on September 14.Members of both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha need to mandatorily undergo Covid-19 testing through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests—the gold-standard for testing for coronavirus testing— before entering the parliament for the ongoing monsoon session.The Noida lab, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27 through video conferencing, has tested a total of nearly 60,000 samples so far. Dr Shalini Singh, director, NICPR said that the institute’s lab is now also testing samples of parliamentarians after they are collected by health officials in Delhi. “We are conducting RT-PCR tests for the lawmakers here. Our laboratory is equipped with 12 RT-PCR machines and four automatic RNA extractors. The lab has a capacity to test 7,000 samples in a day,” she said.“We also conduct tests of dengue and other viral diseases here. But since testing for Covid-19 is a top priority these days, we are mainly focusing on RT-PCR tests,” she said.Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union minister of state for health and family welfare, said PM Modi had inaugurated the laboratory a video conference along with similar laboratories in Mumbai and Kolkata. “These are high-output laboratories which use either a single high-functioning machine that can test high volumes of samples or multiple machines to increase capacity and help increase testing capacity multifold,” he said.He further said that the biosafety level-2 laboratory, with a capacity of testing up to 7,000 samples daily, will not only help in ramp up testing in Noida, but will also facilitate testing in other neighbouring districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-lab-tests-samples-of-parliamentarians-for-covid-19/story-DSSos6hoh35u7wADSxRGKP.html
21-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad approves hiring of more lab technicians, to increase daily testing to 5,000 daily||The district committee tasked to approve expenditure on specialists and equipment for Covid-19 has approved the hiring of 20 lab technicians (LTs), which will be required for ramping up of testing capabilities. According to officials, the 20 technicians will form 10 teams, which will bolster testing capabilities by about 1,500 more samples every day. Ghaziabad district till September 20 had tested about 270,174 samples, which included 155,322 samples through the use of rapid antigen kits. The district’s test positivity rate on September 20 was 4.59%. The district health department earlier this month had raised a demand for 20 LTs, specialist doctors, nurses and cleaning staff for Covid duty. “We have approved the hiring of 20 LTs and these will help us in getting more tests done across the district. The proposal includes hiring of other specialists and staff. A decision will be taken up soon,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked state officials to conduct more tests to complete the one-crore target by the end of September. According to state officials, UP tested 8,676,686 samples till September 20. In first 20 days of August, Ghaziabad completed 59,773 tests at an average of 2,988 per day. In comparison, the district in the first 20 days of September tested 72,581 samples at an average of 3,629 per day. From September 14 to 20, the district enhanced testing and conducted 28,793 tests at an average of 4,113 tests per day. Health officials said they are presently taking up sampling in the range of 3,500-4,000 tests per day and aim at the 5,000-mark. “With the approval to hire 20 LTs, we will form 10 teams with each having capacity to collect 150 samples per day. With the new teams joining in, we will be able to take our daily testing up to 5.000 per day and even higher. At present, we were facing a shortage of LTs as there were 76 available and 12 of them left and three are on long leave. Two of our LTs were sent to the new RT-PCR lab at MMG Hospital. So, the new LTs will be of great help in increasing daily sampling/testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The officials said the new lab technicians will prove helpful for 100% testing of people in containment zones as per guidelines issued by Indian Council for Medical Research.The UP government has already allowed hiring of specialists. It also allowed contingency funds of Rs 5 crore each to the districts with a population of over 25 lakh. Ghaziabad district has received Rs 2.5 crore so far. “The expenditure for hiring LTs and other specialists will be met from these funds. Apart from lab technicians , we have demanded hiring of physicians, pathologists and anaesthetists, besides trained staff nurses and cleaning staff, exclusively for Covid-19 duties,” Dr Gupta said. The proposal mentions demand for equipment like high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP units, besides medicines such as Remdesivir, etc.The contingency funds are approved by a committee of officials headed by the district magistrate. It includes the chief medical officer, chief development officer and other officials. Ghaziabad district has 20 different testing facilities in the government sector, which includes static testing booths, mobile teams and mobile vans. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-approves-hiring-of-more-lab-technicians-to-increase-daily-testing-to-5-000-daily/story-Y0Yd4lY27dmKBqUHM2rSrN.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: With masks and physical distancing, students turn up for academic guidance sessions in govt schools||Students studying in classes 9 to 12 in government schools across the city visited schools for the first time in over six months on Monday for voluntary academic guidance sessions. Schools across the country were shut and exams suspended in mid-March when a countrywide lockdown was imposed to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19. Voluntary visits to schools for clearing doubts for a limited time period were permitted by the Central government as part of Unlock 4 guidelines. As part of the guidelines, students of classes 9 to 12 are permitted to visit schools in areas outside containment zones for academic guidance with the written consent of parents. In line with the SOP that needs to be followed during these guidance sessions, teachers across schools need to get a negative Covid test report and have Arogya Setu installed on their phones. Only 50% of teachers are permitted to visit schools for these academic sessions.Students’ visits to schools on Monday were unlike any other. Starting sharp at 8:30 in the morning, students wearing masks started trickling in batches of five as per their allotted time slots. Right at the entrance, they were asked to furnish the written consent document from their parents, subject to which they were given entry. While a security guard took the students’ temperatures, they were asked to sanitise their hands and register their attendance with teachers who sat near the entrance, all this while maintaining an optimum distance with the help of circles drawn on the floor. Teachers sat outside the classroom for these sessions and no blackboards were used. Further, students were only permitted to go out for water breaks and washroom visits, one at a time. Govind, an 18-year-old class 12 student at Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that while he was excited to see some of his teachers and classmates after months, an eerie emptiness surrounded the school. “The building premises don’t feel like school anymore. There is silence all around. On routine days, during this time of the day, our playground would be brimming with students. There used to be so much noise and cacophony. It’s unusually empty today due to the absence of routine student crowd,” said Govind, who goes by his first name. Like most students, the commerce student was surprised when classes were called off in March. He had, however, not anticipated that the closure of schools would last for more than six months. “We were supposed to appear for our Maths exam when classes were called off. We kept thinking that it would take place soon but the day never came. Instead, a countrywide lockdown was imposed,” said Govind. In the days that followed, his classmates gradually jumped on the bandwagon of online classes while he was left behind. “A day before the lockdown was declared, the phone at my house was stolen. I had no idea what to do. For the next two-three months, I lost complete touch with my teachers, classmates, and even books,” said Govind, who spent his days playing Ludo with his three siblings. Due to lockdown restrictions, he was unable to move out or seek books or any assistance from seniors and classmates. “Once the restrictions eased a little, I arranged for my teacher’s number and called him. He said that I was lagging behind by several months. I purchased books since I didn’t have a smartphone and started covering the lessons,” he said. Monday’s visit gave him a chance to clear the doubts that he had in various subjects. A relieved Govind said that he was hopeful about covering up his missed lessons in the subsequent visits. “On an ordinary phone, it becomes difficult to understand complex concepts. There is disruption due to which one is unable to maintain concentration. It’s great that schools are finally allowing us to visit now,” he said. With schools facilitating academic guidance visits, a ray of hope has emerged for many other students such as Govind, who continue to struggle with access to smartphones and other technological devices. Rinki Sharma, a 17-year-old class 12 government school student, has been attending online classes via WhatsApp for the past six months. With only one smartphone in the house, she only gets a chance to study once her mother, who works as an ironer, returns back from work in the evening. “While our teachers readily explain things over the phone, sometimes there is a lag due to delays in accessing the phone. Hopefully, that should change with these visits,” said Sharma. Unlike her, Rinki’s mother was not too keen on sending her to school. “My mother was scared and skeptical since cases are rising in the city. But I convinced her somehow,” she said. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that 49 students in class 10 and 52 in class 12 had appeared for the academic guidance visits on Monday. “Everything was conducted smoothly since we had created different slots and placed a cap on the number of students in each slot. Our school is quite big and different buildings were allotted to class 10 and 12 for the guidance sessions,” said Sharma, adding that many more students had shown eagerness for these classes. “Students were very happy and enthusiastic about coming back to school. Many more are waiting for their slots to come up,” she said. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that around 51 students from class 10 and 12 visited the school for academic guidance visits on Monday. Raghav said that the school was expecting the footfall to increase in the coming days. “We are yet to receive written consent forms from parents in classes 9 and 11. Once that is completed, the number of students will increase,” he said, adding that the school had invited parents for a PTM last week to given them a glimpse of the sanitisation procedures in place. “Parents saw that thermal scanning, sanitisation and other checks were in place. This gave them the confidence to send children to school,” said Raghav. Other schools that saw a tepid turnout said that many parents were fearful about the prospect of sending children to school. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said that only two students had turned for the classes on Monday. “We had taken feedback from parents earlier this week. Parents are reluctant about sending children to school due to the spike in cases,” said Miglani. Most private schools said that majority of parents were not in favour of children visiting schools at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases in the city were increasing. Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the school had no plans of calling students any time soon. “For now, we have not taken any call on school visits for children. Moreover, our online classes have been taking place smoothly” said Erry.Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools, said that the school had sought feedback from parents but around 75% were not in favour of permitting these visits. “Initially, we had plans of calling those students who were willing to come for these sessions. However, around 75% of parents are not in favour of schools opening. We will continue with online classes as before,” said Bhadoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-with-masks-and-physical-distancing-students-turn-up-for-academic-guidance-sessions-in-govt-schools/story-h1pMjp6n8l1hOb9rRbhuVM.html

Commenting on the tie-up, Peyush Bansal, founder and CEO, Lenskart, said, “Our mission is to provide vision to India. India has a huge vision deficit with over 300 million people deprived of vision correction and hence solving this gap requires over 100,000 more high-quality optometrists. To develop this talent requires combined practical and academic experience.” With the partnership, Lenskart hoped to help develop the future workforce of vision care, that will be instrumental in shaping the future of primary eye care need in India, Bansal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chitkara-ties-up-with-lenskart-for-bachelors-in-optometry/story-WHs4Prl3kqiOqCcJVxx4gL.html
21-09-2020||City||More than 10,000 Covid-19 patients recovered in Ghaziabad so far||Even as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Ghaziabad, the district to its credit has successfully discharged more than 10,000 Covid-19 patients.As per data by the state health control room, the district crossed the 10,000-mark of total Covid-19 recoveries on September 19 when with 264 new recoveries, the total number of discharges reached 10,146 (out of 12, 153 total cases).Four districts where more than 10,000 patients have been successfully discharged in Uttar Pradesh are Lucknow, Kanpur City, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur.On September 21, Ghaziabad district’s overall recovery rate was 83.29 % with total 10,391 recoveries out of 12, 475 Covid-19 cases. “We have been focusing on early detection, quick testing and fast referral of patients to health care facilities. Even with home isolation in place, we are regularly tracking patients, and if they develop complications they are immediately referred to a Covid facility. So, with coordinated efforts between government and private facilities, we have been able to provide good treatment to our patients. Hence, the discharge rate or recovery rate is also on the higher side,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to records of the district health department, the Covid-19 recovery rate in the district was 76.39% at the end of May, 45.77% till June-end, and since then has been hovering above 80%. The recovery rate was 81.38%till July 31 and 80.88% till August 31.In Uttar Pradesh, the overall recovery rate on Monday stood 80.69%— 289, 594 recoveries out of 358, 893 patients.“The speedier contact tracing has also helped us get positive cases to facilities and start with their treatment at the earliest. At present, our contact tracing is nearly 99%. The virus if not detected on time among contacts which belong to high-risk groups can lead to health complications for them,” chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, said.The CMO added that the number of Covid-19 patients being discharged is also steadily increasing after the discharge policy for patients in home isolation and in Covid-19 facilities were changed. “The high rate of discharge is also due to clinical management offered in our hospitals which include use of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP—used for providing non-invasive ventilation— which has proved helpful for patients having respiratory issues. During the initial months, the patients were getting discharged only after they get two successive negative reports. So, this took more time, nearly about 13-15 days, to get a patient discharged. Then, the discharge policy was changed and just one negative report was needed. At present, new discharge guidelines are in place and have helped us discharge patients within a maximum period of 10 days,” Dr Gupta said.“Since last month, we also started using medicines such as remdesivir among others for patients with mild and moderate symptoms, and it has given good results, “he added.As per the revised discharge policy rolled out on July 21, the mild asymptomatic patients will be discharged after 10 days of the preliminary test or seventh day of admission if they do not have symptoms. Likewise, the patients in home isolation are also marked as “recovered” after ten days of home isolation.Til September 19, the district had a 72.96% discharge rate for those in home isolation ( 2,259 patients recovered out of 3,096 patients).Experts have, however, said that the recovering patients should be tested more than once.“The discharge rate has definitely got better but it is also due to revised discharge guidelines. Earlier, the patients were getting discharged after their test was negative. Now, they are getting discharged after a certain period of time. So, it becomes vital that there should be proper monitoring of discharged patients and if possible, their test should also be conducted after 15 days of testing positive as well,” said Dr VB Jindal, president, Indian Medical Association, (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-than-10-000-covid-19-patients-recovered-in-ghaziabad-so-far/story-ZTBeYrF4OcAduadECJpSHK.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 1,20,000 children immunised in a two-day-long pulse polio drive||A two-day-long intensified pulse polio immunisation (IPPI) drive was launched by the health department over the weekend. The drive, which concluded on Monday, administered polio drops to 1,28,529 children — from newborn babies to children of five years of age. The door-to-door immunisation campaign covered 2,03,164 households, as per the data shared by the district health department.This was the second such IPPI to be conducted after a national immunisation day (NID) drive in January this year. This will be followed up with another drive in November this year. However, the subsequent two drives are known as sub-national immunisation days (SNIDS) and will be implemented only in 13 high-risk districts in Haryana. Last year, about 0.35 million children were vaccinated against polio in Gurugram. Health department officials did not reveal the specific immunisation target (or achievement) for the ongoing year, but mentioned that it is lower than in previous years on account of Covid-19. “Still, we managed to immunise over 1,20,000 people over the past two days. We thought we would not be able to cover more than 77,000 people initially as Covid has reduced our staff strength,” said Dr Naresh Garg, deputy chief medical officer and nodal officer for polio in Gurugram.“Every year, two IPPIs are conducted on SNIDS, and another on NID. Such IPPIs used to be more frequent, but have reduced in number over the years. The last case of polio we had in Haryana was in 2011, and in 2014 we were declared polio-free. Still, immunisation drives are needed in case of transboundary entry of the virus into the community. Other than immunisation, the health department audits all registered cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in the district to check if the virus has remerged,” Garg added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-over-1-20-000-children-immunised-in-a-two-day-long-pulse-polio-drive/story-9XzclCOYoLUd3a2YlA8ZFL.html
21-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Thieves break into five shops, decamp with cash, other items||Gurugram: A group of thieves allegedly broke open the shutters of five shops and decamped with several items and at least ₹1 lakh cash in Farrukhnagar on Monday morning. The police said that several teams were working to trace the suspects. According to the police, the incident took place between 2 am and 2.30 am in the main market near Sheesh Mahal. Preliminary probe has revealed that the suspects arrived in a car and used rods and cutters to break open the shutters. Of the five shops targeted, three sell garments while the rest are general stores, the police said. Rajesh Kumar, a grocery store owner whose shop was broken into, said, “It seems that the suspects planned to loot several stores in the same line. In the CCTV footage, five men can be seen alighting from a car and taking the cash box from my shop after breaking in. It happened within five minutes. The suspects escaped after a person, who was on a phone call on his terrace, noticed commotion and raised alarm.” Kumar filed a written complaint at Farrukhnagar police station on Monday evening, along with a list of stolen items, such as garments, groceries and cash from the five shops, the police said. The police said that according to the CCTV footage, the suspects had covered their faces and the registration number of the vehicle, a Santro car, appeared hazy. Subash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “A complaint has been received. At least ₹1 lakh cash and several items, whose list is being compiled, were stolen. The CCTV footage is hazy and it will be sent to the forensic laboratory for examination. A probe has been initiated and an FIR will be registered accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-thieves-break-into-five-shops-decamp-with-cash-other-items/story-zGFERzOVwnuQBpCXMgbCUN.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: TERI to survey Golf Course Road, suggest flood-prevention steps||Researchers at the TERI School of Advanced Studies will be conducting a three-month-long hydro-geological survey of Golf Course Road (GCR) and the Aravalli hills that run adjacent to it. The study, which is likely to conclude sometime early next year, will suggest a range of interventions to conserve rainwater and prevent urban flooding in the region. During recent floods in the city on August 19 and 20, the GCR stretch remained among the worst affected areas of the city, with the DLF Phase-1 underpass being rendered unusable for over 30 hours due to waterloggingCommissioned by IAmGurgaon — a city-based NGO known for eco-restoration projects such the Aravalli Biodiversity Park and the Wazirabad bundh — TERI’s upcoming study, for which a detailed proposal has been prepared, has also received the support of officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). Over the past four weeks, representatives from TERI and IAmGurgaon have held meetings and conducted field visits with VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA and Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, to discuss the scope of the undertaking. The study, however, will not be funded by either of the two local bodies, said representatives of IAmGurgaon. The proposed study, according to experts at TERI, will focus on assessing four drainage channels, which originate in the Aravallis just above Golf Course Road, and traverse its carriageway before draining into a water body that collects along the nearby Chakkarpur-Wazirabad bundh. The first (and lowest-lying) of these natural creeks runs through Sector 26, while the other three are located in sectors 42, 54 and 56. “These channels are part of the natural topography of the area. We will be assessing their feasibility to retain run-off and recharge groundwater. Based on our assessments, we shall model a range of interventions that could potentially prevent repeated floods of the kind we have just witnessed. By harnessing these creeks, we may also find a more sustainable use for rainwater than simply draining it out,” said Fawzia Tarannum, of the School of Regional Water Studies at TERI-SAS. Tarannum, who is also an advisor with the district administration’s Gurujal society, added, “We will firstly conduct a satellite-based GIS survey, scrutinise older and existing drainage maps, see how the region’s topography has changed and how exactly it has changed the flow of water. We will also calculate the carrying capacities of these four creeks based on different weather scenarios, from light rain to heavy rain. Our assumption is that extreme weather events are bound to intensify, and that rainfall patterns will become shorter but more severe. An ‘unprecedented’ shower like Gurugram witnessed, in reality, has a lot of precedents.” Representatives from IAmGurgaon, which will be funding TERI’s study, said such intensive showers might strike the city again. “We have already seen it happen multiple times in just five or six years. At IAmGurgaon, we had been aware of these four Aravalli creeks since restoring the Wazirabad-Bundh. What we are trying to do is find a way to rejig the area’s natural drainage,” said Latika Thukral, founder, IAmGurgaon. She added, “We want to show the administration that there are alternative solutions to simply building more drains to carry the water off to Najafgarh.” Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA, and a member of a recently appointed Flood Protection Committee, said, “We will help with the study in whatever way we can. We have been looking into the matter ourselves. The problem is that GCR lies at the lower end of a steep, 15-metre elevation difference. Mining in the Aravalli areas like Mangar and Bandhwari around the Gurugram-Faridabad Road, and rampant construction and concretisation in the foothills have disturbed the natural drainage pattern. As such, water simply rushes down onto the carriageway.”He added that the GMDA, which took over the maintenance of Gurugram’s drainage system from the HSVP in 2017, would consider any viable interventions the study may present. Rohit Sharma, director, DLF Estate Developers Ltd, the private developer who is the custodian of GCR, said, “We welcome any study that is in the interest of Gurgaon and its residents. Our infrastructure along the Golf Course Road is sufficient, but due to unprecedented rainfall last month some issues arose. We have already taken stock of them, and would be happy to work with GMDA, MCG or any other official authority in the larger public interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-teri-to-survey-golf-course-road-suggest-flood-prevention-steps/story-PiEqSXG3pGdR6ZeDpXKmKI.html
21-09-2020||City||Three held for flinging mobile phones inside Bhondsi jail complex||The police on Sunday arrested three men for their alleged involvement in supplying mobile phones to inmates in Bhondsi jail by flinging the devices across the boundary wall of the jail complex. The police said their probe has further revealed that the men had supplied over two dozen phones to the jail inmates in exchange for money using the same modus operandi in at least five instances. Four mobile phones, which were meant to be thrown across the boundary wall, were recovered from their possession on Sunday. According to the police, the crime branch of DLF-4 received a tip-off that at least three men were on their way to Rithoj village with the intention of throwing a bundle, containing mobile phones, across the boundary wall of the jail complex. A raid party was formed to trace the accused men. Around 12 midnight, a sedan, which was heading towards Rithoj, was intercepted by the police near the jail. The car driver tried to reverse after spotting police presence, but the trio was caught by the police. The accused men have been identified as Sachin, Jaswinder alias Khannu, and Shehzad. Sachin and Shehzad hail from Tauru while Jaswinder is a native of Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, said the police. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “A probe has revealed that Jaswinder was arrested in 2018 in a case of illegal possession of weapons and was lodged in Bhondsi Jail. Inside the jail, he had met a criminal, identified as Deepu. Since Jaswinder’s release on bail, he and his aides had been supplying mobile phones to Deepu by flinging them across the jail complex in a packet. Deepu’s associates used to pay the accused for supplying the phones. The accused have a criminal history and three cases have been registered against them earlier.” A crime branch official, requesting anonymity, said, “Jaswinder and Sachin confessed that they had thrown at least 24 phones in the jail so far using the same method. The third suspect, Shehzad, said that his brother was lodged in jail and he wanted to be in touch with him.” The police said they will take Deepu on production remand and question him. Several instances of mobile phones and drugs being flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex have been reported in the past. The police said the mobile phones are used by the inmates to make extortion calls and contact their henchmen and aides to run their operations on their behalf. Last month, 12 mobile phones, ten batteries, five chargers, a 4 G SIM card, and two headsets, allegedly concealed in four packets, were recovered from the barracks during an inspection inside the jail complex. A preliminary probe had found that the packets had been thrown from outside and flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex. The easy access of mobile phones and narcotics among jail inmates had come under the scanner after the police had arrested one Dharambeer Chautala, who was earlier posted as deputy jail superintendent of Bhondsi Jail, on July 23. Chautala along with an associate, Ravi, was caught supplying mobile phones and narcotics to jail inmates. The police had recovered at least 11 4G SIM cards and 230 grams of hashish (a kind of narcotic) from their possession. Probe had found that one 4G SIM card was sold for over ₹20,000 to the inmates, who were using phones to run their networks outside the prison. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the matter, following which two more aides of the accused duo were arrested.A case was registered against the accused persons under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and Prisons Act at Bhondsi police station on Sunday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-held-for-flinging-mobile-phones-inside-bhondsi-jail-complex/story-niITOga2tg9XGGkU245LLK.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: GMDA developing single-window online platform to address public grievances||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is developing a website, which will serve as a single-window, online platform for residents to lodge complaints against various public bodies operating in the city and track the status of their grievances, said officials on Sunday. The platform will enable people to lodge complaints either against a single civic body or multiple ones — such as the GMDA, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), the Gurugram district administration, the Public Works Department (PWD), Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) — via a single window, said GMDA officials.GMDA officials added that even the complaints that are received through emails, the CM window, toll-free numbers, social media and various mobile applications will be synched with the platform. This will allow people to register their feedback once all formalities are completed, said officials.VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, said that such a platform will increase the accountability of public bodies. Such bodies can no longer deflect the responsibility of completing the work.Consequently, this will also prevent delays in taking action.“The development of this platform is our top priority. We have realised that there is a lot of public dissatisfaction as many offices are not responding to grievances of residents properly, including the GMDA itself. We don’t have a responsive public grievances redressal system in place. Hence, we are developing a platform, which will put all the government offices falling within the GMDA area under one single window. This will also ensure a two-way communication between authorities and residents,” said Kundu.Kundu further said that a single-window platform will also solve the issues pertaining to overlapping jurisdiction between various public bodies.“All complaints would be handled at a central level. A team of employees or outsourced workers would be forwarding the matters reported on the CM window, social media, customer care, or in writing, to the concerned public body. The status of matter would then be monitored online, and the complainant would also be kept in the loop. He or she will come to know which public body the complaint has been forwarded to and what is the current status of the complaint,” said Kundu.Kundu said currently, GMDA is in the process of establishing a framework. “Once the framework is in place, technology will then be used for implementing the same. We are looking at various models, both globally and domestically, in regard to the redressal of public grievances. Simultaneously, we are also streamlining our processes internally. We are identifying the various public bodies than can be included on this platform, their areas of jurisdiction, and the type of issues they address,” said Kundu, adding that once the framework is in place, GMDA will take a call on whether they have the necessary expertise and resources to build the platform on their own or do they need to float tenders to hire an outsourced agency to build the platform.Kundu said that as part of the Smart City project, a decision was taken in December last year for building a single-window platform, which can address all forms of public grievances. However, he said that work in this regard could not be initiated right away, and, as an interim measure, the call centre of the MCG was shifted to the GMDA office to address public grievances. However, this measure failed to “improve efficiency” of the public grievance system, he said.“We realised that the call centre was not improving the situation in any way and that public dissatisfaction was still very much prevalent. Hence, we decided to start taking steps towards the formation of an online platform that will include all relevant public bodies of the city in one single window and would be able collate all forms of public grievances,” said Kundu.Kundu said that using data analytics, the platform would be able to point out issues that are receiving the maximum number of complaints.This will prompt officials to come up with alternative measures to fix the problem.“Under the existing system, there remains a possibility that a person at a call centre may not attend a complainant’s call or deflect the matter entirely. Hence, we want to reduce human intervention and maximise the use of technology. A voice bot or a chat bot can help address common issues, and, if the need arises, an operator can then take over the matter at any given stage.The operator can access the background details and the history of the complaint from the platform’s interface,” said Kundu.Kundu also highlighted the fact that the platform would ensure complaints are not lost and help review and identify services or public bodies that are “less efficient” and, therefore, require greater monitoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-gmda-developing-single-window-online-platform-to-address-public-grievances/story-AuHLQVrQ4G9dFJWGL43ayM.html
21-09-2020||City||Gurugram: MCG plans to host cultural events at its open-air theatre from next month||Gurugram: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to resume hosting cultural events at its open-air theatre in Sector 29 from next month, said officials.“We are planning to start cultural events in our Sector 29 open-air theatre soon. Tentatively, we are looking at starting operations on October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. A final decision on this would be taken by the end of this week,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG.The open-air theatre is the city’s main public cultural venue, and since March 2015, has provided a platform for singers, theatre actors, dancers, schoolchildren and other local artistes to perform.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said a decision on whether the events will be held with a crowd or the performance be streamed digitally would be taken depending on the willingness of the artistes.On August 29, the central government had allowed open-air theatres to resume operations across the country from September 21 as part of Unlock 4 measures. However, a maximum of 100 people would be allowed at such events.The MCG officials said that the 1,500-seating capacity venue has enough space to accommodate 100 people, keeping social distancing and other safety protocols in place.“Due to the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, the mood of the city has been quite low. When the central government paved the way for reopening of open-air theatres, we immediately started working on the best possible ways to once again host cultural events in the city, with adequate safety measures, as it will give people a much-needed mood boost,” said Kaur.Kaur further highlighted the importance of artistes also needing a platform to start performing again. “Besides bringing about positivity, we felt that local artistes need to be promoted as they have suffered a lot during the last six months. By giving them a platform, they can showcase their talent while also provide entertainment to people,” she said.MCG hosts at least 30 events at the theatre annually, which can be watched by audience free of cost. If the event takes place on October 2, it will be the first time since the coronavirus outbreak that any government body in the city is hosting a public event.Local theatre artistes have welcomed the move. “It has been more than six months since our theatre group performed in front of a live audience. In the interim, our group has been practising online but it isn’t the same as performing on stage. If MCG resumes its cultural events, it will give hundreds of artistes like us a chance to once again engage with an audience and may also open doors to other opportunities for us on other forums,” said Suhasini Dighe Rastogi, a Gurugram-based theatre actor and director. Rastogi’s theatre group has performed 11 plays at the MCG’s open-air theatre based on adaptations of short stories from Anton Chekhov, O Henry, Rabindranath Tagore, and Munshi Premchand. Last year, the district administration had set up Kala Gram, a society for arts education. The objective of Kala Gram is to run weekly classes for providing training for theatre, various dance forms, classical and instrumental music while also hosting events where artistes can showcase their talent.The civic body officials said that Kala Gram’s office is being constructed near the Sector 29 open-air theatre and they are tying up with them to host the October 2 event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-plans-to-host-cultural-events-at-its-open-air-theatre-from-next-month/story-BZLoXL3Rp3L7iKklJALh5I.html
21-09-2020||City||Committee’s report on Gurugram floods delayed as three GMDA staff test positive for Covid-19||Gurugram: The seven-member committee constituted by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to probe the cause of recent floods in the city, following heavy rain on August 19 and 20, has not yet submitted a final report in the matter as at least three GMDA employees involved in the exercise tested positive for Covid-19. The initial deadline for the report was August 28. Confirming the delay, Pradeep Kumar, a committee member and chief engineer (infrastructure-II), GMDA, said, “We have made a lot of progress in terms of gathering data and conducting field work. Every single official in charge of a drainage beat has submitted their situation reports of what happened during those two days. But our three employees, including superintending engineer Mr Rajesh Bansal who is also a flood committee member, came down with Covid-19 in the past two-three weeks. Naturally, as they have had to undergo isolation, work has been delayed.”The committee is chaired by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran’s (HSVP) former engineer-in-chief, KK Bhugra. A Gurugram resident, Bhugra also played a key role in formulating a ₹298-crore ‘comprehensive drainage plan’ for Gurugram, whose implementation has been delayed due to prolonged talks with stakeholders in the second half of 2019, followed by the Covid-19 lockdown this year.“The committee chairman has received all the data and situation reports from us. We will have to speak with him to take things forward and come up with the mandated solutions, both short term and long term,” said Kumar, declining to comment on when the report is expected to be ready. As per an August 21 order issued by VS Kundu, chief executive officer, GMDA, “The flood protection committee will examine the causes of flooding specially in the underpasses at Golf Course Road, Medanta road, Rajeev Chowk and Iffco Chowk, which were submerged with stormwater rendering them unusable for normal traffic, and will suggest short and long term solutions... to prevent this from happening in the future.” Though reluctant to speak about the committee’s findings so far, Kumar said, “The main issue with Golf Course Road, as we can see it, is that the carriageway became overwhelmed with run-off coming down from the Gurugram-Faridabad Road and the abutting Aravalli hills. We will have to find a solution to either retain the water on the hillside or slow its course towards GCR.” Despite multiple attempts, the GMDA chief could not be contacted for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/committee-s-report-on-gurugram-floods-delayed-as-three-gmda-staff-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-38hrApeIS2BqJ4zd4zbPcO.html

21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University V-C apologises, HC drops contempt proceedings||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dropped contempt proceedings against Panjab University vice-chancellor Raj Kumar after his “unconditional apology”.The contempt proceedings were initiated against him and the varsity’s registrar earlier this year in a case concerning the promotion policy for the faculty of Dr Harvansh Singh Judge Institute of Dental Sciences and Hospital.The high court bench of justice Arun Monga while disposing of the contempt petition observed that before finalising the promotion policy, PU would grant an opportunity of hearing to the representative of the dental institute faculty. Earlier, the V-C had told court that the promotion policy framed by PU in 2007, based on the Punjab pattern, will continue to be followed for the dental institute faculty. He had further informed court that the policy would be put up before the senate for final approval.Last May, disposing of a plea from 37 faculty members of the dental institute, the high court had directed the varsity to take a final decision on framing their promotion policy within four months. PU kept dillydallying, and when on June 10 this year, the HC found that the order has not been complied with, it issued show-cause notices to the V-C and then registrar Karamjit Singh to respond by July 20.The registrar submitted his response on July 20, but the V-C failed to do so. This had invited sharp criticism from the bench. “This court is unable to understand the reluctance and hesitation shown by the vice-chancellor to respond to the contempt notice, which conduct apparently smacks of certain self conceit,” the bench had observed seeking response by September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-v-c-apologises-hc-drops-contempt-proceedings/story-DY8BTDLWKlqbHuveNsoxWO.html

UT administrator and Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore also urged teachers to get themselves tested and asked schools to follow protocols.As the ministry of home affairs ordered reopening of schools for senior students requiring “guidance” from teachers on various subjects, government institutes too received just 4% of the 25,000 odd students whose guardians and parents had filled the consent form allowing their wards to attend.Around 950 students were present in 93 government schools. Attendance, as a matter of fact, was higher in periphery areas and villages of Chandigarh as compared to the city, education department officials said.Badnore advises teachers to get testedMeanwhile, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore advised teachers to get medically tested for covid regularly. During the administration’s Covid-19 review meeting with medical institutes in the city on Monday, Badnore directed the UT education secretary to ensure that the Union government’s guidelines were strictly followed when students visited the school campus.The scenario in schools A round of the government schools revealed that no student had turned up at Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS) Sector 32.

21-09-2020||Chandigarh||School in Ludhiana seek parents’ consent sought before allowing students to attend schools||Most schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) have decided to take parents’ consent before allowing students to attend.The Punjab government has allowed students of Classes 9 to 12 to visit schools outside containment zones on voluntary-basis to seek guidance from teachers. Many schools said this is not the right time to allow this amid surging Covid-19 cases in the district.With all schools in the district conducting online exams in September, majority of them have decided to allow students to visit from October for doubt clearance.JK Sidhu, principal of DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, said, “We may call students to school after October 4 to take guidance from teachers. We are conducting an online survey to take consent from parents.”The students will be instructed to follow all guidelines under national directives for Covid-19 management which include wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands regularly, he added.Harmeet Kaur Waraich, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School, said, “We will allow students of Classes 10 and 12 to visit school for guidance from teachers in the first week of October. After taking consent from parents, we will call them on alternate days.”Vandna Shahi, principal of BCM School, Dugri, said, “We conducted a survey by sending Google forms to parents and over 30% of them have given consent. We are planning to allow students to visit school after September 28 and will first call students of Classes 10 and 12 on alternate days. If all goes well, then we will call students of Classes 9 and 11.”Several PSEB-affiliated schools had taken consent from parents and will allow students to visit schools from Tuesday. Authorities of BCM, Focal Point, have already informed parents and over 150 of them have given written consent to the school. Neeru Kaura, principal, said, “We have asked students of Classes 10 and 12 to visit the school for doubt clearance from Tuesday. We have made all arrangements and asked students to wear masks when they enter. We will follow all SOPs and social distancing will be maintained in classrooms.” Skill training in NSTIs, ITIs, permittedDeputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma, exercising his powers conferred under Section 144 of the CrPC, has permitted skill or entrepreneurship training at National Skill Training Institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and short term training centres registered with the National Skill Development Corporation or State Skill Development Missions or other ministries of central or state government.Likewise, the activities of National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Developments (NIESBUD), Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) and their training providers have also been allowed from September 21, subject to strict adherence of Covid-19 SOPs.The order also allows higher educational institutes to open for research scholars (PhD) and postgraduate students for technical and professional programmers requiring laboratories/experimental works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-in-ludhiana-seek-parents-consent-sought-before-allowing-students-to-attend-schools/story-XOql3jHpoJp9NLwhkKWFmJ.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||GMADA, Mohali MC get Lok Adalat notice on water tariff parity||The Lok Adalat (people’s court) has asked the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) and Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to file their reply by September 30 on the issue of extending water tariff parity to the residents of sectors 66 to 82. Residents of these sectors moved court after paying a higher water tariff of Rs 5.25 per kilolitre compared to other sectors under the MC with rates of Rs 1.8 per kilolitre. A decision in their favour will be a huge relief for the 50,000-odd residents of the aforementioned sectors as their water bills will be reduced considerably.Apart from pleading to the court to issue directions to GMADA to hand over the water tariff of their sectors to MC, the residents sought refunds from 2017 for the excess tariff paid to GMADA. It is to be noted that MC is making a bid to take over the functioning of sectors governed by GMADA for tariff parity, but the agenda point is yet to be approved by the local bodies department of Punjab. Shinderpal Singh (Bobby Kamboj) and Satvir Singh Dhanoa, MC councillors as well as local residents Jagdev Singh and Jatinder Sandhu say they have been fighting for parity for the past two years and paying excessive charges. “But MC and GMADA have not given any relief to us till date. The agencies have been making excuses for which residents are suffering. On top of it, stray cattle and blocked sewerage lines have made our lives miserable,” they add.However, it is to be noted that MC will be unable to take over the tariff till the Punjab government formulates the new water policy for issuance of new water meters. Residents also say property rates here are falling because of the high water charges.“For the past three years, people here hesitate to rent out their homes because of the high tariff. Those who are dependent on income from rentals, therefore, are the ones who are suffering the most,” says Surinder Singh, Former Shiromani Akali Dal councillor from Sector 80.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmada-mohali-mc-get-lok-adalat-notice-on-water-tariff-parity/story-KjXnsxt3iXMFwqxOOU7iYM.html

21-09-2020||Mumbai||MNS workers demand local trains for public in Mumbai, stages agitation||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers staged agitations on Monday at various stations on the suburban railway network, demanding the resumption of local train services for the general public. While some MNS members were detained, the Railways issued a statement saying train services were not affected. Local trains have been suspended since March and a limited number of train services resumed in June for those working in essential services. On Monday, MNS staged agitations by boarding trains at various stations and protesting outside stations, demanding the resumption of regular train services. “Local trains are the lifeline of the city and it’s time the government allowed the general public to travel in them,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande. In Thane, MNS leader Avinash Jadhav and around 30 supporters were detained at Naupada police station for two hours. “For the common man, getting to Mumbai for work regularly from Thane and beyond is very difficult. Not everyone can afford private vehicles. If buses can ply, why not trains?” said Jadhav. Twenty-four MNS workers protesting outside Kalyan station were also detained by police as were seven MNS workers at Ambernath. To avoid the police bandobast at Boisar station, some MNS workers walked along the tracks and boarded the train at Palghar. Senior police inspector Anil Sonawane of Palghar Government Railway Police said necessary action would be taken against them. Police were able to stop MNS protesters from boarding trains at Dombivli and Vashi. In a statement issued on Monday, Central Railways said no overcrowding was reported and the trains had run on schedule. State transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said train services were limited as a precautionary measure. “We are unlocking in phases and being cautious. Our problem is that if we allow the full opening of train service and even if two people infected of Covid-19 travel in them, it will spread rapidly,” said Parab. The final decision on the resumption of local train services would be taken by the ministry of Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mns-workers-demand-local-trains-for-public-in-mumbai-stages-agitation/story-Mgzyo0Y8MWlq82ahNhPWMI.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps Medical Council of India for not ensuring colleges follow admission norms||The Bombay high court while asking the Medical Council of India on why it does not have any mechanism in place to verify whether students admitted to medical courses by private medical colleges are as per the state merit list, has said that it was not inclined to pass orders in favour of a student who did not secure an admission in a Pune-based private medical college. The student had claimed that while she had a better merit score, students with lesser merit or even those who were not eligible were admitted by the college and she was refused. The court observed that passing orders in favour of the student would mean displacing a student who had secured admission, but as those students were not a party to the petition it was not inclined to pass orders. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice G S Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by Sunita Pal through advocate Amogh Singh was informed that after the regular rounds of admission for the medical course had been completed, a mop round was conducted to fill up the remaining seats. Singh submitted that Pal had received a call from the private medical college at Pune on July 30 asking her to reach the college and secure her admission by July 31. Singh submitted that Pal who is based in Mumbai was unable to reach the college on the said date due to the lockdown. Singh added that it was only later in August that Pal came to know that students who were much lower than her in the merit list or were not even eligible had secured admission. When she confronted the college, she was told said that as she had failed to reach on the given date she could not ask for a seat. Aggrieved by this arbitrariness of the college, Singh submitted that Pal approached the court on August 14. On its part advocate, Ganesh Gole for the MCI submitted that as per admission rules if it was found that non-meritorious student/s were admitted than such admission would have to be cancelled or the seat would have to be surrendered. However, after hearing the submissions, the court asked the college on the logic behind giving students only a day’s time to reach the college and take admission during the pandemic and lockdown situation. The court also questioned the state how it could allow the college to have such a system. “It seems that due to the pandemic only those students who were in and around Pune were granted admission even if they were less meritorious or not even eligible,” said Datta. He further asked the MCI why it did not have any mechanism to check whether colleges were adhering to admission norms and were admitting only those students who were as per the state merit list. The court while agreeing that the Pal had a valid point said that as she had not joined the less meritorious or ineligible students as a party in the petition who had secured admission in the private medical college it was not inclined to pass orders favouring her. “Passing orders would imply displacing a student already admitted. You should study better and score better and seek admission next year,” suggested Datta. The court, however, directed Singh to inform the court as to what course of action his client (Pal) wanted to adopt in light of the observations and posted the matter for hearing on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-medical-council-of-india-for-not-ensuring-colleges-follow-admission-norms/story-wIsBiNdjScRKaA87f7LWjN.html

Omkar Shankar Sathe was found dead inside a sack on Friday evening by around 3pm after he went missing from 12 pm. Police inspector Giridhar Gore, from Rabale police station, said, “The post-mortem report mentions the cause of death as asphyxia due to suffocation. The doctor has ruled out the possibility of throttling or smothering, as there are no such injury marks. Even if smothering happens, there are some marks left behind which is not found in this case. We are investigating if he would have accidentally got himself trapped inside the sack while playing.” After speaking to the family, the police have learnt that they never had any fights with anyone in the area, neither did they have any enemies. “We are not ruling out murder. But we are also investigating on the possibility of getting trapped by self and unable to come out,” Gore said The boy, a resident of Balaram Wadi, was last seen by his sisters aged six and nine, who were playing on the first floor. While the mother had stepped out to buy chicken, father a painter by profession and grandmother a vegetable seller had gone for their respective jobs. The boy was playing at the ground floor when the mother left, though his mother could not find him on return.

In her rejoinder to the affidavit previously filed by BMC, Ranaut claimed there were discrepancies in BMC’s affidavit and that no substantial alterations had been underway when the bungalow was inspected on September 7 by the concerned officer. The case will be heard next on September 22. Last week, BMC had filed an affidavit in Bombay high court (HC), opposing Ranaut’s plea challenging the demolition work carried out by the civic body at her premises and demanding Rs 2 crore in damages. BMC had stated Ranaut undertook unauthorised additions and alterations to her bungalow. The demolition was stayed by HC and Ranaut was allowed to amend her petition. In addition to demanding Rs 2 crore as compensation, Rananut said BMC had damaged nearly 40% of her bungalow and other movable assets. On Monday, Ranaut submitted her rejoinder, filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, pointing out alleged discrepancies on BMC’s part and accusing the civic body of attempting to cover up its illegal action by misinterpreting the amended petition she’d filed. In her rejoinder, Ranaut said BMC had failed to prove its allegations as it had not attached any photographs, which should have been taken when the designated officer inspected Ranaut’s property on September 7. She said this pointed to high-handed action by BMC. Ranaut further claimed that designer Manish Malhotra, who owns the adjoining bungalow, was given seven days to respond after BMC found similar alleged violations on his property, but Ranaut was given only 24 hours. Ranaut has also questioned BMC’s procedure and claims, alleging malicious intent. Ranaut’s petition is likely to come up for hearing before the bench headed by justice SJ Kathawalla on September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-ongoing-work-during-bmc-inspection-of-mumbai-bungalow-kangana-ranaut-states-in-her-rejoinder-to-bmc-affidavit/story-UAJElriZWIhRkLthJgueVN.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||IPS officers tried hard to keep Fadnavis’s 80-hour government going in Maharashtra: Shiv Sena||A day after Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh dismissed reports of him having made any claims that a group of Indian police service (IPS) officers in the state had attempted to overthrow the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that an attempt was made to keep Devendra Fadnavis’ 80-hour government alive, but it was foiled.An editorial in Saamana on Monday said that some IPS officers were working as if it was their responsibility to prove majority on the floor of the House.Deshmukh, in an interview with a vernacular media outlet in Maharashtra, was asked if a group of IPS officers were working to topple the Uddhav Thackeray-led government. The minister said, “I do not wish to say anything publicly on this. All officers work diligently, but some officers can have different ideologies.”Following the interview, there were reports that Deshmukh had claimed that a plan to topple the government, hatched by some senior IPS officers, had been thwarted. Later, he issued a clarification stating, “This news is completely false... erroneous statements have been put into my mouth. Please see the video clip of the interview and you will realise that I had not said any such thing when I was asked to comment on whether there had been such a move planned by some IPS officers... I had only said that I cannot comment on such things openly.”The Sena mouthpiece said that several officers thought that the Fadnavis government will return to power after the 2019 assembly polls. “It was difficult for them to accept that despite having 105 legislators the BJP could not form the government... Some officers were involved in the early morning swearing-in [of Devendra Fadnavis] before the President’s rule was imposed... In a bid to remain in the CM’s good books, some police officials even tried to net legislators of smaller parties and some Independents. It is even true that the State Intelligence Department also played a role. Some officers were working as if they had taken up the responsibility of proving the majority,” the editorial said.Fadnavis, in a response to Deshmukh’s statement in the interview, said that no home minister has ever shown “distrust” on the police force. In a tweet on his official twitter handle, the former chief minister said, “To date, no Home Minister in the history of Maharashtra has shown so much distrust in his police force. It is not right to insult one’s police.”The editorial added that the state administration is “professional” and the “best”. “They do not have the power to make or break any government. It is not the culture of Maharashtra. If some minister thinks so that some officers are toppling the government then it sends a wrong message to people that the government is on a weak footing,” it said.It also indirectly slammed the BJP for thinking that officers’ lobby can help them topple the MVA government. It added that keeping an eye on elements who can pass on information to the opposition and work against the government is the job of the home department.“Some officers [who were involved] are still occupying high posts. They roam with confidence despite openly working to prevent Thackeray government from coming to power. The government could not do anything. The government is at danger from such a mindset. What does toppling the government mean? It is giving some information secretly to the opposition, to create an atmosphere of distrust against the government. Keeping an eye on such a mindset is the job of the home department. If it successfully does this task, then the future of the government is bright,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ips-officers-tried-hard-to-keep-fadnavis-s-80-hour-government-going-in-maharashtra-shiv-sena/story-qnzCjw8zvENmxI9yQ8SHSJ.html

21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn, PGI not on same page about converting Infosys Sarai into Covid Hospital||The Chandigarh administration and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) are not on the same page regarding the conversion of The Infosys Foundation-Red Cross Sarai in Sector 12 into a 200-bed hospital for Covid-19 patients.The administration had formally written to the PGIMER to take steps to convert Infosys Sarai, which provides patients and their attendants visiting the hospital a place to stay, into a Covid facility. However, the institute had said that its focus right now is to cater to patients already admitted to its dedicated Covid-19 wards, which have almost 400 beds.The issue was discussed during the review meeting on Monday, too, wherein PGIMER representatives said that arrangements have already been made to accommodate around 100 more patients in private wards of the main Nehru Hospital building besides the existing dedicated Covid facility at Nehru Hospital Extension Block.What they say“The PGIMER had some reservations as the building is being used for the hospital staff performing Covid-19 duties. After today’s discussion, we are not insisting on converting Infosys Sarai into a hospital for now. However, we have not shelved the plan, and the PGIMER will have to convert it if Covid-19 cases increase,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.The UT administration twice in its press statements has said that Infosys Sarai will be developed as a hospital for Covid-19 patients and the institute will take necessary steps in this regard.“The focus is on augmenting the facilities in the already earmarked areas and catering to patients admitted there,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.A senior doctor, on the condition of anonymity, said: “Infosys Sarai can be converted into a Covid care centre, but not a hospital. Arranging logistics for such operations needs time as well as a huge workforce, which is not available at this point of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-pgi-not-on-same-page-about-converting-infosys-sarai-into-covid-hospital/story-TiphKmU58Qu5K4DpMrzRlI.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||A breather: New Covid cases see a dip in tricity||The number of Covid-19 cases being reported daily has seen a gradual dip in the tricity, with only 440 fresh ones reported on Monday (September 21), down from 754 just three days back (September 18). The peak was witnessed on September 13, when 865 people had tested positive.Chandigarh, which has the maximum population in the tricity, has seen a gradual dip from 347 cases on September 15 to 240 on September 21. The daily count has remained below 300 since September 17 while around 1,500 tests are being conducted on an average every day.The number of people tested positive has more than halved in Mohali district from 337 on September 18 to 150 on September 21, while the number of tests has largely remained unchanged. Only 134 cases were reported on September 20. However, the number of cases as well as tests in Panchkula district have been fluctuating. When around 1,150 tests were conducted on September 16, 110 new cases had come to the fore. The tests saw a gradual decrease to 776 on September 20, while the number of cases stood at 133. Only 50 new cases surfaced on September 21.‘Number of factors need to be evaluated’“A number of factors need to be evaluated to see whether this is a real or pseudo dip in the pandemic,” said Dr PVM Lakshmi, a professor in the department of community medicine and school of public health at the PGIMER, who was also part of the central government’s team deputed to assist the Chandigarh administration in Covid-19 management. “To scientifically prove a dip, we need to take into account not only the testing numbers, but also the strategy employed. We need to see how and when contacts are being tested and what type of testing is being employed among other factors,” he said.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said the administration is not reading too much into the recent decline in numbers.“One factor (for decline) can be a dip in testing, but it has to be ruled out in the UT’s case as around 1,500 tests are being done daily for the past two weeks. A minor reason could be the increase in the number of antigen tests because more number of asymptomatic people are coming forward. Positivity among them is low, from which we can deduce that infection spread has decreased. But we need to wait and see whether this trend continues, “ he said. Dr KK Talwar, Punjab government’s adviser on health issues and former PGIMER director, said the situation is stabilising in a few districts of Punjab and same may be the case with the tricity. “If the number is decreasing, it shows that the situation is stabilising. But the emphasis should be on early detection of disease so that lives can be saved, “ he said. 3 succumb, 240 new cases in ChandigarhChandigarh reported 240 new coronavirus cases and three deaths on Monday.

The capacity development program will run for a week for 25 Planning and Statistics Officers associated with the Planning Department of the state government. “We have plenty of data, but the important thing is to understand it.

The programme is being conducted in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Public Administration.Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said government officials need a deeper understanding of available data to plan the infrastructure needs accordingly. “Our Planning Department has to become an expert of data.

21-09-2020||Delhi||Journalist Rajeev Sharma sent to police custody for a week more in espionage case||A Delhi court Monday sent 61-year-old journalist Rajeev Sharma, a Chinese woman and a Nepalese man, all arrested on charges of spying last week, to seven more days of custodial interrogation by the Delhi Police’s special cell. Police have also written to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking its help in exploring how Sharma was allegedly paid through shell companies operated by a couple in China.Chief metropolitan magistrate Pawan Singh Rajawat extended the custody of Sharma, Chinese woman Qing Shi, and Nepalese man Sher Singh after they were produced before the court at the end of their police remand. Sharma was arrested under the Official Secrets Act on September 14. The other two were booked under the same Act on September 19 for allegedly helping Sharma receive money from Chinese intelligence agents in lieu of information he allegedly provided them. On Monday, police sought eight days’ remand of Sharma while stating that they have written to the defence ministry about the “incriminating documents recovered from Sharma”. They said Sharma has to be “confronted with huge and voluminous data”. The police also said a lot of data was recovered from the cellphone and laptop of the three arrested persons. Appearing for Sharma, senior advocate Adish C Aggarwala, opposed the remand plea and said the investigation was not being conducted in the correct manner. He said all charges against his client were baseless and there was no evidence against Sharma with the police. Aggarwala had earlier told HT that police did not recover any classified document from Sharma’s Pitampura house (when he was arrested).“We also informed the court that the police have not provided us with a copy of the FIR. The bail application that we filed on September 17 was to be heard today ( Monday). The court directed the police to provide us with the FIR copy and reply on the bail plea by September 24,” Aggarwala said. Following this, the court sent Sharma to seven-day police remand and posted the matter to September 28. The bail hearing will also be on September 28, the senior advocate said. Special cell officers probing the case said Sharma was allegedly passing on “sensitive and classified information” to Chinese intelligence agencies since 2016, and was allegedly paid nearly ₹40 lakh through various channels, including Hawala transactions and shell companies. A senior officer associated with the probe said two sets of “classified documents”, running into nearly 15 pages and related to “India’s defence strategies at India-China border (Galwan valley)”, were recovered from Sharma’s Pitampura home, along with other incriminating documents that were found in his three email IDs and laptop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/journalist-rajeev-sharma-sent-to-police-custody-for-a-week-more-in-espionage-case/story-NJSXcaoiCkLca4fLEi6K0K.html

They said that such restrictions announced by the state government are taking a toll on their business.Owners of marriage palaces, banquet halls and tent dealers stated that the sector has already suffered losses of ₹70,000 crores and if the state government failed to provide any relief, the sector would collapse.Former president of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Manjit Nagpal said, “How can businesses think of revival with such restrictions in place? No events were taking place due to restriction on gatherings since the lockdown began in March.”Hotelier Gurmeet Singh said, “A large number of people are participating in farmers’ protests including Congress MLAs and no social distancing norms are being followed. We are not against the farmers, but the government should also accept our demands so that we can earn a livelihood.” President of Marriage Palace Welfare Association Amarjit Singh Sant said, “We have submitted memorandums with the government and MLAs on different occasions, but they are still not paying heed to the problem. These policies of the government will result in large scale unemployment and many would be forced to shut down their business permanently.”Tent dealers had also observed a two-day strike in the state on September 15 and 16 seeking extension in gathering limit. They had said that the lockdown is not only taking a toll on their business but also on their mental well-being.Secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers Welfare Association, Ashok Sharma and member, Dimpy Makkar said, “Tent dealers at large have been forced to change their vocation and many of them are selling vegetables to earn a livelihood. This is also taking a toll on their health as the government has failed to provide any relief in terms of electricity bills, bank loan installments, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-hospitality-sector-fears-shutdown-amid-stringent-gathering-curbs/story-lJuccrNNlUiTVJDmeMYz0H.html

However, the University Grant Commission (UGC)’s National Eligibility Test (NET) will also be conducted between September 24 and November 11 – including two papers on October 7 as well. JNU Students Union (JNUSU) has raised concerns that students wishing to appear for both exams may face issues in travelling. In a letter to NTA on Monday, the student body asked the examination agency to reschedule the exams and inform students at least a month in advance about the revised dates. “The UGC NET, also conducted by the NTA, falls on the same dates as the JNU entrance exams, rendering it impossible for many students to appear for both exams,” JNUSU wrote in its letter. The student body also pointed out that final semester exams of several universities will be continuing on the said dates, making it difficult for aspirants to appear for JNU entrance exams.“The dates have been announced just 15 days prior to the test. While the Covid-19 pandemic rages on and the transportation facilities are uncertain, this period is insufficient for students to plan their travel. Also, opportunities must be granted to students to change their centres before the announcement of the schedule,” said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh.A senior JNU official said the entrance exams are conducted by the NTA and the varsity will follow the decision of the examination agency. Despite repeated calls and texts, NTA director-general Vineet Joshi did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-entrance-exam-clashing-with-ugc-net-please-reschedule-varsity-student-body-tells-nta/story-pfAgAd37PErG2t7ia7YouL.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Jewellery of schoolteacher murdered in Chandigarh missing from house||The police team tasked with investigating the murder case of a 40-year-old government school teacher couldn’t find her jewellery at her house during a search. Jyoti Rani’s decomposing body was found at her Sector-23 accommodation on the night of September 15. Her husband Mandeep Singh, 42, also a teacher at a government school, is the prime suspect in the case. He has also been booked for attempting to kill one of his sons, whom he had allegedly pushed into a canal near Ludhiana. Mandeep is currently absconding. The detailed statements of the couple’s salary accounts also revealed that they had less than Rs 2,000 balance in each account, investigating officials said. As per a probing officer privy to the case, police have been able to trace only one bank account each in the name of Mandeep and Jyoti so far, wherein Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,200 were found, respectively. As Mandeep had not talked to his father Surmukh Singh, a retired inspector from Punjab Roadways, in the last five years, no one in his family was aware if they had more than one bank account. “Bank accounts of the couple had minimal amounts and even the jewellery of the victim was not found in her house during a search,” Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vineet Kumar said. Police sources also pointed out that the family owned a property in Kharar and was considering selling it off. Missing son was to celebrate birthday on MondayThe nine-year-old son of the couple, who is still missing, was to celebrate his birthday on September 21. His grandparents, who already have the custody of his elder brother, are now worried about his well-being. Meanwhile, to ensure uninterrupted studies of the couple’s elder son, one of Mandeep’s college friends, Rajinder Singh Kamboj, who teaches at the government school in Sector 43, on Monday collected study material from the boy’s school. The couple’s sons, aged 13 and nine, studied at a Sector-33 private school, which already has decided to offer free education to the boys till Class 10. Jyoti Rani was found dead at her government accommodation by a police team from Ludhiana, which had come knocking at her house to drop her elder son. The police are yet to trace Mandeep Singh and his nine-year-old son, who was in the car when he pushed his other son in Neelon canal on the night of September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jewellery-of-schoolteacher-murdered-in-chandigarh-missing-from-house/story-T2hAycEC4xK44xeM4pvmzL.html

The man, identified as Mam Chand, later blackmailed the aspiring models with their pictures. He used to impersonate established female models to target and deceive the aspiring models, deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse, said. “Chand is a resident of Sultanpuri. He was involved in a cheating case of Hisar in Haryana,” the DCP said. Police said a 17-year-old girl filed a complaint, alleging she was contacted by one Rashi Goel on social media. Goel introduced herself as a model, who was looking for new models for an upcoming web series, and asked for normal and unclothed photographs of the complainant for auditions, the DCP said. “The girl sent such photographs to Goel. But when Goel kept on asking for more photographs, the girl blocked her. Thereafter, the complainant was contacted by two persons, who sent her the same photos she had sent to Goel, and threatened her,” the DCP said. “During investigation, four social media IDs used to contact victims were identified. The accused was apprehended from outside his residence in Sultanpuri,” Alphonse said. Police said he used to contact potential victims from different fake profiles but never met them. “He claimed he never met any victim. An audition form was found in his mobile phone. Objectionable photographs of victims were found in the mobile phone of the accused,” the DCP said.

It has discharged more than 1,333 cases, with a recovery rate of 81%, one of the highest in the city. According to a hospital official, more than 322 civilian patients were admitted requiring critical care and 55 police personnel have been treated in ICU and discharged. The institute also gave a helping hand to the Pune Cantonment General Hospital by looking after over 40 patients requiring ICU care. AICTS deals with complex interventional cardiology, intricate cardio-thoracic surgeries, pulmonary and Interventional radiology and pathology. With the increase in Covid cases in the region in March 2020, there was a need to have a separate Covid hospital of the Army in Pune so that the multi-disciplinary Southern Command Hospital could continue treatment of non-Covid patients unhindered. AICTS was identified and converted into a Covid hospital for treatment of primarily service personnel, ex-Servicemen and their wards from March 29, 2020. “The hospital converted its 600-bed facility into a 400-bed Covid facility with 20 critical beds (ventilator), 30 intensive care unit (ICU) and 350 isolation beds. The institute has been a blessing for numerous Covid patients not only from the Armed Forces fraternity, but also civilian patients of Pune and neighbouring areas. AICTS has also been taking care of Covid-19 infected police personnel of Pune district and civilians on referral basis as directed by the designated civil administration,” stated a press note from Defence Public Relation Wing.The hospital has managed complex multi-organ failure cases and is also a key member in multiple research projects including the WHO study “Solidarity Trial” - an international randomised trial of additional treatments for Covid in hospitalised patients. At present, hospitalised patients with symptomatic Covid are given either injection Remdesivir or Interferon Beta 1a, which are being provided by the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aicts-treats-1-650-covid-patients-81-recovery-rate-highest-among-pune-hospitals/story-LMhCcaX7bXvrJH2mi92TFM.html

21-09-2020||City||Covid impact: 75% high-end brand outlets cease operations at Chandigarh airport||The coronavirus crisis has cut a swathe through retail establishments at the Chandigarh international airport, forcing almost 75% of the shops to put up the shutters. Despite domestic flight operations resuming at the airport on May 25, 22 of the total 30 high-end brands’ outlets had to shut down owing to huge losses. The airport now only has eight shops, which hardly see any visitors. Retailers here say though their business has gained some momentum with about 15% improvement in footfall, passengers are still not willing to visit their shops amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The airport, too, is incurring a loss of nearly Rs 7 crore per month on various accounts. Losses suffered by the airport authorities in the past five months have been pegged at about Rs 50 crore. Before the lockdown, the airport saw at least 12,000 passengers, both at arrivals and departures, daily. The number has since come down to 1,000 a day. While 44 domestic and two international flights (Sharjah and Dubai) used to arrive and depart from the airport before March 23, only six to eight flights operate daily these days. One of the shop owners said they have requested the authorities to charge the rent on the basis of revenue share. “But the management issued a letter stating that the rent will be fixed as per the passenger traffic. Food, beverages, retail, and services have borne the brunt of the pandemic at the airport and if this continues, we will be forced to shut all shops,” the shop owner, who wished to remain anonymous, added.‘Will take some time to tide over this crisis’Chandigarh airport’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj said, “We have asked the shop owners to pay rent on the basis of passenger traffic. Though our footfall has improved by 15% with about 3,000 passengers per day, we are still suffering a monthly loss of around Rs 7 crore. We will take some months to tide over these crises.”The airport’s main source of revenue is the aeronautical category, whereby the authorities charge Rs 800 per passenger from the airlines. For instance, a Delhi-bound flight with 80% occupancy pays about Rs 65,000 to the airport. The other sources of revenue are retail shops, office spaces, vehicle parking, and advertisements. Daily estimate of the total revenue generated by the airport was around Rs 30 lakh during pre-corona times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-75-high-end-brand-outlets-cease-operations-at-chandigarh-airport/story-JPYIKhG99DDsWpgaY8tUCO.html

As many as 21 senior leaders, including former ministers and legislators, were in attendance.The party spokesperson said it was observed in the meeting that while the internal situation of J&K is very precarious, the situation at LoC and LAC is also on the boil.“It was resolved that the party would continue to fight for resolution of the basic issues and advocate dialogue and reconciliation with all the stakeholders, as envisaged in the party’s roadmap, which has become more relevant than ever,” the spokesperson said.During the deliberations, the leaders opined that post-August 5, 2019, a false semblance of normalcy is being created in the Valley, which in fact resembles the peace of the graveyard.“People are still shell-shocked and unable to come to terms with what has happened. The situation has created a kind of a stalemate where nothing except all kinds of anti-Kashmiri steps like domicile law etc are being pushed in a hurry,” the party said.The PDP spokesperson added that the party leaders demanded immediate release of all political detainees, irrespective of their political ideology, whether lodged in Kashmir or outside.They also expressed anguish over the recent spree of killing of innocent people from Shopian to Sopore to Batamaloo and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to book and families be given justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pdp-meets-for-first-time-after-scrapping-of-article-370/story-hlqNJorzDppJLeo1sk4QXO.html

This struggle of the farmers will not go in vain because those who have fought have never lost, the MLA said. Jain said the government should bring a fourth ordinance that gives legal rights of the MSP to the farmers, and there should be such a provision that if someone buys at a price less than the MSP, action is taken against him.The party also sought the rollback of the farm bills while demanding withdrawal of cases filed against farmers during Pipli rally and compensation for those injured in a recent lathicharge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-holds-protest-against-farm-bills-in-ambala/story-tNC2YPceD5Bs4DvyphmCkI.html

He was posthumously awarded the Kirti Chakra in 2004.The fallen soldier’s 70-year-old mother, Rajkumari, said the government made false promises of honouring his son in the past 18 years.She said she was assured naming of a government high school in Kangra besides a memorial in her son’s name, but both were empty promises by the state government. This is why she decided to return the award to the President through the Himachal governor.“My son’s martyrdom was not recognised in nearly two decades. I don’t expect anything from anyone now,” Rajkumari said in disappointment.Amit’s brother said he feels proud to be related to a fallen soldier, but never expected such disgrace to someone who sacrificed his life for the country.As the slain jawan’s family members were interacting with the media outside the Raj Bhawan, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, whose convoy was passing by, invited the former to his office and assured them of looking into the matter. He requested the mother not to return the award.Thakur said, “I am going to find out every detail on why the promises made to the family were not fulfilled and ensure that they are soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fallen-hp-soldier-s-kin-reach-raj-bhavan-to-return-gallantry-award/story-NnCcOV7djK7U8x9Fan9OKJ.html
21-09-2020||City||Schools reopen in Haryana with few students amid Covid scare||Schools in Haryana reopened partially on Monday for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak in March.In line with the Centre’s Unlock 4 guidelines, students from Classes 9 to 12 have been allowed to voluntarily visit teachers for a limited time to seek guidance.According to the standard operating procedure (SoP) issued by the ministry of health and family welfare on September 8, only 50% teaching/non-teaching staff will be allowed on the premises, and attendance is not mandatory for students.Parent consent is mandatory, and the relaxation doesn’t apply to containment zones.Schools need to schedule activities and chart out a seating plan to ensure physical distancing of six feet, wherever feasible, among students and teachers.Sonepat district education officer, Joginder Hooda, said he visited a couple of schools to check and ensure that the standard operating procedures are followed. “Less number of students visited the schools on the first day. Teachers and other management staff followed safety guidelines. Only teachers, who had tested negative, were allowed to visit the schools. Students were allowed to visit the schools after a written consent from their parents,” the DEO added.The DEO said the teachers were instructed not to share books, chalks and dusters with other teachers and students. Also, the school authorities have modified the toilets and pedals have been installed to control water taps.“A five-minute break was given after a 40-minute class. One student was allowed at a time to go to the toilet,” he said. Students and teachers had undergone thermal scanning before entering the school premises.A senior education official, pleading anonymity, said many students did not visit the school on the first day as their parents are yet to give the school heads a consent in writing. “We will not allow any student to enter the premises without their parents consent. We cannot take any risks even though we are following safety guidelines,” he added.Govt school in Fatehabad shut as three teachers test positiveA government senior secondary school in Fatehabad city was closed after three teachers tested positive for coronavirus two days ago. The sanitation drive was conducted in the school and students were informed in advance not to visit the school till further orders, an official said.Parents refrain from sending kids to school In Karnal, most parents refrained from sending their children to school amid the rise in number of Covid-19 cases in the state.As per the record of the district education department, there are 179 high and senior secondary schools in Karnal district and on an average three to five students came to schools to clarify their doubts. Officials in the district education department said that in some schools not even a single student came on the first day.A parent, Sumit Kumar said, “It is a very difficult time especially for children. We cannot send them to school as it is very risky because the number of virus cases are on the rise and online classes are a better option.”Karnal district education officer RK Choudhary said schools were reopened partially as per the guidelines and students were allowed entry only after thermal screening and sanitising hands and shoes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-reopen-in-haryana-with-few-students-amid-covid-scare/story-SLz4qBBFv6RL49qQrVTBHK.html

21-09-2020||City||Haryana Congress holds statewide protest against farm bills||The Haryana Congress held protests across the state on Monday against the Parliament’s nod to the contentious farm bills, which the party described as “black laws”. State Congress chief Kumari Selja led the protest in Jind, while former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda addressed the protesters in Sonepat. Senior leaders Ajay Singh Yadav and Kuldeep Bishnoi joined the protest in Rewari and Hisar districts, respectively. The party workers, who staged a protest at the district headquarters, submitted a memorandum addressed to the President through deputy commissioners. While addressing mediapersons, Hooda said the Congress has sought a special session of the Haryana assembly to discuss the “impact and ramifications” of the farm bills. He said the party will also move a resolution against these bills. He said they will not tolerate attack on the farmers’ rights. “These three ‘black laws’ are a direct attack on the MSP and mandi system which have been built over the last 70 years. The government made a law to encourage purchases outside the market but there has been no reference to the protection under MSP,” he added.Reacting over the ruling party’s allegations that these bills were part of Congress manifesto, Hooda said the BJP was spreading lies about the party manifesto and the recommendations of a committee headed by him.Hooda said crops like paddy, millet, cotton, moong and maize are being sold at a much lower rate than MSP and farmers are forced to sell these at minimal rates.“Everyone knows that the aim of open market is to get rid of MSP. If the farmer could get a good rate in the open market, then there is no need to arrange MSP in the country,” he said. Addressing the protesters in Jind, the party’s state unit chief Kumari Selja said the “anti-farmer” move of the Union government will “destroy the peasants”. “BJP is pro-capitalists, it does not understand the pain of the poor and the farmers. They hurriedly pushed through these bills. They even did not care to listen to the suggestion of the opposition members that bills should be referred to the select committee, which could have then taken a view of farmers, farm-labourers, arhitiyas (commission agents),” Selja said. Hitting out at the BJP, Selja said, “They accuse the Congress and opposition parties of misleading the farmers whereas the entire country can see the pain of farmers”. She alleged that under the present system, “big companies will exploit the farmers. Also, in case of any dispute, can ordinary farmers take on big corporates, how will a small farmer fight the legal battle?”. Selja said the Congress-led government in neighbouring Punjab raised its voice against these bills but the BJP-JJP coalition in Haryana is silent. “The state government has adopted silence. They are not raising voice in favour of farmers,” she said. “Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar should have raised the voice of farmers before the prime minister but he does not have the courage to do so. Deputy chief minister (Dushyant Chautala), who used to do politics in farmers’ name, too is not raising voice because hanging on to power is more dear to him now,” she alleged. In Karnal, party workers led by local leaders sat on a dharna outside the mini-secretariat. The protesters demanded withdrawal of the bills and submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav. In Kurukshetra, party leader Ashok Arora said the new laws will affect farmers and labourers. He said the Congress will continue its agitation till the government withdraws these bills. In Ambala, protesters led by Congress MLAs Varun Chaudhary and Shelley Chaudhary, Haryana Congress treasurer Rohit Jain staged a demonstration near the DC office. Congress MLA Varun Chaudhary termed the bills a move to ruin the lives of farmers, who are already facing hardships. Through the memorandum, he said, the party sought the President’s intervention in the matter and asked him not to sign the bills. Similar protests were observed by Congress workers near the mini secretariat in Yamunanagar.

21-09-2020||City||Four months on, Kathuria sees political conspiracy in his expulsion||Nearly four months after former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chander Prakash Kathuria was expelled from the primary membership of the party after a video, purportedly shot as he jumped off the second floor of woman’s house in Chandigarh’s Sector 63, surfaced on social media, he has termed the incident a political conspiracy to defame him. As per the earlier reports, the leader, 51, was reportedly visiting a woman in the apartment for some official work when another person whom he did not want to meet turned up there. In a bid to avoid running into the person, Kathuria reportedly tried to descend from the balcony with the help of a cloth, and fell down after losing grip. He was admitted at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, with a fractured leg. After the incident, he was expelled from the primary membership of the party for six years. While addressing a press conference here along with his wife on Monday, Kathuria said that one Vikramjit alias Happy of Karnal, a relative of a local Congress leader, had hatched a conspiracy against him for political advantages. Kathuria did not rule out the possibility of involvement of local BJP leaders in the conspiracy. He, however, did not take any names.“The woman shown in the video is like my sister and I had known her father since 26 years. I had gone to their house to sort out a dispute between the couple,” he said. “However, there was some misunderstanding and the woman shown in the video saw Vikramjit outside her house. She asked me not to go out from the main door and therefore I tried to exit from the balcony,” Kathuria said. “I decided to get down from the balcony with the help of a cloth but lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital,” he added. He said the woman had also filed a police complaint against Vikramjit accusing him of threatening her guest. Kathuria said at that time he could not file a police complaint since he was in the hospital. “I have now written to Haryana home minister,” he added.“I am not against the party but there are some people who were behind the conspiracy and they should be exposed,” he said. Kathuria said he had tried speaking to the chief minister twice but did not get any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-months-on-kathuria-sees-political-conspiracy-in-his-expulsion/story-0Sctno6L3tYreGoYciP8RO.html
21-09-2020||City||HC admits plea seeking regulations on web series’ content||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday admitted a plea seeking measures to control and regulate alleged illegal, anti-social, vulgar, abusive and anti-national content that is being broadcast on web series. The plea has been filed by a lawyer, Sukhchain Singh Gill. The high court bench of justice Arun Palli while admitting the plea observed that he was espousing the public cause and interest thus his plea needed to be registered as Public Interest Litigation and referred it to chief justice for ‘appropriate orders’. He had alleged that Sony Liv, an online platform that broadcasts various web series was streaming content without any certification or approval from any government authority. Recently, Sphere Origins Multivision Pvt. Ltd. produced a web series “Your Honor” and on viewing its content, it is apparent that it tends to bring the legal system, administration of justice and the judicial institution to disrepute, he had told court, supplying a copy of the content before the bench. Such content erodes public faith and confidence and also creates communal disharmony, he had claimed. The court was told that web series content is uncensored/unchecked as it is out of the purview of the Cinematograph (Amendment) Act, 1973. The Board of Film Certification, constituted for the purpose of sanctioning films for public exhibition examines the film to be exhibited on various public platforms. There is a mechanism in place to regulate movies being produced by Bollywood and other regional cinemas along with television shows by the TV industry. But there is none to regulate the alleged vulgar, violent, distorted and anti-social content exhibited in the form of web series, he had told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-admits-plea-seeking-regulations-on-web-series-content/story-FDOam5RvUevLOitBhcGJGK.html

The state government’s disappointment has been communicated by principal secretary, industries and commerce, Alok Shekhar in writing to Union secretary, department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra. “Having implemented 100% reforms, it is disappointing to note that Punjab did not substantially improve its ranking as compared to last year,” according to the letter sent by Shekhar, on Monday. In the Business Reform Action Plan 2019 (BRAP-2019) rankings representing the performance of states and union territories on ease of doing business which were announced by DPIIT on September 5, Punjab was at 19th place, just one notch higher than the 20th rank the state got in 2017-18 when it was sluggish in implementation. The industries and commerce department was expecting a big leap in its ranking this time, hoping to break into top 10, and has been feeling let down by the survey findings. Director, industries, Sibin C said they were dissatisfied with the ranking and have expressed their resentment to the central ministry. “There is no clarity on how the states were ranked as the detailed survey report is still to be made available,” he said. Punjab had implemented all 178 of the 187 reforms applicable to the state. The DPIIT has also been requested to provide the questionnaire used to gather feedback, methodology followed for ranking the states and UTs and detailed score for each recommendation to enable the state government to identify the gaps. The states were ranked on the basis of implementation of business reform action plan in business regulatory areas such as single window system, access to information, labour, environment, etc. The EODB rankings, which were launched by the Centre five years ago to encourage competition among states for improvement in business environment to attract investments, also gave full weightage to feedback about the effectiveness of the reforms – an area that has not been the state’s strong suit. In 2016, Punjab had got 12th rank, but has not able to get anywhere close since, slipping to 20th position in 2018 due to non-implementation of 45% of the 372 action points for reforms in areas related to labour, single window system, environment clearances, construction permits, paying taxes, obtaining utility certificates, land availability and allotment, enforcing contracts, registering property and carrying out inspections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uneasy-over-low-rank-in-ease-of-doing-business-punjab-writes-to-centre/story-5jJKuSSfvr3dfKpb0bVIgI.html

21-09-2020||City||New regional parties in Assam unlikely to merge; could join hands for 2021 polls||Several new regional political parties have formed in Assam with the intention of dislodging the ruling coalition, headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in the upcoming assembly polls that are likely to be held in the end of March and early April next year.Three parties -- Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) and United Regional Party-Assam (URPA) -- have been formed and another outfit by peasant leader Akhil Gogoi’s Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) is set to be announced later this week. “We waited until September 20 for the AJP to come together with us and form a united regional party. We will announce our new party this week because there was no positive response from them (the AJP),” Bhasco De Saikia, who is the president of the KMSS, told media persons on Sunday. Also Read: Schools in four northeast states reopen partially today after six monthsThe new parties have been floated by personalities and organisations that were at the forefront of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 stir in the state and espouse the protection of the rights of the indigenous communities in Assam. Two of Assam’s biggest student bodies -- All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) -- have formed the AJP.Journalist-turned-Rajya Sabha (RS) member Ajit Bhuyan has floated the AGM. Eminent filmmaker Jahnu Barua is one of the guiding forces behind the URPA. The regional parties will take on the ruling BJP-Asom Gana Parishad (AGP)-Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and the grand alliance announced by opposition Congress and perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). “We want all regional forces to come together to fight the upcoming assembly polls. There is no other alternative in a bid to counter the ruling BJP-led combine and the Congress-AIUDF alliance,” said Jagadish Bhuyan, coordinator of the AJP. “But any decision on that would have to wait until November when AJP’s first political convention takes place, the party office-bearers are announced and a constitution is adopted,” he added. Bhuyan stressed that contrary to the view that the AJP is not in favour of all regional parties coming together his outfit strongly favours all the new political formations and the existing regional parties uniting under a single platform for the next year’s assembly polls. “We are of the view that we might not have one party, one flag and one symbol. But all regional forces must join hands to fight against the ruling BJP-led coalition and the Congress-AIUDF alliance,” said KMSS’s Saikia. Besides the AJP, the AGM, the URPA and the KMSS’s yet-to-be-named party, the existing regional outfits such as the Asom Songrami Mancha (ASM) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are also expected to join the platform. “We welcome formation of the new parties, but that’s not going to affect our prospects in next year’s assembly polls. Our party has 42 lakh members and if each of them brings in just one additional vote we will get 84 lakh votes, which will be enough for a win,” Ranjeet Kumar Dass, BJP’s Assam unit chief had told HT recently. Congress’s Assam unit chief Ripun Bora told media persons last week that his party would want the AJP and all the other regional parties to join the Congress-AIUDF alliance if they were serious about dislodging the BJP from power. A few more political outfits are likely to be formed before the next year’s assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-regional-parties-in-assam-unlikely-to-merge-could-join-hands-for-2021-polls/story-dn0p9KmSNuV6IoMPnGuuuK.html

However, Gupta has a good previous track record. At the same time, he has been punished for his act,” said Deshmukh on Sunday while interacting with journalists in Pune.When asked what exactly was the punishment meted out to the IPS officer, Deshmukh preferred to remain silent.Maratha quotaOn the Maratha opposition to initiating the recruitment process for 12,500 posts in the police department, Deshmukh said a legal opinion is being sought on retaining 13 per cent of the posts vacant for the community, until the Supreme Court takes a decision on the matter.“The process of recruitment in the police department was initiated around two months ago and the cabinet approved it only recently after the Supreme Court verdict. Since the process of recruiting for 12,500 posts will take time and the government does not want anyone to be left out, it is planning to keep 13 per cent of posts vacant and reserved for the Maratha community,” said Deshmukh, responding to the opposition to the beginning of recruitment.Rajya Sabha MP Sambhaji Raje and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis have opposed the government’s move to go ahead with the recruitment process and termed it as, “rubbing salt in the wound”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-the-wadhwan-e-pass-issue-maha-home-minister-backs-pune-s-new-police-chief-amitabh-gupta/story-rnFvZDtoExpmu6g8ui9ZWJ.html

21-09-2020||Chandigarh||New sports complex to tap south Kashmir’s talent reservoir||Two kilometres away from town, under the shade of poplar and willow trees, a group of workers are busy cementing the interiors of an indoor stadium expected to be completed by next year.Sports officials say it will be one of the biggest facilities in south Kashmir to hone the sporting skills of young men and women from its four districts: Pulwama, Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian. This will be the nursery to groom raw talent, especially in cricket.“This complex will have all the facilities for players of various games, a 50-room hostel where players can plan camps for two or three weeks,’’ says cricketer Pervaz Rasool, who has represented the Indian team and has a huge fan following across Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). Rasool, who is also associated with the J&K Sports Council, which is building the complex, said the sports body had earlier developed facilities at the Higher Secondary Ground in Bijbehara through local resources and its impact is visible. “Now we have dozens of young talented players representing different events at the national level in cricket. Good infrastructure makes a difference.’’ State-of-the-art facilitiesBeing built at a cost of Rs 16 crore on 5.5 hectares, the new complex will have, apart from the indoor stadium, a cricket ground of international standards, a football ground, hockey stadium, skating rink, cycle track, modular synthetic basketball court, volleyball and badminton courts. “Work is underway and we hope that in the next five to six months most of the project will be completed. Because of its size it’s going to take time, what with winter approaching,” says Anantnag deputy commissioner KK Sidha.As all funds had been released by the government the deadline for the completion of the complex is 2021.The need for such a facility has been felt as south Kashmir has an abundance of talent, especially in cricket. “Boys as young as 12 or 13 from Bijbehara in Anantnag and other areas of south Kashmir have already played in the Ranji and the Indian Premier League (IPL). This year too one of our boys from south Kashmir is playing in the IPL in Dubai. Pervaz Rasool, who played for the national team, lives a few kilometers away from the sports complex,’’ says Sidha.Youths forced to go to Srinagar, JammuHimself a local from south Kashmir, Sidha stresses on the importance of the complex, saying youths from the area are usually forced to go to Srinagar and Jammu for training. “Once they have a facility, they can train here. Senior players will also get an opportunity to groom the younger ones.’ As cricket has huge potential, Sidha says 12 cricket practice wickets are also being set up in the district from administrative funds to attract the youth towards this game, and “their energy will be channelised towards sports activities.’’ Ishfaq Ahmad, junior engineer with J&K Sports Council, under whose supervision the complex is taking shape, says it will have state-of-the-art facilities. “This is going to benefit 3,000 youths of the entire south Kashmir area. Even players from other parts can come here as we are constructing a big hostel here. The multi-purpose indoor complex is under construction and Rs 4 crore is being spent on it under the prime minister’s development package and it will be completed within two months.” Locals too are enthused. “This complex will become the training nursery for future players. Many of our talented boys and girls couldn’t excel as they didn’t have any facilities. And if trained coaches are available it could be a game changer and give country future players in various games,’’ says Tasaduq, a sports columnist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-sports-complex-to-tap-south-kashmir-s-talent-reservoir/story-oaBeuhNDLwBoTPWfdphjfP.html

HT could not independently verify the veracity of the picture.“This picture is so disturbing and violative of all decency in a democracy. This is extremely shameful and unacceptable,” said Nishi Pandey, a Lucknow University professor.“To protest is a democratic right. We do not deserve this manhandling.

The victim’s mother informed her husband and took the girl to a nearby hospital where the doctor confirmed the rape and referred her to the district hospital.”The 19-year-old accused was arrested on Sunday and was booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 376 (rape) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Police said the accused has confessed to raping the girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/19-year-old-man-rapes-toddler-in-madhya-pradesh/story-WvocpUbadINroiqM3XXMuM.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Commission agents’ strike enters fourth day, farmers unable to sell produce||Even as the prices of Basmati have declined to around Rs 1,000 per quintal, paddy growers in Haryana are unable to sell their produce—thanks to the indefinite strike of the commission agents, which entered the fourth day on Monday.Due to the strike, the commission agents have not allowed traders to procure paddy and made farmers wait in the mandis for the past three days. Thousands of migrant labourers have been sitting idle since the procurement operations were stopped on September 18.The growers of early varieties of paddy like PUSA 1509 of Basmati and PR 126 of Parmal are bearing the brunt as the strike may cause a glut in the mandis, leading to a further fall in the prices.Also Read: Farm bills: PM Modi says farmers to get better prices because of reforms“My produce from four acres of land is lying unsold in the mandi for the past three days. There are no buyers because of the strike. I am unable to pay the labourers who harvested this crop,” said Sandeep Kumar, a farmer of Nilokheri, Karnal district.According to the farmers and the commission agents, there are no buyers despite the prices of some varieties of Basmati have declined to below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Last year, the price was Rs 3,000 per quintal.The farmers fear that the prices may drop further due to the ongoing strike as the government does not have any control over the private buyers and there is no Minimum Support Price for the Basmati varieties. Also Read: Congress MP says 12 parties have sought time to meet president over passage of farm bills, request him to not give his assentMoreover, the All India Rice Exporters’ Association (AIREA) has also extended its support to the commission agents as it has decided not to procure paddy until the government exempts the market fee even on paddy procured from the grain markets.In this regard, the AIREA has issued an advisory to private traders not to procure paddy till the government decides to withdraw the Market Fees and Rural Infrastructure Development Fee, which is around 4% on the paddy procured in the mandis of the state.However, the ahartia (commission agents ) had declared an indefinite strike, demanding the government withdraw the three ordinances passed by the Centre, but now that the bills have been passed in both the Houses, there is no clarity on how long the strike will continue.“The government has become uncontrollable and it is misusing the mandate to enact such anti-farmer anti-ahartia laws. But this will spread the agitations further if the government fails to resolve this issue,” said Ashok Gupta, state president of Haryana Anaj Mandi Ahartia Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/commission-agents-strike-enters-fourth-day-farmers-unable-to-sell-produce/story-LiW1reTT4l8Or7pvyGJdIP.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Solar fencing comes to rescue of farmers in Kangra||A state-run farm protection scheme has helped farmers, who abandoned agriculture due to the stray cattle and monkey problem, to return to farming in Kangra district. The district authorities have spent ₹10.31 crore under the Mukhyamantri Khet Sanrakshan Yojna, a flagship scheme of the state government, on fencing abandoned farmlands in the district, benefiting 784 farmers. Under the scheme, there is a provision of 50% subsidy on barbed wire and chain link fencing, 70% on composite fencing and 85% on solar fencing. The scheme was launched from 2016-17 to help farmers protect their crops from stray and wild animals, including monkeys. Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said a total of 1,26,843 metres of solar fencing was installed, covering more than 12 hectares of abandoned farmlands where agriculture has been restarted. One of the beneficiaries, Rajendra Kumar of Gaggal near Dharamshala, said that he had abandoned farming a decade ago due to the stray animal problem. “Wild boars, monkeys and stray cattle would destroy crops. Two years ago, I approached the agriculture department for this scheme,” he said, adding he got 320 metres of solar fencing installed, covering 10 kanals. “Of the total cost of ₹3.5 lakh, I contributed ₹1.07 lakh, while subsidy worth ₹2.5 lakh was given by the agriculture department,” he said. Another beneficiary, Mithila Sharma of Siholpuri village in Shahpur panchayat, said that the stray animal problem was so rampant that he could not even grow turmeric or ginger let aside traditional crops. “This scheme helped me return to farming. Now, I grow not only traditional but cash crops also,” Sharma said. Narendra Dhiman, the regional joint director of agriculture, said the solar fencing carries solar energy produced current, delivering a severe but non-fatal shock to an animal coming in its contact, deterring it from entering a field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/solar-fencing-comes-to-rescue-of-farmers-in-kangra/story-p3Y6ifASFlFnB1tcO3JQLK.html
21-09-2020||Pune||32% Punekars used connections to get an ICU bed, only 5% went through routine process: Survey||An online survey conducted by a community social media platform found that over 32 per cent of the respondents said that they had to use “connections” and “clout” to get a Covid-19 ICU bed while only five per cent of the respondents said that they got a bed through the routine process. Pune has reported multiple cases wherein people had to struggle to get an ICU or a ventilator on time because of which some lives were lost. The survey had 653 responses from people living in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Of these, 32 per cent said that they had to use connections and clout to get an ICU bed, 10 per cent had to follow up aggressively and one per cent even used social media to draw the attention of the administration to get a bed. While 44 per cent said that they had to use all the former options to get an ICU bed. Three per cent also said that they had to pay a bribe to get an ICU bed. Only five per cent said that they got it through a routine process while the remaining five per cent said that they did not get it.Among the questions, the survey asked people to also include whether hospitals should mandatorily display real-time ICU bed availability on websites and building entrances. Of the 504 people who responded, 88 per cent said that it should be made mandatory while 10 per cent said no. The remaining 2 per cent replied as ‘can’t say’. Local circles is a community a social media platform that enables citizens and small businesses to escalate issues for policy and enforcement interventions and enables the government to make policies that are citizen and small business-centric. Sachin Taparia, founder of Local Circles which conducted this survey said, “We received many complaints from citizens from across the country about their family, friends or associates not being able to find an ICU bed at a government or a private hospital. We received about over 17,000 responses from citizens located in over 211 districts of the country.” He further said that among the total responses over 55 per cent said that they did not have any person in their network that needed a Covid-19 ICU bed. Pune received 1,157 responses but only those who did report any such experience were included and the rest were taken out of the sample. A senior doctor from Sassoon hospital requesting anonymity said, “I have at least five letters from MLA’s, MP’s and local politicians recommending patients who need either an ICU bed or ventilators.”Rajesh tope, health minister who was in Pune on Sunday inspected Sassoon hospital and also addressed the issue of bed shortage in the city. He said, “I will be in the city for two days now and will be visiting various facilities. I will also take a meeting with the owners of trust hospitals. All private hospitals with huge capacity will be there in the meeting. We will also increase the beds in Sassoon and recruit more doctors.”There have been multiple incidents which have been reported by Hindustan Times earlier too, that while the Covid-19 dashboard made for Pune division did reflect vacant ICU beds and ventilators in some hospitals, citizens often returned empty-handed because the hospital said they did not have any beds at the moment. As of Sunday evening, the Covid centre dashboard stated that there were only 16 ICU beds without ventilators and only one ventilator available in the entire city while PCMC showed 88 vacant beds for ICU without a ventilator and 14 vacant ICU beds with a ventilator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/32-punekars-used-connections-to-get-an-icu-bed-only-5-went-through-routine-process-survey/story-iwDwqbKIJOGC6rIZ3QttbI.html
21-09-2020||Pune||25 per cent increase in demand for ‘immunity booster’ eggs, says NECC, Pune||The promotion of eggs as a ‘rich source of protein’ and ‘immunity booster’ during the Covid-19 crisis has brightened the prospects of poultry farmers. The rising demand for eggs has led to an increase in egg prices in the city to Rs60 - Rs72 per dozen. Similarly, the packed eggs which were selling at Rs75 are now available at ₹90 for buyers. According to the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC), Pune, the Covid-19 crisis has broken the back of the poultry farmers and the rising demand and confidence of the citizenry for eggs has led to an egg shortage and price rise. The domestic consumption of eggs for Pune is pegged between 35-40 lakh eggs on a daily basis while the current supply was around 25 lakh, NECC added. Shyam Bhagat, NECC, Pune president said, “The efforts of the government and people resulted in eggs being accepted as the most preferred unadulterated immunity booster. The citizens have shown full confidence in eggs as the sole immunity booster. There is no solution to Covid-19 as there is no medicine available. People are convinced that the eggs are the way to fight Covid-19. In government hospitals, eggs were given to patients to boost their immunity. The poultry farms had shut down due to the Covid-19 crisis leading to a shortage.”“Moreover, people started eating eggs in large numbers to protect their health and boost immunity leading to rising demand for eggs. The poultry farming industry which is currently facing a crisis can be revived due to this rising egg consumption trend.” Nana peth-based Bismillah poultry owner Yusuf Khan said, “There is a shortage of eggs in the market as there has been a sudden demand for eggs due to the Covid-19 crisis. Our buyers are buying double the number of eggs to increase immunity. Currently, we are selling eggs at ₹70 per dozen. Most of the consumers have increased their consumption of boiled eggs leading to increased demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/25-per-cent-increase-in-demand-for-immunity-booster-eggs-in-pune/story-ERDsKRn8cMkCflc39BEMjJ.html
21-09-2020||Pune||Residents want Khadda Market in Pune to be relocated; traders cry foul say false violations listed||The Covid-19 pandemic has taught residents a new way of living. Things which were the usual norm earlier have to be discarded now, including the overcrowded daily vegetable markets set up across the city serving residents with fresh produce. Norms of social distancing, sanitiser stands and wearing of masks have made setting up or restarting such local markets a dangerous proposition as it could lead to spreading of the Covid-19 infection.A similar situation has presented itself at the 40-year-old Khadda market of Pune Cantonment near Pul Gate. The market served at least a thousand residents living in the area before the pandemic started. The market stands empty currently owing to the lockdown enforced by the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB). However, residents now do not want the market to restart in the area and demand its relocation as they fear that restarting the market will lead to the spread of Covid-19. The market sees as many as 400 fruit and vegetable sellers operating there on a daily basis. Following the closure, the vegetable sellers have started occupying the entire road stretch outside the market leading to congestion in the area.A spot visit conducted by HT on Friday and Saturday revealed that the vendors, both vegetable and fruit sellers, were operating without any fear of the cantonment authorities and most of them were not wearing masks. Similarly, buyers were seen crowding the area and social distancing regulations were being violated.Shopkeeper Nilesh Kanse, who stays in the immediate vicinity of the market, said, “The rules which are applicable to Market Yard must also be applied here. Covid-19 will spread faster in the area if the market reopens as social distancing norms are not being maintained. We have petitioned the PCB seeking relocation of the market.”Parvez Qureshi, another resident of the area, said, “The market traders don’t operate by rules and regulations. There is no timing discipline and they are currently even dumping garbage in the area. We have informed the PCB administration and have asked the board administration to relocate them as they are a source of nuisance to us. Now, they are occupying roads and are not wearing masks and violating social distancing rules.”PCB vice-president Vivek Yadav, said, “The vegetable and fruit sellers have been selling their goods there since the past 40 years and due to the Covid crisis their livelihood has been affected. We will soon take a decision of either relocating them or restarting the market as they have been suffering huge financial losses over the past six months. A decision will be taken with due consultation of MLA Sunil Kamble and the board administration.”Someshwar Kale, a fruit seller, said, “We have been given legal rights by the board to operate at the Khadda market since the past four decades. Now, they are indulging in politics and our right to livelihood is being denied. We want the market to open so that we can feed our families. Currently with no income, we are starving and have no option but to occupy the roadside. Some vested interests, including area residents, are filing false complaints about violation of social distancing and not wearing masks. The area comes under CCTV surveillance and nobody is violating the rules. We are being targeted by the vested interests who want to start a parking lot in the area. Our union is planning to consider legal option to fight for our rights.”PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar, said, “We have received petitions from both the sides. Residents don’t want the market to open, but the traders want it to restart. The market was closed due to Covid-19 regulations related to health and hygiene. The decision was supposed to be reviewed after August 31, however, residents opposed the reopening on grounds of the Covid crisis. A decision will be taken keeping both the options on the table. Earlier, we had thought about relocating it to Golibar Maidan, but it is not feasible option. Currently, the entire area is functioning properly and there has been no increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the area. The matter is before the board and it will take a final call on the issue soon.” Area resident Rajshekhar Angre, said, “The Khadda market was shut down due to Covid-19 crisis and we don’t want the market to reopen as it might jeopardise our health. The PCB must look at other options. The public toilet is also currently not useable as traders are occupying the footpath there.”Though the area is near Bhavani peth, which has been a Covid-19 hotspot, currently there is no containment zone operational here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/residents-want-khadda-market-in-pune-to-be-relocated-traders-cry-foul-say-false-violations-listed/story-AZAEkv1jsQpkQhSGhyfaJN.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Structural changes at Ridge to save Shimla’s sinking heart||In a bid to save The Ridge from sinking in the heart of Shimla, the public works department is changing its structural design on the advice of experts from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. The experts have suggested better water drainage arrangements as the foundation of The Ridge may deteriorate if the problem is not rectified. A one-and-a-half metre step will be made separately along with the proposed 70-metre retaining wall for better drainage. “The Ridge has a higher elevation near the Padamdev complex, while the elevation is lower near Townhall. Therefore, a separate one-and-a-half metre step will be made for proper drainage. The final design of the step has been prepared and sent to IIT, Roorkee. Its tender will be put up after approval,” state PWD executive engineer AK Soni said. CRACKS SURFACE DUE TO LOOSE SOIL In recent years, the popular Ridge has developed cracks near Gaiety Theatre where it has been sinking. The Shimla municipal corporation (SMC) has been trying to save it from sinking further and has sought help from IIT, Roorkee. A hub of cultural activities, state and national level functions besides government events are organised at the Ridge that connects Scandal Point on Mall Road to Lakkar Bazaar, a wooden craft market. The Ridge rests upon a British-era tank used for water storage. Former SMC mayor Sanjay Chauhan says that when the British were constructing the Ridge, they dumped debris on its northern slope. The Ridge is resting on loose soil and the only solution to save it is to remove the muck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/structural-changes-at-ridge-to-save-shimla-s-sinking-heart/story-fkHhw1S5UVdS6F62jYYF3L.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana accuses Uddhav Thackeray govt of focussing on her instead of governing||Actor Kangana Ranaut continued her tirade against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, and alleged that instead of governance, they are obsessed with her. Her latest tirade was in connection with a building collapse incident at Bhiwandi near Mumbai on Monday, where at least 10 people were killed. Ranaut tweeted: “Meanwhile Maharashtra government K-K-K-K-Kangana ... if they stop being obsessed with me they will know how the entire state is collapsing.” Meanwhile Maharashtra government क-क-क-क-कंगना ..... if they stop being obsessed with me they will know how the entire state is collapsing. https://t.co/qSUBGApLLAThe Sena chose not to respond.Sena Rajya Sabha (RS) member Sanjay Raut had remarked recently that the party would listen to her but would not react. A Sena spokesperson said on condition of anonymity that CM Thackeray made it clear not to give her any importance. “She is being used by the opposition party and we are only falling into their trap by reacting to her. She is making statements that are going against her after we started ignoring her,” said the spokesperson. Ranaut drew flak a day after she called the farmers protesting against the recently introduced agriculture bills as “terrorists”. Also Read: Kangana Ranaut says Anurag Kashyap is ‘very much capable’ of sexual assault, claims ‘many big heroes’ misbehaved with herThe comment evoked sharp reactions, which prompted her to issue a clarification that her jibe was aimed at those who were spreading disinformation about the new legislations. She clarified through a tweet: “People who spread misinformation and rumours about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 that caused riots are the same people who are now spreading misinformation about farmer’s bills and causing terror in the nation. They are terrorists. You very well know what I said but simply like to spread misinformation.”Ranaut has been engaged in a running feud with the Sena. The ties have worsened after the Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities recently partially demolished her Bandra office on the ground of violation of building norms. The slugfest started when Raut in Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece, had asked Ranaut against returning to Mumbai since she had no faith in the Mumbai Police. This provoked Ranaut to compare Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) that led to all-round condemnation of her.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) recently provided Y+ security detail to Ranaut, which has further angered the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-accuses-uddhav-thackeray-govt-of-focussing-on-her-instead-of-governing/story-1lnMCfayWFwupbQ4onYWNM.html

RT-PCR test will be aggressively conducted in high-rise buildings, slum clusters and hospitals within the jurisdictions of the civic body. Around 70% of the daily tests conducted in Mumbai are being done through the RT-PCR technique. RAD test is less preferred because of its unreliability.

However, the RAD tests will be more focused. We will conduct RAD tests on civic workers, people living in containment zones and healthcare staff.”Mumbai crossed the 10-lakh mark of Covid-19 tests on Sunday. The total tally stands at 10.04 lakh and the positivity rate is 18.13%, which had risen to 23% in July. So far, the city has reported 1.82 lakh Covid-19 cases.

MNS workers boarded trains at five railway stations in a bid to defy the travel ban imposed by the Maharashtra government because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Police stopped agitators in places like Dombivli and Thane.MNS leader Avinash Jadhav and his supporters were stopped at the entrance of the Thane station and later taken to the Naupada police station. MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, who travelled by a train, said it’s high time the state government resumed the suburban rail operations for the public. Also Read: Amid Covid-19 pandemic, officials in Maharashtra adapt to new ways of governance“The local trains are the lifeline of Mumbai. The government must allow the public to travel by suburban trains. This trip was an attempt to send this message to the government,” said Deshpande. “When the buses have started operating in full capacity, it makes no sense to restrict travel by trains. People are spending hours by travelling in buses,” he added. The railways said train services were not affected due to the agitation by MNS workers.“No overcrowding has been reported at stations. Trains are running as per schedule,” said the Central railway in a statement.

On June 15, a limited number of local train services resumed for employees working in essential services.The ruling Shiv Sena said it is adopting a cautious approach to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.“We are unlocking in phases. The viral infection will spread rapidly if the suburban train services are thrown open for the public,” said Anil Parab, Maharashtra transport minister and a Sena leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mns-boards-local-trains-stages-agitation-for-reopening-of-services/story-0CANMGFvfb4elrs3jReUnO.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 mortality rate now higher than Gujarat’s||Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) for Covid-19 infections overtook Gujarat’s on Sunday. It is now in second place in the national chart after Punjab. Maharashtra’s CFR increased to 2.7%, while Gujarat stood at 2.69%, and Punjab at 2.89%.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally reached 1,208,642 on Sunday while its death toll stood at 32,671. The state is battling to bring its CFR down at par with the national rate. A month ago on August 21, Maharashtra’s CFR stood at 3.32% and Gujarat’s at 3.43%, against the national rate of 1.89%. According to officials from the health department, a high CFR in some of the districts is leading to the high cumulative figure.Also Read: Maharashtra teachers request education department for Covid-19 insurance“The CFR in Mumbai is 4.6%, followed by Solapur (3.3%), Parbhani (3.2%) and Akola (3.1%), which are the districts/cities with highest rate. However, these districts have seen an improvement in the CFR in the last few weeks, as it used to be over 5% till a few weeks ago. Maharashtra’s death rate for the month of September (until now) is around 1.94%, and we hope to bring it down further in the next few weeks,” said an official of the health department.Another official, however, said that the weaker health infrastructure in some of the districts and a lackluster approach of the machinery in tracing high- and low-risk contacts have proved to be impediments in the treatment of critical patients. The official said that the state government’s My Family My Responsibility campaign launched last week will help state authorities identify patients with comorbidities and help bring them to health facilities fast. Also Read: Amid Covid-19 pandemic, officials in Maharashtra adapt to new ways of governance“The state government has failed to address the issues of weak infrastructure over the last six months of the outbreak. We are still struggling with the shortage of oxygen, medicines, besides the failure of tracking vulnerable people. There is no proper monitoring of the people who have come into the contact with infected patients,” said Dr Avinasht Bhondwe, Maharashtra president of Indian Medical Association.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said that the high rate of testing in Maharashtra is one of the reasons the high mortality rate has come to light. “Our number of tests per million is much higher than Gujarat’s and the rest of the country. We have been maintaining transparency in every aspect. Our weekly CFR has been ranging between 1.75 and 1.94% over the last few weeks. With concentrated efforts, we will be able to bring the overall rate down,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-19-mortality-rate-now-higher-than-gujarat-s/story-25LT5ZaHB3frX54xnPH8dP.html

The victim, Balraj Deshwal, was shot in his face from a “very close range” and died on the spot. The alleged accused, Pradeep Khokar, is absconding, said Santosh Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (Dwarka), Delhi Police. “Gehlan Apartment, where the murder took place, was constructed by Deshwal and his three business partners. Khokar had purchased one of the flats and was staying in Gehlan Apartment. We have learnt that Khokar was to pay an outstanding amount of Rs 5 lakh to Deshwal. It’s not yet clear whether the murder took place because of a dispute over the payment,” said DCP Meena. The crime occurred place at around 8:30 pm, when Deshwal and one of his business partners were sitting in the parking space on the ground floor of the building. Khokar entered building while having an argument with a person over the phone, one of Deshwal’s partners told the police in his statement. “One of Deshwal’s partners told us that Khokar looked angry and was abusing the person on the phone. Soon, Khokar disconnected the call and got into an altercation with Deshwal without any provocation. During the argument, he whipped out a pistol and fired at Deshwal’s face from a very close range. Deshwal died on the spot,” said the DCP. Khokar fled the crime scene and Deshwal was rushed to an adjacent hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. A case of murder has been registered and teams have been formed to arrest Khokar. “We have learnt that Khokar got a job as a teacher in Haryana.

21-09-2020||Delhi||Northeast Delhi double murder case solved, three held||Eight days after two friends were shot dead within a distance of 600 metres and in 15 minutes of each other in north-east Delhi’s Dayalpur, the police have arrested three persons and claimed that the twin murder was a result of a personal and property dispute, officials privy to the development said on Monday. Three illegal firearms, a car and a motorcycle that were used in the murders have been seized along with 11 cartridges from the arrested persons identified as Javed alias Chickna (38), Sahabjaan (27) and Jaan Saif Ali (22).The arrested accused are residents of north-east Delhi. The arrested persons along with their associate, who is still absconding, had fired around 10 rounds at the two separate spots and killed their rivals, Farookh Pehalwan (45) and Abdul Hamid (47) in Munga Nagar and Nehru Vihar on September 12. The incident, which had occurred at night, had triggered panic among local residents. Pehalwan and Hamid had sustained four fatal gunshot injuries each. The murders had left Delhi Police baffled as around the same time another person, Sonu Rana, was shot dead near a traffic signal in outer Delhi’s Swaroop Nagar. The three men, who had killed Rana, had also fired around half a dozen rounds of bullets of which four had hit the victim. A fourth shooting and murder incident took place the following day on September 13 when three motorcycle-borne men had opened fire at a car, killing the lone man on the driver’s seat at a traffic signal near Hasanpur bus depot in east Delhi. In the twin murder case, the police said that two separate first information reports (FIRSs) were filed at the Dayalpur police station and multiple teams were constituted to probe the incident and nab the killers. During the probe, the role of Chikna and his associates emerged but all of them were absconding, said MA Rizwi, additional deputy commissioner of police (north-east), Delhi Police. On Saturday, a probe team received the information that the suspects would leave the city in a car. The registration number of the car was also shared with the police. Acting on the tip-off, a trap was laid and the three suspects – Chickna, Sahabjaan, and Ali Saif – were arrested on Sunday and the car was also seized. The three confessed to their crime and disclosed their fourth associate’s name. Though raids were conducted, the associate is yet to be arrested. During the interrogation, an investigator, who did not want to be named, said Chickna and Sahabjaan revealed that they had an enmity with Pehalwan because he was opposed to Sahabjaan’s bid to marry one of his distant relatives. Pehalwan and Hamid often humiliated Chickna and Sahabjaan over the wedding plan.“There was a near fatal attack on Chickna around a week before he and his associates killed Pehalwan and Hamid. Chickna suspected that the attack was orchestrated by the slain duo. Pehalwan’s brother Suleman had assaulted Chickna in a Delhi jail some months ago. Chickna took the revenge by killing Pehalwan and his friend Hamid,” said the officer.Chickna also had a property dispute with Hamid, he added. Pehalwan was a fruit and vegetable vendor at Okhla Mandi, while Hamid was into property business. Hamid was shot dead in his office in Nehru Vihar. Pehalwan was at his friend’s factory in Munga Nagar when he was killed, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/northeast-delhi-double-murder-case-solved-three-held/story-qxabbItXLQV7Uj0sTSBvxM.html

Stating this while interacting with mediapersons in Shimla on Monday, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said Modi will tentatively come to Manali on October 3 for inaugurating the tunnel and will also visit Lahaul-Spiti. He said that a decision on a public rally on the occasion is yet to be taken. State technical education minister Ram Lal Markanda said that Modi may address the public after the inaugurating the tunnel at Sissu or Keylong in Lahaul. He said that the Prime Minister would flag off a bus through the tunnel. “The government will honour elderly residents of Lahaul by making them the first passengers to cross this tunnel by bus,” he said. Markanda said that the tunnel will open new opportunities by giving a fillip to tourism and the economy of the tribal district. OVERCOMING CHALLENGES The Rohtang tunnel has been named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had announced the project on June 3, 2000. The work to build it was entrusted to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The project faced several geological challenges that pushed the deadline since digging started in 2011. The project was to be completed in February 2015, but water ingress from Seri Nullah, ban on rock mining and the delay in land allotment for quarrying, and loose rock strata in the middle, delayed progress. The 9.2-km tunnel is the world’s longest above an altitude of 3,000 metres. It will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and bring down travel time by 4.5 hours that will help expedite movement of troops to the border areas in Ladakh. It is a 10.5-metre wide single tube bi-lane tunnel with a fire proof emergency escape tunnel built into the main tunnel itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm-likely-to-open-atal-tunnel-at-himachal-s-rohtang-pass-on-october-3/story-LUuQpV3zN1OfuxY18UwVeN.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi House panel sends summons to top Facebook executive||The Delhi legislative assembly’s peace and harmony committee has sent a fresh notice asking Facebook India vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan to present himself for a deposition before the panel on September 23, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson and legislator Raghav Chadha said on Sunday.The committee, which is headed by Chadha, had on Tuesday issued a warning to Facebook India after Mohan failed to appear before the panel for its third hearing, despite having been summoned.“As a matter of law and Constitution, it is imperative for those who are sent notices/summons by the Committee, must appear before the committee and offer responses and solutions and raise all questions including those relating to the remit of the committee,” said the latest notice sent on Friday, a copy of which HT has seen.Facebook representatives did not respond to a request for comment.The committee had earlier said Facebook was in contempt of the Delhi assembly, and gave the social media company a “final warning” to heed the summons and appear before it, dismissing a letter sent by executives of the firm, declining to present themselves before the panel.In a letter, Facebook’s director (trust and safety) Vikram Langer told the peace and harmony committee of the Delhi assembly on Tuesday that the company’s India head, Ajit Mohan, could not appear before the panel because it was already deposing before a parliamentary standing committee, and contended that the firm‘s content regulation was outside the jurisdiction of the state assembly.On the latest notice sent to Mohan and Langer, the committee said, “It is inconsistent with law of privileges of a legislature, which extends to the committee and its members, to refuse to appear and send a letter, questioning the jurisdiction of not just the committee but of the Assembly of the NCT {national capital territory} of Delhi itself.” “Any defiance of the subsequent notice for appearance shall be deemed to be an act of breach of constitutionally guaranteed privileges of the committee,” Chadha said on Sunday, “The indifference exhibited by the representative of Facebook India is also a contempt to the people of Delhi who have reposed their faith in the committee to examine the current issue.”The first notice was issued to Mohan after the committee’s second hearing on September 12, in connection with complaints about the social media company’s alleged “deliberate and intentional inaction to contain hateful content” in the country.The notice was issued after the committee, in its second hearing on August 31, said prima facie it had found that Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead and over 400 injured.The committee is investigating the matter after it took cognisance of “several complaints” received from the public based on an article published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.“Overriding jurisdiction of the Central Government was cited as reasons for objecting to the notice for appearance which, to the committee, seemed like a sly attempt to evade responsibility and conceal facts… The frivolous technical grounds cited by the Facebook smacks of premeditated attempt to non- cooperation and ill- assistance with the proceedings in the committee. Reasons cited were demonstrably unsustainable and erroneous in nature. The committee is well within its jurisdiction to call and examine the Facebook officials before it,” said Chadha.He added: “The fallacious contentions raised in the reply to notice by Facebook, falls foul of the basic federal structure envisaged in the constitution but in the interest of natural justice, the committee has now decided to afford one last opportunity to Mr. Ajit Mohan to appear before the committee on September 23. Facebook must honour the proceedings taking place under the Delhi’s state legislature in the same manner as they did for the parliamentary standing committee. The committee has issued fresh set of notices to Mr. Ajit Mohan to ensure his presence for deposing before the committee* The report titled, Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics, had stated that the company’s officials, especially Ankhi Das, the public policy director for India, south and central Asia, allegedly cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate-speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).A bid to invoke hate-speech rules were allegedly glossed over despite concerns being flagged internally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-house-panel-sends-summons-to-top-facebook-executive/story-QPdRljekD9rIs8ZoywRdwL.html

Not only men, young women are also coming in large numbers to attend the protests organised by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugarahan) in the hometowns of chief minister Amarinder Singh and his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal at Patiala and Badal village. Moreover, the youngsters are helping the farmer organisations to run their social media accounts for live updates. “This is for the first time that the youth is actively participating and thronging to the protest sites. Of the gathering, almost 50% is youth, which is a positive sign for the movement against the draconian ordinances,” said Joginder Singh, state president of the union. Not only those from the farming background, those from teaching field, unemployed men and women besides students and research scholars are also coming in large numbers, he added. Parminder Singh (24) of Gharacho village in Sangrur district, who handles social media accounts of the union, said technology is a crucial role in getting huge response from youngsters. “We have around 49,000 followers on the union’s social media page. We can’t sit at our homes accepting this injustice with the farming community which is fighting for its survival,” he said.Ajaydeep Singh (29) said when thousands of farmers, many of them in their 50s and 60s, are sitting at the dharna sites despite the coronavirus threat, how could they sit in the comforts of their homes. People from various fields extend support People from all walks of life have extended their support to farmers against the agriculture ordinances. From Punjabi artists to economists, social activists to the members of the civil society have pressed upon the Centre government to roll back these ordinances. Balwinder Singh Tiwana, former economics professor at Punjabi University, Patiala, said these ordinances and bills are opening the way for entry of big corporate houses in agriculture, and they will ultimately capture the land and agricultural market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-fight-against-ordinances-youth-dominates-farmer-protests-in-punjab/story-X3AKfpnQNoEO6rPKfsNxyJ.html
21-09-2020||City||Mohali MC replaces ‘perfect’ footpath slabs, railings for ₹6 crore||The residents of Mohali are up in arms against the municipal corporation (MC) for replacing “perfect” footpath stones and railings with new ones in Phases 5 and 7 at a cost of ₹6 crore.Despite no recommendations from any expert or any policy in place, residents allege that since 2018, the Mohali MC has spent ₹50 crore on laying interlocking paver blocks in the entire city.In the last two years (2018 and 2019), MC has approved 624 development works, of which 281 pertained to laying of paver blocks alone. Surprisingly, 30% of paver blocks were replaced even when the old ones were in good condition. In 2019, though ₹10 crore were allocated for the laying work, the MC spent ₹25 crore on it.NS Kalsi, chairman of the Phase 4 RWA, has written a letter to the MC commissioner calling it was a wastage of public money, as stones and railings already in place were perfect and didn’t need replacing. “If the civic body does not stop misusing funds, we will be forced to move the Punjab and Haryana high court,” he said.MS Aujla, former director of town planning, local government, Punjab, who is a resident of Mohali, said, “The reckless laying of concrete blocks on roads is not environment-friendly. Certain portions of road berms (of a uniform width all along the road for a better street picture) must be kept and maintained concrete-free for greenery as per environmental norms.”MC has no policy on laying of blocksAround two decades ago, it was decided that paver blocks will be laid only in markets, but presently, these are used on pavements and even in parks. This, despite the fact that the MC has not formed any policy on laying of blocks in over a decade.Interlocking concrete blocks do not let water percolate, thereby hitting groundwater recharge, besides completely covering up the green space. As such, the blocks are laid as per the whims and fancies of the councillors, who seem to be in a race to get them installed in their wards.Former Congress councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said, “Civic body is replacing footpath stones on the demand of the market welfare and residents welfare associations and councillors. For paver blocks, there should be some concrete policy, he said.When contacted, MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said some of the works are undertaken after they are approved in the MC House. We only allot work when we get demands from associations or councillors, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-mc-replaces-perfect-footpath-slabs-railings-for-6-crore/story-CVb9SKCFyhgbSzU2YZ0U6O.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Neighbours of arrested Chinese woman say she was ‘very aloof’||The residents welfare association of Ganga Apartment, part of a large gated society in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, is planning to approach the police to get verified all tenants who have already vacated flats, following the arrest of a Chinese woman resident in an alleged case of espionage. NS Mor, the RWA president, said, “Henceforth we are also planning to propose that a member of the RWA be witness during the tenant verification process when someone shifts to our society.”“We had never doubted the Chinese woman during her stay here, but her arrest has come as a shock for all residents of the society,” Mor said. Delhi Police’s special cell has arrested Qing Shi, the Chinese woman, along with a Nepalese man, Sher Singh, and an Indian journalist — all of whom have been booked under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly spying for China. Mor said some Chinese students had lived in the society previously, but as of September, Qing was the only Chinese person living there. Residents of Ganga Apartment said Qing and Singh were always “aloof”. Rajeev Kumar Mishra, a security guard in the society, said he saw the news of their arrest on television. He said, “The chequered orange top she wore in the image was one she frequently wore while leaving for work every morning.”“They never interacted with anyone. Whenever I went to collect the monthly maintenance charges from their flat, the Nepalese man would open the door only slightly and give the cash without saying much,” Mishra said.The security guard said that earlier this year, the duo had disposed of a rickshaw full of some electronic items such as transistors and speakers. “It came across as unusual, but I didn’t ask them anything,” Mishra said. Sandeep, who owns a general store below the duo’s second-floor flat, said his interaction with the suspects was limited to Singh shouting for drinking water from his balcony. “He would just say ‘paani’ and I would send a delivery boy. I always thought they didn’t know any Indian languages,” he said. A neighbour who didn’t want to be identified said the duo was “very very aloof”. “They were aloof to such an extent that her roof leaked for days on end about a month ago, but she didn’t raise the issue. Only when she heard me speaking about the same problem in my flat did she ask to keep her updated about any possible solutions,” the neighbour said. “I always worried that the Chinese woman could get cornered by people due to the ongoing hostilities between India and China, but no one could have guessed that she could be working against our country,” said the neighbour. Businessmen at the busy Mahipalpur market, where the duo had taken up an office, which police said they used to run an alleged “shell company” to receive funds from their handlers in China, had similar reactions to their arrests. The company, MZ Pharmacy, was running out of the first floor of a three-storey commercial building. The pharmacy office is located above a cellphone store, adjacent to which is another pharmacy, which receives customers frequently. The insides of the MZ Pharmacy office looked dark through the large glass windows in the front. Some bare wooden furniture was visible near the windows even as the shutters to the staircase leading to the office was found locked. “I would see the Chinese woman and a man visit the office every morning around 9-10 am. I wondered if they were husband-wife or business partners,” said Narender, a staff member at the other pharmacy. “The two would come together every morning and leave in the evening. The board outside their office said it was a pharmacy but they never had any customers. In fact, I don’t remember anyone else visiting that office in the last six months that I have been working here,” said Narender, who just gave his first name.The only visible sign that the floor served as an office is a 15x3 feet green board that read MZ Pharmacy in English.Qing, Singh and journalist Rajeev Sharma were arrested between September 14 and 19 after the special cell received inputs from a central intelligence agency about their involvement in the alleged espionage.Sharma’s wife, who is a teacher, remained unavailable for a comment despite HT reaching out to her through phone calls and text messages. Sharma is accused of passing on “classified and sensitive” information to the Chinese. His lawyer, senior advocate Adishi Aggarwala, has denied the allegations and quoted Sharma’s wife as saying that no “classified and sensitive” documents have been recovered from his home, contrary to the police version.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/neighbours-of-arrested-chinese-woman-say-she-was-very-aloof/story-cDgjXdCPsjLVq6qyFtfAyL.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh grain market traders to go on strike on September 22||The market welfare association of the Sector 26 Grain Market has given a call to hold a strike on Tuesday against high parking fees being levied on the traders amid losses in business due to the pandemic.President of the association Ram Karan Gupta said, “There is no provision for monthly passes anymore. For parking commercial vehicles, contractors charge upto ₹250 per day which we cannot pay. Moreover, as a part of their contract they can increase the parking fee yearly for the next four years.”General secretary of the association Mohit Sood added that due to excessive barricading by police outside the market and because of Covid, their business was badly hit. “We had sent a memorandum to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, but nothing has been done.” He added that all traders of the Grain Market will be on strike on Tuesday and if their demands were not met, they will organise more strikes.Chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal Charanjiv Singh said that he had spoken to the association and the CBM would be supporting the traders on their strike on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-grain-market-traders-to-go-on-strike-on-september-22/story-Qu2Wq8gSIIjrpDv5yKKfSL.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi: 71 butterfly species spotted||Participants spotted 71 species of butterflies in the fourth edition of Delhi’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).Sohail Madan, centre manager of BNHS at the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, said the survey was done to collate all recorded sightings of butterflies in Delhi-NCR and to create a platform to share and learn about different species of butterflies. Among biodiversity parks covered this year, 30 butterfly species were spotted in Yamuna Biodiversity Park, 22 were seen in Tilpath Valley Biodiversity Park, 33 in Kamala Nehru Ridge, and 12 in South Delhi Biodiversity Park.Apart from these, 41 species were spotted in Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park and 56 in the Aravalli Biodiversity Park.Around 115 butterfly species are native to the National Capital Region.“The sightings of butterflies is the first sign that the environment is improving. While many people share their sightings through pictures on social media but that doesn’t reach out to as many people. However, through a common medium all sightings can be recorded and can be later used by others,” said Madan.This year, volunteers also spotted the Indian grizzled skipper butterfly for the first time in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park.Experts said many species, during the Covid-19 lockdown, were seen to have reacquired geographical areas where they had become extinct.M Shah Hussain of Aravalli Biodiversity Park said, “Butterflies are a very important component of nature and their presence in any area in large numbers is an indicator of environment’s quality. The first action-based initiative for the conservation of butterflies was started in biodiversity parks, and to showcase butterflies to nature lovers, conservatories in natural settings were established in biodiversity parks”.Faiyaz A Khudsar of Yamuna Biodiversity Park said, “Butterfly sightings are proof of the efficient functioning of biodiversity. It shows that we have been able to successfully create an environment where such species can thrive.”Last year, the survey spotted 66 new species of butterflies, including some rare ones such as Brown Awl, Dingy Swift and Common Red Flash. The list also included common species such as Plain Tiger, Common Grass Yellow, Mottled Emigrant and Common Emigrant.In 2018, the volunteers spotted 69 butterfly species, and 75 in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-71-butterfly-species-spotted/story-UFdcrmBWDIUfnpD2EpgzOL.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The iron man of Sector 49||He is the ironing man, and generally addressed by his profession rather than by his name. “Many people call me press wale bhayya,” says Dharmendra Diwakar. His profession is not taking good care of him these days. “I would daily iron about 300 pieces of clothing before the (coronavirus-triggered) lockdown, but now.... yesterday for instance, I ironed 35.”In his early 30s, Mr Diwakar is chatting on WhatsApp video from his workplace—which consists of two tables and two irons, on the ground floor of a housing society tower in Gurugram’s Sector 49. The society has a multitude of multi-storey towers, and Mr Diwakar’s customers are spread among two of such towers. The other ironing men are similarly spread in other towers.Mr Diwakar’s business has plummeted because most of his customers rarely step out of their house these days, so they don’t feel the need to get their dresses ironed, he explains. “Another reason is that people are scared that they might get coronavirus from me.” With barely any earnings, Mr Diwakar’s debt to the local grocer is piling up. He’s also finding it tough to pay for the school fee of his three daughters—a helpful “didi” in the other tower, however, purchased a new smartphone for his kids so that they do not miss their online classes (occasionally longtime clients give him emergency cash).It was in this context that last night, at his one-room home in Bhondsi village, nearby, Mr Diwakar sat down with his wife, Roshni, for a brainstorming session on how to manage in the coming months. The couple eventually devised a “plan B”—Mr Diwakar would offer to his regular customers his services as a car washer.“This morning I rang many of the houses, and before anybody could say that there are no clothes to be ironed I asked them if they would let me wash their cars daily.”Mr Diwakar has already got two car washing assignments. Staring into the phone screen, he says, “I cannot break my spirit under any circumstances.”Later in the night, on reaching home, he poses with the entire family for a photo shoot. Everyone’s smiling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-iron-man-of-sector-49/story-MTauXUa4hQ84yzzIpZ6iuO.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Modi tweets in Punjabi, says agri legislations in farmers’ interest||In the wake of protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana against three agriculture-related ordinances, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday assured the farmers -- through tweets in Punjabi -- that the proposed laws were historic and in their interest.“Main pelan vee keha si, tey ek vaar fer kehnda haan: MSP di vivastha jari rehe gi. Asi ethey kisana di sewa layi haan. Asi kisana di madad layi harr sambhav yatan karange tey ohna dian aaun valiyaa pirriyaan layi behtar jiwan sunishchit krange”. (I have said this before and I say this once again: the system of MSP will continue. We are here to serve the farmers. We will make all possible efforts to help the farmers and ensure better life for their coming generations),” Modi said in one of the series of tweets in Punjabi, hours after the passage of two of the three contentious agricultural legislations by the Rajya Sabha.The tweets come at a time when BJP’s alliance partner in the NDA, the Shiromani Akali Dal, has taken a strident stand against the legislations. Its MP and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Modi cabinet after the bills were cleared by the Lok Sabha. The Akali Dal has also appealed to the President not to give his nod to the legislationsEarlier, dubbing the passage of the farm legislations as a “watershed moment”, the Prime Minister said: “For decades our farmers were stuck in several obstacles and they had to deal with the middlemen. With passing of the (farm) bills in the Parliament farmers will get freedom from this. With this the efforts to double farmers’ income will get strength and their prosperity could be ensured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modi-tweets-in-punjabi-says-agri-legislations-in-farmers-interest/story-sbUFn2sRi0HC7BuROPfMGM.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s AQI hits 148 as pollution begins to rise||After a month in which Delhi saw its cleanest air in five years, air pollution has seen an uptick in the national capital over the past few weeks. With monsoon drawing to a close and little possibility of more rainfall this month, the air quality may deteriorate further by the end of this month, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Unlike August, when the air quality was in the ‘good’ category for four days, and ‘satisfactory’ for the remaining 27, the air this month has mostly remained in the ‘moderate’ category.August was the cleanest month on record since 2015, from when air quality index (AQI) records in the city have been maintained.An AQI reading of 0-50 is considered ‘good’ (minimal health risk), 51-100 is ‘satisfactory’ (minor discomfort to sensitive people), 100-200 is ‘moderate’ (breathing discomfort to people with lungs and heart disease).Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that the AQI this month slipped to ‘moderate’ category on September 5, with a value of 101. It improved to ‘satisfactory’ for a few days before again falling into ‘moderate’ on September 9, a zone it has remained in so far.On Sunday, Delhi’s overall AQI was 148, in the ‘moderate’ zone, as per the CPCB’s 4pm bulletin, up from 118 the previous day.“The spell of clean air days may almost be over now, as meteorological conditions are changing. The monsoon is set to withdraw by September-end, after which calm winds blow across the northwestern region that are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre “Pollutants suspended in the air that were till last month being washed away by the rain and winds are likely to persist, in the absence of any such weather activity,” he added.He added that while August received the most rainfall in at least 10 years, September, which usually sees good showers every year, has not received adequate rainfall this year and will not be able to cover the deficit for this month. “The monsoon trough this month has remained mostly in the hilly regions. Only three days of light rain were recorded this month — on September 5,6 and 8. There is a system forming in the Bay of Bengal, which is likely to induce light rain or thundershowers on September 22-23, but even that will not be able to cover the deficit for this month,” Srivastava said.The Safdarjung observatory, which is representative of Delhi’s weather, has a rain deficit of 78% so far this month.Another IMD scientist, who did not wish to be named, said industrial and vehicular pollution was almost zero during the lockdown months. Then in July and August, even with curbs being eased in phases, good and continuous spells of rain kept the air quality in check. “Now, from the end of the month, the weather will slowly transition to calmer winds and a decrease in temperature neither of which are favourable for pollutants to disperse. Besides, it is also the time when stubble burning in neighbouring states begins, which adds to the pollution load,” the IMD scientist told Hindustan Times.The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) is scheduled to meet the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) next week to discuss an action plan to curb pollution in the major ‘hot spots’ across the city.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai had, last week, asked all agencies to submit a winter action plan by September 21. The Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), put in place to deal with various levels of pollution, is enforced in Delhi and the National Capital Region from mid-October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-aqi-hits-148-as-pollution-begins-to-rise/story-WmtqmqblrqFX0H5X6GoRhI.html

He added that due to the spread of the coronavirus, the drive will cover only high-risk areas, migratory population, brick kilns, construction sites and urban slum areas.Sharing details about teams engaged in the drive, the minister said, “The target is to give polio shots to around 6,80,800 children across the state for which a total of 8,436 places have been identified. A total of 5,530 door-to-door teams have been pressed into service, with 656 mobile teams. The total number of vaccinators, ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife) and Asha workers is 14,749, 3,097, 11,965, respectively, whereas a total of 1,031 supervisors will carry out surprise checks to monitor the drive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-day-polio-vaccination-drive-launched-in-mohali-s-high-risk-areas/story-s4C1Evw4ML01pW6OXn4YxH.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||‘Will resign from Khattar govt if MSP discontinued’||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Sunday said he will resign from the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government if any attempt to discontinue procurement of farmers produce under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system surfaces. In his first official reaction to the current controversy surrounding the Centre’s three farm legislations and fears of farmers that the objective of the central law was to dismantle the MSP at later stage, the deputy CM said there is not a single line regarding eliminating MSP in three farm Bills. He said the crops of the farmers would be procured on the MSP and the farmers would have the right to sell their crop in the market openly in case they received price higher than the MSP. In a statement, he made it clear that farmers would have the right of MSP and urged the farmers to not get misled. Accusing former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of trying to misguide the farmers for furthering his own political interests, Dushyant Chautala said not only did Hooda himself advocate open market for farmers but also signed on such recommendations of a committee set up by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during regime of UPA as its head. “Why the former CM is adopting double standards on this and what is the reason behind misleading the farmers,” he asked. “The Congress party supported contract farming in its vision document during its first tenure of UPA and now Congress is opposing the Bills for political gains whereas they will open new avenues of progress for the agriculturists.” The deputy CM said that in coming paddy and maize procurement season each grain would be procured on MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-resign-from-khattar-govt-if-msp-discontinued/story-gSAMMJfMSXDqEuVDfqT5uJ.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers’ highway siege hassles commuters in Haryana||Thousands of farmers on foot, two-wheelers, tractors and in cars poured out of the hinterlands and staged sit-ins at various state and national highways in Haryana on Sunday, blocking the traffic for about three hours to express their anger against the Centre’s three agriculture Bills. The sit-in began at 12 noon as farmers started parking their vehicles in the middle of the highways. The police and civil administration, already under direction to deal with the agitating farmers with “tact and patience”, didn’t stop the protesters from reaching the dharna sites. Over three-hours later and after having aired their anger and demonstrating unity, the farmers lifted the road blockades. The agitation ended on a peaceful note with police exercising restraint and farmers also refraining from provoking the law enforcement agencies. But the protest caused huge inconvenience to the commuters even as the police personnel, who had been on their toes since Saturday evening, diverted the traffic to alternative roads. The farmers went ahead with the protest even after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar invited them for talks on Saturday and urged them to call off the stir. As the farmers were not relenting, the Home department had issued directions to deputy commissioners and district police chiefs to ensure that the agitation stays peaceful. Sunday’s protest was held 10 days after police lathicharged agitating farmers at Pipli in Kurukshetra. Following the incident, farmers staged sit-in protests in every district until Saturday. The undercurrent of the police action was visible as thousands of farmers, especially in Northern and central Haryana, came out in support of stir spearheaded by Bhartiya Kisan Union led by Gurnam Singh Charuni. “The protests were peaceful and over 17 farmers’ unions participated. The next course of action will be decided later,” Haryana BKU chief Charuni said, urging farmers to also support the nationwide stir on September 25. “The protests remained peaceful. Traffic was restored after the farmers lifted the blockade around 3pm,” said Kurukshetra SP Astha Modi. BKU received a huge support from farmers in Kurukshetra as farmers held sit-ins at five locations and almost all the state and national highways. Backed by commission agents, farmers blocked most of the roads in Rohtak, Jind, Sonepat, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad, and Hisar. The farmers also blocked highways such as Ambala-Roorkee, Ambala-Panchkula, Jind-Delhi, Ambala-Kaithal, Karnal-Ladwa-Shahbad, Karnal-Assandh and Kurukshetra-Pehowa road, Rohtak-Panipat, Rohtak-Hisar, Jind- Delhi, Jind-Kaithal, Jind-Patiala, Dadri-Jhajjar, Sirsa-Fatehabad. The farmers, however, did not block the Delhi-Chandigarh national highway. Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha’s state chief Phool Singh Sheokand said the farmers’ unions will hold protests on September 25 also. SUPPORT FROM POLITICAL QUARTERSApart from the Congress and Indian National Lok Dal, the MLAs of Jannayak Janta Party, the coalition partner of the BJP in Haryana, also reached at the protests sites and extended support to the farmers. JJP’s Shahbad MLA Ram Karan Kala met the protesting farmers while another JJP MLA Jogi Ram Sihag (Barwala segment) joined the agitating farmers. Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, after visiting dharna sites in Rohtak, Meham and Charkhi Dadri, said: “If these bills aren’t withdrawn I will launch hunger strike from October 2.”Meanwhile, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Kumari Selja, in a statement issued on Sunday, said, “September 20 will go down as a black day in the history of India. The BJP government has hit the very soul of the nation by hatching a conspiracy against the farmers in the form of three farm- related Bills. At the root of these Bills is a move to snatch the farmers’ right to sell produce under the MSP. These Bills will ruin the farmers and benefit some capitalists.” Terming the new agriculture laws as ‘black laws’, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in a tweet said, the government is adopting a dictatorial attitude. “The farmers are not happy with this so they are protesting on the streets. The Congress will also stage a sit-in against the black laws,” he said. INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala said, “It is condemnable to go against the farmers of the entire country and pass the anti-farmer bill in Parliament today. This law is a death warrant for farmers. The Central Government, intoxicated by power, forgot that farmers are the backbone of the country.Responding to the opposition attack, Haryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister JP Dalal said, “Some politicians have become used to indulging in petty politics in the name of the farmers. It would have been better had they read the Bills in detail before issuing statements. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the Rajya Sabha reiterated that the crop procurement will continue at the MSP like before.” (inputs from Neeraj Mohan and Sunil Rahar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-highway-siege-hassles-commuters-in-haryana/story-Mggq6lGCj5R6nukLiACM5K.html

21-09-2020||Chandigarh||3 years on, Haryana’s youth world champions still await cash awards||Three years after they made the country proud at the Youth World Championship held in Guwahati in November, 2017, four Haryana boxers are still awaiting the cash incentives promised by the state government.The boxers-- Nitu (48kg), Sakshi (54kg), Jyoti Gulia (51kg) and Shashi Chopra (57kg), had all won gold medals at the championship and are entitled to a cash award of ₹10 lakh as per the Haryana government’s sports policy.Nitu and Sakshi, both hailing from Dhanana village in Bhiwani, went on to win gold medals in 2018 too when the championship was held in Budapest, Hungary. Four other girls from the state had also made it to the podium that year. While Anamika (51kg, Rohtak) and Manisha (64kg, Kaithal) won silver medals, Neha Yadav (+81kg, Kaithal) and Jony Phogat (60kg, Rohtak) won bronze medals.The six of them had also won gold in the national championship held prior to the world meet. For the gold in two world championships and one national event, Sakshi is entitled to get a cash award of ₹22 lakh, while Neetu, who had an additional gold medal in the 2018 Asian Youth Championship, has to get a cash award of ₹24.5 lakh from the Haryana government. Jyoti, who hails from Rohtak’s Rurki village, has to get ₹12 lakh each for her gold medal in the 2017 youth world championship and 2017 national meet while Shashi Chopra (Hisar) has to get ₹10 lakh for her performance in world meet.But none of them have got any incentive from the state government so far. “Since 2017, we haven’t got any cash award for our achievements at the national and international competitions. In the first week of August, we (Sakshi and Neetu) got a message from the office of the district sports officer (DSO), Bhiwani, that the award money has been sanctioned and they will get it transferred to our respective bank accounts. It’s been more than a month since then but we have not received anything,” says 20-year-old Sakshi, whose father is a farmer. “In 2015, when I won gold in the junior world championship, I got a cash award of ₹20 lakh. Now, as per the new sports policy, the cash award for sub-junior, junior and youth categories has been reduced to half and three-fourth. But we have not even got the slashed cash award,” adds Sakshi, who is now part of the senior women team.“I am from a humble farming background, and yet to get a job. So cash awards are very important for players like me. With this (incentive), we can contribute to our family and also take care of our training whenever we are not at national camps,” says Jyoti, 19. When contacted, Bhiwani DSO Satvinder Gill, said, “We have forwarded the case of Nitu and Sakshi to the head office in Chandigarh and from there, it has gone to the finance department (FD) for the release of the money. Once it is cleared from the FD, we will get the money and immediately transfer it to the players’ accounts. We will follow-up with the head office regarding this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-years-on-haryana-s-youth-world-champions-still-await-cash-awards/story-oyWWN4drEflTF5hClmNrvO.html
21-09-2020||Chandigarh||PUTA elections 2020: Sans gatherings, department visits, campaign a low-key affair||With the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) elections being conducted amid the pandemic this year, the campaigning for the polls has also changed.Instead of gatherings and visiting departments, the two rival groups contesting the elections are preferring the use of online platforms to reach out to the teaching community of the varsity.The election of the office bearers of PU’s teaching body is scheduled to be held on September 25 and 26. The Mritunjay-Naura group, which is backed by the syndicate’s Goyal group, is contesting against the rival Khalid-Sidhu group.Contrary to the previous years, most of the teachers are taking classes from home, so visits to the teaching departments for campaigning won’t be happening this time. Door-to-door campaigns on campus are also on a decline.From the Khalid-Sidhu group, Mohammed Khalid, who is contesting for the post of president against Mritunjay Kumar, said, “Keeping the prevailing situation in mind, we have appealed to the contestants of our group to use digital platforms and electronic media like emails and WhatsApp to reach out to colleagues.”No gatherings are being held on campus for the purpose of campaigning this year. Physical meetings are held with only a few people at a time amid precautionary measures.Mritunjay Kumar said, “We are avoiding physical meetings as much as possible and we only meet those who allow us. We reach out to the teaching community through phone calls and social media.”As per a strategy chalked out by the returning officer for the election, voting will be carried out at two venues, English auditorium and evening auditorium. The different departments will be allotted one of the four time slots, starting from 8.30am to 11.30am up to 3.30pm to 5pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/puta-elections-2020-sans-gatherings-department-visits-campaign-a-low-key-affair/story-KxhA1ScS1xibLkNGWBBo4N.html
21-09-2020||City||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, officials in Maharashtra adapt to new ways of governance||From being accustomed to clearing a large number of files daily to solving issues on Twitter and Facebook, officials are adapting to the new ways of governance, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. HT speaks to a few government officials to understand the change. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation After taking up his role as the assistant commissioner of G-N ward in Mumbai in June 2019, Dighavkar started a campaign called the “footpath challenge” on Twitter. He asked citizens to send pictures/videos of broken or potholed footpaths – a common problem in the city – and said the municipal corporation would fix it within 24 hours. “The campaign went on for three-four months, by when we undertook repairs at almost 169 locations,” Dighavkar recalled. As a ward official, he also created WhatsApp groups, including representatives from different citizen organisations. His jurisdiction includes the central areas of Dadar, Mahim, Prabhadevi and even India’s largest slum – Dharavi. “There is a separate group for each suburb - Dadar, Mahim, Dharavi – where residents post complaints about illegal construction or garbage issues. We try to address these as soon as possible,” he said. In the limelight for his ‘Dharavi model’ to control Covid, which was also hailed by the World Health Organization (WHO), Dighavkar also used Twitter to create awareness on social distancing, the current trends in the ward and steps being taken by the municipal corporation to deal with the pandemic. Until recently, Dighavkar also shared information with citizens on facilities being created by the corporation for Ganesh visarjan. Dighavkar said during the lockdown, he received pictures from citizens of crowding on Twitter, which the ward would address. He said one needs to be careful about the information being put out, as it can be “interpreted wrongly.” Ask him if social media has changed his governance style and Dighavkar says, “I will not say that social media has changed our style of governance. I would say that it is yet another forum for complaint redressal.” Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment and climate change, Maharashtra government A senior bureaucrat of the Maharashtra government, when Manisha Mhaiskar was deputed to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as part of the Covid-19 task force in April 2020, coronavirus was still “unknown” and BMC was also facing a lot of flak from citizens. Mhaiskar then began a series of posts on Facebook, which she called “Coronavirus Task Force” (CTF) or the “glass half full” narrative. She used the medium to spread awareness about Covid-19, when it was still emerging, the work being done by BMC, the general dos and don’ts and even risk assessment charts. “The risk assessment chart was widely shared by people. It analysed various daily activities based on risk of exposure and advised people to follow the risk assessment chart in their new normal daily life,” said Mhaiskar. She added the posts were also a way to document the kind of work being done by BMC in tough times. In her role as a principal secretary of the environment department, Mhaiskar is contemplating thinking of connecting to people via social media and encouraging them to undertake a pledge to save the environment. “Even if you take a small pledge, of using only cloth bags from now on, you are helping save the environment,” she said. Ask her about using social media for governance and she says, “The same question was asked when computers were introduced. Any new invention is just another tool. It depends on how one uses it,” she said. Suman Chandra, district collector, Buldhana As the district collector of Buldhana, in the Amravati division of the state, Suman Chandra started an initiative called e-lokshahi, a dedicated helpline number through which people could register their complaints, or just WhatsApp it. “Once we receive such complaints, they are sent to the departments concerned. Not all problems are addressed via this medium, but administrators at least get a feel of what is bothering people and try to resolve them,” said Chandra. The administrator is also active on Twitter and her account is open to general complaints, many of which she looks at solving real-time. “It (Twitter) helps me build a great rapport with my district citizenry,” she told HT via WhatsApp. Ask her about this style of governance and Chandra says, “Leveraging technology to address public grievance is a great way to bridge the gap, especially during Covid-19.” Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner, BMC A senior bureaucrat of the Maharashtra government, Ashwini Bhide has a huge following on Twitter (55.7K). Bhide, as the additional municipal commissioner at Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, has been sharing Covid data on Twitter and also addressing various queries by citizens. In her previous role as the managing director of Metro-3, a fully-underground Metro corridor in Mumbai, Bhide was constantly hailed for the valuable updates she would post about the progress of the project. Bhide did not wish to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-19-pandemic-officials-in-maharashtra-adapt-to-new-ways-of-governance/story-2BSW3swTD1l78BT7kNsRPL.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Modi government’s bills on farm sector: Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi parties yet to decide its stand; Left outfits to protest against Centre’s move||Even as the Maharashtra unit of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) has planned a protest on September 25 against the three agriculture sector bills passed by the Centre in the Parliament, the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is yet to decide their stand on the issue. The three parties have not discussed any plan so far to stage any agitation together to oppose the ordinances.The three central ordinances, which would bring far-reaching impacts in the sector, led to large-scale protests by farmer groups in Punjab and Haryana. AIKS general secretary Ajit Nawale announced that the organisation will hold protest across Maharashtra. He added that the protest has the support of 208 other farmer bodies.The passing of the ordinances in the Parliament yet again revealed the lack of coordination between the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – the ruling partners in Maharashtra. While the Congress opposed the three ordinances, NCP did not support or oppose the bills openly but demanded that the Centre build consensus on the issue across the country. The Shiv Sena committed a flip flop as its Lok Sabha member Arvind Sawant “welcomed” the ordinance in the lower house but Rajya Sabha parliamentarian Sanjay Raut, took a critical view of the bill. The change in stance came after Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar spoke on Saturday evening. Speaking to HT, Raut said, “Sharad Pawar is a tall leader in India and was the country’s agriculture minister for 10 years. They [the Centre] should have involved him [in discussions]. These bills, according to him [Pawar] are in favour of the farmers. However, there are some points that need discussion. There is no point in opposing without any reason. The Shiv Sena and NCP have a neutral stand on these bills.”“[All India] Kisan Sabha’s protest is fine, but most of Maharashtra’s farmer bodies have welcomed the reforms,” Raut added when asked on the protests by the Left-affiliated farmers’ body.Raut also dismissed speculations over the lack of coordination within the MVA. He said that the change in Sena’s stance on the ordinance came after former Union minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the cabinet in protest of the bills.State NCP spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said that the central government is “anti-farmer” as it wants a few corporate houses to control the agriculture sector through the ordinances.“MSP guarantees minimum remuneration for farmers’ produce. Once it is abolished, farmers can be exploited easily. This will further result in the elimination of APMC markets in due course of time because these markets will start losing business. After a point of time, it will become financially unviable to run them,” Malik said. Minimum Support Prices (MSP) is a guarantee for the farmers to get minimum remuneration for their produce, which has been struck down in the new laws.“The Centre’s plan is to eliminate the farmers’ network. It is also like giving licence for illegal hoarding to a few big players, who will control the market as well as its prices. The prices of commodities will be inflated as per their whims and fancies. In a way, it is not only harmful for the farmers but also for the consumers as they will also be looted,” he added.Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the party will decide its stand soon. Congress chief ministers Amarinder Singh (Punjab) and Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) are opposed to the provisions of the bill which was passed in the Rajya Sabha by a voice vote amid protests by Opposition parties on Sunday. With two sets of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) legislations that delinked the sale of vegetables and fruits only in mandis (markets) and recently opened up the sale of all agricultural goods, Maharashtra is unlikely to be impacted by the central ordinance. The state government has already amended laws to allow farmers to sell directly without going to APMC. The bulk buyers can also directly procure the products from farmers. However, the scale of procurement by such buyers is much less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/modi-government-s-bills-on-farm-sector-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-parties-yet-to-decide-its-stand-left-outfits-to-protest-against-centre-s-move/story-ay81vfEnr8h6KvfnZd7i6H.html
21-09-2020||Lucknow||A re-energised SP to begin its battle from the streets||Having reactivated and revamped most of its district units and frontal organizations, the Samajwadi Party (SP) is now set to do what it does best when out of power -- taking to the streets, with an eye on the 2022 UP assembly polls. Most of the district units and frontal organisations were lying dormant since party president Akhilesh Yadav had dissolved them after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls debacle. “In the last three weeks, the party has appointed presidents, vice presidents and, in some cases, more office-bearers of the district and mahanagar units and frontal organisations. Whichever districts are left will soon get their office-bearers,” said SP MLC Sunil Singh ‘Sajan’. He said the party has had made hundreds of appointments in Yuvjan Sabha, Mulayam Singh Youth Brigade, Chatra Sabha (students wing), Mahila Sabha (women’s wing), Adhikvakta Sabha (lawyers wing) and Vyapaar Prakostha (traders wing) etc. “The party is fully reactivated and re-energised. We took to the streets earlier also during the past several months. First we have a major statewide protest -- as called by the party chief Akhilesh Yadav -- on Monday and the effect of the party’s reactivation would be visible then,” said a newly appointed district president. The Samajwadi Party has given a call to all its units -- up to the tehsil level -- to protest on September 21 against the state government over “unemployment, farmers’ issues, collapsed law and order and corruption in health services in these Covid-19 times, he said. The party has also issued instructions to the units to submit memorandums (addressed to the governor) to the district officers at tehsils and district headquarters during the protest, further said. Meanwhile, the party’s state president also has started doing video conference meetings with district units since Friday. Till now, only Akhilesh had been doing video conferencing with party leaders in districts. Akhilesh, as a customary practice, had dissolved all district and frontal organisations and state units (barring the state president’s post) after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which, despite an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the SP could win only five seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/a-re-energised-sp-to-begin-its-battle-from-the-streets/story-DfZWt74AjJhe35lw7TdPmN.html
21-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Many containment zones have same addresses||As the number of cases continue to rise in Ghaziabad, a closer look at the publically available list of containment zones reveals that the district administration has considered a case as a containment zone.For example, under Sadarpur locality, there are two containment zone, and both have the same address. In Kavi Nagar, there were 11 containment zones with the same address in K block. The numbers suggest that of the total containment zones declared in the district, many of them may represent a single household.Containment zones are created on the recommendation from the health department. Thereafter, the administration officials, called as incident commanders, are tasked to supervise the sealing and timely de-sealing of the zones.According to the district administration, while there were 336 containment zones on September 1, by Saturday this had gone up to 617. Totalling the number of cases reported from these zones on Saturday, there were on an average 4.3 cases per containment zone.During the 19 days of September, an average of 413 containment zones were defined per day.According to the list of containment zones published by the Ghaziabad district administration on September 19, localities like sector-23 of Sanjay Nagar (43 containment zones), Kavi Nagar (56), Indirapuram (68), Vasundhara (49), Vaishali (95), Govindpuram (46), Raj Nagar (42), Shastri Nagar (40) and Rajendra Nagar (51) figure prominently among the localities with high containment zones.District malaria officer, GK Mishra, who defines containment zones, said that once people are tested and found positive for Covid-19, they were to be grouped into a single address and labelled a containment zone. “We are still in the process of doing that,” he said.Meanwhile, residents continue to claim that authorities were lax in securing containment zones with hardly any barricading to stop people from moving around. “The management of containment zones has been poor at the ground level even if it may appear strong on paper. It is primarily due to this the district figures in the list of top 10 districts in the state having highest number of Covid-19 cases. Further, the RWAs were also not involved. Had the civil society been actively involved, they would have made a lot of difference at ground level,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation.“In Saturday’s instance at Model Town, we had two cases of Covid-19. However, till Sunday no containment zones got defined. So, we are clueless what the officials are doing,” he added.RWAs while saying that containment zones are no longer seen added that people should take up containment activities.“The containment zones are somehow not visible at ground level. Even people seem to have got more relaxed with opening up of activities. During initial months the apartment owners’ associations were very strict about health protocols but with time they also got relaxed. One of our AOA has now shutdown certain activities in the highrise as cases have continued to come in. So, it is time that people in localities consider imposing restrictions otherwise mixing of population will invite more cases,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.To secure the containment zones, municipal commissioner MS Tanwar on September 11 had told HT that he has got prepared bundles of specially marked strips which have been sent to different police stations and police posts for securing the containment zones.“The work for securing the containment zones is to be done by the respective incident commanders (generally sub divisional magistrates of the areas) and police deploys personnel to secure them. We have deployed about 550 personnel for containment zone duties,” said Ghanshyam Singh, superintendent of police (crime) and department’s nodal officer for Covid.When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey referred the issue of containment zones to Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city).“The sealing is taken up by incident commanders. We feel that there has to be better coordination with police as regards the containment zones. The strips which the corporation has got prepared have been given to police. On Monday, it will be ensured that the containment zones under the jurisdiction of city areas will be secured,” Singh added.The medical experts however believe that contact tracing and 100% testing in containment zones will help reduce spread of infection.“Given the number of bigger localities in the city with high cases, the concept of containment zones has almost become blurred with opening of activities after lockdown. It would be a better idea to trace contacts at fast pace and get all persons in the area tested to filter out suspected cases. It is possible nowadays as people are not averse to testing with facilities like home isolation in place,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-many-containment-zones-have-same-addresses/story-TvDtzfZuq8Y8bCafNzMlUP.html
21-09-2020||City||No helmet, no entry: Noida residents spread road safety awareness||Noida: A group of residents from sectors 74 to 79 (commonly known as 7X sectors) have come forward to spread road safety awareness among the two wheeler riders in the city. They have started an initiative -- ‘no helmet, no entry’ -- which is aimed at making people understand the importance of wearing a helmet.“The idea originated from the district administration’s ‘no helmet, no fuel’ rule where riders are denied fuel at petrol pumps if they don’t wear helmets. Ours is a similar concept where we request riders coming to and going from residential areas to wear helmets for their own safety,” said Brajesh Sharma, a member of the 7X sectors welfare team that has started the initiative.The group has already carried out the drive for four weeks in which they covered several high-rises in the 7X sectors. “We took help from various apartment owners associations as well to request both the residents and visitors alike to abide by these rules. People need to understand the fact that these rules are in place only for their safety,” said Rakesh Jha, another member of the team.He said that the members had come up with the idea after several accidents were reported from the area.“We will continue the initiative for at least another month. Most of the riders without helmets we encounter with have an excuse that they just came out for a couple of minutes. But mishaps can happen anywhere at anytime and that is what has to be understood. During the drive in sectors 74-75, we also involved police personnel from a PCR van parked there who helped us in requesting the public to follow the rules,” said Sharma.The group on Sunday morning covered the market area in Sector 41 and will continue to cover other shopping complexes and residential areas in the city.When asked about the initiative, Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said, “Change comes from within. We always encourage civil society’s participation and efforts. Such efforts are appreciated and they help in bringing out necessary change. We can enforce law, but that will only help to a certain extent. Last month 20,000 challans were issued for not wearing helmets only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-helmet-no-entry-noida-residents-spread-road-safety-awareness/story-sP4MeJAQJYqleubFDTROiJ.html
21-09-2020||City||Coastal road work in Mumbai: No nod to move corals for now||The mangrove cell of the Maharashtra forest department has temporarily stalled clearances for translocation of corals for the coastal road project until the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) clarifies certain details. On September 3, BMC had applied for wildlife clearance and submitted a proposal to move 18 coral colonies across Worli and Haji Ali for further reclamation of the project. Corals are protected marine species sporadically spread across rocky intertidal regions along the Mumbai coast. They garner the same protection as a tiger or elephant under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972, and permissions are needed from the principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF-wildlife) before translocation of the species. Through a letter issued by the Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit (MMCU) under the state mangrove cell on Thursday, officials have raised multiple queries that BMC needs to respond to.“We have been told that BMC plans to reclaim the two coral patches by October 17-18. However, approval cannot be granted until we have more clarity on certain issues,” said DR Patil, divisional forest officer, MMCU. “Maps submitted with the proposal by the contractor are not attested by any official authority. Details regarding the project justification, copies of environment and coastal regulation zone clearances and legal status of the project before various courts have not been submitted so far. These documents need to be examined by the senior most officers of the forest department, and should not be taken casually.”According to BMC’s proposal, the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, had identified two species of corals from the Rhizangiidae family (Oulangia and one unidentified species) with 18 colonies documented across 0.251 sqm (almost 3-ft) in Worli region of the project site, and another species (Dendrophylliidae family) along with Rhizangiidae across 1.1-ft area at Haji Ali. The translocation is to be undertaken by NIO scientists, BMC said.Patil added that so far all details had been submitted by BMC’s contractor and he was receiving repeated calls from BMC on the status of their proposal. “We have asked BMC to appoint an engineer who can help us with the verification of details on-field and on paper rather than the contractor. It would take us at least 10 days to complete formalities at MMCU level, and then the proposal would be vetted by the additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell), and finally the PCCF (Wildlife) in Nagpur. Based on the current status, clearance may not be met by the required time frame (October 17-18),” said Patil. Niranjan Khanolkar, chief engineer (coastal road), BMC said, “We will fulfil all requirements and clarify queries as soon as possible.”Meanwhile, environmentalists opposing the project plan to challenge BMC’s proposal before the Supreme Court. “BMC should not have been allowed to start work on this project without obtaining requisite clearances,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust, adding that under the WLPA, Schedule I species can be destroyed only in case they pose a threat to human life. For example, a confirmed problem animal involved in conflict (tiger or leopard) with humans, requires prior approval from the PCCF (Wildlife) before capture. “There is no provision in the WLPA to permit the destruction of a Schedule I species for facilitating a project that should have been designed to avoid the destruction of corals,” said Goenka.Meanwhile, BMC has said they are yet to allocate ₹2.9 crore budgetary plan for marine biodiversity conservation and monitoring (MBMP) for the coastal road project as directed by NIO, which in its September 2019 report found the presence of six coral species along the south Mumbai coast, presence of dolphins, 17 bird species, and rich benthic marine life. A senior BMC official said it was the responsibility of the contractors to allocate the required funds. BMC has reclaimed over 53 hectares of the sea along south Mumbai for the 9.9-km coastal road, which is to be an eight-lane highway connecting Princess Street Flyover to the southern tip of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coastal-road-work-in-mumbai-no-nod-to-move-corals-for-now/story-6zcBOB1DztUiPlCP2T6dnM.html
21-09-2020||Noida||Four development projects to be ready by month-end in Noida||The Noida authority on Sunday said it will complete work on four projects, worth nearly ₹220 crore, by the end of this month.These projects include an underground car parking in Film City Sector 16A (being developed at a ₹110 crore budget), another underground car parking in Sector 3 (₹62 crore), Shaheed Bhagat Singh Park in Sector 150 (₹ 23 crore) and Biodiversity Park in Sector 91 (₹25 crore).Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, work on these four projects was disrupted and these could not be opened for the public earlier, but, now, the authority officials said, they have expedited work on these projects so these are opened for the public use without any delay.“We are giving finishing touches to these four projects so that these can be completed by September end, and be open for public use at the earliest,” said Rajiv Tyagi general manager, Noida authority.The 1400-car capacity, three-storey car parking project, proposed on an area of 19,202 square metres in Film City, was started in July, 2015 with a December, 2016 target. But the project missed several deadlines. The coronavirus triggered lockdown further disrupted the work. Officials said that it will be opened for use by September end. Similarly, work on the car-parking facility at Sector 3’s F block started in January 2016, and supposed to be ready by July 2017. The project will now be ready by September end and will have a 450-car capacity, said officials.The authority had in January, 2016 conceived the idea of developing a park in the memory of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. But work at the site in Sector 150, which is home to newly built group housing towers, started only in April, 2018. According to the Noida authority officials, it has planted 2,000 trees, 75,000 shrubs at the park, so far.Spread over 75-acre green area along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, the Biodiversity Park in Sector 91 once ready would be the city’s largest park. The authority has planted as many as 4,322 traditional trees including neem, jamun, banyan and mango besides 19,625 ornamental trees.Both these parks are expected be open to the public by the month-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-development-projects-to-be-ready-by-month-end-in-noida/story-HZrPW84NVgPxSyAzx8s5WI.html

21-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad: NHAI to install surveillance cameras on Eastern Peripheral, Delhi-Meerut e-ways||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started securing the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) and the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) with the installation of high-resolution cameras. These will help in incident detection, check speeding and general surveillance, said officials. The 135-km EPE inaugurated in 2018 connects Kundli to Palwal, both in Haryana, while passing through Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts in Uttar Pradesh. The 60-km DME connects Akshardham in Delhi to Meerut in western UP. “About 133 such cameras will be installed on the EPE by March next year, each one kilometre apart and alternatively one either side of the expressway. They will be able to rotate and view upto 500 metres on either side.,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. The live feed will be routed to a control room, still under construction, at Dasna interchange. Eighty sub-control rooms along the EPE will be responsible for the general maintenance of the cameras and serve as a backup too.The speed limit on the EPE are 120kmph for cars/jeep and 100kmph for commercial vehicles. According to records, there were about 271 accidents on the EPE since May, 2018 to August this year. Last week, HT reported that the NHAI had begun installing barriers and boards to check trespasses into the EPE by people living in the vicinity. “The cameras will detect all such instances. At the main control room, our staff will be monitoring movement of vehicles and instances of speeding. When the cameras detect a speeding case, the control room will be alerted, the vehicle identified and information shared with the local traffic police. Likewise, in case of an accident, help will be rushed to the spot. A similar setup is underway at the DME where three sub-control rooms will be connected to the main control room at Dasna,” Garg said. The 14-lane DME project, having six dedicated expressway lanes, is divided into four phases with 8.4-km phase 1 (Akshardham in Delhi to UP-Gate) and 22.3-km phase 3 (Dasna to Hapur) already operational and is expected to have 78 cameras. While phase 1 has 13 cameras installed, phase 20 have phase 3. Once completed, 19.3-km phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) will have 15 cameras and 31.8-km phase 4 (Dasna to Meerut) will have 30 cameras. Both phases are scheduled to be completed by December this year and are expected to have the cameras installed by then too.The installation protocols and camera specifications will be similar to the ones at the EPE. Of the three sub control rooms, one at the CWG flyover near Akshardham and another at Chijarsi (at the Pilkhuwa flyover in Hapur) are already operational. The NHAI last week proposed to the Union ministry for road transport and highways the speed limit for the DME be increased to 120kmph for cars/jeeps and 100kmph for commercial vehicles.

21-09-2020||Noida||UPSEE 2020: 71% attend exam for admission to BTech, MBA programmes||At 71.46%, the Uttar Pradesh State Entrance Exam (UPSEE, 2020) saw its lowest turnout in four years on Sunday. Officials attributed the fall in attendance partly to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Over 115,000 had applied to sit for the exam, organised by the APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (APKJAKTU) for B.Tech and MBA seats in its 756 affiliated institutes across the state. The number of applicants this year too was the lowest in four years.In 2019, the turnout was 89.5% (of around 150,000 applicants); in 2018 it was 86% (156,000 applicants); in 2017 92% (156,000 applicants).Commenting on the drop in applicants and turnout, APJAKTU pro vice-chancellor professor Vineet Kansal said it appears some students did not take the exam due to fears of catching the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. “However, it is also possible that some students may have scored well in the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) mains and may be hoping to secure their admissions using that score. Besides, some students might have taken admission in other private colleges/universities as UPSEE has been delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.APJAKTU had set up 206 exam centres – 187 in UP and 19 in other cities, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Patna, Mumbai, Bhopal and Jaipur. Gautam Budh Nagar had six centres – one in Noida and five in Greater Noida – where a total of 3,000 students appeared. The varsity does not have separate data on Noida colleges.The JSS Academy of Technical Education in Sector 62 was the only exam centre in Noida, while Greater Noida had five exam centres – IIMT College, Accurate Institute of Management and Technology, GL Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, and Dronacharya Group of Institutions.Professor Vineet Kansal, Pro Vice Chancellor of APJAKTU and its UPSEE 2020 coordinator, said the exam was held in three shifts – 9am to 11 am, 12 to 3 pm and 3.45 to 6.45pm. The B Tech exam started from 12 while MBA and MCA papers were administered at 3:45pm. In the morning shift, papers like BPharma, Bachelor of Fine Arts, etc. were held.He said the process went smoothly. “The university had issued a WhatsApp bot number and connected all nodal officers of exam centres. The officers shared all information about the examination process on the WhatsApp group in real time. No incidents of cheating or using unfair means in the papers cropped up. We had set up isolation wards (at the centres) but no candidate was found to have high temperature or fever,” Kansal said.It should be noted here that while 89.50% of the registered students appeared in last year’s UPSEE exam(1.50 lakh out of 1.66 lakh), 2018 saw 86% of the registered candidates (1.56 lakh out of 1.75 lakh) show up, while 2017 saw 92% of the registered students (1.56 lakh out of 1.69 lakh) take the exam.Rajeev Agarwal, director GL Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management, and nodal officer for the examination centres at JSS Academy and IIMT College, said all protocols for the Covid-19 pandemic were followed. “Candidates were required to carry their UPSEE hall ticket and valid photo ID proof. They were also required to wear face masks. They were allowed to enter only after their temperature was found to be normal. A maximum of 24 candidates were allowed per examination hall,” he said, adding that the candidates’ mobile phones and electronic gadgets were deposited outside the exam hall to ensure fair means.Neha Kumari, a candidate, said she was satisfied with the preparations made by APJAKTU. “The officials ensured social distancing inside and outside the exam centre. I hope to make a good score,” she said.UPSEE 2020, earlier scheduled on August 2, was postponed to September 20. Kansal said the results will be declared by October 20, and the counselling will start after October 25.The exam is a gateway to various technical and professional courses like BTech, MBA, MCA, BArch, BPharma and MTech, among others, in educational institutes across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/upsee-2020-71-attend-exam-for-admission-to-btech-mba-programmes/story-VoPLckjEXGSqOy6p00NhZI.html
21-09-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar suffers fourth Covid death of the month||Gautam Budh Nagar recorded its fourth Covid-19 death of the month on Sunday, taking the total to 49, according to the Uttar Pradesh government daily health bulletin.With 3,398 Covid-19 positive cases in September so far, highest of any month, the district administration believes it still has things under control and that the trajectory is on expected lines. Officials said they will continue increasing surveillance and testing. The overall count of Covid-19 cases in GB Nagar district is now 11,342, of which 9,615 have recovered. The district at present has 1,678 active cases. District magistrate Suhas LY said: “It was anticipated that once the economy began to unlock, there will be a surge in Covid-19 cases. Staying indoors is not an option anymore in order to bring the economy back on track. What is more important that the people must be cautious, practice all guidelines and take precautions, to reduce the transmission of this deadly virus.”The DM further said that the caseload rise is mainly due to strict contact-tracing, increased testing, low specificity in rapid antigen tests and a possible reverse migration of workers returning from their homes to the city. “Our focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing maximum patients. For that, we have adapted ‘tracking, testing and treating’ methodology, in which our health officials are ensuring maximum contact tracing, testing nearly 4,000 people every day and treat the infected patients as per their symptoms,” said Suhas. District chief medical officer Dr. Deepak Ohri asked people not to drop health protocols even as the economy inevitably opened up. “It is not a fight only for doctors or health officials against this virus. Everybody needs to be well-equipped,” he said. “Some people are arranging social functions and not wearing masks, which could prove detrimental in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-suffers-fourth-covid-death-of-the-month/story-DzZVdQnIz8OCSApQTFsu2L.html

The police have already arrested three suspects for allegedly stabbing Bhati to death over some personal dispute. The man arrested on Sunday was identified as Khussan, a resident of Mewatiyan mohallah in Dadri, the police said, adding that a countrymade gun and three live cartridges have been seized from his possession. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that the police had arrested three suspects -- Jamshed, Shoeb and Wasim -- on September 9. “Primary investigation showed that the victim and suspects had personal enmity. Bhati had slapped Wasim a day before the incident took place. The suspects made a plan and attacked the victim to take revenge,” he said. Pandey said that the police investigation found that the fourth suspect, Khussan, was also involved in the murder. Khussan, who was arrested from Kathera road in Dadri, had informed the three suspects about Bhati’s movement resulting in the murder, the police said. According to the police, Khussan is a seasoned criminal wanted in nine cases, including rioting, criminal conspiracy, Gangster Act, etc. The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody, the police said. Bhati’s father Fateh Singh had filed a complaint at Dadri police station against three suspects -- Jamshed, Shoeb and Wasim. In his complaint, Singh said that Bhati had gone to buy some medicines from a local store when the three suspects reached the spot and attacked him with a sharp knife. “My son raised an alarm and some local people reached there for rescue. We also reached the spot and saw the suspects fleeing the spot waiving the knife,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-one-more-arrested-in-sher-singh-bhati-s-murder-case/story-o3l42NcYu0UyxpYhRJ37ZN.html
21-09-2020||City||UP defers partial opening of schools till further notice, say officials||Officials of the Ghaziabad district administration on Sunday said the state government has deferred the partial reopening of schools planned for Monday, that would have allowed students from class 9 to 12 to voluntarily come to school for seeking academic guidance, till further notice.Keeping in line with the guidelines issued by the Central government for “unlock 4”, the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari on August 30 had issued directions allowing students from class 9 and above to come to school from September 21. However, the officials on Sunday said, they have received directions from the state administration schools will not be allowed to open on Monday and will permitted to open partially on a later date (which is yet to be notified).Officials from the district administration, who did not wish to identified, that reopening of the schools was probably deferred in view of the rising cases of Covid-19. As per the state health control room data, the total Covid-19 case tally in the state had reached 354,275 on Sunday.“As per the earlier guidelines, schools would open partially from September 21. But we have received directions from the state government that another date will be issued,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate(DM) , Ghaziabad.In the meantime, the DM said, the administration will focus on preparing for opening schools in the district. “ We have asked the education department officials to utilise this time to spread awareness among parents; take written consent from parents if they wish to send children to schools, and engage with schools on setting up virus-free premises,” the DM said.The DM nominated the district inspector of schools (DIOS) and also the basic education officer to start the preparatory works. The DIOS has been asked issue a helpline number on Monday where parents can seek information about opening of schools.“The respective sub-divisional magistrates have also been asked to ensure compliance of the new directions. The local bodies such as municipal corporation and others will help schools with guidelines related to cleanliness and sanitization,” Pandey added.Similar arrangements are also being taken up in the neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district.“So far, we have not received information from any school that they will be holding academic counselling sessions for students between classes 9 and 12. Also, parents are also reluctant to send children to schools due to the pandemic,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.The parents’ bodies also said they are not inclined to send children to schools for such sessions.“Parents are not eager to send their children to schools. We are not aware if any schools want the students to come for classes and at this point, we will oppose such requests. Parents know that it will be difficult to prevent the children from getting exposed to the virus outside, and no one wants to take any kind of risks,” said Yatendra Kasana, president, All Noida schools’ parents association.Parents are not willing to send children to schools in view of the pandemic. We held various meetings with many parents and they were not willing to send children to schools. It is our request to the state government not to allow opening of schools till the number of cases reduce considerably or a vaccine becomes available,” said Vivek Tyagi, spokesperson , Ghaziabad Parents’ association.Office bearers of Independent Schools’ Federation of India said they will wait for further instruction from the state government on opening schools. “We will not open schools for counselling sessions till we get another date and we get directions from the UP government,” said Subhash Jain, president of the federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-defers-partial-opening-of-schools-till-further-notice-say-officials/story-0WvBGTHVkjvNlCM1sKJzEI.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram gets 495 additional Covid beds; 50% of ICU beds in use||Following directions from the district administration, an additional 10 percent of hospital beds in the district have been reserved for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The fresh directions from the administration have added 495 hospital beds to the 1,740 that were already reserved (across 42 hospitals and healthcare centres in Gurugram), taking the total tally of Covid beds to 2,235. The upgrade also adds 61 beds to the district’s ICU bed capacity — including 23 that will have ventilator support.Of the 2,235 beds allocated for Covid treatment, 1,975 are general beds with oxygen facility (up from 1,541 beds earlier). As of September 20, data showed, that at least 540 of the 1,541 beds (or 27 percent) were occupied. Meanwhile, occupancy of available ICU beds stands at exactly 50 percent, with 130 beds (of total 260) currently in use. The total number of ICU beds include 102 ventilator beds, of which 60 are currently in use. The number of patients on ventilator support has increased by 39.5 percent over the past two weeks, data suggested.Despite a steady increase in the number of active cases over the past fortnight, occupancy rates of beds have not changed much. General bed occupation has increased by only two percent, while ICU bed occupation has, conversely, reduced by 10 percent since September 8 (despite a 62 percent increase in active cases during the same time).“This is because most of the active patients are actually young, asymptomatic and don’t require hospitalisation,” said Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, pointing out that over 50 percent of Gurugram’s active cases comprise people between the ages of 20 to 40. “They are pulling through with home isolation, allowing us enough capacity to absorb an increase in hospitalisation rate in coming weeks,” said Dr Prakash.In view of a rising number of Covid infections, district authorities had taken stock of bed availability on September 7, following which an order was issued by the deputy commissioner, Amit Khatri, on September 14, under the Epidemic Disease Act and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The order (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times) stipulates that 35 percent of all available beds in public and private facilities in the district are to be reserved for Covid-19 patients. “It was earlier 25 percent. The additional beds allocated after last week’s order are all from private hospitals as Civil Hospital does not have the capacity to allocate more beds,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-gets-495-additional-covid-beds-50-of-icu-beds-in-use/story-UvEbgdSfJd0xnO8ZwLQGYO.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Haryana BJP, government assure farmers that MSP will not go||The Haryana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assured farmers of the state that their interests would not be harmed with the passing of three agriculture bills in Parliament on Sunday. This, they said, included continuation of purchasing produce at the minimum support price (MSP).The statement comes at a time when the party has been putting all efforts, including an appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to allay fears that farmers will lose out with the passage of the bills, now awaiting the President’s assent. Farmers in Haryana and Punjab have been at the forefront of protests against the new legislations, which includes allowing farmers to sell outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committees, deregulation of farm foods and contract farming.The state party chief OP Dhankar, also a prominent farmer leader, said that the new system would prove beneficial to farmers. Farmers will now be able to sell produce directly to the market without relying on middlemen and also find markets across the country thereby helping them get better price for their product, he said.Dhankar was addressing a hurriedly called press conference at the PWD Guest House in Gurugram. “The Haryana government will procure each and every grain of paddy in the coming procurement season and this will prove the lies being peddled by the opposition,” he said, adding that the state would empower farmers to engage in peri-urban agriculture and directly satisfy the needs of urban markets. “The opposition particularly Congress is trying to create a false perception but the fact is that these same reforms were promised by it in its manifesto. The farmers will realise that they have got a great opportunity and they should take advantage of market instead of letting middlemen make all the money,” said Dhankar. To safeguard the interest of farmers, he said, the period of contract has been limited to five years and this will ensure that farmers’ land won’t be taken over by the contractor. “Assets created by a contractor will go to the farmer if it is not removed within stipulated time.” Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, who was also in Gurugram said that the new laws will improve the lot of farmers significantly.Earlier in the day, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala from the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), a coalition partner of the BJP, said that he would resign if any attempt to discontinue MSP system emerged. Dushyant also said that the Congress supported contract farming in its vision document during its time in the Centre, and that it was now opposing it for political gains. The Congress rejected the allegation. “The government should make it clear in writing that the MSP system would not be eliminated. It should have been mentioned in the Bills. Also, the contract farming bills takes away the right of farmers to approach the civil courts for justice, which is grossly unfair,” said Captain (retd) Ajay Singh Yadav, senior Congress and leader and former minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-bjp-government-assure-farmers-that-msp-will-not-go/story-27PWltDkvvzjY7FZNCIgpJ.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Police deployment intensified in Sadar Bazar||Following the armed robbery on Saturday, the Gurugram Police has increased the deployment of personnel in the Sadar Bazar area, where most of the jewellery shops in the city are located. The police said although the number of robbery cases have come down in recent times, they wanted to further curb them. As per police officials, while earlier as many as six cases were reported in a week, nowadays only four cases are registered in a month. The police also checked the CCTV cameras in the area, and found that nearly 160 cameras were operational. The CCTV footage gave them crucial leads that helped them to identify the accused.The members of the Gurugram Jewellers’ Association said they will meet the commissioner of police on Monday to ask for greater police vigilance and to ensure that the safety of the shopkeepers are taken care of. Members of the association said that although cops are regularly patrolling the area, they wanted the presence of police personnel in plainclothes to do rounds of the area and keep a close watch on suspected miscreants. Bhoop Singh, a 71-year-old jeweller, said their work involved precious metal that put them at a high risk. “We need police protection as suspects take advantage of the crowd in the area to flee the spot,” he said. Another shopkeeper, said that hiring a single armed security guard costs around ₹35,000 a month that increases the overhead costs. “We deal in jewellery and cash. Most of the time, we carry cash on our way home. We feel unsafe as the police presence in the area is very thin. While, for the past two days, deployment has increased, we need a permanent solution,” he said. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that dedicated teams have been formed, which have been directed to keep a close watch on the jewellery shops in the area. He also said that police personnel would also be deployed even at night when shops are closed. “We have increased the number of police personnel deployed in Sadar Bazar. Further, the station house officer(SHO) of the local police station has been asked to send a report every night after the market closes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-deployment-intensified-in-sadar-bazar/story-04K2IqgClBVpbkKyQAi7FK.html
21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram murder-suicide: Police recover note, probe property dispute angle||The police has recovered a note from the pocket of a man, who shot his father dead on Saturday afternoon and later died by suicide. Police said that they have found a note from victim, Ravinder Dahiya’s pocket, who along with his 62-year-old father were found lying in a pool of blood in a room of a paying guest accommodation in Laxman Vihar in Sector 9. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Dahiya had written six lines in the note alleging his wife and in-laws for harassing him for the last 10 years ever since his marriage. He held them responsible for him taking the extreme step. “We have booked the wife and in-laws for abetment of suicide under section 306 of Indian Penal Code and are investigating the matter,” he said. On Saturday afternoon a 32-year-old lawyer had shot his 62-year-old father before turning the gun on himself in Sector 9 A . Police suspect that the incident could have been a fallout of a property dispute, which is being probed. Police said Rajveer Dahiya, who had retired from the Delhi Police, and his son Ravinder Dahiya, had constructed two houses in the area, with the one in Laxman Vihar turned into a paying guest (PG) facility in 2016. Sangwan said Rajveer used to stay at the PG facility and manage it too and Ravinder helped him. The duo had employed a woman from a nearby eatery to cook meals twice a day and make tea between 3pm and 4pm for those staying there. “She claims that when she went to the PG at around 3pm, she found the bodies lying in a pool of blood,” said Sangwan. The dead person’s family were soon informed who called the police, he added. Ravinder allegedly pumped two bullets into his father before shooting himself, said police. Manjeet Dahiya, Ravinder’s younger brother, told police that Ravinder was upset over property and marital issues. “The in-laws always pressurised my brother and threatened him to lodge a criminal case against him and send him behind bars,” he said. A case under IPC section 302 (murder) was registered against deceased Ravinder, and sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) against his in-laws at Sector 9 police station on Saturday late evening, but no one has been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-murder-suicide-police-recover-note-probe-property-dispute-angle/story-uzZ4vt4UyOuXaxWFO5OqfP.html
21-09-2020||City||Gurugram records over 5,600 cases in just three weeks of September; mortality rate continues to dip||Gurugram: In just three weeks of September, Gurugram recorded 5,686 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), exceeding August’s total reported caseload of 2,952, the district health department data shows. In June, there were 4,716 cases, the highest monthly aggregate so far, which health department officials regard as the period of Gurugram’s first peak in infections. On Sunday, the district reported 405 new cases. Health department officials and experts have reiterated caution against non-essential public movement and emphasised on the importance of maintaining hand hygiene.As per the health department’s data, Gurugram saw a 25% increase in the number of active Covid-19 cases over the past week, during which it also registered an average of 369 new positive cases each day (up from 275 new cases each day the week prior). Gurugram currently has 2,793 active patients, up from 2,232 a week ago, on September 13.The district’s test-positivity rate (TPR) over the past week remained consistently above the World Health Organisation’s recommended benchmark, ranging between 10 and 13%. The WHO recommends achieving a daily TPR of 5% before easing restrictions on public mobility. This is up slightly from a positivity rate of between 9 and 11% observed the week prior.Even with the increase in cases, though, mortality rate has continued to drop, resting at 0.9%, down from 0.97% a week ago. Despite having accumulated over 5,000 new cases so far this month, the district has seen only 18 deaths in the three weeks of September. In June, which saw the highest new cases in a month so far, the number of Covid deaths was much higher, at 94. The district recorded one new death due to Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the total toll to 160. A week ago, the death toll stood at 147.“This is a result of different factors. For one, fewer active cases in a younger age bracket have symptoms, and are less prone to worsening of symptoms. Second is that home isolation is working well for such patients. The cases we are seeing are also milder in nature, but why that is, will require further inquiry,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the health department’s district surveillance officer for Gurugram.The district’s total tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 17,828, up from 15,249 a week ago. This is equal to an average of 2,579 new cases in seven days, the highest weekly aggregate since the outbreak began in March. The daily growth rate in new positives, as of September 13, was 2.3%, and has remained above 2% for at least three weeks now. This is also reflected in the sharp contraction of Gurugram’s doubling rate, which stands at 44 days as of September 13. For comparison, in the last week of August, the doubling rate was around 81 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-records-over-5-600-cases-in-just-three-weeks-of-september-mortality-rate-continues-to-dip/story-E9RWpnSzkTF91SPbMZnXaK.html

21-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Govt schools open for academic guidance visits from today, pvt ones to stay shut for now||Gurugram schools are all set to open partially for voluntary academic guidance visits of students in classes 9 to 12 from Monday. While most private schools were planning to call students on a voluntary basis for practical sessions, they later decided against doing so immediately as the number of cases began surging in the district again. Government schools, on the other hand, are expecting a good number of students to turn up for these visits, with teachers supposing that the lack of smartphones being an important factor that will prompt students to visit schools. As part of the Unlock 4 guidelines, students of classes 9 to 12 were permitted to visit schools in areas outside containment zones for academic guidance, with the written consent of parents, starting from Monday. As per the SOP for a partial reopening of schools for these visits, teachers need to produce a negative Covid test report and have Arogya Setu app installed on phones. Schools have been asked to arrange these sessions in a staggered manner. Students living in areas outside containment zones will only be allowed for these sessions in slots. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said that school teachers got tested for Covid in various PHCs on Sunday and they’d be allowed to report to work for classes only if they get a negative Covid report. “In line with directions from the department, all teachers are getting tested for Covid-19. Some teachers couldn’t get the tests done today and will be doing it tomorrow. Only those teachers who get a negative test will be asked to take sessions for students who need to get their doubts clarified,” said Miglani. Based on the feedback received from parents, Miglani said that not many students were expected to turn up. “Parents are worried about lessons but safety continues to be of utmost importance for many of them,” said Miglani. She said that the school had asked teachers to allocate slots to different students. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that while most teachers in her school had been tested for Covid, a team of doctors would be visiting the school on Monday for further tests. “We expect around 70% of students to come for these classes. Many of them come from backgrounds where there they do not have access to smartphones. Physical visits will greatly benefit such students,” said Sharma. Parents of students in government schools said that they’d consider sending their children to schools for occasional visits in the coming days. Sangeeta, whose son is a class 10 student of Government Senior Secondary School, Manesar, said that she’d consider sending her son for these sessions if he felt the need for assistance. While she expressed concerns about safety due to the rising cases in the city, she admitted that sharing a single phone within the household was leading to disruptions in lessons. “We are worried about sending our son to school, since cases have only been increasing in the city. At the same time, my son is in a senior class and might need assistance that we can’t provide at home. We might send him to school in the next few days depending on the situation,” she said. Many private schools said that they’d wait for the situation to stabilise before calling students. Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the school had no immediate plans of calling students. “Our school will be busy with examinations this month. For now, we have not taken any call on school visits for children,” said Erry. Dhriti Malhotra, school principal, Manav Rachna International School, Sector 46, said that the school was yet to take a decision regarding academic visits since it was already engaged as one of the centres for the CBSE compartment exams for Classes 10 and 12 that start from Monday. “We will be conducting the compartment exams first. Once the exams get over, we will be able to take a decision on if students can be called back on a voluntary basis. If at all we call students, it will be in very small batches for practical sessions,” said Malhotra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-govt-schools-open-for-academic-guidance-visits-from-today-pvt-ones-to-stay-shut-for-now/story-qB9kaTMEUBu3tk9ZMRpTJJ.html

A yellow alert has been issued for Monday with a forecast for heavy rain at isolated areas or thunderstorms accompanied by lightning with gusty winds.“Active monsoon conditions and enhanced rain activity is expected up to September 22 due to the development of a low-pressure area over northeast Bay of Bengal, which will strengthen surface level winds, and its convergence along the west coast,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.Though a yellow alert had been predicted for Sunday, no rain was recorded between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Over the past 24 hours — between 8.30am Saturday and 8.30am Sunday — the Santacruz weather observatory recorded 12.4mm rainfall while Colaba received 2.8mm rain. “While light to moderate rain was recorded over 24 hours ending Sunday across Mumbai and Thane, northern suburbs of Mira-Bhayandar received heavy rain. Heavy rain is expected along north and south Konkan and isolated areas of interior Maharashtra on Monday and Tuesday,” said Hosalikar.The drop in rain activity led to a rise in temperatures on Sunday as Santacruz recorded the maximum temperature at 32.4 degree Celsius, 1.7 degrees above normal, while Colaba recorded the day temperature close to the normal mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/very-heavy-rain-warning-for-tuesday-in-mumbai-thane-imd-upgrades-alert-to-orange/story-kCRLnyRLyIMcX3BCgjouFM.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Double whammy: After Internet access, school books elude poor students||Six months into the current academic session, many economically disadvantaged parents in the national capital have complained that their wards have not been provided with the promised free textbooks and stationery by private schools, in violation of caveats of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has summoned as many 45 private schools after receiving several such complaints within the last one week.The delay in the distribution of books has added to the woes of students from Economically Weaker Section (EWS) families, who are already struggling to access virtual education at a time when schools have been shut in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The 42-year-old mother of a Class 8 student in Victor Public School in north-east Delhi’s Maujpur said that she and her husband have been out of work since March due to the Covid-enforced lockdown. “Both of us were working in a garment manufacturing factory. We lost our jobs during the lockdown in March. We are still looking for employment. Our daughter could not attend online classes between April and June because even though we have a smartphone at home, we could not afford the Internet package. Now my sister has started recharging my phone with a monthly Internet package, just to help my daughter. But she is having a hard time without books,” the mother, who wished not to be named, said.The mother, who is a resident of Vijay Park said that she has been visiting the school since April for the textbooks. “The school turns me away every time and asks me to contact them later. I would have bought her the books if I was not out of work,” she said.School in-charge Shrawan Kumar said the delay took place due to the prevailing situation. “The school is also going through a financial crisis, since only 10-15% of the parents have paid the fees for this academic session. We are trying to get books and distribute them among students as soon as possible,” he said.Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25% of the seats in entry-level classes — nursery, KG and Class 1 are reserved for EWS students. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.Ranjana Prasad, a member of DCPCR, said that the commission has been receiving similar complaints against private schools on a daily basis since April. “We have summoned around 45 private schools within the last one week. A majority of them have agreed to provide textbooks to students at the earliest. The schools cannot deny providing books to the EWS students,” she said.The father of a Class 6 student enrolled in Cambridge Foundation School in Rajouri Garden, under the EWS category, said that his child has not received books from the school yet. The father, a resident of Tilak Nagar, who was working as a driver in a private firm before losing his job in March, said his son could not appear in recently concluded half-yearly exams due to the unavailability of textbooks.“He has started taking online classes now after a gap of almost four months using a second-hand smartphone. But he still doesn’t have books, and that’s why he is having a hard time understanding anything. We have been contacting the class teacher, but there is no response. He had missed last term exams as well due to the unavailability of a device. And now that I have managed to get a second-hand smartphone for him, he does not have books to prepare for another exam,” he said, requesting anonymity.School principal Anita Puri did not respond to calls,texts and emails sent by HT for a comment.Deepak Singh, an autorickshaw driver and father of a Class 7 student at a private school in south Delhi, said, “The school has given us textbooks only for Hindi and English. We are still waiting for more books and stationery.”Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working for EWS children in Delhi, said, “We have received hundreds of complaints from parents in this regard. We have forwarded the complaints to the education department as well. A majority of these students are either not attending virtual classes or have very little access to them. At least they should have books to study at home.”A senior official in Delhi government’s education department said that they have also been receiving such complaints from EWS parents. “The DoE is looking into the complaints. We have already sent communications to several schools following which they have distributed books among students,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/double-whammy-after-internet-access-school-books-elude-ews-students/story-VUNdcJ5fNz2ZMCcZMFq6nJ.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Convict on parole hangs himself at police station hours after being arrested for raping a minor girl||Out on parole after being convicted in a case of robbery and murder and another of rape, a 40-year-old man allegedly raped a 14-year-old girl in an outer Delhi locality on Saturday and died allegedly by suicide hours later while in police custody at a station on Sunday.Senior police officers said the man hanged himself in a lockup at the Samaypur Badli station, and that the guard deployed outside the cell had been suspended.However, the man’s relatives alleged that they saw the police beat him up in the police station on Saturday night, and questioned how he was able to kill himself despite being in police custody.The man hailed from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh, and lived in Delhi’s outskirts for over two decades.“In 2005, he was arrested for a robbery and murder case registered in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas. He was convicted in the case, but not before he raped a 10-year-old boy in outer Delhi in 2012. He was convicted in the latter case as well,” said Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north).He was released on parole on February 2 this year.His parole was extended due to the pandemic, and he was due to return to jail on October 17, his lawyer Rakesh Kaushik said.But on Saturday, the man allegedly raped a 14-year-old girl in her home in outer-north Delhi. “The girl’s mother, a labour worker, was not at home when the incident took place, and her father is no more,” Sharma said.The girl and her family filed a complaint on Saturday morning, and the police tracked him down based on her description later that evening. He was arrested and booked for rape and under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.The man’s nephew, at whose factory he worked while on parole, said he reached Swaroop Nagar police station with some other relatives around 11.30 pm on Saturday after receiving a call from the police.“We saw a group of policemen beating him up with sticks and banging his head against the wall. They were also forcing him to drink alcohol. We weren’t allowed to meet him and were shooed away,” the man’s nephew alleged. DCP Sharma did not respond to these allegations.Around 9am, the family said they received another call from the police calling them to Samaypur Badli police station. “We were told that my uncle had hanged himself. How did he make arrangements for a suicide in a compound that also houses the DCP’s office,” the nephew asked.The Samaypur Badli police station, where the alleged suicide took place, operates out of the same compound where DCP Sharma’s office is located.Sharma said the man had to be shifted from Swaroop Nagar to Samaypur Badli police station because the former does not have a lock up. However, they did not specify when he was transferred.“We have preserved CCTV camera footage and have suspended the guard who was deployed outside the lock-up,” Sharma said, adding that the metropolitan magistrate has been informed about the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/convict-on-parole-hangs-himself-at-police-station-hours-after-being-arrested-for-raping-a-minor-girl/story-NWs5w7roP1dnlfvZ4VqAgP.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||Couple commits suicide in North Delhi||A married couple was found dead at their home in outer-north Delhi’s Siraspur, with the police suspecting they poisoned themselves. Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), said a preliminary enquiry has revealed both were depressed because their son did not have a child after nine years of marriage, allegedly due to medical issues. “This would often lead to the couple and their son quarrelling. A few days ago, the couple decided to move out and live in a rented house in the same neighbourhood,” Sharma said. On Sunday afternoon, the couple’s son-in-law visited them to find both of them unconscious. The evidence suggested that they had consumed poison, Sharma said. They were rushed to a hospital where both were pronounced dead on arrival. The 50-year-old man worked as a security guard at a godown in Alipur and his 48-year-old wife worked at a factory nearby. The police have initiated inquest proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/couple-commits-suicide-in-north-delhi/story-l2K9z2TU95WOsCeXEmkfkO.html
21-09-2020||Mumbai||Experts raise concerns over the relaxation in age criteria for nursery, Class 1 admissions across Maharashtra||Two days after the state education department relaxed the cut-off date for age criteria to nursery and Class 1 admissions in the state, experts have raised concerns over the new norms. As per a government resolution released on September 18, a child has to complete three years by December 31 to be eligible for pre-primary/nursery admissions. Similarly, the child should have completed six years by the same date for admission to Class 1. The earlier cut-off date for both these admissions was September 30. This effectively means that a 2.5-year-old and a 5.5-year-old child can get admission to nursery and Class 1 respectively from 2021-22. Rohan Bhatt, trustee, Children’s Academy Group of schools said, “For CBSE/ICSE schools which begin their academic year in April, even a child who is two years, three months old will be eligible for nursery admissions. This is a big concern for educationists as it might have a detrimental impact on the development of children who start schooling at such a young age. Several research studies have shown the importance of age-appropriate learning which might not be achieved in this case.” Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association said that there will also be a disparity between two children whose age differs by six months. “For example, 2.5-year-olds are able to use sentences of two to three words, while three-year-old toddlers can usually use sentences of up to five words or more. Curriculum designed for nursery is more in line with the three-year-old development domains and 2.5-year-olds would struggle to cope with it,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/experts-raise-concerns-over-the-relaxation-in-age-criteria-for-nursery-class-1-admissions-across-maharashtra/story-p4OZ4SxWwXNJ2EjEfkGfGP.html

A senior officer associated with the investigation said the woman had been seeking a personal loan of Rs 18 lakh. One of the accused, identified as Manoj Sharma, 48, had offered to give her Rs 7 lakh at the hotel. Sharma has been arrested and four others, including a woman, have been booked on charges of gang rape and causing hurt on a complaint by the rape survivor, said Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi). “We are searching for the other suspects,” said DCP Singhal. The survivor is a married woman who works in the tourism industry. “She was in dire need of money and was looking to get a personal loan,” said the DCP. Police identified the arrested suspect, Sharma, as a private contractor. “On Friday evening, he had called the victim to a spot outside the hotel. He was accompanied by a woman. When the victim reached there, they told her to accompany them to the hotel,” said another investigator. “Four men were already inside the hotel room when victim was taken there. The five men gang-raped her while the other woman allegedly instigated and provoked them to sexually assault her,” said the officer. “Sharma dropped the victim to her home in South Delhi. The woman called the police after reaching home,” the officer said.A spokesperson for Shangri-La Hotel said, “The Delhi Police is currently looking into an incident which allegedly took place at the hotel. We are unable to provide any details as this is an ongoing investigation. The hotel is extending its full support to the authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-gang-raped-in-shangri-la-hotel-one-arrested/story-7pAyZsWT0ah2L6l6j1pj7N.html
21-09-2020||Noida||G Noida authority junks safari project, offers land for film city||The Greater Noida authority on Sunday offered to set up a film city on the 550 acre land, which earlier had been demarcated for a unique Night Safari project. The authority on Sunday said it has scrapped the safari project and requested the Uttar Pradesh government to give necessary approvals for the development of the film city. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has also offered the land it had earmarked for developing a Film City Centre in 2018 to the state government.“We have decided not to continue with the Night Safari project, which could not materialise due to ecological issues. So, we have decided to develop a film city on the 550 acres land earmarked for the safari project. We have prepared a proposal and will send it to the government for necessary approvals on Monday,” said Narendra Bhooshan chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Former UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had in 2005 planned the recreational project, including Night Safari in Greater Noida but it could not be developed due to fund crunch.The Yogi Adityanath government had in January 2019 decided to revive this project, which was slated to have a Disneyland-like recreational and other entertainment facilities.“But the government later realised that managing wildlife would involve a lot of ecology related issues and it might not be viable. Therefore, we have now decided to use the 550 acres land for a film city. The best part is the location is suited for the film city with airport connectivity, world class Yamuna Expressway, high-rises, Surajpur bird sanctuary, Formula One track, well-planned industrial towns and other facilities,” said Bhooshan.The land use of the 550 acre plot is described in the official documents as ‘institutional green’.“As per the land use norms, we can allow construction of studios on 200 acres of land with ground plus a maximum eight floors. At least 8 lakh square metres area can be developed for film shooting, as per initial estimates. It would be the best suited location for filmmaking,” said Bhooshan.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had asked officials on Friday to find a suitable land to set up the country’s ‘biggest’ film city in the Gautam Buddha Nagar district including the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida, officials said. The CM gave the directions during a meeting to review development projects in the Meerut division--comprising Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Baghpat and Gautam Buddha Nagar districts.The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh has also written to UP government, offering 500 acres land in sector 21 located along 165km Yamuna Expressway for developing the film city. Singh said , “The Yeida had earmarked sector 21 as Film City Centre in 2018 and we had taken this land from farmers to develop a film city.” However, the project didn’t materialise. During his tenure, former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had also tried to lure filmmakers to the state but the state could not receive any investment in developing film production facilities, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/g-noida-authority-junks-safari-project-offers-land-for-film-city/story-TPlgymkYPhftOcuLtqutIO.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||CBSE focus on safety as it readies for conducting compartment exams||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has thrown in a bunch of strict safety measures in place to check the spread of Covid-19 as it gears up to start conducting its compartment exams for students of Class 10 and 12 from Tuesday onwards. From doubling the number of examination centres to seeking Delhi Police’s help to prevent crowding outside centres, the board is trying to do it all in order to ensure safety and security of the students during the exams.This year around 2,37,000 students from India and 16 other countries will be appearing in the compartment exams. Students of Class 10 will be appearing in a maximum of two subjects and those in Class 12 will write their exam in one subject. The board has increased the number of examination centres from 500 (last year) to 1,268 this time around to maintain social distancing. In Delhi, the exams will be conducted in 247 centres.The CBSE on September 4 — despite vociferous protests by students and parents against conducting retests amid the raging pandemic — had announced that compartment exams will be held between September 22 and 30. The board had to earlier suspend exams of classes 10 and 12 after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the nation. The exams were later cancelled and students were evaluated on the basis of the average of exams in which they had appeared.The Directorate of Education (DoE) on Friday issued a notification asking all principals of schools that have been turned into a CBSE exam centre, to ensure smooth movement of students and teachers on exam days. “Further, the heads of these schools are also directed to ensure continued water and electricity supply during exams, and health support (in case required) . Delhi Police is also directed to support in preventing overcrowding outside exam centres,” the notification stated.All the candidates have been asked to wear a face mask and to carry their own hand sanitisers in a transparent bottle, along with a water bottle. The exam will be conducted between 10:30am to 1:30 pm. The answer book will be distributed to candidates between 10am and 10:15 am.Among the centres in Delhi, is Sarvodaya co-ed vidyalaya in Rohini sector-8. School principal Awadhesh Kumar Jha said that they are ready with sanitisers, masks, thermal scanners. “The rooms will be sanitised before the arrival of students. We have also drawn circles at a distance of 5-6 metres outside the school for students to ensure social distancing during entry. The school has also written to the Delhi police requesting their personnel be posted outside the building to avoid crowding,” he said.Many students and their parents have been protesting against the CBSE’s decision of conducting an exam amid the pandemic. Students had also launched an online campaign with the hashtag #cancelcompartmentexam2020. A plea seeking cancellation of exams has also been filed in the Supreme Court. The matter will be next heard on Tuesday. Sidhi Sawant, a student, took to Twitter to vent her opposition against the move, “If our exams are not cancelled then we want all the exams which were cancelled previously (because of COVID-19 pandemic) to happen compulsorily for all students. Why we are being treated differently amid a Pandemic (sic),” her tweet read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cbse-focus-on-safety-as-it-readies-for-conducting-compartment-exams/story-Ngd1pqP0fkbgspesNmpueL.html
21-09-2020||Delhi||73 ‘low-performing’ Delhi govt schools to be adopted by mentors||The Directorate of Education (DoE) has identified 73 ‘low-performing’ government schools across Delhi on the basis of their performance in CBSE Class 10 exams this year. The schools will now be adopted by the directorate officials who will monitor their academic performance throughout the year.In a circular issued on Friday, DoE’s inspection cell said, “On the basis of result analysis of Class 10 CBSE result, for the session 2019-20, the low performing government schools have been identified for adoption. All the concerned officers of the directorate are requested to adopt the allotted school for monitoring the academic performance during the session 2020-21.”While a majority of these schools have overall pass percentages in Class 10 between 50% and 60%, some have also recorded pass percentage as low as 21%, 34% and 38%.The officials will carry out inspections in their allotted school at least once in a fortnight. They will help schools identify low performing subjects and students and chalk out a plan to improve their performance in the current academic session. “The mentors are expected to visit the respective schools at least once in a fortnight and submit an inspection report in the inspection branch within three days and a copy of the same to be given to the head of schools for the action taken report,” the circular added.The inspection performa carries parameters like — steps taken to improve attendance/ involvement of students in online classes / regular classes; whether the action plan for improvement of low performing students is prepared and followed; and if the schools have requisite online study material for students. At a time when schools are have been forced shut in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, learning have become digital with classes shifting online.An official at the Delhi government’s education department said that the idea behind the adoption is to prepare an action plan for these schools. “Despite Delhi government schools performing better than last year in CBSE class 10 exams, the performance of some schools are still not up to the mark. The mentors will now monitor the academic performance of these schools and help them improve,” the official said.The performance of government schools in Delhi improved by around 11 percentage points, from 71.6% in 2019 to 82.61% this year, in CBSE class 10 exams. Of 1,005 schools from which students took the class 10 exams, 147 achieved 100% results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/73-low-performing-delhi-govt-schools-to-be-adopted-by-mentors/story-LTPHwAWXtRSLBtNTk0wAlO.html

In the last eight days alone, the state has reported 3,486 fatalities, which is an average of 435 deaths during the period.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “We must not view it in terms of absolute numbers. The CFR is an important parameter. Each death is a matter of concern and important for us, but the CFR has reduced from 4.5% in June to 2.70%. It is declining in different regions as well. The count of infections itself is huge, the absolute number of deaths will seem higher.”Maharashtra, as per the data of the state medical education department, went to the second spot in the country for highest CFR after Punjab. Maharashtra surpassed Gujarat, which for a long period had occupied the top spot, but was later dislodged by Punjab. Punjab’s CFR is 2.88%.The state has so far tested 58,72,241 samples, which has a led to an overall positivity rate of 20.58%.

21-09-2020||Delhi||SC panel asks Delhi govt to increase homeless shelters in view of Covid||The state level monitoring committee, which was constituted following Supreme Court order, on night shelters has asked the Delhi government to increase the number of temporary shelters to ensure adequate physical distance is maintained between occupants this winter in view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.In a meeting held last week, the committee asked the Delhi government’s Delhi Urban Shelter improvement Board (DUSIB), which is responsible for running the shelters for homeless people, to prepare this year’s Winter Action Plan conforming to the Covid-related norms.Indu Prakash Singh, member of the monitoring committee, said, “There is a need to draw up the winter action plan now, as we will need more temporary shelters this time as physical distance has to be ensured between individuals. The existing capacity of shelters will reduce this time. We have asked DUSIB to prepare a detailed plan and share it with us. We have also told other government agencies not to demolish or close any shelter home, especially those operating in porta cabins, on their land.”According to a senior DUSIB official, aware of the development, the board is planning to set up more temporary tents this time. It is also planning to make two of its under-construction shelter home buildings at Dwarka and Geeta Colony, each with a capacity to house close to 300-400 people, operational by November, said a DUSIB official.The DUSIB has 211 shelter homes in various parts of the city. During the winter season, the board sets up temporary shelters depending on the requirement. According to DUSIB officials, the board on an average sets up 50-60 additional tents annually during the winter season.“While the number will increase due to social distancing, we will have to assess the demand. We may have to set up 100-125 tents. The details are being worked out. We are planning to set up bigger tents or temporary structures, as we have to make arrangements for toilets, water, etc also. We can accommodate more people in these tents,” said a DUSIB official, who was part of the meeting.According to DUSIB officials, nearly 18,000 people can be accommodated in the existing night shelters. “But on an average, only 11,000-12,000 people use our facilities. So, we already have additional space. Our two buildings in Dwarka and Geeta Colony will also be operational soon,” said the official.The NGOs running the night shelters in the city say that managing people during winter will be a challenge. During the lockdown, the homeless shelters could accommodate more people. “But during winter, everyone sleeps inside. We need to create adequate space.As compared to last year, we have more people at our shelter homes right now. The cases of covid are on a rise. We should plan for the winter now,” said Rajesh Kumar, national executive director of Society For promotion of Youth and Masses, which manages 24 shelters for homeless people across Delhi.The Delhi government did not offer a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-panel-asks-delhi-govt-to-increase-homeless-shelters-in-view-of-covid/story-BgSKBrNslJWHmFmfYL4ETP.html

He was charged earlier in the year by the US with narco-terrorism, corruption, drug-trafficking and other criminal offences, and carries a reward of $15 million for information leading to his arrest.“The United States has now restored UN sanctions on Iran,” President Donald Trump said in a statement announcing the executive order he signed on the UN arms embargo and the new sanctions on 27 entities and individuals connected to Iran’s “proliferation networks”.“The Iranian regime has repeatedly lied about its secret nuclear weapons archive and denied access to international inspectors, further exposing the deep flaws of the last administration’s failed nuclear deal from which I withdrew the United States,” he added, referring to the 2015 nuclear deal signed by Iran, US, UK, France, China and Russia and Germany. The deal had temporarily frozen Iranian nuclear weapons programme in return for lifting of all curbs and sanctions, including those related to conventional arms.France, Britain and German have already rejected the US call to restore the UN sanctions for alleged violation of the nuclear deal, saying Washington did not have any authority to demand a ‘snapback’ of curbs after having left the agreement.The US has gone ahead nevertheless, and secretary of state Mike Pompeo told reporters on Monday, “We have made very clear that every member state in the United Nations has a responsibility to report the sanctions.”“That certainly includes the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We will have every expectation that those nations enforce these sanctions,” he added.The UN Security Council had rejected in August a US proposal to snap back the 2010 UN embargo on sale of conventional arms to Iran. China and Russia had opposed it in a vote and France, Germany and the United Kingdom had abstained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unilaterally-restores-un-sanctions-against-iran/story-3Qqh1rAt6bX2DTe41DZdUM.html

The police released new CCTV footage that shows a vehicle parked on the street where the offence took place before the burglary. The suspects are described as three white men with eastern European accents. One Beretta ‘Cheetah’ Auto Pistol featured in Die Another Day; one Walter PP featured in A View to a Kill; one Revolver Smith and Weston 44 Magnum featured in Live & Let Die; one Beretta ‘Tomcat’ Auto pistol featured in Die Another Day; and one Llama 22 cal featured in Die Another Day were stolen.The yellow-handed Llama pistol was recovered by a member of the public in a field in Essex in April. Detective inspector Paul Ridley said: “It has now been six months since the burglary and only one of the firearms has been recovered. Sadly, this has been severely rusted due to being exposed to the elements outdoors and its integrity destroyed”.“We now have images of a vehicle that was parked near to the scene of the crime and appears to be carrying out reconnaissance in the area. In scenes reminiscent of a James Bond movie you can even see the flash of a camera from the occupant engaged in the surveillance”. “I believe these individuals were involved in the crime, it was only a matter of minutes prior to the raid. The firearms which were stolen are very distinctive and will almost certainly be recognised by the public and anyone who is offered them for sale”, he added.The police said the stolen items are unique. For example, the Magnum is the only one in the world ever made where the whole gun is finished in chrome. It has a six-and-a-half inch barrel and wood grips. The Walther PPK was the last gun used by Roger Moore, who played James Bond in View to a Kill in a famous scene with Grace Jones who descends the Eiffel Tower on a parachute, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cops-issue-new-appeal-to-find-james-bond-guns-stolen-in-london-heist/story-pFeeUCdi0Ak7dKJvzhWENI.html
21-09-2020||World||UK considering new national lockdown as Covid-19 cases ‘doubling each week’||The United Kingdom could see 50,000 new Covid-19 cases every day by mid-October if no swift action is taken, top experts warned on Monday, as the Boris Johnson government considered imposing another national lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.Chief scientific officer Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the number of cases is doubling every seven days. For the first time in recent months, they appeared on live television without a minister present to report the new data described as “critical”.“If, and that’s quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days...you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day”, Vallance said. He projected more than 200 daily deaths by mid-November. “The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days. That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down.” Health secretary Matt Hancock is due to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon. The Johnson cabinet is reported to be divided on the issue of a fresh lockdown in view of another severe blow it would inflict on the economy.After daily increases in cases in the hundreds in July and August, the figures have consistently been in the thousands in September. On Sunday, 3,899 new cases and 18 deaths were reported across the UK, as the experts reiterated basic precautions needed.Setting out current situation in Spain and France, the experts said the UK is seeing similar increases, with new cases rising across all age groups, but particularly among the youth. The call for action is also prompted by the annual challenge of dealing with seasonal ailments in winter.Parts of the UK are already under local lockdowns, with a range of heavy fines to be imposed from September 28 on those breaching self-isolation or lockdown rules. Parts of London are also due to face new restrictions.The opposition Labour urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government’s incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system”.“Labour’s priority is that there must be a national effort to prevent another national lockdown. The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people’s wellbeing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-considering-new-national-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-doubling-each-week/story-foe2BYkTDqeWKNAcC8ItYM.html
21-09-2020||World||Drug used to treat coronavirus infections in cats may be effective against Covid-19: Study||According to a study, a drug used to treat deadly coronavirus infections in cats could potentially be an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the global coronavirus pandemic. The finding, published in the journal Nature Communications, paves the way for human clinical trials of the drug, a protease inhibitor called GC376. “This drug is very likely to work in humans, so we are encouraged that it will be an effective treatment for Covid-19 patients,” said Joanne Lemieux, a professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. However, the researchers said clinical trials will need to run their course before anyone can be sure that the drug is both safe and effective for treating Covid-19 in humans. In cats at least, GC376 works by interfering with a virus’ ability to replicate, thus ending an infection, they said. Derivatives of this drug were first studied following the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and it was further developed by veterinary researchers who showed it cures fatal feline affliction. Lemieux and colleagues first tested two variants of the feline drug against SARS-CoV-2 protein in test tubes and with the live virus in human cell lines. They then crystallised the drug variants in conjunction with virus proteins. The researchers determined the orientation of the cat drug as it bound to an active site on a SARS-CoV-2 protein, revealing how it inhibits viral replication. “This will allow us to develop even more effective drugs,” Lemieux said, adding the team will continue to test modifications of the inhibitor to make it an even better fit inside the virus. Aina Cohen, from the US Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, said she was excited by the drug’s effectiveness. “Until an effective vaccine can be developed and deployed, drugs like these add to our arsenal of Covid-19 treatments,” Cohen said. “We are thrilled to learn of these important results and look forward to learning the outcome of clinical trials,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-used-to-treat-coronavirus-infections-in-cats-may-be-effective-against-covid-19-study/story-xlouFanOq83IiOWkyt9tSI.html
21-09-2020||World||UK faces 50,000 Covid-19 cases per day by October without action now||The UK is on course for 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October if urgent measures are not taken to prevent the spread of the disease, the government’s chief scientific adviser said.That infection rate would likely lead to more than 200 deaths per day in mid-November, Patrick Vallance warned in a live TV broadcast on Monday. “Cases are increasing, hospitalizations are following,” he said. “Deaths unfortunately will follow that, and there’s the potential for this to move very fast.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out further restrictions on Tuesday, as ministers try to strike a balance between stamping down on the pandemic and avoiding a full lockdown that would snuff out the recovery after the economy plunged into its deepest recession for more than 100 years.On ITV earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government’s plans have not been finalized, though he reiterated the government is determined to keep schools open and the economy running as much as possible.Testing data show social activities -- rather than the reopening of schools and offices -- are the main reason for the recent surge, Hancock said, indicating that will be the government’s focus with new rules. Pressed on whether pubs will have to close, Hancock said: “It’s not a no and it’s not a yes.”The latest government statistics, released on Sunday, showed a further 3,899 daily Covid cases and 18 deaths in the UK Vallance said the epidemic is “doubling roughly every seven days.”The figures showed that without action, the UK is on course for as many as 49,000 cases per day by Oct. 13. Vallance said that these 50,000 new daily infections would be followed a month later by around 200 deaths per day, if steps are not taken to tackle the outbreak and the disease continues to spread at current rates. He emphasized that this was a modeling projection, not a prediction of what will happen.England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, sitting alongside Vallance, said the UK must take Covid-19 “very seriously” for the next six months as the country enters the more dangerous autumn and winter months. He said there was no evidence the virus is milder now than it was in the spring.“If we do too little, this virus will go out of control and you will get significant numbers of increased direct and indirect deaths,” Whitty said. “But if we go too far the other way, then we can cause damage to the economy which can feed through to unemployment, to poverty, to deprivation -- all of which have long-term health effects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-faces-50-000-covid-cases-per-day-by-october-without-action-now/story-LAXI23QzkaNWBUfdVS3ZNL.html
21-09-2020||World||Seven choices for Boris Johnson as UK faces second coronavirus lockdown||Boris Johnson’s top team is grappling with a spike in coronavirus infections that’s seen the UK outbreak spreading exponentially again.Ministers are trying to decide how to balance tackling the virus with helping the economy recover from its worst recession in more than a century, sparking divisions within the Cabinet over the best way forward.Here’s what could happen next:More local lockdownsThe existing “whack a mole” strategy has already seen vast swathes of the country under local lockdown, restricting social contact between households and imposing early closing times on pubs, bars and restaurants.The measures cover some 10 million people, and there’s only so far they can go before they start resembling a national lockdown again. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is pushing urgently for measures in the capital, which has so far avoided fresh restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people in London could be told to work from home again this week.Social RestrictionsThe government’s strategy so far has been to try to keep schools and businesses open while stamping down on social interaction. This month, ministers replaced complicated rules on social mixing with a blanket rule than no more than six people could meet socially, unless they were all from the same household. The next step would be to ban people from different households from mixing altogether.“We’re at a really critical moment and I think that if we don’t make sure that we’re adhering to all the various different requirements – the rule of six, self isolation, quarantine when required, then we are going to end up needing to apply stronger brakes on this,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Monday.Work From HomeThe advice at the beginning of the pandemic was that everyone who could, should work from home. But as the outbreak died down over the summer, the government started encouraging people to return to their offices, particularly in city centers where bars, cafes and shops that relied on commuters were struggling.But with the virus on the rise again, the authorities may tell people to stay in their homes again.Circuit BreakerJohnson has compared the idea of a second national lockdown to a nuclear deterrent -- the option of last resort, and ministers consistently say they want to avoid such a radical step at all costs. But gaining traction is the idea of a so-called circuit breaker -- a two week shutdown, perhaps coinciding with the half-term holiday in schools next month.Asked about the notion on Sunday, Hancock said “that was another proposal that came from the scientists,” and stressed officials were looking at “all” options. Enforcing the rules is seen as key.“We’ll be increasingly stringent on the people who are not following the rules – if everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdowns,” Hancock said. “But we, of course, have to be prepared to take action if that’s what’s necessary.”Close SchoolsJust about the last thing the government will countenance, having rested a lot of political capital in getting them open again in September. Ministers are concerned that having children at home hits the ability of their parents to work effectively, whether from home or in their workplaces.Test and traceThe government says it will increase testing to 500,000 a day by the end of October, but the system is ridden with well-publicized failings. If the government can make the system more effective, speeding up the time it takes to give people results and then reaching more of their close contacts to tell them to self-isolate, the U.K. could begin to bear down more effectively on its infection rate.VaccinateThe government has ensured it has orders for six different vaccines should they succeed in clinical trials. Hancock said on Sunday that “there is still hope that we will get one of the vaccines over the line this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-choices-for-boris-johnson-as-uk-faces-second-coronavirus-lockdown/story-z4RA4DCR2pEO3gTndLrdqJ.html

21-09-2020||World||Tropical Storm Beta forecast to make landfall Monday||Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Monday morning in parts of Texas and Louisiana as Tropical Storm Beta slowly worked its way into a part of the country that’s already been drenched and battered during this year’s exceptionally busy hurricane season.No longer expected to gain hurricane strength, forecasters also decreased estimated rainfall totals from Beta early Monday, saying in a US National Hurricane Center advisory that up to 15 inches of rain could fall in some areas.That’s down from earlier predictions of up to 20 inches.Maximum sustained winds also decreased to 85 kph Monday morning. Beta was moving west at 9 kph, forecasters said.It was the system’s slow movement and storm surge were generating concerns in coastal communities. Storm surge up to 5 feet was forecast from San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass in Texas.Beta was set to make landfall along Texas’ central or upper Gulf Coast late Monday night, forecasters said.It was then expected to move northeastward along the coast and head into Louisiana sometime mid-week, with rainfall as its biggest threat.Forecasters said Beta was not expected to bring the same amount of rainfall that Texas experienced during either Hurricane Harvey in 2017 or Tropical Storm Imelda last year. Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on Houston and caused USD 125 billion in damage in Texas. Imelda, which hit Southeast Texas, was one of the wettest cyclones on record.The first rain bands from Beta reached the Texas coast on Sunday, but the heaviest rain wasn’t expected to arrive until late Monday into Tuesday.In low-lying Galveston, which has seen more than its share of tropical weather over the years, officials didn’t expect to issue a mandatory evacuation order but they advised people to have supplies ready in case they have to stay home for several days if roads are flooded.“We’re not incredibly worried,” Galveston resident Nancy Kitcheo said Sunday. Kitcheo, 49, and her family had evacuated last month when forecasts suggested Hurricane Laura could make landfall near Galveston, but they’re planning to buy supplies and wait out Beta. Laura ended up making landfall in neighboring Louisiana.Kitcheo, whose home is 18 feet above the ground on stilts, said she expected her street to be impassable as water from rising tides was already flooding neighboring roadways on Sunday.“This has definitely been more stressful, this hurricane season,” she said.Galveston, which has about 50,000 residents, was the site of the deadliest hurricane in US history, a 1900 storm that killed an estimated 6,000 people.The city was also hit hard in 2008 by Hurricane Ike, which caused about USD 30 billion in damage. Kitcheo’s previous home was heavily damaged during Ike and had to be torn down.Beta was churning slowly through the Gulf of Mexico on Monday morning about 180 kilometers south of Galveston, and 150 kilometers east-southeast of Port O’Connor, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.Forecasters ran out of traditional storm names on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner on Sunday said while Beta was not expected to bring rain like Harvey, he cautioned residents to “be weather alert.” “Be weather aware because things can change.This is 2020 and so we have to expect the unexpected,” said Turner, adding the city expected to activate its emergency center on Monday.In Victoria County, about 193 kilometers southwest of Houston, officials asked residents to prepare for up to 10 to 15 inches of rain.“As with any event, panic is never helpful or necessary, but preparation is, and now is the time to finalize those plans,” said County Judge Ben Zeller, the top elected official in Victoria County.Beta is forecast to dump heavy rain on the southwestern corner of Louisiana three weeks after the same area got pounded by Hurricane Laura.More than 41,000 homes and businesses remain without electricity, and Beta could add to that figure by toppling trees that were left leaning by the previous storm, said meteorologist Donald Jones of the National Weather Service office in Lake Charles, Louisiana.Storm debris from Laura clogging draining ditches in hard-hit areas such as Lake Charles could increase the threat of flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-beta-forecast-to-make-landfall-monday/story-rOY52DW7oQbrdkZ9YRphJL.html
21-09-2020||World||UK ponders second Covid-19 lockdown as outbreak accelerates||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Monday pondering a second national lockdown as an accelerating coronavirus outbreak threatened to destroy any shoots of economic recovery and send millions back into isolation.The United Kingdom already has the biggest official Covid-19 death toll in Europe - and the fifth largest in the world - while it is borrowing record amounts in an attempt to pump emergency money through the damaged economy.But new Covid-19 cases are rising by at least 6,000 per day in Britain, according to week-old data, hospital admissions are doubling every eight days, and the testing system is buckling.“The trend in the UK is heading in the wrong direction and we are at a critical point in the pandemic,” Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical officer, will say at a briefing at 1000 GMT on Monday.Johnson is due to speak on Tuesday.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the restrictions would be different to last time: the government wants to crack down on socialising but schools and many workplaces will stay open.“If we do have to take action, it will be different to last time and we’ve learnt a huge amount about how to tackle the virus,” he told ITV.“Schools aren’t where a lot of the transmission happens, it’s more about people socialising,” he said.Asked about Christmas and if people would be able to hug their relatives, he said he wanted it to be as normal as possible.“If this runs out of control now, we’ll have to take heavier measures in the future,” Hancock said.The official UK death toll stands at 41,777 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ponders-second-covid-19-lockdown-as-outbreak-accelerates/story-nwORHYlonnd0Kz2vgaFc4N.html

21-09-2020||World||Around 270 whales stranded on sandbar off Australia’s Tasmania||Marine biologists were planning the rescue of around 270 whales stranded on a sandbar off the remote west coast of the Australian island of Tasmania on Monday.Government scientists said it appeared that at least 25 of the animals, believed to be pilot whales, had already died. Pilot whales are a species of oceanic dolphin that grows 7 metres (23 ft) long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes.“While strandings are not uncommon in Tasmania, and while strandings of this scale aren’t (unprecedented), we certainly haven’t had one for at least 10 years,” Nic Deka, a regional manager for Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said.Tasmania’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment said the whales were stranded in three groups in shallow water at Macquarie Heads, some 200 kms (120 miles) northwest of the state capital Hobart.Rescuers with specialised equipment arrived at the site on Monday afternoon to assess the situation. They were expected to regroup on the shore as it grew dark to discuss a rescue strategy.Officials usually respond to reports of strandings of dolphins and whales in Tasmania once every two or three weeks, on average.Government scientists had first thought the mass stranding involved about 70 whales when it was viewed from the air, but a closer inspection revealed the larger number.The last mass stranding off the coast of Tasmania was in 2009, when around 200 whales beached themselves. In 2018, more than 100 pilot whales died after beaching themselves off the coast of New Zealand.It is not known why whales, which travel together in pods, sometimes beach themselves but they are known to follow a leader, as well as gather around an injured or distressed whale.“Their social groups and strong bonding between the groups causes often all of them to strand,” Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher and Project Manager of whales and climate at Griffith University, told Reuters.

21-09-2020||World||China air force video appears to show simulated attack on US base on Guam||China’s air force has released a video showing nuclear-capable H-6 bombers carrying out a simulated attack on what appears to be Andersen Air Force Base on the U.S. Pacific island of Guam, as regional tensions rise.The video, released on Saturday on the People’s Liberation Army Air Force Weibo account, came as China carried out a second day of drills near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to express anger at the visit of a senior U.S. State Department official to Taipei.Guam is home to major U.S. military facilities, including the air base, which would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.The Chinese air force’s two minute and 15 second video, set to solemn, dramatic music like a trailer for a Hollywood movie, shows H-6 bombers taking off from a desert base. The video is called “The god of war H-6K goes on the attack!” Halfway through, a pilot presses a button and looses off a missile at an unidentified seaside runway.The missile homes in on the runway, a satellite image of which is shown that looks exactly like the layout of Andersen.The music suddenly stops as images of the ground shaking appear, following by aerial views of an explosion.“We are the defenders of the motherland’s aerial security; we have the confidence and ability to always defend the security of the motherland’s skies,” the air force wrote in a brief description for the video.Neither China’s defence ministry nor U.S. Indo-Pacific Command immediately responded to requests for comment on the video.Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said the video was aimed at highlighting China’s growing prowess in long-range power projection.“The video is meant to warn the Americans that even supposedly safe, rearward positions such as Guam may come under threat when conflicts over regional flashpoints, be it Taiwan or South China Sea, erupt,” he said.The H-6 has been involved in multiple Chinese flights around and near Taiwan, according to Taiwan’s air force, including those last week.The H-6K is the latest model of the bomber, which is based on the 1950s vintage Soviet Tu-16.On Monday, China’s Eastern Theatre Command, which would be in charge of an attack on Taiwan, released a propaganda video of its own, called “what if war broke out today?”, showing soldiers running in wooded hills and ballistic missiles launching.“Motherland, I swear I will fight for you until my death!” large golden Chinese characters read at the end of the montage as explosions go off in the background.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-air-force-video-appears-to-show-simulated-attack-on-us-base-on-guam/story-TGOjOTO7oEZ5v1NHtppaOJ.html

Students will attend in-person classes once or twice a week.South Korea managed to contain the virus and avoid a full lockdown earlier this year, but infections at a church and political rally in August sparked the country’s largest outbreak forcing authorities to impose social distancing curbs. Many schools closed on Aug. 26, though high school seniors facing a key test were allowed to continue in-person classes.Authorities on Sunday, meanwhile, extended phase 2 social distancing for a week until Sept. 27, which limits indoor gatherings to below 50 and outdoor to less than 100. They said they would impose stricter restrictions on Sept. 28, ahead of the three-day Chuseok holiday when people traditionally reunite with families.“We are not at a stage to let our guard down yet,” health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho told a briefing.The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 70 new cases as of midnight Sunday, the lowest daily increase since the middle of August. The latest outbreak peaked at more than 440 new cases at the end of August, and despite the steady decline officials say they fear the upcoming holiday may lead to another spike.Yoon urged residents to hold online visits during the holiday, and said the government is arranging for proxy services for some of the Chuseok traditions, including tidying around ancestors’ graves.Overall South Korea has reported 23,045 coronavirus cases with 385 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-schools-resume-in-person-classes-as-south-korea-coronavirus-cases-dip/story-X4005cZm2dlbZYUN4zLSEM.html

The court is scheduled to hear arguments on November 10, a week after the election, and probably will rule in the first half of 2021.With Ginsburg on the court, the law’s supporters held a strong, perhaps even unbeatable, hand. She was one of five justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, who remained on the court after voting in 2012 to uphold the core of the law in a case that raised similar issues.Her death Friday means defenders of the law will have to pick up a fifth vote from one of the other Republican-appointed justices.“I think you have to say that Affordable Care Act is in a more tenuous position today than it was on Friday morning,” said Nicholas Bagley, a health-care law professor at the University of Michigan Law School. “And you can hold that thought and still think that the likeliest outcome is that this very silly lawsuit will be turned away.”The law’s supporters have a strong candidate in Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose past votes and opinions term suggest he would be unlikely to throw out the entire ACA. Justice Samuel Alito’s record also suggests he would be open to upholding the bulk of the law, though he voted to invalidate it in 2012.Democrats are seeking to make Trump’s stance in the case a pivotal issue in the presidential election. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday Trump is trying to “strip away the peace of mind from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.”Republican ChallengesThe law, also known as Obamacare because it was signed by President Barack Obama, brought health insurance to 20 million people. Republicans have tried repeatedly to kill the law since it was enacted in 2010. The court also upheld Obamcare’s crucial tax credits in 2015 in a clash that centered on a glitch in the wording of the statute.The latest legal fight stems from a provision known as the individual mandate, which originally required people to acquire health insurance or pay a tax penalty.Writing for the court in 2012, Roberts said that provision was a legitimate use of Congress’s taxing power. A Republican-controlled Congress later joined with Trump to zero-out the tax penalty, leaving the mandate without any practical consequences.Republican-led states then sued to challenge the law. They argue that, without the tax penalty, Roberts’s rationale for upholding the individual mandate no longer applies. And the Republicans say the mandate is so integral to the law, even without any penalty attached to it, that the court now must strike down the whole thing.Kavanaugh’s VoteThe Trump administration is largely backing that position, while Democratic-run states are leading the defense of the law.Kavanaugh now could cast the pivotal vote. In other contexts, he has indicated reluctance to throw out an entire statute just because one part is unconstitutional.“Constitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute,” Kavanaugh wrote in July in a case involving the federal ban on robocalls to mobile phones.Roberts and Alito joined that opinion, which stripped out an exception for robocalls made to recoup debt owed to or guaranteed by the federal government.CFPB PrecedentThose three were also in the majority this year when the court resolved a case over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by stripping out a provision that shielded the director from being fired by the president. As with the robocall case, the court severed the job-protection provision from the statute that set up the CFPB.The reasoning in those cases, as well as a law review article Kavanaugh wrote before joining the Supreme Court, suggests the court will leave most of the ACA intact even if it decides the individual mandate is invalid, says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.“I don’t think there are five votes on the Supreme Court for holding that what’s left of the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the ACA,” Somin said.If a successor to Ginsburg hasn’t been confirmed by the argument date, the court in theory could split 4-4. That probably would mean a second argument to let the newest justice take part. The court could also take the preemptive step of rescheduling the argument to help ensure that nine justices can take part.No matter what the court decides, if Democrats win both the White House and the Senate, they could override the decision with a new law. They could even try to scuttle the case by re-imposing the tax before the court issues its ruling.And if Trump wins re-election, he will have four more years in the White House to try to kill the ACA.“Whoever wins the presidential election will have much more to say about the success or failure of the act than the court,” said Theodore Ruger, a health-law expert and dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School. “If it’s Trump, there are many administrative ways he could stifle it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ginsburg-s-death-injects-new-doubt-into-fate-of-obamacare/story-dBZh74pxCJkxIva5Hq9hwI.html
21-09-2020||World||China to lose access to Australian space tracking station||China will lose access to a strategic space tracking station in Western Australia when its contract expires, the facility’s owners said, a decision that cuts into Beijing’s expanding space exploration and navigational capabilities in the Pacific region.The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) has had a contract allowing Beijing access to the satellite antenna at the ground station since at least 2011. It is located next to an SSC satellite station primarily used by the United States and its agencies, including NASA.The Swedish state-owned company told Reuters it would not enter into any new contracts at the Australian site to support Chinese customers after its current contract expires. However, it did not disclose when the lease runs out.“Given the complexity of the Chinese market, brought about by the overall geopolitical situation, SSC has decided to focus mainly on other markets for the coming years,” the SSC said in an emailed response to questions.The site is owned by SSC subsidiary, SSC Space Australia.The Australian government did not immediately respond to questions on Monday.The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The expansion of China’s space capabilities, which includes the growing sophistication of its Beidou navigation network, is one of the new frontiers of tension between the U.S. and China, who are clashing on everything from technology and trade to Chinese activities in the disputed South China Sea.Australia has a strong alliance with the United States, which includes working together on space research and programmes, while Canberra’s diplomatic and trade ties with Beijing have also been fracturing.China last used the Yatharagga Satellite Station, located about 350 km (250 miles) north of the Australian city of Perth, in June 2013 to support the three-person Shenzhou 10 mission which completed a series of space docking tests, SSC said.The SSC said the current contract supports Chinese scientific space missions within its programme for manned-space flights for telemetry, tracking and command services.Overseas ExpansionGround stations are a vital part of space programmes given they create a telecommunications link with spacecraft. While stations have different capabilities, they can be equipped to co-ordinate satellites for civil-military Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Beidou, Russia’s GLONASS, the European Union’s Galileo system and U.S.-owned GPS.China’s space programme has been increasing its access to overseas ground stations in recent years in line with the expansion of its space exploration and navigational programmes.“Generally speaking anywhere you put a GNSS monitoring ground station will improve the accuracy of positioning for that region,” said Joon Wayn Cheong, a senior research associate at the University of New South Wales’ School of Electrical Engineering.Christopher Newman, professor of Space Law and Policy at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, said China wants to remove its dependence on GPS as part of broader plans to expand its global influence.“GPS could be made unavailable to them in a military conflict. An independent secure system is crucial for the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army in respect to targeting, weapons, navigation,” Newman told Reuters.Beijing last year re-established diplomatic ties with the small Pacific island nation of Kiribati, where it has a mothballed ground station in the central Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-lose-access-to-australian-space-tracking-station/story-1zoPf0EEyP4QV8YFwNweVM.html

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is rallying the troops as the end of the third quarter nears, urging employees in an email to make and sell as many electric cars as possible before Sept. 30.“We have a shot at a record quarter for vehicle deliveries, but will have to rally hard to achieve it,” said Musk in an internal email Sunday in the US that was seen by Bloomberg News. “This is the most number of vehicles per day that we’ve ever had to deliver.”Tesla makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y at its automotive plant in Fremont, California, and the Model 3 at its gigafactory in Shanghai. The company is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Sept. 22 and its first-ever so-called ‘Battery Day’ for investors.Tesla representatives in the US didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours. A Tesla China representative declined to comment.“Please consider vehicle deliveries to be absolute top priority,” Musk said in the email, which was titled ‘All hands on deck!’. “It’s also extremely important that we keep factory output as high as possible over the remaining 10 days. This is vital for the California market.”Musk, 49, has made a habit of sending end-of-quarter staff emails to urge productivity as well as to send a signal to investors. Tesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic dented consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars.The company hopes to deliver half a million vehicles in 2020, and has delivered roughly 179,000 through the first half. Blog Electrek reported on the internal communication earlier on Sunday.Tesla plans to ship China-built Model 3 cars made at its Shanghai factory to other countries in Asia and Europe and will likely start mass production of those vehicles in the fourth quarter, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-shot-at-record-quarter-if-employees-rally/story-a1khDt8y4vkQGopyh5A0FI.html
21-09-2020||World||Hungary PM Viktor Orban endorses Donald Trump in November US election||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Monday endorsed Donald Trump’s re-election bid for the U.S. presidency, saying his rival Democrats have forced a “moral imperialism” on the world that illiberal leaders like himself reject.“We root for Donald Trump’s victory, because we know well American Democratic governments’ diplomacy, built on moral imperialism. We have been forced to sample it before, we did not like it, we do not want seconds,” Orban wrote in an essay.Nationalist Orban faces a steep challenge to his decade-long rule in parliamentary elections due in early 2022 as Hungary braces for the economic and social impact of a second wave of coronavirus infections.The vote would be decisive as the international liberal elite was out to destroy Christian conservatives in Europe, he wrote in the pro-government daily Magyar Nemzet.“They prepare for a decisive battle in 2022, backed by the international media, Brussels bureaucrats, and NGOs disguised as civil organisations,” Orban said. “It is time for us to line up too.” Hungary and other central European countries would place economic efficiency over European Union policies such as “climate goals elevated to absurdity, a social Europe, a common tax code and a multicultural society”, he said.The EU will try to implement the multi-trillion euro post-pandemic revival plan with key political discussions yet to be conducted among member states, some of which want to regulate the self-styled illiberal Orban much more strongly.The idea of strict conditions on the disbursement of EU aid and funds to the rule of law has prompted a threat of veto for the whole package from Orban, who said the system was more aptly described as “rule of blackmail.”Orban said the outcome much depended on the succession battle in Germany as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s term nears an end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-pm-viktor-orban-endorses-donald-trump-in-november-us-election/story-9phh4OTGbBsHZ68pqeNRmJ.html
21-09-2020||World||Why is Taiwan-China tension rising and what are the risks?||China sent numerous aircraft close to Taiwan during two days of drills from Friday, causing the island’s air force to scramble, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei.Why is the tension rising now?China claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, a threat the island has lived with since 1949, when defeated Kuomintang, or Nationalist, forces fled there after their defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war.China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for Taiwan, including two visits in as many months by top officials, one in August by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the other last week by Keith Krach, the undersecretary for economic affairs.In addition, the United States is planning major new arms sales to Taiwan. China views all these steps as effectively being U.S. support for Taiwan independence, with the eventual establishment of a Republic of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that the People’s Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan and has no right to.China calls Taiwan its most important and sensitive issue in U.S. ties. For China’s ruling Communist Party, Taiwan is the last part of the nation still awaiting “liberation” after the 1949 victory, adding an extra historical significance.What are the risks?Taiwan and China do not have an official dialogue mechanism, meaning that any accidental clash between their fighter jets, for example, could quickly spiral out of control.Taiwan’s air force now regularly scrambles to see off approaching Chinese aircraft.A conflict over Taiwan may suck in the United States and its Asian allies, though it is an open question whether Washington would, or could, come to Taipei’s aid.China may quickly overwhelm Taiwan with missile and cyber attacks before the United States even has a chance to respond.However, any war would be damaging for China too, in terms of its international reputation and economically, especially if it is subject to broad Western economic sanctions. Why is Taiwan strategically important? Not only is Taiwan in a key geographic location on the edge of the Pacific between the disputed South China Sea and Japan, but it is a tech powerhouse, home to the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.The United States views China’s tech firms as a security risk and has moved to cut off its access to advanced chips, including those from Taiwan.How do the armed forces on the two sides compare?Taiwan’s military is well-trained and well-armed, but is dwarfed by China’s People’s Liberation Army, which is adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and advanced missiles in the throes of an impressive modernisation programme.Tsai has made upgrading Taiwan’s military a priority, stressing “asymmetric warfare”, to make any attack as painful and as difficult for China as possible. This could include, for example, pinpoint strikes by long-range missiles on targets in China.What would happen in a war between Taiwan and China?While China could easily overwhelm Taiwan with missiles and air attacks, it has other options to bring the island to its knees, such as cyberattacks to take down basic infrastructure, or a naval blockade to force surrender.Whatever happens, the reaction of the United States will be crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-is-taiwan-china-tension-rising-and-what-are-the-risks/story-13ts1V9LoOHNinEeBxteyJ.html

It also reported two deaths due to the virus.“This is not just a good day. This is a great day,” Andrews told reporters in the Victorian capital, Melbourne.But the premier said his government would not accelerate a timetable for easing restrictions, which were imposed after daily case numbers topped 700 in early August.“The formal position is clear,” Andrews said.“If circumstances change, if we find ourselves ahead of schedule, not for one day, but in a manifest sense, common sense always guides us,” he added.Melbourne has been under one of the toughest lockdowns, including nightly curfews, but the state government has said it will let construction sites, manufacturing plants, warehouses and childcare facilities in the capital reopen on Sept. 28 if the average number of cases over two weeks is below 50.The average in Melbourne is now below 35.The bulk of all restrictions in Victoria will be lifted in late October if the two-week average for the state is below 5, a target that has been criticised by Prime Minister Scott Morrison as too punitive and costly to the country’s economy.Australia has recorded its first recession in 30 years, while effective unemployment is still to top 13%, as virus-related restrictions paralysed business activity.The restrictions in Victoria, the epicentre of Australia’s Covid-19 outbreak, have however prevented a second wave of infections in the country.Australia has reported nearly 27,000 cases, 75% of which have been in Victoria, and 851 deaths due to the virus. Nearly 90% of all Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Victoria.New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, reported four new cases in the past 24 hours, though three of them were already in hotel quarantine after returning from overseas.Queensland state also reported one new infection in its hotel quarantine system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-covid-19-hotspot-reports-lowest-daily-rise-in-infections-since-june/story-ZBbDcpGLB7tomGHxxw0I8K.html

Abe stepped down due to ill health after nearly eight years in office.“I told him that the Japan-US alliance is the foundation of regional peace and stability, and we agreed to continue to coordinate closely,” Suga told reporters late Sunday night after the call with Trump.Suga said Trump also said he wanted to further develop the alliance together.Suga said the two leaders agreed to cooperate in the fight against the coronavirus and on North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats.Japan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement early Monday that the during their 25-minute call the two leaders also pledged cooperation in the development of the coronavirus vaccines and treatment, as well as regional security concerns.Known for his political prowess on domestic issues, Suga has hardly travelled overseas and his diplomatic skills are largely unknown, though he is expected to pursue Abe’s priorities.Suga inherits a range of international challenges, including balancing relations with China in the face of an ongoing US-China dispute over trade and other issues.Suga said Trump told him he can call him any time if something happened.“Now I’ve gained confidence,” he said, adding that he hoped to hold phone talks with other global leaders to explain Japan’s stance and deepen mutual understanding and cooperation.Suga also held talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier on Sunday and agreed to continue cooperating between the countries, the foreign ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-japan-prime-minister-suga-holds-first-talks-with-us-president-donald-trump/story-DwpoIH8Rgc3bHwr1y1vO3O.html
21-09-2020||World||Bahrain says it broke up militant attack plot by Iran in early 2020||Bahrain said on Monday that it broke up a plot by militants backed by Iran earlier this year to launch attacks on diplomats and foreigners in the island nation home to the US Navy’s 5th Fleet.The announcement came hours after Saudi state television and a Bahraini local newspaper implied the plot was new in their reporting Sunday night, just days after the island kingdom normalised relations with Israel. Bahraini government officials, who routinely claim breaking up plots by militants backed by Iran, did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press over the confusion.The details of the plot became public as tensions between Iran and the US remain high after the Trump administration claimed to have re-invoked all United Nations sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme — something disputed by other world powers. The militants reportedly sought revenge for the US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in January, something long threatened by his colleagues in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.Iran’s mission to the UN dismissed Bahrain’s claim of Tehran being involved as just “another instance in a long line of preposterous and false allegations, with no basis in truth.” “It appears there is no limit to Iran-bashing by the US and its client states in the region, who are trying to divert attention from their recent betrayal to Palestinians and their own people,” mission spokesman Alireza Miryousefi told the AP.The Saudi state TV report aired previously unseen footage of what appeared to be police raiding a home with a hidden passage. The footage showed assault rifles and explosives, apparently seized in the raid.Nine militants have been arrested, while another nine are believed to be in Iran, the Saudi state TV report said.Authorities uncovered the plot after finding an explosive on the street believed to have been planted to target a “foreign delegation,” the pro-government Bahraini newspaper Akhbar Al-Khaleej reported, citing the Interior Ministry. The ministry accused the Guard of supporting the militants, who also had surveilled oil sites and military bases, the newspaper said. The militants also planned on assassinating bodyguards of Bahraini officials, the newspaper said.It wasn’t clear when all the arrests and alleged plots took place, as the Akhbar Al-Khaleej report referred to incidents dating as far back as 2017. The newspaper linked the militants to the al-Ashtar Brigade, a Shiite group that has claimed responsibility for a number of bombings and attacks in Bahrain, including two that killed police. The group has been sanctioned by the US.Bahrain’s Interior Ministry later published what it described as a “clarification” saying the cases dated to the start of the year and “is not new”. However, media is tightly controlled on the island and access to such trials is routinely limited, suggesting authorities at the least encouraged the initial reporting.Bahrain is home to the 5th Fleet, which patrols the waterways of the Mideast. Officials have worried in the past that the sailors and Marines attached to the base in Manama could be targeted, as well as others who make up the 7,000 American troops there. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the 5th Fleet, declined to comment and referred questions to the Bahraini government.Bahrain, an island off the coast of Saudi Arabia, just last week normalised relations with Israel alongside the United Arab Emirates, in part over their joint suspicion of Iran. The UAE has said their move also pushed Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians. Civil society groups in Bahrain have opposed the normalisation decision.Israel’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the reported arrests in Bahrain.Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had pushed to take over Bahrain after the British left the country, although Bahrainis in 1970 overwhelmingly supported becoming an independent nation and the UN Security Council unanimously backed that. Since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Bahrain’s rulers have blamed Iran for arming militants on the island. Iran denies the accusations.Bahrain’s Shiite majority long has accused its Sunni rulers of treating them like second-class citizens. They joined pro-democracy activists in demanding more political freedoms in 2011, as Arab Spring protests swept the wider Middle East. Saudi and Emirati troops ultimately helped violently put down the demonstrations.Bahrain promised change after the protests. But in recent years, Bahrain has cracked down on all dissent, imprisoned activists and hampered independent reporting on the island. Militant groups like the al-Ashtar Brigade have launched small, sporadic attacks amid that crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-says-it-broke-up-militant-attack-plot-in-early-2020/story-IIG7TDMUnHkebsdJ1qEzrL.html
21-09-2020||World||Thailand protests: Plaque, placed by demonstrators challenging monarchy, removed||A plaque placed by Thai pro-democracy protesters near the Grand Palace in Bangkok that declared that Thailand belongs to the people and not the king has been removed, as police warned on Monday they may charge those behind the symbolic gesture. The plaque was placed on Sunday after a rally by tens of thousands of people who cheered calls for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.“I’ve received a report that the plaque is gone but I don’t know how and I don’t know who did it,” Bangkok’s deputy police chief Piya Tawichai told Reuters.“Police are checking with the BMA (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration) and checking who took it out as the plaque is part of the evidence to charge the protest group (for this wrongdoing),” Piya said.At the biggest demonstration in Thailand in years, protesters cheered calls for reform of the monarchy as well as for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution and elections.After the protest, people queued up to take pictures next to the plaque, which also features a hand giving the three-finger salute adopted by pro-democracy protesters.But far from all Thais support the new plaque, which resembles one that had commemorated the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 and which was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017, after Vajiralongkorn took the throne.Prominent right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom said on Sunday the plaque was inappropriate and the king was above politics.“It didn’t achieve anything,” he told Reuters. “These actions are symbolically against the king, but the king is not an opponent.”Craig Kunakorn, 33, a barber who had been at the protests came to visit the spot where the plaque had been cemented into the ground on Monday.“Everyone knew it would disappear soon but the success of creating it is something that will continue. It is still an important symbol,” Craig said.Anon Nampa, an activist and human rights lawyer, told Reuters the plaque should be returned to the people.“We will go and file a complaint to police today to find that plaque which is the people’s property and who took it,” said Anon, one of the leading figures in the loosely organised protest movement.Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailand’s palace and military-dominated establishment, breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy - which is illegal under lese majeste laws. The demonstrators say the constitution gives the king too much power and that it was engineered to allow Prayuth to keep power after elections last year. He says that vote was fair.The next protest is scheduled for Thursday. Protest leaders also called on Thais to take Oct. 14 off work to show their support for change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-protests-plaque-placed-by-demonstrators-challenging-monarchy-removed/story-RFKnFxJvYkh9qnsVFrxbLP.html

21-09-2020||World||Iran dismisses US efforts for UN sanctions as currency drops||Iran’s president dismissed US efforts to restore all UN sanctions on the country as mounting economic pressure from Washington pushed the local currency down to its lowest level ever on Sunday.Iran’s currency dropped to 272,500 to the US dollar at money exchange shops across Tehran.The rial has lost more than 30 per cent of its value to the dollar since June as sweeping US sanctions on Iran continue to crush its ability to sell oil globally.Iran’s currency was at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which was signed by the Obama administration but which the Trump administration pulled the US out of.Also read: US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushbackAs the currency plummeted, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani slammed the Trump administration’s declaration Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been reimposed because Tehran is not complying with the nuclear deal.“If America uses its bullying ... and does something in practice, it will have to face our decisive response,” Rouhani said in a Cabinet meeting Sunday.Rouhani said that, if the deal’s remaining signatories fully carry out their obligations under the agreement, Iran will walk back its steps away from the deal.For Iran, being able to sell oil remains its most important concern.The US move to reimpose sanctions has been rejected as illegal by most of the rest of the world and sets the stage for an ugly showdown at the world body ahead of its annual General Assembly this week.Even before the US declaration, other Security Council members had vowed to ignore it.They say the US lost legal standing to invoke snapback sanctions when President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and began reimposing US sanctions on Iran.France, Germany and Britain issued a joint statement Sunday reiterating that they contest the legal basis of the Trump administration’s bid to activate the “snapback” sanctions mechanism because the United States withdrew from the nuclear accord.The statement said “it follows that any decision or action taken on the basis of this procedure ... are without effect in law.” The three countries stressed they remain determined to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran.Also read: France, UK, Germany reject US call to return Iran sanctionsIsraeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi on Sunday welcomed the US sanctions efforts.He called on France, Britain and Germany to withdraw their opposition and support a “rigorous implementation of the sanctions.” Israel views Iran as its greatest threat, and has hailed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions.Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the snapback sanctions have only happened in “the fantastical world” of the Trump administration. He said the US stands on the wrong side of history.“They are attempting to make everyone believe it, but nobody is buying it except for themselves,” Khatibzadeh said during his weekly press briefing on Sunday.“It is a television show whose sole presenter, viewers and those cheering it on are Mr. Pompeo himself and a handful of others,” the spokesman said, referring to the US secretary of state.The White House plans to issue an executive order on Monday spelling out how the US will enforce the restored sanctions, and the State and Treasury departments are expected to outline how foreign individuals and businesses will be penalized for violations.Tensions are running high between Iran and the US, particularly since a US strike in January killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, prompting Tehran to retaliate with a ballistic missile strike on Iraqi bases housing American troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-dismisses-us-efforts-for-un-sanctions-as-currency-drops/story-OrsIEP9vt2El138BQNKdNL.html
21-09-2020||World||‘FinCEN’ documents reportedly show banks moved illicit funds: Report||Several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two decades, despite red flags about the origins of the money, BuzzFeed and other media reported on Sunday, citing confidential documents submitted by banks to the US government. The media reports were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the US Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen). The SARs, which the reports said numbered more than 2,100, were obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and other media organizations. In all, the ICIJ reported that the files contained information about more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, which were flagged by internal compliance departments of financial institutions as suspicious. The SARs are in themselves not necessarily proof of wrongdoing, and the ICIJ reported the leaked documents were a tiny fraction of the reports filed with FinCEN. Five global banks appeared most often in the documents — HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the ICIJ reported. The SARs provide key intelligence in global efforts to stop money laundering and other crimes. The media reports on Sunday painted a picture of a system that is both under-resourced and overwhelmed, allowing vast amounts of illicit funds to move through the banking system. A bank has a maximum of 60 days to file SARs after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction, according to the Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The ICIJ report said in some cases the banks failed to report suspect transactions until years after they had processed them. The SARs also showed that banks often moved funds for companies that were registered in offshore havens, such as the British Virgin Islands, and did not know the ultimate owner of the account, the report said. Staff at major banks often used Google searches to learn who was behind large transactions, it said.Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank. “I hope these findings spur urgent action from policymakers to enact needed reforms,” said Tim Adams, chief executive of the trade group Institute of International Finance, in a statement. “As noted in today’s reports, the impacts of financial crime are felt beyond just the financial sector – it poses grave threats to society as a whole.”In a statement to Reuters, HSBC said “all of the information provided by the ICIJ is historical.” The bank said as of 2012, “HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.”Standard Chartered said in a statement to Reuters, “We take our responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously and have invested substantially in our compliance programmes.” BNY Mellon told Reuters it could not comment on specific SARs. “We fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and assist authorities in the important work they do,” the bank said. JPMorgan said it has “thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to this important work.” “We have played a leadership role in anti-money laundering reform,” the bank said in a statement.In a statement on Sunday, Deutsche Bank said the ICIJ had “reported on a number of historic issues.” “We have devoted significant resources to strengthening our controls and we are very focused on meeting our responsibilities and obligations,” the bank said.FinCen said in a statement on its website on Sept. 1 that it was aware that various media outlets intended to publish a series of articles based on unlawfully disclosed SARs, as well as other documents, and said that the “unauthorized disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States.” Representatives for the US Treasury declined comment beyond the FinCen statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fincen-documents-reportedly-show-banks-moved-illicit-funds-report/story-pjVsNk1sATXIULiJA8WcWM.html
21-09-2020||World||Don’t jam through Ginsburg nominee: Joe Biden to GOP senators||Joe Biden on Sunday slammed President Donald Trump and leading Senate Republicans for trying to jam through a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and urged more senators to stand with a pair of GOP colleagues who oppose the election-season rush.The extraordinary televised plea from the Democratic presidential candidate to Republican senators reflected the ferocious maneuvering that has followed Ginsburg’s death at 87 on Friday. Her passing upended a campaign that had, until then, focused on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the nation’s economic collapse and racial unrest that has stoked protests in US cities.Trump has said he intends within days to name a woman to succeed the liberal icon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was moving toward the first hearings this week.Just hours before Biden spoke, a second Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in opposing efforts to fill Ginsburg’s seat before the next president is elected.It takes four Republicans to break ranks to keep Trump’s nominee off the court. Attention quickly focused on Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who voted to convict Trump on one count of impeachment, and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Also read: How Ginsburg’s death could reshape the presidential campaignBiden acknowledged that those Republicans and others like them were his target audience when he warned that Trump’s plan was an “abuse of power.”“Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience,” said Biden, speaking in battleground Pennsylvania. “Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have engulfed our country.”There was little chance of calm overtaking the historic campaign as early voting progressed and the death toll from the virus reached 200,000 Americans.Just before Murkowski joined Collins, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to the House having “options” she did not name to stall or prevent the Senate from confirming Ginsburg’s successor to the lifetime job.“We have arrows in our quiver that I’m not about to discuss right now,” Pelosi said on ABC’s “This Week.” The House has no formal role in the confirmation of Supreme Court justices. But Pelosi would not rule out a new round of impeachment proceedings that might divert the Senate’s attention, though that route seemed unlikely.Meanwhile, Murkowski raised by one the number of Republicans opposing a rush to confirmation.“For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up” a potential nomination as the presidential election neared. “Sadly,” she said, “what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed.”Collins, meanwhile, said the next president should name Ginsburg’s replacement.Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the Senate. If there were a 50-50 tie, it could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence.There is another potential wrinkle: Because Arizona’s Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30, which would narrow the window for McConnell if Democrat Mark Kelly wins.Trump has said he is obligated to act as soon as possible and had at least two women in mind for the seat. Most Republicans concurred on the need for speed and one named a practical reason: The nine-member court, argued Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, must be full if called upon to decide the outcome of a disputed presidential election.But Biden and other Democrats said voters should choose the next president, who should pick Ginsburg’s successor. Health care, abortion rights and religious freedom are on the line, they said.Biden, who has run on uniting the country after Trump’s divisive tenure and imparting a sense of comfort to despairing Americans, warned against more upheaval.“The last thing we need is a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss and deeper into the darkness,” he said. He acknowledged that if Trump wins, his pick should be approved.But he added, “If I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn and as the new president I should be the one to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor.”Nonetheless, the process for replacing her moved swiftly ahead. On a call with McConnell, R-Ky., late Saturday, Trump mentioned two federal appeals court judges: Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa, according to a person familiar with the private conversation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the call and spoke on condition of anonymity.To the chants of “Fill that seat,” Trump told supporters at an event Saturday night in North Carolina that he would nominate a woman as soon as this week.“We win an election and those are the consequences,” said Trump, who then seemed to signal that he’d be willing to accept a vote on his nominee during the lame-duck period after the election. “We have a lot of time. We have plenty of time. We’re talking about January 20th” — when the next president is inaugurated.Democrats have denounced McConnell’s move to push ahead as hypocritical, pointing out that he refused to call hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, 237 days before the 2016 election.If the court were to take cases with eight justices, 4-4 ties would revert the decision to a lower court; for instance, the Affordable Care Act could then be struck down by a lower Texas court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-jam-through-ginsburg-nominee-joe-biden-to-gop-senators/story-nQipakphrRp9pvs3RncAaM.html
21-09-2020||World||Donald Trump to nominate female judge to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg||President Donald Trump has said he intends to name a woman as his nominee to replace late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and will make an announcement next week.“It will be a woman — a very talented, very brilliant woman,” Trump said at an election rally in North Carolina on Saturday. “We haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list.”The president first spoke of picking a woman for the seat left vacant by the passing of Ginsburg while talking to reporters before departing for the rally. Asked if he would pick a woman, he said he could. “I could see, most likely, it would be a woman, yeah. I think I can say that it would be a woman. I would - if somebody were to ask me now, I would say that a woman would be in first place, yes.” He also said in a response to another question he expects to announce his pick next week .Female judges reportedly in his shortlist include Amy Coney Barrett, a judge on the Seventh Court of Appeals (similar to Indian high courts). He had interviewed her in 2018 when considering a nominee to replace Stephen Kennedy. He went with Brett Kavanaugh instead.Whoever Trump picks eventually will face a bruising confirmation process in the Senate, with fierce opposition expected from Democrats. They want the seat to be filled by the next president, whoever wins the November 3 elections, as Republicans had argued in 2016 to block President Barack Obama’s pick for a vacancy in the court.With Trump announcing he will pick a woman, chances have diminished for Amul Thapar, an Indian-American judge who was earlier reported to be among front-runners for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-nominate-female-judge-to-replace-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg/story-AZka4WMpL0VVNMiCyYAr7H.html
21-09-2020||World||US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushback||The US said international sanctions on Iran are automatically “snapping back,” in a move that most nations say the Trump administration doesn’t have the authority to demand since quitting a 2015 nuclear deal two years ago.“Sanctions are being re-imposed on Iran,” secretary of state Michael Pompeo said in a statement late on Saturday. “The United States expects all UN member states to fully comply with their obligations to implement these measures.”That’s unlikely to happen, with key European powers on Sunday stressing their commitment to the nuclear agreement.Their support for the deal has left the US isolated on the United Nations Security Council, and most nations say America has no authority to demand the return of international sanctions, since it’s no longer a party to the deal.“We have worked tirelessly to preserve the nuclear agreement and remain committed to do so,” the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK said in a statement on Sunday. The accord is “a key pillar of the global non-proliferation architecture,” Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said in a separate statement, adding that all parties should “do their utmost to preserve the agreement.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, at a cabinet meeting on Sunday shown on state television news, called the US move a sign of “certain failure” which only demonstrates that President Donald Trump’s strategy has resulted in “maximum isolation” for Washington. On Saturday, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that Iran would set Washington’s military outposts in the Persian Gulf “on fire at once” if its adversary tried to start a war.The US on Monday will sanction more than two dozen people and entities involved in Iran’s nuclear, missile and conventional arms programmes, a senior US official told Reuters, putting teeth behind UN sanctions that Washington argues have resumed.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide detailed evidence regarding either assertion.A major part of the new US push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms and will also be unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-move-on-un-iran-sanctions-faces-pushback/story-oRuEVL1Ewgj7DOekFrOKTJ.html
21-09-2020||World||Hackers leak personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police on weekend of protests||Anonymous hackers leaked the personal data of 1,000 Belarusian police officers in retaliation for a crackdown on street demonstrations against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko, as protesters geared up for another mass rally on Sunday.“As the arrests continue, we will continue to publish data on a massive scale,” said a statement that was distributed by the opposition news channel Nexta Live on the messaging app Telegram. “No one will remain anonymous even under a balaclava.”The government said it would find and punish those responsible for leaking the data, which was widely distributed on Telegram channels on Saturday evening. “The forces, means and technologies at the disposal of the internal affairs bodies make it possible to identify and prosecute the overwhelming majority of those guilty of leaking personal data on the Internet,” said Olga Chemodanova, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.The loyalty of the security forces is crucial to Lukashenko’s ability to cling on to power following last month’s presidential election, in which he claimed a landslide victory but his opponents say was rigged to hand the former Soviet collective farm boss a sixth term. Security forces have detained thousands of people to tackle a wave of protests and strikes, their faces often obscured by masks, balaclavas or riot helmets. Some protesters have physically torn off the masks of some officers.The government said 390 women were detained for taking part in a protest on Saturday against Lukashenko. Most have been released. Lukashenko’s crackdown on the protests has prompted the European Union to weigh fresh sanctions against his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-leak-personal-data-of-1-000-belarusian-police-on-weekend-of-protests/story-SW0dgSwoUr8uG1TX8ClFOK.html
21-09-2020||World||UK curb flouters face fines of $13k||From September 28, those who violate Covid-19 restrictions in the UK will face fines of up to £10,000 (nearly $13,000), as health secretary Matt Hancock said the country is at a “tipping point” with cases rising exponentially.The country reported a further 4,422 new cases on Saturday, the biggest daily increase since early May. Hancock told TV channels on Sunday: “This country faces a tipping point. We face a choice. If everybody follows the rules ...then we can avoid further national lockdowns”. “But we of course have to be prepared to take action if that is what is necessary. I don’t rule it out; I don’t want to see it.” The fines for those breaching self-isolation rules will start at £1,000 (nearly $1,300), but could increase to up to £10,000 for repeat offences and for the most egregious breaches, including for those preventing others from self-isolating. Russia reported 6,148 cases of Covid-19 in the past day, the most new cases registered in two months. The number of new infections is up 30% since September 1, when schools opened. France’s daily coronavirus cases surged to the highest since the national lockdown ended in May. Another 13,498 cases were reported on Saturday, the second straight day over 13,000.To the alarm of experts, Italians headed to the polls for a referendum and regional elections. Just a week after a Herculean effort by schools to reopen in line with last-minute Covid-19 rules, classrooms across the country were shut to pupils and transformed into ballot stations.In Spain, nearly a million Madrid residents went into a partial lockdown from Sunday. Meanwhile global fatalities neared 1 million, and deaths in the US, the worst-hit country, moved closer to 200,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-curb-flouters-face-fines-of-13k/story-y62jhi3DtT7tx9inlKmhUN.html
21-09-2020||India||13 die in building collapse||Thirteen people, including six children, were killed, while 22 were injured and 27 still trapped under the debris after a portion of a 36-year-old ground-plus-three storey residential building collapsed in Bhiwandi, around 35km from Mumbai, at around 3.30am on Monday, officials said.Though the cause of the accident was immediately not clear, however, Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) commissioner Pankaj Ashiya said the Jilani building in Dhamankar Naka was illegal and notices had been sent to residents to vacate.At the time of going to press, rescue operations were still going on.According to the BNCMC, 24 of the total 48 flats of the building collapsed, while the portion that did not collapse had a power loom on the ground floor. The injured were rushed to the Indira Gandhi Memorial (IGM) hospital. A seven-year- old boy, Ayaan Shaikh Ibrahim, who was trapped for nine hours along with his family of five, escaped with no injuries.Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) regional disaster management cell, the fire brigade and the disaster cell of BNCMC were part of the rescue operations, along with locals.“As soon as the incident took place, residents living near the area rushed to the spot and started pulling people from under the rubble. It was painful to hear people calling out for help. My relatives lived in this building,” said Khalid Abdullah Khan, 28, who lived in the building one year ago but has now shifted to another building nearby.Before the NDRF team reached the spot, 21 people were rescued by locals and the Bhiwandi and Thane rescue teams. Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant of NDRF, said, “Since the incident took place at a time when most residents were asleep, we emphasised on searching bedrooms and living rooms. There was also a fear that the remaining portion of the building might collapse as it was also tilting. We focused on canine search operations as we could not use equipment, fearing vibrations that could lead to collapse of the remaining portion.” As a precautionary measure, power supply to the area has been snapped.“As soon as the incident took place, I received a call and alerted the fire brigade team to reach the spot. Around 5.30am, the NDRF team took over rescue operations and managed to pull out residents from under the debris,” said Ashiya.Ashiya claimed that the building was built in 1984 during the Gram Panchayat rule and hence it is an illegal structure. “The building is illegal and also very old and we have served notices to the residents and owner to vacate it. If any sort of negligence has led to the incident, legal action will be taken,” he added.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray postponed e-opening of the Mankoli flyover in suburban Mumbai on Monday after receiving the news of the incident.Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as President Ram Nath Kovind offered their condolences to the bereaved families.“Saddened by the building collapse in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra. Condolences to the bereaved families. Praying for a quick recovery of those injured. Rescue operations are underway and all possible assistance is being provided to the affected,” PM Modi tweeted.In a statement issued by the Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde, a compensation of Rs5 lakhs will be given to the victim’s kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-die-in-building-collapse/story-QKHc3v3Ak65yo42W2mEZ7J.html

The differences --- rare in the army’s top echelons --- between the head of the Jaipur-based South Western Command and his chief of staff relate to roles and responsibilities of various offices in the command headquarters, the officials said, without elaborating on the exact nature of the ongoing tussle between the two lieutenant generals. There was no official word from the army on the development. The South Western Command is headed by Lieutenant General Alok Kler, an armoured corps officer, and his second-in-command is Lieutenant General KK Repswal, who is from the Corps of Engineers. After receiving representations from both the three-star officers, Naravane nominated the army’s vice chief Lieutenant General SK Saini to look into the matter and submit a detailed report with measures to streamline the functioning of the command headquarters, the officials said. “Differences of opinion at that level can hinder day-to-day functioning and decision making. The fact-finding mission will hopefully resolve the matter,” the officials said. The South Western Command has around 130,000 soldiers and is responsible for guarding India’s border with Pakistan in Rajasthan and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-rift-appears-between-top-echelon-army-chief-appoints-a-mediator/story-skDVoiGII5bl2bWIuBkxpN.html

To be clear, as per the new tender only companies registered in India can apply.Railways had last month cancelled its global tender issued for manufacturing 44 sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains, after a Chinese joint venture company CRRC Pioneer Electric (India) Private Limited emerged as the only foreign bidder. According to officials aware of development, the tender is estimated to cost around Rs 2,000 crore.“The revised tender is In line with Government of India’s preference for Make In India policy, the minimum local content percentage has been revised to 75%. It is the first big tender under revised DPIIT norms of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Having atleast 75 % domestic components. This tender is now a domestic tender. It shall be local (indigenous) tender in which a two stage, reverse auction shall take place,” the ministry spokesperson said.The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) had revised public procurement order issued on June 4 to encourage domestic manufacturing. The tender is scheduled to open on November 17. A pre-bidding conference for the tender will take place on September 29, the ministry said.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves the manufacturing of 44 train sets comprising 16 coaches each for Vande Bharat.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi-Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-new-tender-for-vande-bharat-trains-centre-wants-more-local-parts/story-drG5psLlNS5vNoexNUIutJ.html
21-09-2020||India||New form of globalisation a must post-Covid: Shringla||India believes multilateralism must be rules-based and reformed to accommodate current realities even as it works on a new form of globalisation based on fairness and equality in the post-Covid-19 world, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday. The pandemic has disrupted the world order that has been in existence for long, and shaping and reforming this system has been a major foreign policy priority, he said in his virtual address at the inaugural session of a course on “India and the reshaping of the world order” at his alma mater, St Stephen’s College. “Multilateral diplomacy has to be based on rules. We are committed to an international order based on rules,” he said. “We also believe that the content of globalisation needs to change. We believe that multilateralism must be reformed to accommodate current trends and realities.” Referring to the prime minister’s call for human-centric globalisation that transcends a purely economic agenda, he added: “We would like a new form of globalization, based on fairness, equality and humanity in the post-Covid world.” One of India’s priorities in the post-pandemic era is to make the country the nerve centre of global supply chains in line with the prime minister’s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India), Shringla said. “We are actively engaged in promoting India as an alternative manufacturing hub and an innovation destination,” he added. Though crises such as the pandemic alter geopolitics, the fundamental orientation of India’s policy remains “neighbourhood first” and initiatives such as Bimstec link this policy to another fundamental pillar, “Act East”, he said. Bimstec is short for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic CooperationThink West, India’s outreach to the Gulf and West Asian countries, has also become an increasingly important pillar of foreign policy, and India has outlined a vision for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes and international rules, he said. All decision-making is done in a highly complex multi-layered and multi-dimensional operating environment and the “business of statecraft is not one of binaries”, Shringla said. Amid the pandemic, India tried to act as a “pharmacy of the world” and provided medicines and essential medical supplies to more than 150 countries and sent rapid response medical teams to Kuwait, the Maldives, Mauritius and Comoros. India also “went out of its way to be a net provider of security”, Shringla said. Looking to the future, which he described as uncertain, Shringla said India needs to be “prepared to continuously adapt and innovate”, build resilience and capacity, and be agile and flexible in international diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-form-of-globalisation-a-must-post-covid-shringla/story-44a5Cejpsa5gOUh74u8iXP.html
21-09-2020||India||SC fixes Oct 31 deadline for Amrapali defaulters to pay up or lose allotment||The Supreme Court on Monday fixed a deadline of October 31 for all dubious flat owners in Amrapali housing projects to clear their outstanding dues or face cancellation of allotment. These defaulters were identified during the forensic audit exercise carried out at the instance of the apex court prior to its judgment of July 23, 2019 which cancelled Amrapali’s registration under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act.The bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan said, “All defaulting homebuyers as identified by the forensic auditors must pay their outstanding dues before October 31, failing which the Court Receiver shall be entitled to take steps for cancellation of allotment.”The order came on a note submitted by the Receiver, senior advocate R Venkatramani who gave a slew of recommendations as part of efforts to implement the July 23 order and expedite completion of the Amrapali housing projects.Advocate ML Lahoty appearing for the group of homebuyers told HT, “These are not the genuine homebuyers who have defaulted on payments of installments to Amrapali. The forensic auditors had identified 5,856 flats that were undervalued and sold by Amrapali directors at unusually low prices. The auditors had demanded recovery of Rs 321.31 crore from these flat owners based on the prevailing market rates.”Venkatramani in his note further indicated to the Court that an action plan is being worked out with MSTC Limited on the auction of Amrapali properties. “Five properties have been identified which could fetch close to Rs 12 crore,” Venkatramani said, adding that all luxury cars out of the 85 cars recovered from Amrapali Group and its Directors have already been sold.As regards SBI Capital Market Ventures (SBI CAP) which had agreed to finance six Amrapali projects, the Receiver informed the Court that talks were on with SBI CAP on formalizing the modalities of disbursing the fund through a special purpose vehicle. In addition, Venkatramani pointed out that he was in talks with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on getting a consortium of banks to agree on putting in funds into the Amrapali projects against the security of unsold flats inventory of Amrapali. The SC judgment of July 23 recorded the total unsold inventory to be worth Rs 1,958 crore spread over 5,229 flats.“There is no impediment from our part.” RBI counsel Ramesh Babu informed the Court, Venkatramani informed the Court that he had written twice to the RBI but is yet to hear this statement which has held up talks with individual banks, which have claimed that unless RBI gives a go-ahead, it will be difficult for banks to step in. The bench asked RBI to file an affidavit in this regard by October 5, the next date of hearing.The Receiver in his note also pointed out that certain distressed homebuyers who wish to sell or dispose their property prior to registration of flat should be allowed to do so as this was permissible under the arrangement with their erstwhile builder Amrapali. The Noida and Greater Noida authority opposed this request on the ground that prior to registration, there is no title that can be transferred. But the bench went with the Receiver’s suggestion and allowed “pre-registration transfer”.The Court further asked the Receiver to go through a note prepared by advocate ML Lahoty appearing for homebuyers on pending recovery of money from persons who directly or indirectly siphoned homebuyers’ money from Amrapali group.The note by Lahoty said, “The project consultant NBCC requires an amount of Rs 8,016.88 crores to complete the 46,459 units, out of which Rs 3,870.38 crore is only the dues of the homebuyers. The remaining amount of Rs 4,146.5 crore is to be recovered from various other sources.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-fixes-oct-31-deadline-for-amrapali-defaulters-to-pay-up-or-lose-allotment/story-Vtw2yZhWRwxlcgyZhhPRCP.html

The draw was held on Sunday evening and he came to know about it in the night.“When I got a call I thought somebody was playing a prank with me. But when I checked the news I couldn’t believe it. On Sunday morning I had shared a joke with my friends saying the Onam bumper will change my fate. It proved right,” he said. Living with his parents and sister in a remote area in Idukki district he said he hit the jackpot at the right time. His sister, who was working as an accounting assistant, had lost her job during the Covid-19 pandemic and his father who is a painter, was also without any work for the last few months.“My first priority is to shift from the present area and buy a small house somewhere near Ernakulam. I will start some small-time business with my father,” said Vijayan. He said he used to buy lottery tickets regularly and he once won Rs 5,000. One ticket of the Onam bumper was priced at Rs 300. The second prize of Rs one crore, was pocketed by six women, who pooled in Rs 100 each to buy two tickets. All are workers of a self-help group. Lottery and liquor are the main revenue earners of the state. Almost every day there is a lottery (usual price is Rs 40) and there are 35,000 agents and 1.5 lakh retail sellers in the state. The annual revenue from the sale of tickets is between Rs 10,000 core to 12,000 crore. The lottery sale was suspended for three months due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-yr-old-temple-employee-in-kerala-wins-rs-12-cr-onam-lottery-jackpot/story-JrofZTin9PFewDMHvFbLjI.html

Both of them had been arrested in the ongoing investigations into the Bengaluru drug racket after their residences were raided.While Ragini was arrested on September 4, Sanjjanaa was detained on September 8. Both of them are currently in the Parpanna Agrahara jail on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Even as the lawyers of the accused argued that no drugs and no evidence have been found by the police till now, the prosecution said that investigations were ongoing and they should not be given bail as it could lead to destruction of evidence. Accordingly, the court postponed their bail plea to Thursday.The actors have been arrested along with seven others following a FIR registered in the Cottonpet police station under various sections of CrPC and NDPS acts dealing with illegal drug possession, consumption and dealing. Several other well known Kannada movie personalities, including star couple Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray, anchor Akul Balaji and actor Arryan Santosh have been called in for questioning till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-drug-probe-court-postpones-bail-plea-of-actors-to-september-24/story-B99cZnd11PIEcv4fxoG31I.html

21-09-2020||India||Indian, Chinese generals meet in eastern Ladakh to break logjam in border talks||Senior military commanders from India and China on Monday met in the eastern Ladakh sector in their latest attempt to break the logjam in talks to reduce tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with a joint secretary from the Indian external affairs ministry taking part in the military dialogue for the first time, officials familiar with the developments said. The military dialogue started at 9 am at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC in the Chushul sector and was on when this report was filed. The outcome of the talks was not immediately known. Two Indian lieutenant generals were among the officers who took part in the talks --- Harinder Singh, who heads the Leh-based 14 Corps and his soon-to-be successor PGK Menon, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Menon is tipped to replace Singh in Leh after the latter completes his one-year term as corps commander next month. Menon attended Monday’s talks --- the sixth between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6 --- as a representative of the army headquarters, the officials said. A joint secretary-ranked diplomat was roped in for the dialogue as a step to ensure that the talks yield some headway, as reported by Hindustan Times on Monday. The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs --- the diplomatic dialogue between the two countries --- involves a representative of the Indian defence ministry. Military tensions are high in the eastern Ladakh theatre where both armies have made arrangements for holding positions through the winter. Monday’s meeting between the Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers was their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on September 10. The recent developments on both banks of Pangong Tso have increased India’s bargaining power as there will definitely be an element of quid pro quo in the talks, the officials said. A high-powered panel on China reviewed the latest developments in the Ladakh sector last week, focussing on charting the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April on the disputed border. The agenda for Monday’s talks was discussed at the high-level meeting, even as the situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling the country’s borders in the Ladakh sector, signalling a strong resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC. In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching forward areas they could previously patrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-generals-meet-in-eastern-ladakh-to-break-logjam-in-border-talks/story-fOycKeaZElxPcms8qEQGrN.html

21-09-2020||India||UAE arms maker offers to make assault rifles in India||UAE-based weapons manufacturer Caracal, chosen in 2018 to supply nearly 95,000 assault rifles to the Indian Army under a deal that has since stalled, on Monday offered to make the weapons in the country under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. Caracal was chosen by the Indian government to supply 93,895 CAR 816 assault rifles to the army but the deal, described at the time as a “fast track” contract, has stalled after authorities decided to opt for indigenous production of the weapons, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. A statement issued by Caracal on Monday stressed the small arms manufacturer’s “commitment to the ‘Make in India’ initiative and offered transfer of technology to India. “Caracal has already identified the required land, facility and local partners to be able to commence production immediately. Over 20% of the components fitted on the CAR 816 are already made in India, with Caracal now making commitment to fully manufacture the rifles in-country, in alignment with the ‘Make in India’ initiative,” the statement said. “The initiative will also see Caracal oversee technology transfer,” it said, adding that the firm is committed to shift to fully manufacturing in India from the start of the contract, as “opposed to the initial phased approach”. There was no official response from Indian officials to the statement. The people cited above said the matter had been raised by Caracal in a letter sent to India’s defence ministry last month, while the embassy of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had also taken up the issue with Indian authorities. Under its Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative aimed at greater self-reliance, the government had also insisted on the local production of a wide range of weapon and defence equipment. Caranal noted in its statement that it had “surpassed global competitors in terms of performance and technicalities to win the bid two years ago”, and was prepared to “service the fast track order from India within 12 months”. The firm’s CEO, Hamad Al Ameri, said, “Having agreed to fast track the supply, and with the formalities still under discussion, we would like to reiterate our commitment to our bid and to the ‘Make in India’ initiative. “With strong bilateral ties between our two nations, and with India being a key market for Caracal, we remain on standby to supply the product to the customer upon instruction.” The CAR 816 carbines were intended to replace the Indian Army’s ageing 9mm Sterling carbines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-arms-maker-offers-to-make-assault-rifles-in-india/story-h9J6Rgw4TUKalllVn7BJ4J.html

21-09-2020||India||BJP used force to push through farm bills, alleges Mamata Banerjee||The farm bills passed by Parliament on Sunday will trigger a food pandemic in the country and wipe off small and marginal farmers, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged at the state secretariat on Monday afternoon. She accused the ruling BJP at the Centre of using force to push the bills through.“The Centre has bulldozed democracy and the federal structure of the country. Voting was not allowed on the farmers’ bill although the Constitution says that it has to be allowed if someone demands so. But they bulldozed the rights of farmers and passed the bill through voice vote. This must be condemned,” said Banerjee.While the government blamed the Opposition for not seeking a division of votes, a few opposition MPs said they had put forth the demand, but it was not accepted.Amid pandemonium in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday, Parliament passed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. While addressing the media at the secretariat, Banerjee did not specify which of these bills she was referring to but called it “black Sunday.”“A fascist government is controlling our lives,” she quipped. “All powers over land and agricultural produce have been given to landlords and middlemen. In whose interest have so many agricultural products, including onion, been taken out of the list of essential commodities? Farmers will no longer be able to fix the price of their crop. The states can no longer control the price of crops or monitor their supply,” said the chief minister. “A conspiracy is on to take land away from farmers. There is a conspiracy to pass on these lands to landlords. Being in majority does not mean the entire country can be sold. I call all parties to unitedly oppose this. We will stay behind them and support the movement,” said the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) countered Banerjee by calling her “anti-national and anti-farmer.”“The chief minister is a proponent of double standards as far as farmers are concerned. She is opposed to their empowerment. She did not allow the Prime Minister’s Kishan Nidhi Yojna scheme to be implemented in Bengal. It would have benefited farmers,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-used-violence-to-push-through-farm-bills-alleges-mamata-banerjee/story-uTQyhWNqj2b1CMOcIPI1UN.html

There were more than a dozen members in that group. “We have learnt a few more names. Raids are going on to nab them,” said a senior police officer, associated with the developments. Officials also said that most of the members of the messaging platform had come back from Kerala during the Covid-19 pandemic and were residents of Malda and Murshidabad. The six arrested men used to work with them in Kerala. NIA had on Saturday arrested three more men from Kerala. One of the men whose name has cropped up during interrogation was found to be absconding. He was identified as Munna Ansari, a resident of Jalangi in Murshidabad. “After they arrested my brother and he was being taken away I saw the police thrashing him and asking the whereabouts of Munna. My brother kept on telling them that he doesn’t know where Munna stays,” said Isab Ali, brother of Atitur Rehman, one of the arrested men. Jia-ul Mondol, a friend of Ansari, told the media that police may be mistaken as Ansari was known to be a ‘good man’. “I know him (Ansari) very well. He can’t have terrorist links. The police may be mistaken. He has fled because I think he is too frightened after some of his friends were arrested,” said Mondol. The six arrested men are likely to be produced at the Patiala Court in Delhi. Before being taken to Delhi they were all tested for Covid-19. They have all tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-al-qaeda-operatives-spill-more-names-to-nia-investigators/story-JtV72AQP9Y0xL7zEZioxpM.html

The differences --- rare in the army’s top echelons --- between the head of the Jaipur-based South Western Command and his chief of staff relate to roles and responsibilities of various offices in the command headquarters, the officials said, without elaborating on the exact nature of the ongoing tussle between the two lieutenant generals. There was no official word from the army on the development. The South Western Command is headed by Lieutenant General Alok Kler, an armoured corps officer, and his second-in-command is Lieutenant General KK Repswal, who is from the Corps of Engineers. After receiving representations from both the three-star officers, Naravane nominated the army’s vice chief Lieutenant General SK Saini to look into the matter and submit a detailed report with measures to streamline the functioning of the command headquarters, the officials said. “Differences of opinion at that level can hinder day-to-day functioning and decision making. The fact-finding mission will hopefully resolve the matter,” the officials said. The South Western Command has around 130,000 soldiers and is responsible for guarding India’s border with Pakistan in Rajasthan and Punjab. On December 31, 2019, Kler wrote a letter to commanders under him asking them to shun military pageantry, ensure offices shut by 2 pm (the time they are meant to be shut), and encourage professional dissent (as different from insubordination) as they focus on their primary task --- constant readiness for battle. In directions issued to 265 commanders on New Year’s Eve to improve the operational readiness of the South Western Command, he asked them to adopt a nuts-and-bolts approach to soldiering as “it’s not a question of if but when we go to war.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rift-in-top-army-ranks-comes-to-light-gen-naravane-steps-in/story-nUZVp84X2a2Ccw3WZuN7VI.html

21-09-2020||India||‘Crores of farmers will benefit’, tweets PM Modi as govt hikes MSP of wheat, five other rabi crops||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated the farmers over the government’s decision to hike the Minimum Support Price of wheat and five other rabi crops.“It is our great privilege to work for the welfare of our farmers. In line with our ethos of taking farmer-friendly measures, the Cabinet has taken another historic decision to raise MSP. Crores of farmers will benefit from this,” PM Modi said in a tweet.  PM Modi said that the higher MSP will empower farmers and contribute to doubling their income. “Increased MSP, along with the series of agriculture reforms passed by Parliament will ensure dignity and prosperity of farmers. Jai Kisan!” PM Modi said. The prime minister’s tweet comes after the government hiked the minimum support price of wheat by Rs 50 per quintal to Rs 1,975 per quintal to encourage farmers to increase cultivation of the crop.According to the revised price card, lentil has seen the highest increase in MSP at Rs 300 per quintal, followed by gram, rapeseed and mustard at Rs 225 per quintal each, safflower at Rs 112 per quintal. The minimum support price for barley and wheat has been fixed at Rs 75 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal. The hike in MSP comes a day after Parliament approved two agriculture sector-reform bills which have been bitterly opposed by the opposition parties like Congress and TMC as well as from within ruling NDA alliance over apprehension that the new legislations might virtually end MSP-based procurement by the government.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crores-of-farmers-will-benefit-tweets-pm-modi-as-govt-hikes-msp-of-wheat-five-other-rabi-crops/story-tXaAypCHPBIsMlSVPmU9DO.html
21-09-2020||India||Restaurants, bars pin on IPL to bring some cheer!||The commencement of Indian Premium League (IPL), not only brought cheers to cricket fans but added a dash of excitement among restaurants, bars and clubs in the city. Reeling under corona virus fear, cricket lovers and partyholics are taking this as an opportunity for a safe outing. With restaurants now allowed to operate till 11pm and with no weekend lockdown, some food joints and bars are providing IPL offers at their outlets while others are waiting and watching for the season to set in to announce their offers. Club Momentz has placed a big screen on the pool side and is offering discounts on food items and beverages. “IPL viewing on big screen is our biggest attraction. Since opening day of the tournament we have started getting 10-15 table bookings. Our offers on food, drinks, cocktails and mocktail is working well. Besides, we launched ‘sign-your-bottle’ wherein the customer can own a bottle and use it during their next visits,” says Jugal Sachdeva. Food aggregators are also using this opportunity on their apps. By using ‘Cricket’ code people can order dishes on Zomato and ‘Howzzat!’ on Swiggy to get discounts on selected restaurants. At Royal Sky they have already started getting a good footfall during the matches, said the young restaurateur Jatin Ahuja. “As we are slowly recovering from the pandemic crisis, we are very upbeat about IPL this year. Like last year, we have come up with a screen display along with a range of 24x7offers for our clientele like 1-on-1, a free drink and more,” he said. For software professional Abul Hasan it’s a win win situation as a customer, “I love cricket especially 20-20 format. As a ritual I do a watch a match or two at my favourite restaurant on big screen with my friends so this year too we are all game for it. Also offers at the outlets are a bonus for us.” For the ongoing IPL season, The Beer Café Biggie is offering a 20% discount on their food and beverages, informed its operation manager Rishikesh Mishra. RK Jaiswal, owner of Klub Bigg Boss and Suravi Restaurant said, “We are offering buy two and get one on food and drinks. It’s too early to say how it’s shaping up but we hope as the season progresses people may start visiting more. Covid fear is restricting people and if cases go down, I am sure it will pick up,” he said. Traditional clubs are a disappointed lot as they have restricted operation till 9 pm. “Though the bars are allowed to open till 11 pm we have not been allowed to open restaurant beyond 9 pm. So, it’s not feasible to have IPL screening on big screen as it starts at 7.30 pm,” shared Ashok Agarwal, secretary Oudh Gymkhana Club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/restaurants-bars-pin-on-ipl-to-bring-some-cheer/story-c4HqnPy3py5iVyITKUIIII.html

Party spokesman Suhail Bukhari said that in the meeting it was observed that while on one hand, the internal situation of the state is very precarious, the situation along the Line of Control (LOC) and the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is also on the boil. “It was resolved that the party would continue to fight for resolution of the basic issue and advocate dialogue and reconciliation with all the stakeholders, as envisaged in the roadmap of our party which has become even more relevant today than ever before,” the PDP said in a statement.At the meeting, the party observed that post August 5, 2019, a false semblance of normalcy is being created which in fact “resembles the peace of the graveyard”. “People are still shell shocked and unable to come to terms with what has happened. The situation has created a kind of a stalemate where nothing except all kinds of anti-Kashmiri steps like domicile laws etc are being pushed in a hurry,” the statement said.The spokesman said that party leaders demanded the immediate release of all political detainees irrespective of their political ideology, whether lodged in Kashmir or outside.In the meeting leaders also expressed deep anguish over the recent spree of the killing of innocent people from Shopian, Sopore and Battamalloo and demanded that perpetrators be brought to book and families be given justice. On September 16 for the first time after revocation of Article 370, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youth leaders had met to deliberate on several issues at party headquarters in Srinagar. Senior PDP leaders were earlier not allowed to hold meetings at the party office and were not allowed by the police to leave their homes. Currently almost all the PDP leaders other than party president Mehbooba Mufti have been set free. Mufti is still detained under the Public Safety Act. The meetings of the PDP and its youth wing indicate that the government has allowed the party to resume its political activities. The National Conference (NC) has already held a series of meetings in Srinagar and Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdp-senior-leaders-meet-for-first-time-at-srinagar-party-office-in-over-a-year/story-nS2UvH6OKgcfPDoPkgj5LM.html

21-09-2020||India||Lucknow plays the fulcrum in my career, says Anud Singh Dhaka||Actor Anud Singh Dhaka, last seen in OTT series ‘Taj Mahal 1989’, says he is born in Durg, brought up in Bhopal but ‘made in Lucknow’. “Career-wise, all the good things that have happened in life, Lucknow has been the centre-point,” said the actor who is currently shooting for series ‘Jackson’ in the state capital. “In my debut series ‘Taj Mahal’, directed by Pushpendra Nath Misra, I played a Lucknow University student. Then I shot KBC advertisement with the Amitabh Bachchan that was directed by Nitesh Tewari here as he (Big B) was shooting for ‘Gulabo Sitabo’. And now, Saurabh (Tewari, director) sir has cast me for the title role in ‘Jackson’. It feels like a second home,” said Anud feeling nostalgic shooting at LU again.The actor featured in ‘Super 30’ and ‘Chhichhore’. “They were blink and miss roles but the shoot experience taught me a lot. I got a chance to work with such wonderful actors and makers. It was because of ‘Chhichhore’ I got the KBC ad — after the audition of course. I may have a few seconds’ shot but that shoot experience of 25 days with such a wonderful team will be with me forever.” Earlier, his journey started after he got admission in St Xavier’s College, Mumbai. “To learn acting, I started assisting. I was one of the assistant directors in ‘Qarib Qarib Single’. At its premier, Irfaan sir called me and said ‘Meri jaan, tum na idhar ho na udhar ho, tum bas beech main sahi jagah ho…tum bas acting karo’. I was probably waiting for such a push and I started auditioning thereafter.”He also did a small role in the YouTube show ‘Adulting’. “Since I come from an ordinary family, I know that I can’t afford to go wrong. I have to be perfect in auditions, reading and in front of the camera. I know that if I don’t perform or God-forbid my show does not work then no one will give me a second chance,” he said.Anud’s roots are in Uttar Pradesh. “My grandfather’s village is Dhikoli near Meerut and my mother too belongs to Meerut. Basically, we are Western UP ke Jaats but since I grew up in Bhopal, my Hindi is good which gave me an advantage. Thankfully, I got work in Lucknow which helped me further with good scripts and language.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-plays-the-fulcrum-in-my-career-says-anud-singh-dhaka/story-Czl1sYwOaXtxEIvTqIMZgK.html

It also said that killing of civilians in terror-related incidents and deaths of security personnel have also gone down in the same period.In reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said that the government has shown a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism and resorted to strengthening security apparatus. Reddy said that the government has ensured “strict enforcement of law against anti-national elements, and increased cordon and search operations to combat challenges from terrorist organisations”.According to the data shared by the minister, the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir saw 206 incidents of terrorism from August 5 last year (when Article 370 was abrogated) to August 31 this year - in contrast with 443 such incidents recorded from July 2018 to August 2019.During the same period in the last one year, the MHA said 310 stone pelting incidents were recorded, as opposed to 703 such incidents between 2018 and 2019.While civilians killed in terror-related incidents have not seen a significant reduction, the ministry also shared data showing slump in casualties among security forces in terrorist incidents.It said that 49 security personnel were killed in 2019-2020 as opposed to 125 security personnel a year before.Also, in the 2018-2019 period, 54 civilians were killed in Jammu and Kashmir in terrorist incidents. The number came down to 45 in 2019-2020, said the Union minister.Reddy also listed measures taken by the government to bring down incidents of terrorism. “While keeping a close watch on persons who attempt to provide support to terrorists and initiating action against them, other steps by Law enforcing agencies include enhanced interaction between police and public at various levels, sharing of intelligence inputs on real time basis amongst all security forces operating in Jammu and Kashmir, intensified area domination of militancy affected areas by deployment of additional Nakas and patrolling by security forces etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stone-pelting-terror-activities-in-jammu-and-kashmir-reduced-significantly-after-article-370-abrogation-home-ministry/story-venz93dliYYbXG4HLBFuRL.html
21-09-2020||India||‘Committed to global order based on rules in post-Covid-19 world’:Harsh Shringla on foreign policy priorities||India believes multilateralism must be rules-based and reformed to accommodate current realities even as it works on a new form of globalisation based on fairness and equality in the post-Covid-19 world, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday. The pandemic has disrupted the world order that has been in existence for long, and shaping and reforming this system has been a major foreign policy priority, he said in his virtual address at the inaugural session of a course on “India and the reshaping of the world order” at his alma mater, St Stephen’s College. “Multilateral diplomacy has to be based on rules. We are committed to an international order based on rules,” he said. “We also believe that the content of globalisation needs to change. We believe that multilateralism must be reformed to accommodate current trends and realities.” Referring to the prime minister’s call for human-centric globalisation that transcends a purely economic agenda, he added: “We would like a new form of globalization, based on fairness, equality and humanity in the post-Covid world.” One of India’s priorities in the post-pandemic era is to make the country the nerve centre of global supply chains in line with the prime minister’s vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, Shringla said. “We are actively engaged in promoting India as an alternative manufacturing hub and an innovation destination,” he added. Though crises such as the pandemic alter geopolitics, the fundamental orientation of India’s policy remains “neighbourhood first” and initiatives such as Bimstec link this policy to another fundamental pillar, “Act East”, he said. Think West, India’s outreach to the Gulf and West Asian countries, has also become an increasingly important pillar of foreign policy, and India has outlined a vision for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes and international rules, he said. All decision-making is done in a highly complex multi-layered and multi-dimensional operating environment and the “business of statecraft is not one of binaries”, Shringla said. Amid the pandemic, India tried to act as a “pharmacy of the world” and provided medicines and essential medical supplies to more than 150 countries and sent rapid response medical teams to Kuwait, the Maldives, Mauritius and Comoros. India also “went out of its way to be a net provider of security”, Shringla said. Looking to the future, which he described as uncertain, Shringla said India needs to be “prepared to continuously adapt and innovate”, build resilience and capacity, and be agile and flexible in international diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-global-order-based-on-rules-in-post-covid-19-world-harsh-shringla-on-foreign-policy-priorities/story-zC7ohdSW5Qy9S5XDRc6RwJ.html
21-09-2020||India||All-India protest against farm bills from September 24, says Congress||The Congress on Monday decided to launch a nationwide agitation from September 24 against the government for passing farm bills in Parliament.The two agricultural reform bills — the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 — were cleared by voice vote in Parliament even as the Opposition protested and stormed the well of the House seeking that they be sent to a select committee.The authorities called in marshals to form a double-layered barricade to protect Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh and remove an MP, muted live telecast of the proceedings, and refused to accept the Opposition’s demand for a division (voting through paper ballots) on the legislation.The agitation will continue till the government repeals the “anti-farmer, anti-poor and anti-people laws”, said senior Congress leader AK Antony, addressing the reporters after a meeting of general secretaries and in-charge of states at the party headquarters in Delhi.“From September 24 onwards, Congress will launch an all-India agitation asking the government to repeal the black laws,” said Antony.Senior leader Ahmed Patel told reporters that the Congress will take this issue to the people of the country. “The meeting was held under the directions of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” he added. The six-member special committee formed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to help her in organisational and operational matters chaired the meeting in her absence. Accompanied by her son and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi had last week left for the United States for a routine health check-up.Giving details of the agitation, Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal said the party will have a series of nationwide programmes in support of the farmers.Apart from a chain of press conferences across the country, Venugopal said state unit chiefs and legislature party leaders along with former ministers, MPs and MLAs will walk to the respective Raj Bhavans and submit a memorandum to Governors to be passed on to President Ram Nath Kovind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-india-protest-against-farm-bills-from-september-24-says-congress/story-KtE1j8qVdl4jnWcwTrIR6N.html
21-09-2020||India||‘Shameful day in Parliament history’: Ravi Shankar Prasad slams Opposition leaders for creating ruckus over farm bills||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday slammed the Opposition leaders for their unruly conduct in the Parliament during the passage of two key farm bills on Sunday and their refusal to leave the Rajya Sabha despite the Chairman’s order to suspend them this morning. On the Opposition’s claim that the bills were passed without voting on Sunday, Prasad said deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh had asked the members of Parliament (MPs), who went to the well of the house, to return to their seats 13 times.“How can voting take place when you won’t go to your seats,” he said. Pointing to the possibility of the Chairman being physically attacked, the Union minister said, “Yesterday was a shameful day in Parliament’s history. Mic was broken, a leader of a party tore a rule book while some leaders stood on chairs.”He also told reporters about the dismay among the people of Bihar over the treatment Singh faced in the house. “Harivansh ji is an eminent writer, we have all felt very bad at the treatment meted out to him. An eminent Indian who hails from Bihar was humiliated, the people of Bihar will give a response. Harivansh ji remained dignified. The Opposition parties will have to answer in Bihar. We will not make it a political issue but people are hurt,” he said. Earlier in the day, the upper house Chairman M Venkaih Naidu suspended eight MPs over their misconduct on Sunday. TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen, Sanjay Singh of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Congress leaders Rajeev Satav, Ripun Bora and Syed Nasir Hussain and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) were suspended for a week under Rule 256(2).The suspended MPs, however, refused to leave the house which Prasad said is a violation of rules and patently illegal.Referring to the MPs’ conduct on both days, the Union minister said, “they know the rules, propriety but behaved like this. The conduct of leaders is shameful and shows utter disregard for norms.”Stating rule 256, Prasad said a member is expected to leave the House immediately if suspended by the Chairman but the Opposition leaders did not pay heed to the Chairman’s word. “They stayed and shouted in the house. What does this mean? You flouted norms yesterday and again today. And then you talk of democracy,” he added. He also accused the Congress and RJD of encouraging the bad behaviour against the deputy Chairman.The minister dismissed Opposition claims that the bills were passed “forcefully” or “without voting” saying that the Centre had a clear majority with 110 members in favour while 72 opposed. He said the Opposition’s agenda was to not to let the bill pass and took a swipe at them saying, “If you had gone to your place there would have been voting.”The BJP leader also invoked Arun Jaitely who he said had spoken of tyranny of minority. “You will not follow rules, break mics, attack deputy Chairman and then talk of democracy, this won’t do.”He also said the government’s Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers this year is ready and those who are claiming that it will end don’t know what to say. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured MSP will go on and we have implemented it from today itself. On Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation over farm bills, Prasad said she had been a a distinguished colleague. She had asked if it was legally possible. As the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 have been cleared by both houses, the Union minister said, “This is in the interest of farmers. The President will act in his wisdom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shameful-day-in-parliament-history-ravi-shankar-prasad-slams-opposition-leaders-for-creating-ruckus-over-farm-bills/story-4edDp1b39HtPUb84dTBW6N.html
21-09-2020||India||Kerala Police SIT to book caretaker in mysterious deaths of 7 members of single family||A special investigation team (SIT) of the Kerala Police probing seven mysterious deaths in a single family and alleged seizure of their property in Thiruvananthapuram decided on Monday to file a charge-sheet against the family caretaker, said an official involved in the probe. The SIT said caretaker Raveendran Nair will be booked for forging the will of Gopinathan Nair, the family head, and usurping property and a separate case will be registered against him later in connection with the mysterious death of the last family member Jayamadhavan Nair in 2017. The incident came to light after one of the relatives Prasanna Kumari (79), a retired under secretary with the state government, filed a complaint with the state police chief Loknath Behra last year. She alleged that her late husband’s cousins Jayaprakash Nair and Jayamadhavan Nair, died under mysterious circumstances and close relatives were not informed about their deaths and family properties were grabbed by their caretaker after fudging the will. In her complaint she also said deaths of many family members were shrouded in mystery. Seven deaths took place between 1991 and 2017 in their family home named ‘Uma Mandiram,’ situated in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram. “After a year’s investigation we found that explanation given by caretaker Raveendran Nair was far from satisfactory. The will of the family was fudged and their properties seized. In the last death also there are many discrepancies in his claims,” said an officer who is part of the investigating team. The eerie similarities in most of the deaths made family members and local residents suspicious. Their suspicion grew stronger after the death of the last heir in the family Jayamadhavan Nair (60) in 2017. “When he collapsed Raveendran was present at the house. He took him to the hospital in an auto-rickshaw and never informed other relatives. Some witnesses said some injuries were there on his forehead. Though the post-mortem report said it was an unnatural death he used his influence to hush it up,” said Kumari adding she will get justice soon. According to relatives, the first to die in the Nair family was Jayashree Nair, family head Gopinathan Nair’s daughter in 1991. The woman who was 20, collapsed suddenly in the house and died. It was suspected to be a suicide but no post-mortem was done. Some local people said she developed an affair with a local youth but the family opposed it strongly. It was suspected that she died after consuming pesticide. Next year Gopinathan Nair’s son Balakrishnan Nair died after collapsing. In 1993 their cousin Unnikrishnan Nair also collapsed and died in the house. In 1998 Gopinathan Nair died and after 10 years his widow Sumuki Amma died in 2008. Relatives said the last two might be natural deaths because both were in their 70s when they died. In 2012 Jayaprakash Nair, another son of Gopinathan Nair collapsed and died and in 2017 the last heir in the family Jayamadhavan, another cousin, also died under similar circumstances. Kumari said the unraveling of the Kozhikkode cyanide killings prompted her to take up the case. A 47-year woman Jolly Joseph was arrested two years ago for allegedly killing six of her family members by giving cyanide-laced food to usurp their property. The case is on trial stage now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-police-sit-to-book-caretaker-in-mysterious-deaths-of-7-members-of-single-family/story-TQITDz0GaE1l0GWBvHBWyO.html

This also caused the spread of Coronavirus infection amongst many persons,” the reply said.Many foreigners and Indian nationals tested positive for the virus after they had either attended the religious gathering organised by the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin or come in contact with those who were present at the gathering.The ministry also said that as many 2,361 persons of Tablighi Jamaat were evacuated by the Delhi Police on March 29 and 233 persons were arrested. It said an investigation against Jamaat chief Maulana Mohd. Saad is underway.In August, the Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench struck down criminal cases registered against 34 people, including 28 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district, saying foreign nationals were virtually persecuted.“A political Government tries to find scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity, and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them scapegoats,” said a bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar. “The material of the present matter shows that the propaganda against the so-called religious activity was unwarranted.”The Jamaat, which has followers in over 80 countries, maintained many visitors at its headquarters were stranded after the government declared a lockdown to check the pandemic spread. The Centre blacklisted around 1,500 foreign Tablighi members for violating their visa norms and multiple cases were registered against them across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tablighi-event-led-to-covid-spread-among-many-govt-to-parliament/story-IEaQ05G7RfXHEzx08TnBXM.html

While the NCB is working on tracing the backtrail from consumer to peddler to supplier to those controlling the trade, the emerging picture is one that threatens to roil Bollywood with past and present A-listers and others showing up on the radar of the agency.“We have a fair idea as to who is involved in the Bollywood drug scene and (who the) Mumbai suppliers (are). The evidence is being collected before the consumers of hard drugs including heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine and their suppliers are charged,” said a senior NCB official who is familiar with the investigations in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. The official spoke on the conduct that he is not named.While a key Amritsar link who is central to the investigation is expected to be summoned this week by NCB, the agency has sought the help of the US, UK, Canada and Australian drug enforcement agencies to unearth suppliers of cocaine to Mumbai. According to information shared by associate agencies, at least 1,200 kilograms of cocaine landed in India in 2018, with 300 kilograms landing in Mumbai alone. The number was discovered by a detailed investigation into a seizure of 55 kg of cocaine in Australia in June 2019; the same organization was behind both. NCB has already registered a case on the basis of the Australian report.ALSO WATCH | ‘Sushant case not suicide’: BJP’s Rupa Ganguly protests against Bollywood According to NCB officials, the majority of cocaine lands in India through the Columbia-Brazil-Mozambique route, while other African destinations and the Dubai area are sometimes used as an alternative route. Given that India is the largest producer of potassium permanganate, which is used in processing cocaine, there were even plans by some organizations to set up a cocaine processing unit in the country, these officials added.With India consuming nearly one ton of heroin every day, associate agencies have also alerted NCB to the possibility of a processing unit in India for Afghan heroin coming through Punjab (from Pakistan) or through the sea route from Gujarat. Pakistan’s deep state has always used drug money for terrorist funding.While NCB is conducting an intensive investigation into the drug angle of the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the matter needs to be handled carefully, the NCB official cited in the first instance said, with names of drug dealers linked with Maharashtra politicians and companies managing film actors and actresses also coming under the scanner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-probe-in-sushant-singh-case-leads-to-amritsar-pak-and-drug-mafia-cartels/story-y5G6Stj1WD8yJBATkOflFK.html

Please intervene on behalf of farmers, labourers, arhtiyas, mandi labour and Dalits, or they will never forgive us,” the SAD leader had said in a statement on Twitter shortly after Rajya Sabha passed two of the three bills.“Democracy means consensus, not majority oppression,” he added.Also, in line with her party’s dissent over the bills, SAD leader and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had resigned from her post on Thursday following the passage of bills in the Lok Sabha.Apart from SAD, which is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA government, 12 Opposition parties have also sought time to meet Kovind over the agri bills cleared by the Rajya Sabha.According to news agency PTI, leaders of various political parties including the Congress, the Left parties, NCP, DMK, SP, Trinamool Congress and the RJD have in a memorandum to the President sought his intervention in the matter and asked him not to sign the bills, which will become a law after the President grants his assent to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-farmer-sad-team-meets-president-kovind-requests-him-not-to-sign-farm-bills-passed-by-parliament/story-QyjyYpGebxAtVwd5Rpv2IL.html

A division bench of the high court comprising chief justice JK Maheshwari and judges M Satyanarayana Murthy and AV Sesha Sai was acting on a batch of nearly 93 petitions including that of Amaravati Rythu Parirakshana Vedika (Amaravat farmers’ protection forum) and former Telugu Desam Party MLA Sravan Kumar. The bench said it would take up hearing of the petitions from October 5. “Till such time, the status quo on Amaravati capital issue will continue,” the high court bench said. Advocates for petitioners requested that the petitions be heard in person, rather than through video conferencing mode. The high court said it would take a call on October 5. The petitioners were opposing the formation of three capitals – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, judicial capital at Kurnool and legislative capital at Amaravati. They moved the high court challenging the acts passed by the state legislature to this effect in June, besides the legal sanctity of the GN Rao committee and high power committee based on which the state government decided on three capitals. The petitioners questioned the violation of agreement made by AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) with the farmers, deviation of master plan in the state capital region and lack of creation of infrastructure facilities in the region. The Union home ministry, which was made a respondent in the case, had already submitted an affidavit in the court that there was no provision in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, that prevents the Jagan government to go ahead with the three capitals plan. The MHA refused to intervene in the matter, as location or relocation of the state capital is the sole prerogative of the state government. The high court also took objection to the construction of a state guest house in 30 acres of land at Kapuluppada in Visakhapatnam despite the status quo order on the capital shift. The petitioners argued that it amounted to contempt of court. The state government, however, claimed that the construction of the guest house had nothing to do with the capital shift. The high court ordered that the government submit its counter within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-3-capital-plan-for-andhra-put-on-hold-till-october-5/story-wAus8i6r4OOL3vU1X01HCJ.html
21-09-2020||India||Lok Sabha passes amendments to FCRA that seek to make Aadhaar mandatory for NGOs to receive foreign funds||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the amendments to Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 that seek to make Aadhaar mandatory for NGOs to receive foreign funds.The amendments seek to streamline the provisions of the FCRA by strengthening the compliance mechanism, enhancing transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution worth thousands of crores of rupees every year, the government had said on Sunday. Once the bill is cleared by the upper house and gets assent from President Ram Nath Kovind, public servants will be barred from receiving foreign funding.Also, Aadhaar card will be mandatory for all office bearers of NGOs and other organisations which are seeking funds from foreign sources.The amendments will limit the use of foreign funds received under FCRA for administrative purposes from the current limit of 50% to 20%.“The annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior permission under the said Act. Many of them were also found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts,” the proposed amendment states.“This has led to a situation where the central government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including non-governmental organisations, during the period between 2011 and 2019,” it added.On getting clearance from the Rajya Sabha and the President, the amended act will empower the government to ask a violator to not use the funds by holding a “summary inquiry”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-passes-amendments-to-fcra-that-seek-to-make-aadhaar-mandatory-for-ngos-to-receive-foreign-funds/story-ulRQ8jV3RemLWNKchtCeYP.html
21-09-2020||India||In MP’s Sagar district, govt orders regulation of ‘radium cutter’ sale after crime spikes||The administration in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh has invoked prohibitory orders to regulate the sale of ‘radium cutter’, a kind of knife, following a spate of crime. A person will now need to have an identity card and appropriate reason for purchasing and carrying a radium cutter otherwise he will be booked for violation of prohibitory orders issued on Sunday. The district administration said the prohibitory orderwas issued under section 144 of CrPC as criminals were using the cutter frequently to terrorise people and commit crimes. In a two-page order, Sagar collector Deepak Kumar Singh said, “There is a sudden increase in a number of crimes in which criminals are using radium cutters to hurt and terrorise people during loot and theft. To check these incidents, prohibitory order under section 144 of Cr PC is being imposed on sale, purchase, use and carrying of radium cutter. If any person violates the order, he will be booked under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC.” Section 188 of IPC states, “..if such disobedience causes or trends to cause danger to human life, health or safety, or causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.” According to the order, every shopkeeper who sells a radium cutter, has to inform the nearest police station about the stock of the same. “They have to maintain a register in which they will have to make an entry of the ID card number, address, contact number and name of the customer in detail and also the purpose behind the purchase. The details will be shared with the nearest police station every week. Similarly, a person can’t carry it in public places and can’t hand it over to any other person,” reads the order. “Section 144 of CrPC has been imposed for the next six months on the request of the superintendent of police to put a check on crime and criminals,” collector Kumar said. Sagar’s superintendent of police, Atul Singh said, “In a review of crime cases reported from January 2020 to August 2020, as many as 90 cases were reported in Sagar in which criminals used radium cutters to attack or terrorise people.” “The reason behind this increase of use is if criminals carry any sharp-edged weapon including knives and swords or they attack anyone with these weapons, they can be booked under Arms Act, 1959 and section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC but there is no offence in carrying radium cutter and the attack with this will not fall under the category of a lethal attack. The use of radium cutters by criminals is a ploy to save themselves from serious police action,” said the SP. Now, police teams will check at radium and sticker pasting shops, flower decoration and stationary shops, where there is an availability of radium cutters, to know when and from where they purchased them and the police team will check whether the shopkeeper maintained the stock or not. Similarly police can take action against any one if he is found carrying it, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mp-s-sagar-district-govt-orders-regulation-of-radium-cutter-sale-after-crime-spikes/story-hBRZf4sZJB8LCnwRlMGAZO.html

Dozens of Youth Congress leaders and activists assembled at the Jammu Press Club while holding anti-BJP posters and raised slogans against the BJP-led Central government. The protest was led by Uday Bhanu Chib, president J&K Youth Congress. The protesters said that these laws were ill- conceived and the central government should take back the twin farm bills passed on Sunday since these are against the land owners of the nation. “Farm bills are against the federal cooperative spirit,” the protesters said and questioned the need to bring these bills during the Covid-19 pandemic. Chib said that the bills have been brought with an intention to end the Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations and were against the economic interests of the farming sector.

No violence and injuries were reported during the strike barring one woman police officer who received minor injuries, officials said.The strike partially paralysed normal life with shops and markets being half closed. But government offices had almost full attendance. Educational institutions are closed since end of March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “As many as 836 Congress picketers were detained from different parts of the state under Section 151. So far, there has been no report of violence and no injury has been reported. Only officer in-charge of West Agartala Women’s Police Station received minor injuries during detention of the picketers,” said an on-duty police officer at Police Headquarters in Agartala. The party called the strike in support of the twelve point charter of demands that included proper health services at the Govind Ballabh Panth (GBP) hospital, the state’s lone dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Agartala and other Covid Care Centres, giving Rs 10 lakh to the kin of Covid-19 victims and withdrawal of chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s anti-media remark.They also protested against alleged attacks on Congress workers by the ruling party cadres. Employment opportunities for youth, security of women, compensation to people who were defrauded by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), strengthening of indigenous people in the Autonomous District Council areas, stopping harassment of people living along Indo-Bangla border areas etc. were also on their list of demands. Congress sources said that their activists were attacked in different parts of the state mainly in Kailasahar in Unakoti district, Udaipur in Gomati district and Agartala. Congress president Pijush Kanti Biswas said, “Our party activists were attacked in different parts of the state and mainly in Agartala. But people responded to our strike to make it a success. We will lodge a complaint against these attacks with the police.” Reacting to the comments, BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “The Congress has no base in the state. And the people didn’t support the strike. None of our party activists attacked the Congress workers. Rather, they ransacked one of our party offices in Kailasahar and also vehicles of our activists. They attacked our youth activists in Agartala, where they were distributing fruit juice to people to boost their immunity to combat Covid-19. We are collecting information on the incidents from different parts of the state and will lodge a case with the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tripura-congress-observes-12-hour-strike-over-800-party-workers-detained/story-NR82SINPVyZGoHCvGSHtaM.html

21-09-2020||India||Dehradun administration to probe difference in Covid-19 positivity rate in pvt and govt labs||The Dehradun district administration has formed a committee to investigate a 10% difference in positivity rate in the city in Covid-19 tests done through private and government laboratories, the district magistrate said.The positivity rate reported from private labs is 36% while it is 26% for government labs.As per the records of the state health bulletin, the positivity rate has a difference of 10% in Dehradun for tests done from September 13-19 by private and government labs. A total of 10,686 tests were done in the district with 3,315 cases reported for the said week. The positivity rate reported from private labs is 36% whereas for government labs it is 26%. This as, almost equal test took place in both the laboratories but 60% of the Covid-19 cases reported are from private labs and 40% are from government labs. Along with the difference in positivity rate, the Dehradun district administration has also received complaints that they tested positive in one private lab, but tested negative in the second test done from either a government or private lab. Ashish Kumar Srivastava, district magistrate of Dehradun said that a committee has been formed to investigate the matter. “We have formed a committee for all private labs, which has officials from the district administration and two experts, an epidemiologist and microbiologist, to investigate the difference. The committee will study everything and submit its report within one week. It is not just the difference of the positivity rate, but we will be looking into why different test results are being reported from different labs,” said the district magistrate. The district magistrate added that the committee will take details of why there is a difference in positivity rate, the procedure of collecting samples by private labs, precautions taken during collection of samples, testing, how addresses and contact numbers are noted, how much time is taken to give reports to patients. Srivastava further said that the district administration has temporarily stopped testing at only one private lab in Dehradun as “they had taken down wrong addresses and contact details of the patients making it difficult for us to trace the patients. A show cause notice has been sent to them and till they give us a reply, testing has been suspended.” Dehradun district has around 15 private labs for testing Covid-19 samples, the district magistrate said. On Saturday, during a review meeting with all district magistrates, the chief secretary instructed officials that action should be taken against private laboratories if false positive reports are being given. Pankaj Pandey, secretary in-charge for medical health and family welfare department said, “We have learnt from the media and personally also about the difference in positivity rate. All the districts have been asked to check the reason behind the difference in the positivity rate at the earliest as it is becoming a serious issue now. If at all wrong reports are being given, then it can spread panic amongst people and hamper our management process also.” Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities that has been analysing the Covid-19 data in the hill state said, “To understand the difference in the positivity rate between private and government labs we should start getting detailed numbers of RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen tests separately for both government as well as private labs. Only then will we be able to compare apple to apple.” He further said, “A third party or external audit of each and every lab that is doing Covid tests in Uttarakhand also should be done. This includes both private and government labs as well.” Private lab operators, however, say that the positivity rate could be high given that they collect samples from high suspect patients from private hospitals who are already admitted in isolation. Dr. Alok Ahuja, lab director of Dr. Ahujas Pathology and Imaging Centre, one of biggest private labs in Dehradun which collects samples from 14 private hospitals said that as per their records of all samples collected from September 1-14, the positivity rate from private hospitals has been 34.2% and for walk-in samples it stands at 20.9%. “Our incidence is a little higher as we collect samples from major private hospitals in Dehradun, which include symptomatic patients who are already admitted in isolation. Around one-third of the total samples (200-250 daily) are from these hospitals. From these hospitals, we get a positivity rate of 70-80%, but for the general population (walk-in sampling) we get 18-20%,” Dr Ahuja said. He added, “The district magistrate has spoken to me and asked me to review my process. A team from the state health department which included a microbiologist also visited my lab last week and checked all the process. They found everything satisfactory and I welcome further checking also as panic should not be spread amongst common people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dehradun-administration-to-probe-difference-in-covid-19-positivity-rate-in-pvt-and-govt-labs/story-DIOM4cIb4bvIXEXIjI2LxJ.html
21-09-2020||India||Bombay HC dismisses BJP petition, INC’s Ravi Raja to continue as Opposition leader in BMC||Ravi Raja of the Indian National Congress (INC) will continue to be the leader of the opposition in the Shiv Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday dismissed a petition filed by Prabhakar Shinde, the group leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the BMC, seeking an order to mayor Kishori Pednekar to recognise him as the opposition leader in the civic body.A two-member HC bench, comprising Justices SJ Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar, dismissed Shinde’s petition observing that such important posts as the leader of the opposition cannot be allowed to be occupied on the whims and fancies of individuals or political parties.Also Read: ‘Some IPS officers worked to stop Thackeray govt’s march to power’: Shiv Sena“In our opinion, the law does not contemplate an important post such as that of the leader of the opposition to be occupied temporarily on the whims of any person or party,” the bench observed.The observation came in view of the fact that after the 2017 civic elections, the then mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar had offered the post of opposition leader to Manoj Kotak, the then group leader of the party in the BMC. The BJP is the second-largest party in the civic body and has 82 seats after the Sena’s 84. However, Kotak had refused the post and after deliberations on April 11, 2017, Raja was recognised as the BMC’s opposition leader. The INC has 31 seats -- the third-highest numerical strength in the BMC.Also Read: Mumbai civic body increases RT-PCR tests as doubts raised over accuracy of antigen testsMangal Prabhat Lodha, the president of the BJP’s Mumbai unit , wrote a letter to mayor Pednekar on February 28, seeking an order to recognise Shinde as the new group leader of the party in the BMC and also as the opposition leader. Shinde moved HC on June 10 after Pednekar refused to recognise him as such.He said that the BJP had earlier decided not to be active in opposition in the BMC. But because of the changed political equations – it is no longer in alliance with the Sena – the BJP decided to discharge the role of an effective and active opposition party. Shinde sought a directive from HC to be recognised as the opposition leader in the civic body.However, the bench was not impressed with the contention. HC dismissed the petition observing that the party, which expressly refused to accept the post three years ago, cannot seek to be appointed as the leader of the opposition, “merely on the ground that it has changed its mind and its earlier decision”.HC also rejected the argument put forth on Shinde’s behalf that Section 371A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, which requires the post of the opposition leader to be given to the second-largest party, is a dynamic provision and allows such changes.The bench agreed that Section 371A is a dynamic provision, but stated that the reliance placed by the petitioner on the words “for the time being” in the section was unfounded.The court said the words did not support the petitioner’s case to the extent that he sought to stretch their meaning.HC said the words referred to the possibility of a legal change or a change in the party in opposition or in its numerical strength. “Those words cannot and do not cover a change of mind/volition / decision of the party in opposition, which had earlier expressly refused to accept the post,” said the bench.The bench said a change of mind or volition cannot be covered by the words in Section 371A(1). “If we allow such change of mind or volition, it will lead to absurd results in as much as the leader of the opposition will have to be changed every time a party changes its mind.”The bench clarified that while the section called for attention to the state of affairs prevailing at a given time, a change in mindset or volition would not be sufficient to overturn a previous appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-bjp-petition-inc-s-ravi-raja-to-continue-as-opposition-leader-in-bmc/story-JlIJh2cSj4y30qbYD8H6XO.html
21-09-2020||India||‘Pakistan targeting Indians working in Afghanistan’: Govt to Parliament||Pakistan has been targeting Indian professionals working in Afghanistan in a variety of ways, and several Indians working on development projects have been attacked and kidnapped over the past 12 years, the government informed Parliament on Monday. Since September last year, Pakistan has also attempted to designate four Indian nationals, who had previously worked in Afghanistan, as terrorists under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. “However, the 1267 Sanctions Committee, based on its internal procedures, has not approved the request,” the minister said.In his response to the same question, Muraleedharan said: “Pakistan has been targeting Indian professionals working in Afghanistan through a variety of ways. Several Indians working in Afghanistan on various development projects have been attacked and kidnapped over the past 12 years. “With the assistance of [the] government of Afghanistan, India has been able to secure [the] release of many Indians from captivity. In addition, [the] Indian embassy and its consulates have also been attacked.”The last of seven Indian engineers who were kidnapped in Afghanistan in May 2018 were recently released before the Afghan government and the Taliban launched intra-Afghan negotiations in Qatar this month.Muraleedharan said as a result of the Indian government’s efforts, there is “enhanced concern in the international community at terrorism emanating from Pakistan, including the continuing activities of internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals such as Jamaat-ud Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad [and] Hizbul Mujahideen”.The world community strongly condemned the cross-border terror attack in Pulwama in February 2019 and several countries have called on Pakistan to “not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner”, he said.“Many terrorist entities and individuals who find shelter in Pakistan and are also engaged in terrorism against India have been proscribed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union and other countries,” he said, adding that JeM founder Masood Azhar was sanctioned by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee in May last year. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), at its plenary in June 2018, notified Pakistan in the “grey list” due to “continuing terror financing-related concerns, including with respect to the UN proscribed terrorist entities like LeT, JuD and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation”, he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-targeting-indians-working-in-afghanistan-govt-to-parliament/story-02MorbQPMFAN94TfNFMk7H.html
21-09-2020||India||‘The farm bills are just creating procedural clearances’||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Bhupender Yadav has blamed the Opposition for the disruption in Rajya Sabha during the discussion and passage of the two of the contentious farm Bills on Sunday. In an interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran, Yadav said the government is open to addressing all concerns about the Bills, which he insisted are aimed at protecting the rights of the farmers. Edited excerpts:The Opposition is alleging the government bulldozes its way through in Parliament. It prefers to take the ordinance route. In the case of the farm Bills, they felt more scrutiny was needed, which was denied. How will you counter that?To bring an ordinance is the right of the government and to get it passed within six months from the date from which it was issued is the government’s mandate. The government is seriously taking care to ensure that all procedures are followed. These Bills have been discussed at the government as well as non-government level.As far as issues like contract farming are concerned, they are already being implemented in states like Punjab, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Odisha. There are not issues that have never been implemented before or are completely new.Also Read: ‘Will fight in Parliament and on streets’: Mamata Banerjee on suspension of 8 Rajya Sabha MPsAs far as concerns about the sale of crops go, this [legislation]...does not put an end to the system of selling grains in Mandis. We are only creating an alternative for the farmers.These Bills are just creating procedural clearances. There has been a long debate on these issues in the country. What these bills will do is streamline what is already being implemented.The Bills talk about procedures, about giving the farmers a new and additional way [to sell their produce]. Today, we have proposals to open 10,000 new FPOs [farmer producer organisations] and 1,000 new Agro start-ups. A digital revolution is happening. So, in such a situation to deprive the farmers of the benefits of digital transactions is not right. How can we stop farmers and their children from accessing the benefits of the digital revolution? The Opposition is looking to stall the Bills using excuses.Why did the government turn down the demand for sending the Bills to the select committee?These Bills only created procedural ways to benefit farmers. These are not Bills that needed to be sent to the committee. These have been discussed in Parliament and the due process that has to be followed for the passage of a bill was adhered to. ...we stuck to the democratic system. It was the Opposition that disrupted the process and insulted the process.Also Read: Endless arrogance of BJP govt has brought economic disaster: Rahul GandhiThe responsibility of running the House rests with the government. There is a sense that if the Opposition was seeking more discussion or division of votes, then the demand should be met, but it was not done on Sunday and on many occasions in the past...When these Bills were taken up for discussion at the business advisory committee [meeting] to decide how much time should be allocated for discussion, both the Opposition as well as the government agreed that there will be four hours allocated for these two Bills. It was the Opposition that said that both Bills should be taken up together for discussion and passage. The BJP cut short the time of its own MPs [members of Parliament] to allow the Opposition members to speak... The government was ready to seek a division of votes, but that can happen only when the members are on their seats. The Opposition came into the Well of the House. They climbed on the tables of the secretariat staff, tore papers. They broke the chairperson’s mike so that his voice could not be heard. All this shows that they did not want a division. And as for the...[complaints] that these bills were tabled on a Sunday, it was already decided that both Houses will function for four hours each day including on Saturday and Sunday...The Opposition has also alleged that on Sunday when the Bills were passed by a voice vote, voices of the opposition MPs sitting in the Lok Sabha were not taken into account...This is again baseless. All voices were being recorded and carried forth between the Houses. When the speeches they made while sitting in the Lok Sabha could be heard and recorded, how is it that the secretariat could not hear their voices while the voice vote was being counted. Again, before seeking a division of votes, the Opposition started the ruckus and the blame for what happened in Parliament rests on them. The government was ready for a division of votes.Also Read: Farm bills: PM Modi says farmers to get better prices because of reformsYour ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is against the Bills. The affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh have concerns too. How is it that the government has failed to convince its own allies and friends?The government is ready to address the concerns of everybody including the SAD. ...when the Manmohan Singh government was in power, there was a committee that was formed under the chairmanship of the then Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, which also had Prakash Singh Badal [of SAD] as a member. In chapter 5 of the report that was prepared by them, there is a mention of these laws and about the need to repeal the Essential Commodities Act. If they [SAD] are objecting to the Bills now, it can only be [for] political [reasons].The government has never said no to an open debate on these Bills, which are entirely based on the protection of the farmers’ interests. As far as the merits of the Bills are concerned, the government has never shied away from discussing the concerns that people have.The Opposition is complaining about the suspension of MPs and planning an all-night protest...If a decision... has been taken in the House, then it is the responsibility of the Opposition to adhere to it. Parliament is run in accordance with rules and regulations. There is a certain decorum that has to be maintained. Rajya Sabha is the House of the elders. You cannot have hooliganism on the floor of the House; pushing and jostling. You cannot refuse to abide by the ruling. It is an unfortunate situation. And if nothing else, the Opposition should listen to their inner voice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-farm-bills-are-just-creating-procedural-clearances/story-3KDj3xdggcGO8FfSYG2KYJ.html

The total strength of women officers serving in the IAF is 1,875.Last week, Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik told Parliament that women fighter pilots are inducted and deployed in IAF as per strategic needs and operational requirements.The Golden Arrows squadron of the IAF was resurrected on September 10 last year. The squadron was originally raised at Air Force station, Ambala on Oct 1 1951. The squadron has many firsts to its credit; in 1955 it was equipped with the first jet fighter, the legendary De Havilland Vampire.Five French-made multirole Rafale fighter jets were inducted into the Indian Air Force on September 10 at the Ambala air force base.Ten Rafale jets have been delivered to India so far and five of them stayed back in France for imparting training to IAF pilots. The delivery of all 36 aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021.A second batch of four to five Rafale jets are likely to arrive in India by November.The Rafale jets are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-s-rafale-fleet-to-have-first-woman-pilot-soon-to-join-golden-arrows-squadron/story-R1gsoBJ3dFY3SvNhg8jotL.html
21-09-2020||India||India, Maldives launch cargo ferry service connecting Tuticorin and Cochin with Male||India and the Maldives on Monday launched a cargo ferry service connecting Tuticorin and Cochin ports with Male with the aim of cutting costs and time taken to transport goods between the two countries. The launch of the ferry service came a day after India provided a 10-year soft loan of $250 million to the government of the Maldives as budgetary support to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. India will subsidise the ferry service in its initial stage with $3 million, officials said. The maiden voyage of the ferry service was launched during a virtual ceremony by India’s minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya and the Maldives’ minister of transport and civil aviation Aishath Nahula. The ceremony was joined by representatives of Tuticorin and Cochin ports and officials of the Maldives Ports Limited and the foreign ministry of the Maldives. The cargo vessel MCP Linz, operated by the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), will travel from Tuticorin to Cochin and then to Kulhudhuhfushi port in the north of the Indian Ocean archipelago on September 26 before making its way to Male on September 28. The vessel can carry 380 TEUs and 3,000 metric tonnes on bulk cargo. The turnaround time for voyages will be 10 to 12 days and the service will operate twice a month. “This vessel provides direct cargo connectivity between India and the Maldives on a predictable and affordable basis for the first time, and will lower costs and times for traders in both countries,” the Indian mission in Male said in a statement. Officials said the ferry service is aimed at upgrading the trade partnership and improving logistics on both sides. Though the two sides have traded for centuries, India is currently only the fourth largest trading partner of the Maldives, after the UAE, China and Singapore. “Alongside the expansion of Hanimaadhoo airport through an Indian line of credit, connectivity to the northern port of Kulhudhuhfushi through the cargo ferry service will underpin the economic development of northern Maldives and facilitate investments in tourism and other sectors,” said an official who declined to be named. Besides expanding the markets of medium and small-sized enterprises in India, the ferry service will give an opportunity to Maldivian exporters of tuna and other marine products to enter the Indian market and explore the possibility of sending their goods to Europe via Cochin and Tuticorin ports, officials said. The two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding on the ferry service during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the Maldives in June 2019. In his address to the Majlis or Parliament during that visit, Modi had announced India’s commitment to start the ferry service. A team from SCI visited the Maldives in July last year for preliminary studies and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) carried out a feasibility study on the cargo ferry service during March-April, which found India’s share of the 27 principal items imported by the Maldives was well below the potential. The decision to launch the cargo ferry service between the two sides was announced during a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign minister Abdulla Shahid on August 13 The cargo ferry service also reflects the synergies between the “neighbourhood first” policy of the Indian government and the “India first” policy of the Maldives under the leadership of President Ibrahim Solih, the officials said. Addressing the launch ceremony, Mandaviya said the ferry service will boost bilateral trade, provide a cost-effective alternate means for transporting goods, and help in ensuring food security in the Maldives. Nahula said the ferry service will decentralise economy activity and open a new corridor for commerce, development and tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-maldives-launch-cargo-ferry-service-connecting-tuticorin-and-cochin-with-male/story-lhmEH8p5XFGdpd7WYQ575K.html
21-09-2020||India||Parliament being run at the behest of PMO, alleges Adhir Chowdhury||The Congress on Monday alleged that Rajya Sabha (RS) deputy chairman Harivansh tried to “muzzle and throttle the voices of the opposition parties at the behest of” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Addressing reporters outside the Parliament House Complex after Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu suspended eight opposition lawmakers for creating ruckus in the Upper House on Sunday, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the move was against the procedures and rules of the parliamentary system. “We have some entitlements. We are entitled to ask for division according to the rules and procedures enshrined in the parliamentary system. But at the behest of the PMO, the House is being run,” he alleged. Also Read: Farm bills: PM Modi says farmers to get better prices because of reformsChowdhury alleged that the newly-elected Harivansh had certain obligations towards the government. “That is why at the behest of the PMO, he tried to muzzle and throttle the voices of the opposition parties. This is the reason that triggered the commotion inside the RS,” he alleged. On Sunday, Harivansh had rejected the opposition’s demand for a division on the two farm bills, which were later passed by a voice vote. He had argued that a division could not take place because of the ruckus. “Now, in order to divert the attention from the poor plight of farmers, the government has been projecting the commotion inside the RS as if that we do not know how to run Parliament and participate in the parliamentary system,” Chowdhury said. Also Read: ‘Will fight in Parliament and on streets’: Mamata Banerjee on suspension of 8 Rajya Sabha MPs“I would like to remind them (government) that before you came to Parliament, the Congress has been very much accustomed, acclimatised and adapted to the practices of the House. We sought a division following that practices. It is our entitlement,” he added. “We are also entitled to move a no-confidence motion against the RS deputy chairman if it is found and perceived that he has been playing a partisan role. The onus is on us to check the deputy chairman also by applying the instruments that are available to us and we have done so. It is within the ambit of our democratic right and parliamentary system,” the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said the Congress would continue to protest until the decision of suspension of the opposition members of Parliament (MPs) in “such a brazen and undemocratic manner” is not revoked. The suspended members have been protesting Naidu’s decision, first inside the House and later outside the Parliament building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-being-run-at-the-behest-of-pmo-alleges-adhir-chowdhury/story-TSm46aaCTbiWzqATW5nBZN.html
21-09-2020||India||There can’t be universal policy on right to protest: Supreme Court in anti-CAA blockade case||There cannot be a “universal policy” on right to protest and possible curbs as also balancing it with acts like blocking of roads are needed because the situation may “vary” from case-to-case, the Supreme Court said on Monday.The top court’s observation came while reserving the verdict on a batch of pleas against the anti-CAA protests which had led to blocking of a road in Shaheen Bagh in the national capital last December.The situation normalized later due to Covid-19 pandemic fear and subsequent observance of protocol. “There were some supervening circumstances which came into play and it was no one’s hand. God almighty itself intervened,” said a bench comprising Justices S K Kaul, Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari. Taking note of the submissions of lawyers including Shashank Deo Sudhi, the bench said: “We have to balance right to protest and the blocking of roads. We have to deal with the issue. Their cannot be universal policy as the situation may vary on case to case basis.“In parliamentary democracy protest can happen in Parliament and on roads but on road it has to be peaceful”.Amit Sahni, one of the lawyers who had filed the plea in the case, said that this kind of protests should not have been allowed in the larger public interest.“This was allowed to have continued for more than 100 days and people faced difficulty. This kind of incident should not have happened. Yesterday in Haryana there was ‘Chakka Jam’ in Haryana. They have also called Bharat Bandh on September 24-25,” he said. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for an intervenor, said that there was a right to peaceful protest and “some people from a political party went and their created riots”.“We have the right to protest. State machinery is not sacrosanct. Members of a political party went there with the police and created the situation,” he said.Reserving the verdict, the bench said that it had appointed “interlocutors” as an experiment and they had suggested some measures which can be looked into.It said that the experiment of sending interlocutors may or may not have succeeded and the have been Covid-19 situation may also have an effect on the situation.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that the Right to protest cannot be absolute and their are some judgements to this affect.The top court had earlier heard the pleas, filed by Sahni, former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg and Ashutosh Dubey, against the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh after the February 8 Delhi assembly elections. Sahni had approached the high court seeking directions to Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on December 15 The high court had urged local authorities to deal with the situation keeping in mind law and order.Sahni has filed a special leave petition in the apex court against the high court’s order.The plea has sought directions to the police to ensure smooth traffic flow on Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.It has sought supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh, where several women are sitting on protest, by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of the Delhi High Court in order to circumvent any violence.Separately, Garg, through his counsel Shashank Deo Sudhi, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to authorities to remove the protestors from Shaheen Bagh.Restrictions had been imposed on the Kaindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and the Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15 last year due to the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The plea of Gaeg has said that various other arterial roads of Delhi have been facing traffic congestion due the protest at Shaheen Bagh.Saying that the law enforcement machinery has been “held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters,” the plea has sought laying down of guidelines for protests leading to obstruction of public place.“It is disappointing that the state machinery is muted and a silent spectator to hooliganism and vandalism of the protesters who are threatening the existential efficacy of the democracy and the rule of law and had already taken the law and order situation in their own hand,” the plea said.It said the Shaheen Bagh protest is “undoubtedly within the constitutional parameter” but it has lost its legality as constitutional protection were being “blatantly and brazenly flouted and violated”.The state has a duty to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, who have been facing trouble due to the road blockade, it said.“Hence, it is urgently required that the public places must not be allowed to be abused and misused for ulterior and mala fide purposes such as staging protest against the constitution amendment in the heart of the capital city and thereby causing incalculable hardships and difficulties to the common people,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-can-t-be-universal-policy-on-right-to-protest-supreme-court-in-anti-caa-blockade-case/story-kIFgsNzCfJ4vNY7wn5XQHN.html
21-09-2020||India||Uttarakhand pulls up fish farmers for cultivating banned Thai Mangur||Despite the ban by the Central government on the carnivorous Thai Mangur fish, many fish farmers are still cultivating it in Kumaon’s US Nagar, officials said Monday. “We have identified 17 fish farmers who are cultivating Thai Mangur in Kashipur and Jaspur areas of the district. Since it is illegal to rear or sell such a variety of fish, we are sending notices to them to destroy their fish ponds or we will be forced to do it ourselves,” said Ravindra Kumar, senior inspector, fisheries department, US Nagar. Around 280 fish farmers are engaged in fish farming in US Nagar. Officials said some of them have been identified for cultivating Thailand catfish commonly known as Thai Mangur. Its cultivation is considered bad for biodiversity, especially other local fish species.Kumar said, “Basically it is African cat fish but it is commonly known as Thai Mangur. At the beginning of 2019, the Central government had banned its cultivation and NGT has also issued instructions for the elimination of such a variety of fish in 2000 and for forming a task force at block level to restrict such fish farming.” Kumar said this particular fish was imported in the late 1980s. Later studies showed its disadvantages and negative impact on the indigenous fish and aquatic life. Finally, the Central government issued an order to ban Thai Mangur in 2019, said Kumar. “Since this fish is carnivorous and feeds on meat, it also pollutes the water bodies. This fish is carnivorous and also eats other fish and thus affects the local fish populations,” said Kumar. The official from the fisheries department also revealed that Thai Mangur grows faster and gains weight of 3 to 4 kilograms in just 2 to 3 months. “Many farmers cultivate this fish despite the ban as it gives high returns on low investment. Apart from this, it has good sale value as it is a poor man’s delicacy as it is available between Rs 80 to 100 per kg,” he said. The official added that reports from other areas of the district have also been sought. Last year also complaints of Thai Mangur cultivation were received and notices were issued to fish farmers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-pulls-up-fish-farmers-for-cultivating-banned-thai-mangur/story-tBy5MbkDBEIFY1lhbGj9iN.html

So now these people are trying to mislead farmers on MSP (minimum support price). They are the same people who sat for years on the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee on MSP,” PM Modi said.He said a “clique” of people exploited farmers for long as they remained in shackles of rules regulating the sale of their produce and stated that this needed to change, which his government has done.The prime minister described the legislations as “very historic”, and said that if people say that government-regulated agriculture markets will be finished after these reforms, then they are “blatantly lying”.Seeking to dispel concerns among a section of farmers, PM Modi said he wanted to make it clear that the bills are not against ‘mandis’ (agricultural markets) and they will continue like they always have. “No government has done as much to boost MSP and government procurement of farmers’ produce than his dispensation,” the prime minister said.The bills were passed by the Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) amid ruckus. The Opposition members who were against the legislations wanted them to be sent to a parliamentary panel for greater scrutiny.The bills were passed through voice vote, after which the Opposition called it a “black day”.Meawhile, PM Modi inaugurated nine infrastructure development projects worth Rs 14,000 crores for Bihar through video conferencing on Monday.He also inaugurated the ‘Ghar Tak Fibre’ Project under which all 45,945 villages of Bihar will be connected through optical fibre internet service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-people-losing-control-pm-modi-takes-swipe-at-opposition-on-farm-bills/story-NDy9ibfaAF43f1iFM79DhO.html
21-09-2020||India||Over 100 Covid-19 patients rescued as fire breaks out at Odisha hospital||At least 127 Covid patients in a hospital of Odisha’s Cuttack city had a narrow escape when a fire broke out in the ICU on the fourth floor this morning.Fire officials said a short circuit in the ICU on the ground floor of Sadguru Covid hospital in Jagatpur area of Cuttack triggered a fire this morning. As smoke enveloped the ICU and other rooms, alert hospital staff members started evacuating the patients, some of whom reportedly became unconscious.Chief fire officer Sukanta Sethi said no casualties have been reported and all the patients are being shifted to another Covid hospital by ambulances and buses.“Though the exact cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, it seems an electrical short circuit in the ICU was the trigger. Two fire tenders have brought the fire under control,” he said.No fire safety licence was issued to the hospital, said the chief fire officer. “Due to certain shortcomings, notice was issued to the hospital authorities and they were asked to comply. However, no fire safety certificate has been issued to Sadguru hospital till date,” he said. Sethi, however, said the existing fire sprinklers and fire detection system installed in the hospital worked which controlled the fire. The Sadguru Covid hospital started operating a month ago with the provision of 150 general beds and 24 ICU beds. The fire is likely to make the availability of beds for Covid patients difficult in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack where ICU beds are almost exhausted due to a spike in Covid cases. Today, 4,242 new cases were recorded in the state. On August 6, at least 8 Covid patients, including 3 women, in the ICU ward of a Covid hospital in Ahmedabad had died after a major fire broke out.On August 9, ten people were killed in a major fire caused by a short circuit at a hotel which was being used as a coronavirus facility in Vijayawada city of Andhra Pradesh.After the fire in Vijayawada and Ahmedabad, Odisha fire service officials had done a fire safety audit of all the Covid hospitals.Fire safety in Odisha hospital has been a source of a major concern for the state government after a blaze in a leading private hospital in Bhubaneswar in October 2016 killed 26 people and injured over 100 people.In SUM hospital of Bhubaneswar, a short circuit the dialysis unit spread to its ICU leading to carbon monoxide smoke spreading to ICU and other wards through ducts of air conditioning. All the deaths were due to asphyxiation, an inquiry report later found out. The state health minister had to resign following the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-covid-19-patients-rescued-as-fire-breaks-out-at-odisha-hospital/story-eNHDqvSpi5rDeL7G049HJL.html

21-09-2020||India||Maximum good for farmers, says PM Modi on agri bills. Ally Nitish Kumar agrees||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reiterated that the system of minimum support price (MSP) and procurement of foodgrains would continue under the latest farm sector reforms that seek to liberalise agricultural markets. NDA alliance partner and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar backed the reforms amid opposition protest.“I want to assure farmers that minimum support price, government procurement of their produce will continue,” said PM Modi.The PM’s assertion followed launching of work on nine national highway (NH) projects in Bihar and the ambitious project to link up villages with optical fibre network to ensure high-speed internet facility through video conferencing from Delhi.Accusing the opposition of misleading the farmers about new agricultural reforms, PM Modi said that some people were creating a hue and cry over it as they saw their interests getting hampered in the Centre’s move to empower the farmers.“Agricultural mandis will not be closed. Instead the new reform would allow farmers to reap maximum benefits by selling their products at whichever market they find the best for their produce,” underlined the PM.Dismissing the opposition’s claim that the farmers’ interest would be compromised in the wake of reforms, PM Modi clarified that ownership of land would not be impacted due to their direct access to big players in the farm sector. Rather, those engaged in contract farming would be accountable for protection of ownership to farmers, arrange modern technological intervention and cater to other needs of the farmers, he said. The opposition parties have been protesting over the new reforms initiated by the passage of two farm sector legislation in Rajya Sabha on Sunday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a series of tweets, alleged that the Centre was working under a design to enslave farmers to capitalists.The PM laid the foundation stone of three four-lane bridges, two on Ganga and one on Kosi, and widening of six stretches of the national highway (NH) being executed at the cost of Rs 14,258 crore. As many 45,945 villages of the state will be connected through optical fibre internet service under the project that was launched today.In a string of events earlier this month, the PM had laid foundation stone or inaugurated schemes worth more than Rs 1,700 crore in Bihar ahead of the assembly election. Chief minister Nitish Kumar lauded the PM for introducing the farm sector reforms, saying that he had in 2006 abolished the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) Act, which was in no way in favour of the farmers.“People of Bihar are unfazed by the campaign launched by the opposition. Rather, they are happy to see the developments being executed in Bihar under the leadership of PM Modi,” said the CM, adding that people of the state would give a befitting reply to the undignified acts resorted to by the opposition in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maximum-good-for-farmers-says-pm-modi-on-agri-bills-ally-nitish-kumar-agrees/story-OJJN5G9yFaWGDhEiyR9KsL.html

The reason behind the murder is said to be a land dispute and old enmity with someone. The murder led to protests by his colleagues on the premises of Buxar district civil court. This is the fifth murder of a lawyer in the state in eight months. According to the cousin of the deceased, Vishwas Pandey, the incident occurred when Kunal was on his way to the court from his Gurdas-Mathia house. As soon as he reached near a petrol pump, a person riding a motorcycle intercepted him and fired from point-blank range. The bullet hit the advocate in the head and he fell on the road. Locals and passerby rushed him to Buxar Sadar hospital where he was declared dead. On getting information, Superintendent of police (Buxar) Neeraj Kumar Singh and other police officials rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. Police recovered two empty cartridges from the spot. “Criminals had fired on Kunal from very a close range as a bullet had pierced through his head,” a police officer said. As the news of the murder reached the court, the lawyers started shouting slogans against the police and boycotted work resulting in disruption of court proceedings. The protesting lawyers demanded immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the case. Also read: 8 MPs suspended for Rajya Sabha chaos over farm bills, they stage protestLater, a group of lawyers blocked the road and disrupted vehicular traffic for two hours. Buxar SP rushed to spot and heard their grievances. The roadblock was lifted after the SP’s assurances. “The SP has given an assurance that the culprits will be brought to book at the earliest. We have agreed not to launch any agitation on his assurance,” said general secretary of District Lawyer’ Association Ganesh Thakur. Many advocate associations in the state capital condemned the murder. “We demand the arrest of culprits within 24 hours, completion of investigation within a fortnight and completion of trial within 24 hours,” said lawyer Shashi Kant, adding that the incident reflects poor law and order situation in the state. Earlier, sales tax advocate Satyendra Kumar was murdered near his house at Sheetal Tola under town police station of Ara in Bhojpur district on February 22. On February 16, a 35-year-old lawyer, Tuntun Akela, was shot dead by unidentified motorcycle-borne gunmen near Dahibhatta village in Gopalganj district.

21-09-2020||India||Farm bills: PM Modi says farmers to get better prices because of reforms||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called the two farm bills passed by Parliament on Sunday “historic”, addressed key concerns around each of the three bills that seek to liberalise agricultural trade in the country and criticised opponents for “misleading” farmers even as Opposition parties slammed the government for hurriedly passing the legislations. Modi spoke on how each of the three bills bought by his government would help farmers in multiple ways, seeking to dispel “misinformation” being spread around them while unveiling new projects in poll-bound Bihar through a video address. Also read: Congress MP says 12 parties have sought time to meet president over passage of farm bills, request him to not give his ascentThe Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, passed on Sunday, aims to ease all restrictions on trade of agriculture produce. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, also passed on Sunday, lays down a new architecture for contract farming in the country to ensure farmers can engage with one another more confidently, enable modern supply chains and investments by agribusinesses. In a speech aimed at putting a lid on concerns of farmers’ groups, Modi said the existing agricultural state-regulated mandis -- also known as agricultural produce market committees or APMCs -- would continue to function. He also said the government would continue to buy farm produce at minimum support prices (MSPs). Also Read: On agricultural reforms, it’s important to tread with caution“APMCs will not shut down. The new laws are not against mandis and I also want to assure the country that the government will continue to buy farm produce at MSPs in every (farm marketing) season,” Modi said. The PM said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had strengthened the APMC system. “Every market has been computerised,” he said. To allay fears over an alleged weakening of the MSP mechanism, Modi said: “MSPs will continue like before. The proof for our commitment to MSP will come from a comparison of prices paid by our government with that of previous regimes.” MSPs are federally fixed statutory prices, mainly for rice and wheat, at which the government buys from farmers. Also Read: Endless arrogance of BJP govt has brought economic disaster: Rahul Gandhi“Our government has purchased 24% more oilseeds and pulses at MSPs. Even when the country was under the lockdown because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, there was record wheat procurement. The procurement of wheat, oilseeds and pulses was 30% more and farmers were paid a total of Rs 1,13,000 crore in MSPs,” Modi said. The new set of laws brought by the government allows direct purchase of produce from farmers outside APMCs. APMCs have enjoyed a monopoly in farm produce trade so far and there is evidence that trader cartels have often manipulated wholesale prices to the disadvantage of farmers and consumers. In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), had revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgaon APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik. Modi said farm produce would travel freely across states and farmers were already reaping benefits of open markets to get higher prices. “Ground reports tell us how the reforms have benefited farmers,” Modi said. In Bihar, traders bought potatoes directly from farmers for storage in cold chains at higher prices, the PM said. In Madhya Pradesh (MP), oil processing mills bought oilseeds from farmers paying between 20% and 30% more in June and July, he said. Modi said growers of pulses would get better prices in states such as Uttar Pradesh (UP), Chhattisgarh and West Bengal because of the freedom to directly sell to traders. Farmer organisations, such as the umbrella outfit, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said they would continue to protest these reforms, as the government passed them without adequate consultations, farm leader VM Singh said. The bills were passed amid stiff opposition in the Upper House and an ensuing chaos during a voice vote, which opposition parties said was unfair and unsound. The opposition said the deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha, Harivansh, did not allow detailed voting on the bills, called “division”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-pm-modi-says-farmers-to-get-better-prices-because-of-reforms/story-bsfDEu6UKP0ALU9YXBWL3I.html
21-09-2020||India||‘Some IPS officers worked to stop Thackeray govt’s march to power’: Shiv Sena||A day after Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh dismissed reports of him having made any claims that a group of IPS officers in the state had attempted to overthrow the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that an attempt was made to keep Devendra Fadnavis’ 80-hour government alive but it was foiled.An editorial in Saamana on Monday said that some IPS officers were working as if it was their responsibility to prove majority on the floor of the House.Deshmukh, in an interview with a vernacular media outlet in Maharashtra, was asked about a group of IPS officers working to prevent the Uddhav Thackeray-led government from coming to power. “I do not wish to say anything publicly on this. All officers work diligently but there are some officers who can have different ideologies,” the minister said. Following the interview, there were reports that Deshmukh had claimed that a plan to topple the government, hatched by some senior IPS officers, had been thwarted. Later, he issued a clarification stating, “This news is completely false... erroneous statements have been put into my mouth. Please see the video clip of the interview and you will realise that I had not said any such thing when I was asked to comment on whether there had been such a move planned by some IPS officers... I had only said that I cannot comment on such things openly.”The Sena mouthpiece said that several officers thought that the Fadnavis government will return to power after the 2019 assembly polls. “It was difficult for them to accept that despite having 105 legislators the BJP could not form the government... Some officers were involved in the early morning swearing in [of Devendra Fadnavis] before the President’s rule was imposed... In a bid to remain in the CM’s good books, some police officials even tried to net legislators of smaller parties and some Independents. It is even true that the State Intelligence Department also played a role. Some officers were working as if they had taken up the responsibility of proving the majority,” the editorial said.The editorial added that the state administration is “professional” and the “best”. “They do not have the power to make or break any government. It is not the culture of Maharashtra. If some minister thinks so that some officers are toppling the government then it sends a wrong message to people that the government is on a weak footing,” it said.It also indirectly slammed the BJP for thinking that officers’ lobby can help them topple the MVA government. It added that keeping an eye on elements who can pass on information to the opposition and work against the government is the job of the home department.“Some officers [who were involved] are still occupying high posts.

We will protest to restore the status quo ante of our members in Rajya Sabha,” Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.These eight MPs were suspended a day after ruckus in the upper house of Parliament during the passage of the farm bills. The behaviour of these parliamentarians were criticised by the ruling party leaders and the government.Chairman of the House, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, had termed the behaviour of members “unfortunate, unacceptable and condemnable” and one that has “tarnished” the image of Parliament, particularly the House of Elders.Two key farm bills were on Sunday passed by Rajya Sabha with voice vote amid unprecedented unruly scenes by protesting Opposition members who were demanding that the proposed legislation be referred to a House panel for greater scrutiny.After the bills were passed, the Opposition called it a “black day”, while the ruling party members sought action against the MPs responsible for the ruckus. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, at a press conference on Sunday evening, said the behavious has tarnished the image of Parliament.On Monday, when the proceedings began, the government moved a motion seeking suspension of eight MPs.Amid opposition, the motion was adopted by voice vote and Chairman Naidu asked them to leave the House but they remained present and protested against the ruling.“When the Chairman names a member then that member has to leave the House. Never before a member defied the orders of the Chair. Eight suspended MPs had misbehaved, it was a type of goondaism. They’ve proved that they have no trust in democracy,” Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said.As the protests continued, Naidu adjourned the proceedings for 20 minutes. The House saw three more adjournments as the suspended members remained present in the House and Opposition parties protested against the decision before the proceedings werre adjourned for the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-before-minister-slams-behaviour-of-8-suspended-rajya-sabha-mps-they-stage-protest/story-3qjB697r4CaX4qCPpdLaCL.html

The party is also planning a ‘high voltage’ campaign in these by-poll seats with chief minister Yogi Adityanath expected to be the lead campaigner along with other ministers and BJP functionaries, party leaders said.On Sunday, CM Yogi held a meeting with state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh at the former’s residence after which ministers were tasked with responsibility for seats due for by-polls.“As soon as the by-polls are announced, the chief minister would be canvassing for party in all 8 seats,” a BJP leader said, adding that several ministers would also campaign for the party.“It would be a high voltage campaign,” the party leader said, adding that no decision had yet been taken on conceding ally Nishad Party’s demand to let it contest the Jaunpur seat as part of an alliance.Also read: ‘Autocratic mindset’ - Mamata Banerjee fumes at suspension of 8 MPsMoreover, in a departure from its usual policy of not contesting by-polls, the Bahujan Samaj Party has decided to field candidates this time.The Congress too is holding meetings to finalise candidates as this would be the first electoral exercise in Uttar Pradesh after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had been given full-fledged responsibility of the state.The main opposition Samajwadi Party, which held two of the eight by-poll seats – Malhani in Jaunpur and Suar in Rampur - is also desperate to make an impression in these mini-polls.Of the two seats, the BJP is eyeing Suar seat which is considered a bastion of Samajwadi Party’s Rampur MP Azam Khan. The seat was won by Azam’s son Abdullah in 2017 UP polls but his subsequent disqualification paved the way for by-poll.Azam, who has a string of cases filed against him since 2017, is currently in jail along with his lawmaker wife Tazeen Fatima and Abdullah Azam.The BJP has decided to task state’s law minister Brajesh Pathak and party lawmaker Vijay Kashyap with the responsibility of Suar seat while it has given its backward classes welfare minister Anil Rajbhar the responsibility of Malhani seat in Jaunpur. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has been made in-charge of Ghatampur assembly seat while the other deputy CM Dinesh Sharma has been asked to look after Firozabad’s Tundla seat.Adityanath, after assessing the party strengths, said at the meeting with BJP leaders that the opposition was divided and desperate.“The CM laid stress on continuing the public outreach initiatives that the BJP has rolled out to help the poor and the needy during the pandemic. He specifically said the environment was favourable for the BJP though he also warned against getting complacent,” a party leader said.For the 6 bypoll-due seats held by the BJP, the party has named ministers Laxminarayan Chaudhary and Baldev Aulakh for Amroha; Ashok Kataria, Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev Agarwal for Bulandshahr. Surya Pratap Shahi and Satish Dwivedi would look after Deoria while Mahendra Singh and Suresh Pasi would look after Bangarmau seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-assembly-bypolls-cm-yogi-holds-meeting-as-party-mulls-names-high-voltage-campaign/story-110qAAljIa2IQujMhmU6OK.html
21-09-2020||India||People prefer WFH, fear using public transport due to Covid-19: Survey||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is still dissuading people from venturing out and travelling in public transport, as 74% workers are inclined to work from home (WFH), according to a joint survey of eight cities conducted by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) and consulting firm Primus Partners.About three-fourth of the respondents are inclined to WFH or want their companies to adopt other policy measures such as flexible working hours and staggered office schedule, the survey report said.“Our survey shows that 79% of the respondents in these eight cities or metropolitan regions were able to work from home during the pandemic. After the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions were lifted, we found that 74% of the respondents favoured WFH,” the report said. The eight cities that the survey covered were Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Pune.Also Read: India records 86,961 Covid-19 cases, lowest since Sept 16, as recovery rate rises over 80%While 18% of the respondents were in favour of a 100% WFH policy after the lockdown, 56% of them favoured a partial WFH. The report stated that 26% of the respondents preferred to do their jobs at workplaces.During the lockdown period 79% of these respondents did WFH, while 11% were on leave and 10% travelled to their respective offices, it said.“Companies have also seen the benefits of WFH, as it becomes location agnostic, allow them to cut down cost on expensive real estate (which can be redeployed for employee benefits, training, research & development etc.) and hire fresh talents across the country without having to focus on relocation,” it said.The report cited the example of a leading information technology (IT) firm based in Pune. The company recently made 112 new hires from Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Vijayawada, Chandigarh, Patna and Nashik and asked them to do WFH on a permanent basis. “This will allow employees to have a better work-life balance and not congest any of the bigger cities. Such initiatives will also lead to the growth of tier-2, 3 and 4 cities and towns in India,” it said.Also Read: Final analysis of second round of national Covid-19 sero survey underway: ICMRThe report stated that while public transport has largely been opened, 73% of the respondents would still prefer to use their own vehicles because of fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. “As a majority of office- goers prefer to work from home or inclined towards flexible working hours and staggered office schedules, public transportation in cities will undergo a radical shift,” said Nilaya Varma, chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder, Primus Partners.“To revive passengers’ sentiment and contribute towards building a safe ecosystem for commuters and drivers, transport operators need to adopt stringent hygiene guidelines and leverage technological solutions. These measures are essential, even as transport operators struggle with reduced footfall and lower capacity owing to social distancing guidelines,” he added.Companies must also revise policies to incorporate a decentralised working structure in a bid to guard against pandemics in the near future. Professionals surveyed exuded hope that companies would review and incorporate remote working, staggered working hours that would help ensure everyone did not report to work at the same point of time. This would also help lessen congestion in cities, he said. Devroop Dhar, managing director (MD) and co-founder, Primus Partners, said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has led to significant transformation across industries, pushing them to embrace technological solutions across their value chain ...”Corporate entities would also need to look at critical aspects such as information and data security, effective use of business collaboration and meeting tools and bringing in impactful employee engagement initiatives to prevent feelings of loneliness and social isolation, he said.He said WFH also provides the opportunity to public transport authorities and governments to facilitate the adoption of contactless ticketing and digital payments to boost passengers’ confidence in the short term and realise the vision of digital India in the long run. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-prefer-wfh-fear-using-public-transport-due-to-covid-19-survey/story-RtOPL0FUVWhp0wbSuD2pvL.html

Happens when Maharashtra govt has only the time to dismantle @KanganaTeam’s office! #Maharashtra #Bhiwandi,” the user had tweeted. Meanwhile Maharashtra government क-क-क-क-कंगना ..... if they stop being obsessed with me they will know how the entire state is collapsing. https://t.co/qSUBGApLLAAt least 10 people were killed after a three-storey building collapsed in the Patel Compound area in Bhiwandi. The building collapsed at around 3:40am.Ranaut’s tweet also came days after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished her office in the city. Her office in Pali Hill, Bandra was partially demolished by the civic body on September 10. She had moved the Bombay High Court against the demolition of what BMC termed as “illegal alterations” at her office.The civic body had earlier filed an affidavit in the high court, saying Ranaut had made substantial alterations and additions to the property unlawfully and that her allegations against it were “baseless”.Ranaut has been at loggerheads with the Maharashtra government since she criticised Mumbai Police’s handling of the investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. She referred to Mumbai as “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir” and “Pakistan” and triggered a political controversy. The state’s ruling alliance has accused her of carrying forward the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s political agenda. Ranaut got security from the BJP-ruled Centre amid her spat with Sena leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-they-stop-being-obsessed-with-me-kangana-ranaut-s-jibe-at-maharashtra-govt/story-tPjUpaf74OSUqwvB6KT5AJ.html

This ‘omniscient’ Govt’s endless arrogance has brought economic disaster for the entire country,” tweeted Gandhi, who is away in the US accompanying his mother and Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, for a health check-up.’Muting Of Democratic India’ continues: by initially silencing and later, suspending MPs in the Parliament & turning a blind eye to farmers’ concerns on the black agriculture laws.This ‘omniscient’ Govt’s endless arrogance has brought economic disaster for the entire country.The tweet came after Rajya Sabha chairperson, M Venkaiah Naidu, suspended eight opposition lawmakers over protests on Sunday against the government’s move to rush through the contentious farm reform bills.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill were cleared by voice vote in Rajya Sabha even as the Opposition members protested. The members stormed the Well of the House demanding that the bills be sent to a select committee for a review. Opposition leaders charged towards Rajya Sabha’s deputy chairman Harivansh’s seat as he was presiding over the proceedings. They jumped onto tables and shot videos of the ruckus.Also Read: Rajya Sabha: 8 Opposition MPs suspended for a week after protests over farm billsThe bills seek to allow farmers more flexibility in selling their produce. Many experts have hailed the reforms as significant, but some farmer bodies and opposition parties have insisted the new laws would only benefit corporate entities and traders and not the farmers.The minimum support price (MSP) regime has not been mentioned in the legislation. It has triggered fears the new laws will weaken the existing regime set by the government to purchase produce directly from farmers.In a series of tweets related to the legislation, Congress leader P Chidambaram separately questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government how will they guarantee the MSP to the farmers.Also Read: Democracy is ashamed of govt’s ‘death warrant’ against farmers: Rahul Gandhi on farm bills“The PM [Modi] and other ministers have promised that MSP will be guaranteed to the farmer. Pray tell us HOW?

How will the government guarantee MSP is paid in these transactions? Under which law is a private purchaser obliged to pay MSP to the farmer in a private transaction?”Chidambaram said the Modi government should stop lying to the farmers and making false promises. “The promise of guaranteeing MSP in private transactions is like the promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian,” he said.Chidambaram was referring to a speech Modi gave in 2014 election as the prime ministerial candidate in which he promised to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks within 100 days of coming to power. He had said that if all the black money was brought back, it would be enough to deposit Rs 15 lakh in every poor person’s bank account.The Congress has separately called a meeting of its general secretaries and in-charges of states to discuss the future course of action on the farm bills and give a final shape to its proposed nationwide agitation on the farm reforms issue.

Similar reports also poured in from government schools in border areas of RS Pura sector.Principal of the oldest school in the Union territory, Government SRML Higher Secondary School, Anjali Gupta said, “as per protocol, 50 percent faculty had come but not even a single student turned up today”. She, however, added, “It was the first day and it may take parents some time to motivate themselves and their children”.“Probably after a day or two the students desirous of clearing their doubts may start coming to the school,” she added.Also read: Unlock 4 - Schools at several places across India reopen partiallyGupta informed that the entire school was fumigated and all other protocols of sanitisers, thermal screening, masks and social distancing were being followed.Principal of Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School in Gandhi Nagar, Shafqat Chib said that no student turned up today in her school as well. Similar reports poured in from border areas of RS Pura and Arnia in Jammu district and adjoining Samba district.“Fifty percent school staff had come as per the directions but students remained elusive,” said a teacher posted in a government school in Arnia belt. She also said that there were no proper arrangements in place.“Cannabis of four feet height has not been cleared. There was none at the school gate for thermal screening. Three students of class 8 had come but they were not carrying any sanitisers. Further, they were not carrying the indemnity bond which has to be given by the parents,” she added. Another teacher from RS Pura sector also echoed similar views.Sonia Gupta, a parent, said, “the decision is not only idiotic but will prove extremely dangerous. The government should restore the 4G network for hassle-free online studies rather than reopening schools that could be disastrous for our children.”Prem Kumar, another parent, said, “Given the rise in Covid-19 cases and spiralling death toll, there is a fear among the parents. Tell me which right-thinking parent would like to send his children to the school in such a situation”.“The government is ready to put children into grave danger but it won’t restore 4G network on the grounds that terrorists use it to their advantage. Terrorists had been using satellite phones in the 90s. So, this argument serves no purpose. The government should better restore 4G network rather than putting children into danger.”He also expressed dismay over a demand for an indemnity bond from the parents that they won’t blame school authorities if anything untoward happens of the virus infects their children. “How could be they so insensitive?” he added.Principal secretary, school education, Dr Asgar Hassan Samoon said, “Centre has issued certain guidelines and therefore schools are being re-opened only for senior students of classes 9 to 12, that too, for consultation with teachers. Only 50 percent of the teachers have been mobilised.”Dr Samoon informed that everything was being done in strict accordance with the guidelines issued by the Union home and health ministries, adding, “It is a voluntary exercise. Students who feel they need in-person lessons from teachers can visit their schools. Online education will continue as before.”Jammu and Kashmir has already recorded more than 1,000 deaths and nearly 64,000 Covid-19 cases till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-re-open-in-j-k-with-50-staff-students-remain-elusive/story-j6HanlezEVZGmTGdDEaeHI.html
21-09-2020||India||Karnataka legislature session begins, farmers on protest march in Bengaluru||The monsoon session of the Karnataka assembly began on Monday amid protests by farmer organisations and the state government reaching out to opposition to cut short the session as some 50-60 MLAs are Covid-19 positive or in home isolation. The Congress, however, is in no mood to relent. A number of farmer organisations are staging a protest march in Bengaluru against what they say are anti-farmer bills passed by the Centre and the state. Karnataka had passed a law to allow non-agriculturists to buy farmland which they could not do so till recently. In May, the state amended the APMC act which allows farmers to directly sell to private players circumventing the 160 APMCs in the state. This had attracted the ire of some farmer organisations.Large parts of the state are also undergoing heavy rains and the farmer organisations want adequate compensation to be given to those who have suffered due to the recent floods.The state government wants the session, which is currently scheduled for 10 days - till September 30, to be shortened to three days. Nearly 10 members of the BS Yediyurappa cabinet - deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan, home minister Basvaraj Bommai, among others - have tested Covid-19 positive or are under isolation. Several opposition leaders too, including former minister and Congress leader Priyank Kharge, have tested positive for coronavirus and are in isolation.Chief minister Yediyurappa tried to reach out to Congress leader Siddaramiah and JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy to see whether the Business Advisory Committee could agree to shorten the session. However, till now the opposition has not agreed to cut short the session. CM Yediyurappa said he would want the opposition parties’ cooperation to shorten the session given the ongoing pandemic as nearly 55-60 MLAs are unable to attend the session.While administration officials said that extraordinary precaution has been taken to ensure safety measures are in place, KPCC president DK Shivakumar, speaking to the media on Monday, said that there were more than 78 bills that the government was trying to pass which required detailed discussion. “We want answers for the more than 1,600 questions we have submitted in both Houses. We want to highlight the corruption in the government while purchasing Covid care equipment. There is no question of us agreeing to shorten the session.”On the Karnataka cabinet expansion, CM Yediyurapa had said that he is awaiting directions from the party high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-legislature-session-begins-farmers-on-protest-march-in-bengaluru/story-qpMKVsBuvHI10jOGXDsNpO.html

We won’t bow down and we’ll fight this fascist government in Parliament and on the streets,” Banerjee tweeted.TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen were among eight opposition MPs suspended for a week by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Monday for ‘unruly behaviour’ with deputy chairperson Harivansh Narayan Singh a day ago. Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah, Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Sanjay Singh, and CPI(M) leaders KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem are six other members of the House who have been suspended for a week.The suspensions came after the dramatic scenes in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday, as opposition leaders, with TMC’s O’Brien at the forefront, stormed the well of the House to protest against the passage of the two of the three contentious farm bills introduced by the Narendra Modi government.Farmers in both Punjab and Haryana have taken to streets against the bills, alleging that these would lead to dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system. However, the government, including Prime Minister Modi, has repeatedly assured the farmers the MSP system will not be withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-fight-in-parliament-and-on-streets-mamata-banerjee-on-suspension-of-8-rajya-sabha-mps/story-nk49F2vY482EreNQA7bimM.html

21-09-2020||India||Lockdown effect: Domestic tea prices rise even as global prices at multi-year low||The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for tea rose by 79% on an annual basis in the month of August. This is the highest rise in tea prices under the current WPI series. Wholesale prices for tea have has risen by over 130% since March this year. To be sure, the rise in retail prices has been much lower. However, a future rally cannot be ruled out, given the massive hike in wholesale prices. According to tea producers, the hike in tea prices is mainly due to the drop in production for nearly a month (from March end to early May) during the Covid -19-induced national lockdown apart from extended rainfall this year. They stated that the imposition of lockdown caused a disruption in the tea supply chain which has affected tea auctions as well. “This year, from April-end till now, we have sold around 49 million kg whereas last year we had sold nearly 63 million kg during the same period,” said Priyanuz Dutta, secretary of Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC). Tea producers see the recent increase in prices in the domestic market as a positive development for the industry. “The current rise in prices have come as a boost to the tea industry as the industry was in dire straits due to lower prices in the last few years,” said Kamal Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Siliguri Tea Auction Committee. SK Saria, Managing Director of Songachi Tea Estate, said that the current rise in prices will help tea planters recover some of the losses that they incurred on account of lower production this year. The domestic price rally in tea comes even as tea prices in the global markets are at a multi-year low. Data from International Monetary Fund (IMF) commodity portal shows that tea prices in the international markets are at a six-year low. The World Bank, in its latest report in April 2020, had predicted tea prices to drop by 10% in 2020 due to weak demand. Will high prices lead to an import surge? Tea leaf has a weight of 0.96 in the CPI basket which is almost the same as potatoes (0.98). If growing wholesale prices percolate into retail markets, they will add to the already worsening inflationary pressures in the economy. Retail inflation has been above 6%, the upper limit of Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) comfort level, for five consecutive months now. Food inflation has been even higher. It grew to 9% in August. If tea prices continue to increase sharply, the demand for imports as a counter-cyclical measure could grow. Data from the commerce ministry shows that India is a net exporter of tea. The exports which had fallen in the month of March and April were at 11 months high in the month of July. The data also shows that tea imports have increased in the last two months. Imports worth 11.2 million USD were made in July 2020 which is the highest in the last five years. Tea imports in India have a 100% duty at present; while it is nil for re-exports. In mid-August, the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations (CCPA), the apex body of tea associations in India, had urged the Union commerce minister not to reduce import duty on tea, as such a move would lead to the erosion of domestic prices and subsequently affect the economic viability of the tea gardens and the livelihood of lakhs of people, as per a PTI report. Viren Shah ,Chairman of Federation of All India Tea Traders Association (FAITTA), said that tea imports have increased in recent months mainly for re-exports. “If the prices stay this high, the imports in domestic market could increase even after import duty,” he added.

Apart from Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, the second three-star officer will be Lieutenant General PGK Menon, who will be a representative of the army headquarters, the officials said.Menon is set to replace Singh as the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps soon as the latter will be completing his term next month. Singh has been leading the military talks with China to reduce border tensions. He took charge of the corps in October 2019.The military dialogue at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) across the Chushul sector will also, for the first time, involve the participation of a joint secretary-ranked officer from the ministry of external affairs as a step to ensure that the talks yield a positive outcome, the officials said, requesting anonymity. The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, the diplomatic dialogue between the two countries, involves a representative of the Indian defence ministry.Also read | PLA mobilises theatre commandsCorps commander-ranked officers from the two armies have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock in the Ladakh sector, which has seen a significant military build-up by both sides.The Indian Air Force (IAF) is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert amid heightened border tensions with China. IAF’s current fleet of five Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission, the officials cited above said. A high-powered panel on China reviewed the latest developments in the Ladakh sector last week, with a focus on charting the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). The agenda for Monday’s military talks between Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers was discussed at the high-level meeting, even as the situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area.Also read | Altitude begins to take a toll in LadakhThe meeting of Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers will be their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso is now controlled by the Indian Army and that allows it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on September 10.Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC since the tensions began in early May. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching forward areas they could previously patrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-and-china-military-talks-2-indian-lieutenant-generals-to-hold-fort/story-BPDvlRvmfwmSDkE8NGCElK.html

You will cast a vote on the symbol of lotus here and one brick will be fitted in the temple. With the vote, you will earn ‘punya’ also.” According to locals, the video was shot when Athiya was campaigning for his party in a village in support of transport minister Govind Singh Rajput, who is likely to contest the by-election from Surkhi assembly constituency in Sagar district. The by-election is going to be held in Madhya Pradesh on 28 seats of assembly constituency by November end as announced by the Election Commission. However, HT couldn’t verify the authenticity of the video clip. Govind Singh Rajput is among 22 MLAs who resigned in March to join BJP. He was inducted in the state cabinet of Shivraj Singh Chouhan on April 21 without being a member of the state assembly. Also read: Madhya Pradesh HC asks state functionaries, parties to abide by Covid-19 protocol  After the video went viral, Athiya refused to talk to the media. Govind Singh Rajput said he won’t comment as he had not seen any such video. BJP state spokesperson Dhairyavardhan Singh said, “Lord Ram is a matter of faith. The BJP worker might get emotional while talking with people. But we are not sure about the authenticity of the video so we will also check the credentials of the video.” Congress said the BJP was trying to get votes in the name of Lord Ram as they failed to do any development work. MP Congress committee spokesperson Ajay Singh Yadav said, “BJP leaders realized that they are going to lose by-elections so they are using the name of Lord Ram. The Election Commission should take action against them because they are politicizing the matter of faith of people and misleading them while playing with their religious sentiments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-worker-asks-for-vote-in-name-of-ram-temple-video-goes-viral/story-tRcQ9eMcBIvMfdHMREMLPP.html
21-09-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh HC asks state functionaries, parties to abide by Covid-19 protocol||Talking a serious note of huge gatherings during political parties’ meetings in the state as highlighted in a petition, Madhya Pradesh High Court’s Gwalior bench, in its interim order, asked political parties and functionaries to strictly abide by Covid-19 protocol, as per the order. The court’s order was passed on a petition on Friday filed by one Ashish Pratap Singh who brought to the attention of the court huge gatherings in meetings held by political parties in various constituencies which are to witness bypolls by November end. The petitioner urged the court to direct authorities to take action against political parties. A copy of the order came to light on Sunday night. The double bench of the court comprising of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava said, “It is undisputed that Covid-19 pandemic situation is on the rise. Various instructions and precautionary guidelines have been issued from time to time by the central government/state government to contain the aftermath. In the present petition, allegations are made against the political functionaries, who are supposed to be a role model for persons they represent. It is urged that a leader ought to lead by example.” Also read: 8 Opposition Rajya Sabha MPs suspended for a week after protests over farm billsThe court said, “Though learned counsel for the petitioner has filed various photographs showing gatherings of a lot of people at a place, at this stage the said photographs cannot be connected to any incident as alleged without sufficient evidence. However, if the photographs filed are taken to be of recent congregations as alleged, then the political functionaries/administrative authorities appear to be acting irresponsibly. Law, whether statutory or in shape of executive instructions, deserves respect and obedience, as much from a common man as from a leader, a political functionary and even the head of State. This court is reminded of the maxim “Be you ever so high, the Law is above you””. The court further said, “Therefore, as an interim measure, in the interest of public at large, rather in the interest of the nation, we trust and expect that till next date of hearing political functionaries and the functionaries of the state shall strictly abide by the ‘Covid-19 protocol’ prescribed by the central government, state government and the district magistrate of the concerned district from time to time for regulating the congregation of any nature.” The court appointed advocates Sanjay Dwivedi, Raju Sharma and VD Sharma as amicus curiae ‘to assist this court for rendering justice’. The next date of hearing is fixed on September 28, 2020. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Congress party leaders have been violating and ignoring Covid-19 related protocol right from day one. When Congress was in power it didn’t implement the central government’s advisory on the disease and now when it’s in the opposition, its leaders are hardly seen wearing masks. The BJP is for strict compliance of all Covid-19 related orders and advisory.” State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “The way huge gatherings are being organised in BJP’s rallies and by their own admission is really shocking. The BJP government is not taking any action in this regard for obvious reasons. There should be FIRs against organisers of such rallies and events of the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-hc-asks-state-functionaries-parties-to-abide-by-covid-19-protocol/story-vu8ppAXsQpaC0Oe66j36wO.html

The country’s tally to rose to 5,487,580 and the death toll to 87,882, data showed at 8am.There are 1,003,299 active cases of the coronavirus disease and 4,396,399 recoveries after 93,356 patients were cured and discharged across the country in the last 24 hours. This takes India’s recovery rate to 80.11%.The health ministry has said India, the second worst-hit country, has the highest number of recovered Covid-19 patients globally, constituting 19% of the total recoveries across the world. “India occupies the top position in the world in terms of total recoveries. More than 43 lakh have recovered. India’s recoveries constitute 19% of the total global recoveries,” the ministry said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is actively exploring saliva-based test for detection of Covid-19 and asserted that no significant or drastic mutation in strains of Sars-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, has been found in India till now.Vardhan said during an interaction with his social media followers that ICMR has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of Sars-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time-points. He added that detailed results on mutations and evolution of the virus will be available in early October.Also read | Taj Mahal reopens for visitors with strict Covid-19 protocol: Everything you need to knowICMR has successfully completed the second round of serosurvey, to know the prevalence of coronavirus disease in the country, and the final phase of results is currently being analysed. “The final phase analysis of the survey is now underway and will offer a comparison with the results of the first survey,” it said in a statement.The serosurvey is done by analysing blood samples of selected individuals for antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It determines a past infection, considering a majority of patients do not exhibit symptoms and not everyone is getting tested for the viral infection.The health minister, during his interaction, also sought to dispel fears caused by the suspension of trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, saying vaccine development is a complex process and trials have restarted only after an independent investigative expert committee permitted them to proceed.He explained the difference between various vaccines under clinical trial in India and that since formulations, doses, route of administration are different for the vaccines, their mechanisms of action are also different.Vardhan also spoke on the role of traditional medicine in the present context and said that the AYUSH ministry has developed research protocols for validating claims of various Ayush practitioners for Covid-19 solutions although no formulation has been validated as a specific drug.Globally, there are more than and 959,332 people have died, according to the coronavirus tracker of Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-86-961-covid-19-cases-lowest-since-sept-16-as-recovery-rate-rises-over-80/story-xPjzAbHwJsv8wcTO7zUPgK.html

Agriculture minister Prem Kumar launched the much talked about project at Kurkribigha, which has been selected as the first model village by the Rural Development Council (RDC) in the country to grow biofortified wheat, which contains a high proportion of zinc and other micronutrients. The minister said that cultivation of biofortified wheat would also be launched at another village in Gaya, the minister’s home town, and formalities for community farming would complete soon. “Production of biofortified grains would ensure highest value-for-money investments for economic prosperity of farmers,” he added. Also read: At 4.3 million, India has highest recovered Covid-19 cases in the world, says health ministryPrevalence of Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the state to food and nutritional insecurity. The state has a 72.7 percent death rate, generally attributed to malnutrition in children ageing less than five years, as compared to the national average of 69.2 percent. This state-wide data on malnutrition was presented by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) last year. Kumar said that farmers would get free of cost seeds, along with other farm input such as organic manure and mechanical tools to prepare the fields for farming and harvesting the crop. “Farming of biofortified wheat, maize and other cereals like paddy would be extended to other parts of the state upon successful completion of the pilot project in the two villages,” said the minister. Citing a national-level study, the minister said children who ate high-zinc wheat, as chapatti or puri flatbread, or as porridge, experienced 17 percent fewer days with pneumonia and 39 percent fewer days vomiting, compared to children who consumed a lower zinc variety typical of conventional wheat. “Mothers who ate high-zinc wheat spent 9 percent fewer days with fever,” said Kumar. Bihar agriculture management extension training institute (Bameti), a state government institute, would provide necessary skill training to farmers for cultivation of biofortified wheat with technical support from Mahindra and Mahindra and other multinational organisation engaged in health and nutritional programmes. An agricultural scientist of RDC said that zinc was an essential micronutrient, required for healthy growth and development. “Inadequate zinc intake can weaken the immune system, making children more vulnerable to infections and respiratory illnesses like pneumonia, which are the two principal killers of children of this age around the world,” he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-launches-pilot-project-for-community-cultivation-of-biofortified-wheat-first-in-country/story-jwMvrtp9gvykVdgYfsnMMN.html
21-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha: 8 Opposition MPs suspended for a week after protests over farm bills||Eight opposition MPs, including Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and AAP’s Sanjay Singh, were suspended from Rajya Sabha for a week under Rule 256(2) on Monday for their “unruly behaviour” during the fierce protests over the farm bills on Sunday. The government moved a motion for their suspension for “bringing disrepute” to the House. The motion was approved by the House amid protests from Opposition leaders. However, the no-confidence motion against deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh filed by the Opposition was not accepted by the chair.Also Read: Stormy Sunday in House as 2 farm bills go throughApart from O’Brien and Singh, Congress leaders Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah, CPIM’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem and Trinamool’s Dola Sen were suspended. The suspended MPs initially refused to leave and shouted slogans, prompting Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House till 10am. When the House resumed, the suspended MPs continued their protests and the House was adjourned for another half an hour.Naidu, visibly upset over Sunday’s development, made an observation at 9.30am, at the end of the zero hour, listing all “unruly offences” committed by the Opposition MPs in the House. He said that apart from shouting slogans and “dancing on the table”, some MPs even tried to “physically harm the deputy chairman”. During his speech, O’Brien and others started protesting. Also Read: Parliament monsoon session: Naidu rejects no-confidence motion against HarivanshNaidu named O’Brien and asked him to leave the House. Minutes later, the government moved a resolution seeking the suspension of eight MPs who led the protests on Sunday. The resolution was adopted through a voice vote. The suspended MPs didn’t leave the House and instead started a new round of protests. The chair has the option of calling the marshals to forcibly evict the MPs but so far, Naidu has not opted for that extreme step. Rajya Sabha was then adjourned till Tuesday after Members who were suspended refused to leave the House. The chair insisted that business could be taken up only after the members leave the house. Bhuwaneswar Kalita, who was in the chair, said a statement by Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad could only be allowed once the MPs leave the house.This is not the first time a number of MPs have been suspended in the House. During the Telangana issue, a large number of MPs were suspended in Lok Sabha. During the debate on the women’s reservation bill during the UPA 1 regime, MPs were suspended in the Rajya Sabah for unruly behaviour.On Sunday, the Rajya Sabha turned into a battlefield. Senior leaders charged towards the deputy chairman, gheraoed him, uprooted microphones, jumped up on tables, flouted rules to shoot videos of the ruckus and shouted slogans. Authorities called marshals to form a double-layered barricade to protect the Chair, remove an MP from the table, muted live proceedings and refused to accept the Opposition’s demand for a division—voting through paper ballots—on the bills. The high-pitched protests were also the most aggressive in recent years and continued even after the House was adjourned at 1pm. Opposition parties sat in Rajya Sabha for the next two hours and drafted a no-confidence motion against newly re-elected Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh before firing salvoes against the government on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-8-opposition-mps-suspended-for-a-week-after-protests-over-farm-bills/story-ImR5VMKW92ONwgKZ7txaNJ.html

Also, request MPs to follow COVID protocol,” Kalita said.* Earlier, the House was adjourned till 10:36am and by chairman M Venkaiah Naidu till 10:30am after announcing the one-week suspensions unruly behaviour with the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman on Sunday. Naidu had also rejected the no-confidence motion moved by the Opposition against Deputy Chairman Harivansh saying that it is “not admissible under the rules”.* On Sunday, as many as 100 members from 12 opposition parties had submitted a no-confidence motion against Harivansh after he overruled opposition pleas for postponing agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply to the debate on the two farm bills till Monday since the sitting time scheduled of the House was over.* Chief minister of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee tweeted on Monday that the suspension of eight Rajya Sabha members reflects the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s “autocratic mindset”. “Suspension of the 8 MPs who fought to protect farmers interests is unfortunate & reflective of this autocratic Govt’s mindset that doesn’t respect democratic norms & principles. We won’t bow down & we’ll fight this fascist Govt in Parliament & on the streets,” Banerjee tweeted. * Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, the Trinamool’s chief whip of Trinamool Congress in the Upper House, said the role of the chair in the suspension of the opposition MPs was “ex facie partisan, unprecedented and unlawful”.* “Amendments of several members for referring the matter to Select Committee were not taken up for disposal before passing of the bill by so-called voice vote. The role of the Chair in this context was ex facie partisan, unprecedented and unlawful. Without considering this illegality committed yesterday giving birth to strong protests from the Opposition, their voices have further been throttled when some of them have been suspended today for the remaining period of the current session,” Ray said in a statement.* “This way the Upper House is not run. If Constitutional Authorities, in this case, the Deputy Chairman of the Upper House of the Parliament, act as per their whims and fancies in blatant violation of rules and in detriment to the laid down procedures of the parliamentary democratic system, the country is destined to fall prey to majoritarianism, if not fascism,” he added. Ray said such developments must be condemned by all.* The suspended MPs later sat outside Parliament to protest, carrying placards with “We Will Fight For Farmers” and “Parliament Assassination” written in English, Hindi and Bengali.* Rajya Sabha witnessed unruly scenes on Sunday as opposition members stormed the well and reached the deputy chairman’s seat to protest against the farm bills debated and passed by the Upper House through voice vote.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-mps-suspended-from-rajya-sabha-for-a-week-after-chaos-over-2-farm-bills/story-p9AdsZqQ9sQJ5tWZf4ivgI.html

Most of the district units and frontal organisations were lying dormant since party president Akhilesh Yadav dissolved them after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls debacle. “In the last three weeks, the party has appointed presidents, vice presidents and, in some cases, more office-bearers of the district and mahanagar units and frontal organisations. Whichever districts are left will soon get their office-bearers,” said SP MLC Sunil Singh ‘Sajan’. He said the party has had made hundreds of appointments in Yuvjan Sabha, Mulayam Singh Youth Brigade, Chatra Sabha (students wing), Mahila Sabha (women’s wing), Adhikvakta Sabha (lawyers wing) and Vyapaar Prakostha (traders wing) et cetera. Also read: Parliament monsoon session - What to expect today“The party is fully reactivated and re-energised. We took to the streets earlier also during the past several months. First, we have a major statewide protest - as called by party chief Akhilesh Yadav - on Monday and the effect of the party’s reactivation would be visible then,” said a newly appointed district president. The Samajwadi Party has given a call to all its units - up to the tehsil level - to protest on September 21 against the state government over unemployment, farmers’ issues, collapsed law and order and corruption in health services in these Covid-19 times, he said. The party has also issued instructions to the units to submit memorandums (addressed to the governor) to the district officers at tehsils and district headquarters during the protest, he further said.

Till now, only Akhilesh had been holding video conferencing with party leaders in districts. Akhilesh, as a customary practice, had dissolved all district and frontal organisations and state units (barring the state president’s post) after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which, despite an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the SP could win only five seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eyeing-2022-assembly-polls-re-energised-samajwadi-party-to-begin-battle-from-streets/story-n4vVEGIw9ZQM8OEI4QeIsO.html

The meeting started at 8.40 am. The government, on the other hand, is contemplating a move to seek action against some Opposition MPs who were aggressively involved in the ruckus on Sunday. Senior leaders had charged towards the deputy chairman, gheraoed him, uprooted microphones, jumped up on tables, flouted rules to shoot videos of the ruckus and shouted slogans. The protests were also the most aggressive in recent years and continued even after the House was adjourned at 1pm.

The priests will be submitting a list of their demands/suggestions to the state government within a week. Mayur Dixit, district magistrate Uttarkashi said, “The priests have agreed to end their protest. We have asked the priest community to give their suggestions and problems with the Char Dham Board in writing within a week. This will further be sent to the officials of the Board.” On June 21, The Uttarakhand High Court had dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and fifty-one other shrines through the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. The court ruled that the ownership of the temple properties would vest in Char Dham shrines and power of the Board would be confined only to the administration and management of the properties. Last December, the Uttarakhand assembly had passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill. In January, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent for the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019.

They had alleged that the government took the step to ensure its control over shrine-related issues, bypassing the powerful priest community. Deepak Semwal, secretary of Gangotri Dham Committee said that priests from the shrine had a meeting with the district administration after which they have been assured that their suggestions and demands for the Board will be noted. “The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board was, in a way, imposed upon us with the government not holding any talks with us. Now, the officials from the Board want to set up their office near Gangotri shrine. We do not know what work will be done from that office and have asked the district administration to make that clear to us. After talks with the administration, we have also stopped our protests as we have been assured that our suggestions and demands would be considered,” said Semwal. He added that the priests will be submitting a list of suggestions/demands to the district administration after which further talks will be held with the representatives of the Board but till then they will not allow the setting up of an office near the shrine. Priests from Gangotri had started their protest around the last week of June, alleging that the state government was forcing the rules of the Board on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gangotri-priests-end-agitation-against-char-dham-board-after-talks-with-state-govt/story-LIeZMRy7InEwfTqUeTCCzI.html

The system is likely to move west-northwest wards leading to easterly winds at lower levels, which is likely to bring in a lot of moisture even to the north-western region. We are not seeing any parametres of monsoon withdrawal being met in the next two days. Rainfall should stop completely but it rained in western Rajasthan on Saturday and there is water vapour in the region; anti-cyclonic wind pattern is also not established yet. We have to monitor if conditions are becoming favourable for withdrawal after the low-pressure area weakens. But the monsoon season will end on September 30.

They urged to focus on influenza-like Illness (ILI) /Severe Acute Respiratory infection (SARI) cases, 100 percent house-to-house survey, contact tracing and increasing the number of testing, especially with RAT. The team said the focus should be on data analysis and stepping up testing, contact tracing and surveillance of areas from where more cases are detected so that the chain of virus spread could be broken.Also read: 4 coronavirus vaccines in advanced stages of pre-clinical trial - Harsh VardhanThe team suggested various measures that could be implemented in the containment zones and asked to involve ASHA and field Health staff to identify influenza-like illness (ILI) cases so that testing of all can be done. Door-to-door survey was suggested for identifying high-risk people like pregnant women, the elderly and those with co-morbidities.The working of the new Government Medical College (GMC) Kathua, GMC Rajouri, GMC Doda was also reviewed.Dr Vijay Handa, associate professor, AIIMS, asked principals to focus on hospital infection control measures, donning/doffing and biomedical waste management. Further, he called for following SOPs by all the staff members, besides preparing and following the treatment protocols. They were urged to increase the isolation and ventilator beds so that referral is reduced to Jammu, also to follow referral protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-reviews-covid-19-control-measures-in-6-districts-of-jammu-region/story-jQOWyz0Erai6CYYng4TCWK.html
21-09-2020||India||4 coronavirus vaccines in advanced stages of pre-clinical trial: Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said more than four vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has claimed the lives of nearly 87,000 people in India, are in advanced stages of pre-clinical trial in the country.Harsh Vardhan said in Parliament on Sunday that the government is giving all necessary support for the development of a vaccine against the coronavirus disease in the country and that three vaccine candidates are in different phases of clinical trial.“One hundred and forty-five vaccine candidates across the world are under pre-clinical evaluation, around 35 under clinical trials. In India, we gave all support to 30 vaccine candidates - three of these are in advanced trials of phases 1, 2, and 3. Over four in advanced stages of the pre-clinical trial,” Harsh Vardhan said in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the coronavirus pandemic.The government is closely tracking the progress of candidates being tested by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited and Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is one of the frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has struck a production and clinical trials deal with AstraZeneca for the UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has till now been tested in the most number of people among the close to 200 options across the world.He also listed out a series of steps taken to contain the spread of the viral infection and combat the pandemic in the country.“On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the world about such disease. But we had started work from January 8. By January 17, we had issued a detailed health advisory and started point of entry surveillance and community surveillance. On January 30, when the first case in India was reported, authorities did 162 contact tracing,” he said.The health minister said so far 63.7 million tests have been conducted in the country which is “probably the highest in the world”.Also read | Covid-19: What we need to know today“Even today, 40 lakh people were kept under community surveillance. Contract tracing of more than 1 crore people was done. Fifteen lakh people were screened at airports. When the first case in Nepal was reported, 16 lakh people were screened on the border. From March 16 to March 23, more than half of the states have imposed partial or complete lockdown,” he added.Harsh Vardhan said that the ministry of health and family welfare has received Rs 893.93 crore from PM-CARES Fund for 50,000 made in India ventilators. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) under the National Disaster Relief Fund made the provision of Rs 11,000 crore to all state governments wherein the State Disaster Management Funds could be used.He said there are 17,000 Covid-19 facilities in the country which have nearly 1.8 million beds, 13,000 quarantine centres have 600,000 beds. To handle pandemic like this in the future, Harsh Vardhan said that work has started under Atmanirbhar Swasthya Bharat in which Rs 65,000 crore package has been allocated.India’s tally of the coronavirus disease went past the 5.4 million mark and the death toll rose to 86,752, according to the health ministry’s data till Sunday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-coronavirus-vaccines-in-advanced-stages-of-pre-clinical-trial-harsh-vardhan/story-c6enGgf3ts0wXIZsT0QHgJ.html

About 160 tickets were booked online but first to enter was a tourist from Taiwan staying in India, officials said. A maximum of 5,000 visitors will be allowed in two shifts per day into the monument which will be a sight for sore eyes with its well-manicured lawns. Officials at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said they had not neglected the monument despite its gates having remained closed for so long. Tight Covid-19 protocol will be followed for checking tourists. There will be no window ticket sale, visitors can scan the code to purchase tickets or book online through the ASI website or the mobile app.Not many paid Rs 200 to visit the main mausoleum but appeared more content taking photos of the monument and clicking themselves on the ‘Diana seat’.  Also read: Covid-19 - What we need to know today“Lawns were maintained all through these six months and we are all set for the Taj re-opening from September 21 – from sunrise to sunset. All would go through thermal check and they would be provided with sanitizer,” said AN Gupta, conservation assistant, ASI at Taj Mahal.  Gupta said not more than five visitors will be allowed at a time within the main mausoleum which houses the graves of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Taj Mahal will remain closed on Fridays,” said Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh.   Vasant Swarnkar, superintending archaeologist for ASI’s Agra circle, said, “The Taj Mahal will have visitors in two slots — pre-lunch and post-lunch. In each slot, there would be a maximum of 2,500 visitors. Once tickets for the first slot are sold, tickets will be issued for the second slot. In a day, a maximum of 5,000 visitors can visit Taj Mahal.”  Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans will remain at a distance and check visitors with hand-held metal detectors. While no goods are to be carried inside Taj Mahal, an ambulance would be ready at the gates, Gupta said.  Taj reopening has excited all those who make a living in and around the monument. For instance, Munawwar Ali, 50, began cleaning items at his marble goods shop on Sunday for the first time since March 16.  “We have called the staff on Monday after six months. We expect business to be slow but at least we will see tourists going to the Taj,” said Ali who has a shop adjoining the western gate of the monument.  ‘Yes, we are excited about the reopening of the Taj after such a long duration. A day will come when international flights will resume. In the beginning, domestic tourists from nearby regions would come,” said Rajiv Tiwari, president of the Federation of Travel Association of Agra. “ASI needs to follow the Covid-19 protocol so that all goes smoothly. The government should begin thinking about restarting international flights as European nations have resumed tourism. We have to live with the coronavirus,” Tiwari added.  Indians will have to pay Rs 50 per ticket for visiting Taj Mahal and shell out Rs 200 more for entering the main mausoleum. During routine days, it was mostly foreign tourists who used to pay extra to enter the main mausoleum. Tourism trade experts recollect that the Taj Mahal had never remained closed for such a long period before. The decision to close monuments all over the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic was taken on March 17, before the lockdown.  “It is perhaps for the first time that the ‘monument of love’, which attracts a large number of tourists to India, had been closed for such a long time,” said Arun Dang, former president of Tourism Guild.   “This is unprecedented. Though the monument was closed during the Second World War and also during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, the closure had not been so long,” said Dang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taj-mahal-re-opens-for-public-after-six-months-visitors-to-be-divided-into-two-slots/story-bivVQbNEfcWvE0yySmrNmK.html

In order to increase pressure on China to resolve the border impasse peacefully, the Indian government has banned 224 Chinese mobile apps in the last three months, including popular ones like Tik-Tok, UC Browser and WeChat.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();An analysis of imports of Chinese items shows that a complete boycott of Chinese everyday goods is easier said than done. Data from commerce ministry shows imports from China have only fallen by 14.5 % in the past two years to $65.26 billion in 2019-20 after reaching a high of $76.8 billion in 2017-18. Even after such a reduction in imports, a majority of daily household items are still largely brought in from China. Over 50% of items like footwear, knitted fabrics and furniture products, among others, are imported from China.A further breakup of yearly import data shows that electrical machinery and equipment is the largest category of products imported from China, comprising around 30% of Chinese imports in 2019-20. While calls for a reduction in Chinese imports in last few years has caused their imports to fall in the last two years, certain items like lithium ion that is used in batteries in mobile phones and other portable electronic devices has seen an increase of over 100% in imports in the last two years. The import data also shows that India purchases over 80 % of its lithium ion requirements from China. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Given the increasing use of mobile devices and portable equipment in Indian households in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, the imports of such products from China are going to increase unless Indian manufacturers find an alternative source. The data indicates that the call for a complete ban on Chinese imports would cause a disruption of supplies and increase in their cost in the local market .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-households-in-india-bank-on-chinese-imports/story-ysxqIEtvPaYIA1dPFxYFZM.html
21-09-2020||India||Little bits of China all around us||Bhagirath Palace, India’s biggest wholesale lights market, is a long row of shopfronts festooned with strings of LED lights for sale — green, blue, red, yellow, white; all flickering brightly to evoke the Diwali spirit on a sultry afternoon two months ahead of the festival of lights.Ashok Malhotra’s first-floor shop is a fascinating jewel in this crown. Almost all of the lights on display in his flickering shop, Malhotra informs us, are imported from the Guzhen, famous as China’s (and slowly the world’s) lighting capital.Malhotra’s shop showcases the Chinese city’s mastery in light-making – from a variety of “fancy” fittings on the wall, to designer lamps on the floor, to chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. “They are all Chinese,” says the affable Malhotra, sitting behind his desk. “We have about 400 designs of chandeliers, but only about 10 of them are Indian.”In fact, not just his shop, 90% of the lights in this market (from small LED bulbs to expansive and expensive chandeliers) are Chinese.Malhotra casts his eyes to the ceiling to find some Indian chandeliers, and finally spots two in a nondescript corner. “Most people want to but only Chinese lights — they are fancier and cheaper. We are all patriotic, but the idea of dealing in only Indian goods is not practical at the moment. For two decades, we have allowed China to make inroads into all aspects of life; the march towards self-reliance is going to be a long and painful process.” Most traders in Bhagirath Palace, and in Sadar Bazar, which is India’s biggest wholesale market for household goods, and in Teliwara, the largest toy hub, are wondering what the future holds for them as the Union government pushes the Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self- Reliant India ) initiative. The steps include raising import duties and making Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification mandatory for several items, including LED lights imported from China and other countries, in the wake of the pandemic and rising border tensions in eastern Ladakh. These traders talk about the “implausibility” of the sudden curbs on Chinese imports, and how they be thrown out of businessIn one corner of Bhagirath Palace, Harsh Jain, a dealer of electrical switches and LED lights, has started selling Diwali decorations — mostly rope lights imported from Guzhen. But this year, for the first time, he has created a special portion inside his shop for Indian lights to try and respond to the government’s call. So far, the Indian lights – a dozen sample strings flickering on a shelf -- have few takers. “My customers, mostly retailers from north India, face no nationalistic dilemmas. Most of them are buy only Chinese lights because they are more attractive in terms of price and quality. Guzhen boasts of thousands of light-making factories, and India’s small-scale manufacturers do not have the wherewithal to match them in quality, variety, and cost,” Jain said.According to Bharat Ahuja, president of the Bhagirath Palace Electrical Market Association, traders are so heavily dependent on Chinese imports that stopping them will paralyse the market. “Before curbing imports, the government has to promote manufacturing in a big way through the right policy initiatives. The fact is that setting up and running a factory in India continues to be a difficult proposition,” said Ahuja, who manufactures electrical switch gears and MCBs (miniature circuit breakers). Barely three kilometres away, Sadar Bazar illustrates the true scale of the problem. Here, China’s dominance in the Indian household goods market, and the difficulty in adhering to a boycott call, is even more apparent.Rakesh Kumar Yadav, president of the Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association, says 70% of all goods sold in the market are from China. Thousands of shops in the market’s narrow, labyrinthine gallis sell wall clocks, cosmetics, toys, plastic goods, artificial jewellery, food choppers, coffee makers, blenders and hairdryers… “You name it, we sell it,” says Yadav, “and most of it, let’s face it, comes from China.”“Traders don’t have a choice. Indian manufacturers can’t meet the demand. While curbing Chinese imports, the government should also stop Indian and multinational companies from getting their products manufactured in China,” said Yadav, who is a cello tape dealer.People should conduct a simple experiment, says Pawan Kumar, national organising general secretary of Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, just walk around their houses, look at different objects, and check where they come from. “Almost everything is likely to have been made in China.”Kumar, an importer, says that before the Covid-19 pandemic, roughly 500 to 600 containers carrying a variety of goods came to Sadar Bazaar every month, mostly from Yiwu, an international trading hub in China’s Zhejiang province.“Forget small household items, not many people know that a lot of furniture in the market such as Kirti Nagar is also imported from China,” he added. Kumar used to manufacture home appliances until 2010, when he became an importer. “I had eight BIS {Bureau of Indian Standards} licenses. While I sold a simple dry iron for ₹300, a Chinese steam iron would cost just ₹250. How could I match that?”He reads out the list of items in his container, weighing 20 tons, which is due to arrive in Mumbai from Yiwu -- mobile phone screen guards, flip covers, charging cables, woodcutters, woollen scarves, mixer-grinders, colour spray guns… the list goes on. Kumar, however, is supportive of the government’s recent moves to reduce the import dependence on China. “Eventually, we should limit our imports only to essentials,” he said. One of the biggest toy dealers in Sadar Bazar’s Teliwara, Sumit Matta, is a worried man. He says the call to make India a toy hub in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat address last month did not go down well with toy traders. “All of us listened to it with great interest, and it was widely shared on our WhatsApp groups. But it did not seem to take into account many concerns of domestic toy manufacturers and traders,” said Matta, who like most others in Teliwara, exited his family’s hardware business to get into the toy business 15 years ago. Teliwara used to be hardware hub before it turned into a wholesale market for toys over the last two decades. Today, it has about 300 shops, most of them selling toys imported from the coastal city of Shantou in China’s Guangdong province. “Until July, 95% of the toys in my shop were imported from China; now I have brought down their share to 80%” said Matta. The few Indian toys on his shelves include dolls and doctor sets, which he says were recently manufactured in Rajkot. “We closely worked with the manufacturer to ensure the quality is as good as that of Chinese ones. These days, we are getting a lot of calls from toy manufacturers wanting to know what they can manufacture for us. But there are very few who make battery-operated toys.” Rajendra Sharma, president of the Teliwada Toy Market Association and a soft-toy dealer, says it is difficult to convince his customers to buy Indian toys as they do not match the quality of Chinese goods. “The government seems to be making imports of toys difficult without ramping up manufacturing,” said Sharma.“At this rate, Teliwara will revert to being a hardware market. In fact, many of us are already thinking of reviving our old business of agricultural tools.”At least they are mostly made-in-India, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/little-bits-of-china-all-around-us/story-ID11Ylf9O0DcX5IlXeiReP.html
21-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What we need to know today||The annual flu season has begun in Delhi, north-west India, and the northern plains. Several in the HT newsroom have come down with flu in the past week — not the coronavirus disease (Covid-19; they tested negative), but the seasonal flu that makes its presence felt around this time of the year. Some of its symptoms are similar to that of the coronavirus disease, adding to the confusion, and the fear — but it is just the flu.Temperatures in the north and northwestern parts of the country are expected to start falling significantly by the end of September, and while no one in India seems particularly worried about it right now, health administrators in much of the northern hemisphere are wondering what the onset of cooler weather will mean for the Sars-CoV2 virus (which is anyway winter’s child). Will it mean a further spike in cases, which are already surging in parts of Europe as a direct result of countries opening up?Not too long ago, in spring, many of us (including this writer) were hoping that warm weather would prove unfavourable for the spread of the virus. We were wrong. It even thrived in the Indian summer. Now, based on what is known of the Spanish Flu of 1918-19, researchers and health administrators are worried about fall and winter — the second wave of the Spanish Flu, which started in the fall of 1918, was far more virulent and fatal than the first (or the third).It is likely that India and the rest of the world will see a fall (fine, India doesn’t really have the season but you know what I mean) and winter with more cases of Covid-19, but fewer deaths. Several medicines have been approved for emergency use by drug regulators, including in India, and this writer’s own sense is that the use of antivirals such as remdesivir, steroids, monoclonal antibodies, and interferons to manage infections serious enough to require hospitalisation may end up saving lives. India’s health administrators can’t be faulted at least in this aspect. Still, the increase in cases, which will mean a consequent increase in hospitalisations, will stretch health systems again.India’s daily numbers — the country ended Sunday with 5,485,390 new cases — have seen that rare thing, a dip, in the past few days, with its seven-day average actually dipping between Wednesday and Saturday (I remember this happening only once before in recent months). The trailing seven-day averages for each of the six days between Monday and Saturday were: 93,180, 93,334, 93,617, 93,278, 92,589, and 92,308. The only thing that can explain this is a dip in testing. India tested 1.16 million people on September 10, a day when it recorded 99,181 cases. It tested fewer than that on the eight days that followed. Only on Saturday, September 19, did it test more — 1.2 million people, which is also a record in terms of number of tests. As I’ve pointed out previously, there isn’t a direct daily correspondence between tests and cases, although anyone looking at numbers around the world assumes there is (and it is easier from the analytical perspective to do so; all analysis by the HT newsroom also assumes this; otherwise calculating key metrics such as positivity rates will become difficult). The 99,181 cases number on September 10 came on the back of 1.13 million tests on September 9 and 1.15 million tests on September 8.The drop in testing after September 10 wasn’t sharp —the difference exceeded 100,000 only on three days (of which it exceeded 200,000 on one day) — but it still seems to have been enough to prevent the number of new cases in India exceeding six-digits. That reprieve may be temporary. If India continues to test with the same intensity it did on September 19, it will cross the 100,000 number for new daily cases very soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-we-need-to-know-today/story-cXap86raMvCdSTGMF3XstI.html
21-09-2020||India||Political economy of the opposition to agri reforms||That it has been undoing historical wrongs to boost the Indian economy is a key narrative of the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA government. When such moves are criticised, it is quick to portray its opponents as representing a group of vested interests. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the bulwark of the BJP’s current popularity, leads such attacks from the front. This was seen in a big way during demonetisation and the roll-out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The same script is being replayed in the case of agricultural reforms. They were announced by the government in May, and are now facing protests not just from the Opposition but also partners within the National Democratic Alliance. Yes and no. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana, the richest agricultural states, which also account for the highest share of government procurement in India, are at the forefront of these protests. Both states are infamous for levying a large commission on sale of produce in Agricultural Product Market Committee (APMC) markets. If APMCs lose a large part of their business, this will lead to loss in what are essentially assured rents. So, why are farmers unhappy about the move? First, the logic of seeing farmers and local traders as mutually opposed to each other could be misleading. It is entirely possible that the traders who make a commission from APMC sales come from the same socio-economic group as large farmers. Second, the rent income from APMCs (it was around Rs 6,300 crore in Punjab last year), both to the government and private traders, is ultimately spent locally and therefore a source of income and employment. There is no such guarantee when it comes to profits of large corporations. Any loss in these incomes will adversely affect the local economy. Othering the local elite, both in urban and rural areas, has been an important ingredient of the BJP’s politics since 2014. Policies such as demonetisation and GST hurt local businesses the most. This othering has been accompanied by a stellar rise in the BJP’s funding from the corporate sector. The BJP’s corporate donations increased from Rs 437.4 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 743 crore in 2018-19. The short point is, the BJP does not need the financial backing of the local elite anymore, something which was the defining feature of political finance in India. The careful strategy of putting non-dominant caste chief ministers in BJP ruled states is another crucial component of this strategy. A non-Maratha Brahmin (Devendra Fadnavis) in Maharashtra, a non-Jat Punjabi Khatri (Manohar Khattar) in Haryana, a non-Ahom scheduled tribe (Sarbananda Sonowal) in Assam, and last but not the least, Narendra Modi’s own political rise as a non-dominant OBC leader at the cost of Patidars in Gujarat, are some such examples. A weakened local elite, and hence weakened regional parties, only make the BJP’s onward march easier. The proposed agricultural reforms are aimed at hitting the agricultural elite. The rent-seekers in APMCs will lose their assured incomes and the landed elite will face a far more powerful buyer when it sells its produce. This is also the class which does not stand to gain from the government’s welfare policies and might have been vocal against the growing squeeze on farm incomes.Earlier this week, the government announced a ban on exports of onions. It also plans to offload buffer stocks in the next two months. Both these moves are aimed at bringing down prices (which will hurt farm incomes). Inflation data until August shows that both retail and wholesale prices for onions were losing momentum for the past few months. Wholesale prices, had in fact been declining, that too at a growing rate. It was only in September that prices picked up again, and the farmers could have made up for some of these losses, but the government’s action will make sure it does not happen. It is worried about rising inflation. Headline retail inflation has been above 6%, the upper limit of RBI’s comfort level, for five consecutive months now. Food items have a share of 39% in the Consumer Price Index basket. This share is likely to be much higher for poor people. In a democracy, where majority of the population spends half its income on food, it makes eminent political sense to intervene when food prices are rising, even if this hurts farm incomes. That the government banned onion exports within a few months of announcing market-friendly reforms, is a clear reminder that it will continue to intervene and bring down prices. Farmers have long complained that there is no similar intervention when farm prices crash and farmers suffer losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-economy-of-the-opposition-to-agri-reforms/story-uwwWNX3ppgPTgitnZDqnVI.html
21-09-2020||India||Pak says India’s choice for mission post ‘too senior’||Pakistan on Sunday said the diplomat proposed by India as the next acting head of the Indian mission in Islamabad is too senior for the post even as it sought to link bilateral relations to the resolution of the Kashmir issue. The name of Jayant Khobragade was proposed to the Pakistani side in June, days before New Delhi asked Islamabad to reduce the strength of its high commission by 50%. The move had triggered a reciprocal decision by the Pakistani side. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Pakistani side felt the diplomat was too senior to function as the charge d’affaires. One of the people said Khobragade’s current assignment – he has been serving on deputation with the Department of Atomic Energy since 2017 – could have been a factor in Pakistan’s decision. The Indian and Pakistani high commissions in the two national capitals have been headed by the deputy chiefs of mission since August 2019, when Pakistan asked India to withdraw then high commissioner Ajay Bisaria as part of a slew of retaliatory actions in response to India’s decision to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. Pakistan also opted at that time not to go ahead with the posting of the diplomat who had been chosen as its next envoy to India. A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Pakistan believes that by proposing a senior diplomat, who has already served as ambassador in another post, India is trying to circumvent the effect of downgrading of diplomatic relations, which is obviously not in line with Pakistan’s decision.” Khobragade, who served as a counsellor in the Indian mission in Islamabad some years ago, has also held assignments in Russia, Kazakhstan and Spain, and was ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic during 2013-17. “However, keeping in view the diplomatic norms, Pakistan has counselled India to nominate an officer with seniority commensurate with Pakistan’s decision of downgrading the diplomatic relations,” the statement added. The Pakistani spokesperson referred to “veiled threats” in sections of the Indian media that the visa issue would “further destabilise” bilateral ties and said that “it must be clear that the relations between India and Pakistan are inextricably linked to the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions”. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the Pakistani spokesperson’s comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-says-india-s-choice-for-mission-post-too-senior/story-umPkJ29NE3iO5XpTFKgAdI.html

21-09-2020||India||New laws spark protest by angry farmers in Punjab and Haryana||Thousands of farmers staged protests across Haryana and Punjab on Sunday against the three contentious farm sector bills even as the Rajya Sabha passed two of these amid uproar by opposition members. In Haryana, the farmers poured out of the hinterlands and marched towards the urban belts on foot, two-wheelers, tractors and cars, and staged sit-ins at various state and national highways, blocking the traffic for about three hours. The protest began around 12 noon and passed off peacefully. Though there were no reports of violence, the sit-ins caused major inconvenience to commuters. The police had been on their toes since Saturday night and elaborate arrangements had been made to deal with the demonstrations and divert vehicular traffic in advance. Sunday’s demonstration was held 10 days after the lathicharge on farmers in Pipli of Kurukshetra. The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) that has been spearheading this agitation in Haryana with the support of 17 other unions received an impressive response from the farmers for the statewide protest. BKU’s state chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said the protest was peaceful and 17 farmer organisations had extended their support to the Chakka Jam (road block). He said the next decision will be taken after a discussion with the leaders of other farmer organisations. “The protests remained peaceful... traffic was restored after the farmers lifted the blockade around 3 pm,” Kurukshetra ‘s superintendent of police Astha Modi said.In a last ditch effort to persuade the farmers to call off the stir, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday urged farmers to defer their agitation and invited the farmers for talks. RAIL ROKO IN PUNJAB FROM SEPT 24 TO 26 Farmers also staged demonstrations in most districts of Punjab. Farmers’ organisations also announced a three-day ‘Rail Roko Andolan’ and gave a call to farmers to boycott all politicians supporting the new laws. Addressing protesters at Badal village in Muktsar BKU (Ekta-Ugrahana) state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said that railway services will be disrupted in the state from September 24 to 26. He termed the new central legislations as a “direct attack on the rights of farmers, traders and farm labourers”. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, a key member of another BKU faction, said all 31 farmers’ unions have extended support to the three-day ‘Rail Roko’ call.Similar protests were held in Bathinda, Mansa, Moga, Ludhiana, Faridkot, and Sangrur districts. In Amritsar, farmers under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) started a protest march from the deputy commissioner’s office and blocked Amritsar-Ajnala road for around one hour, disrupting traffic movement. KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher appealed to farmers to take part in the ‘Rail Roko Andolan’. The Punjab Youth Congress also took out a ‘tractor rally’. Led by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and PYC chief Barinder Singh Dhillon, hundreds of party workers on tractors converged from Dera Bassi town and were headed towards Delhi to protest against the passage of the three farm bills but were stopped by the Haryana police at the Haryana-Punjab border near Ambala. When the protesters insisted on heading to the national capital to ‘gherao’ the Parliament and tried to knock down the barricade, the Haryana police used water cannons to disperse them. The protesters also allegedly set one of the tractors on fire. Earlier, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh also spoke for farmers, stating they are the country’s backbone and the Central government’s move to harm their interests is unfortunate.“The economy of India is based on agriculture. If we want to save the economy and uplift the standards of living of people, farmers must be saved,” he said in a video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-spark-protest-by-angry-farmers-in-punjab-and-haryana/story-8z2UCPgyG2gY5fS76IkcRP.html
21-09-2020||India||Aggressive, violent acts tarnish House: Rajnath||The government on Sunday said it strongly condemned the “aggressive and violent behaviour” by opposition members towards the Rajya Sabha vice-chairman during the debate to pass the two farm bills in the Rajya Sabha. Addressing a press conference along with several of his colleagues, defence minister Rajnath Singh said: “Whatever happened was against parliamentary dignity. It has delivered a big blow. Rule books were torn, other important papers were torn. Mikes were snatched. Opposition members were in the well and attempts were made to climb on the vice-chairman’s chair.” He was joined by his colleagues Prakash Javadekar, Pralhad Joshi, Piyush Goyal, Thawar Chand Gehlot and Mukhtar Abbas Naqwi. “I would go to the extent of saying that it was extremely shameful,” Singh added.Parliament witnessed chaos during the voice vote to pass the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. Opposition members, claiming that their demand for a division of votes were being ignored, attempted to stall the proceedings and raised slogans in the well of the house, leading to an adjournment for 10 minutes. “Such an incident has never happened in the history of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. It is all the more unfortunate that this happened in Rajya Sabha, which is known as the house of elders,” Singh said. At a press conference in the evening, Singh said the opposition was trying to mislead farmers. “Neither minimum support prices (MSPs) nor agricultural produce market committees are going to be ended. Our government has increased MSPs and they will never be ended under any circumstances,” Singh said. On the issue of a no-confidence motion planned by the opposition against deputy chairman Harivansh, Singh said: “Notice has gone. Chairman will decide. It is his prerogative.” On the resignation of Shiromani Akali Dal minister in the Narendra Modi Cabinet, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Singh said there were political reasons behind it and he would not like to comment on it. “There was full discussion from 9.30 am to 1.30 pm. Even if one were to assume that the opposition was being ignored, is there are right to get violent and attack the deputy chairman?” On the question of opposition MPs seeking a division of votes and being ignored, minister of minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the deputy chairman kept urging opposition MPs to go to their seats and demand a division vote.The Congress party condemned Singh’s statement. “It is unfortunate that the defence minister justified the actions of the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman and the procedure adopted during the debate on bills,” said Congress general secretary KC Venugopal. He said the Congress and other opposition parties will not accept this and take this issue to the people. Trinamool Congress’s Derek O’Brien, who was seen on camera flashing the rule book at the chair later, said the MPs were forced to record the bedlam as the live coverage of the House was disrupted. He also denied ripping apart the rule book and said, “ Many opposition members wanted the bill to go for further examination. These bills were brought in as an ordinance. There hasn’t been any scrutiny of these bills.”In a video message, O’Brien said, “Yes, some MPs broke the microphone, what do you want them to do sit on the seat and have a lollipop? This was a protest and I was part of it.” He said the MPs were forced to tape the proceedings on their phones since the Rajya Sabha television was being “censored”. Referring to the commotion inside the House, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh tweeted that all the parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had agreed to a four hour discussion on the two bills. “…This was unilaterally cut short by the government’s floor managers by almost 45 minutes. This was the starting point for the chaos in the Parliament this afternoon.” “The dictatorial attitude of the Chair in not wanting to get a sense of the House, which is the convention to extend the session beyond the scheduled 1 pm, led to bedlam & chaos. The anti-farmer Bills were passed in the din without voting. Why the tearing urgency? On whose orders?” the Congress MP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-violent-acts-tarnish-house-rajnath/story-eh61IhHW4buWwoUBoaZcaJ.html
21-09-2020||India||No-trust motion moved against RS dy chairman||As many as 100 members from 12 opposition parties moved a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Sunday, shortly after the House passed two key bills aimed at ushering in agricultural reforms. Harivansh was re-elected as the deputy chairperson on September 14, when the House convened after a six-month break following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. While the two farm bills were passed through a voice vote, the opposition claimed that the due process of allowing a detailed discussion on the bills was not followed. A ruckus erupted in the Upper House soon after the deputy chairman, who was presiding over the proceedings, took the decision to put the bills to vote even as opposition members demanded more time to discuss the legislation, which they wanted to be scrutinised by a select committee.The signatories to the no-confidence motion included MPs from the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) , Trinamool Congress (TMC), Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Samajwadi Party (SP), Communist Party of India,Communist Part of India (Marxist), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).“This day will go down in history as a black day. The way these bills have been passed goes against democratic processes and amounts to killing democracy,” senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel told reporters outside Parliament. “The deputy chairman should safeguard the democratic traditions but instead he harmed the democratic traditions and processes. So, we have decided to move a no-confidence motion against him,” he added. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi claimed that no bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha. “The government is claiming that the bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha. It’s black day for democracy. Whoever was present in the House knows that no such bill was passed. This is death and murder of democracy,” he added. Singhvi said the minister started replying to the debate at 12.45 pm, 15 minutes before the House was scheduled to be adjourned for the day. “It is not possible to end the debate within 15 minutes without division and pass the bill by 1.15 pm. Not one but at least 10 members demanded division. Why was no division allowed? Many members had also moved amendments. Not one was allowed to speak. So, how did this bill get passed? Was there any magic wand,” he said. The opposition is also planning to move the court against the legislation. “These are unconstitutional bills. These are against the Constitutional provisions. I am sure that these unconstitutional legislation will not only be challenged but will be quashed by the Supreme Court,” Singhvi said. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for its part, said the opposition was trying to stall business and created the ruckus because it was not confident about the numbers. “They could have pressed for division, but they lacked confidence. It was shameful conduct and they should apologise for their behaviour in the House,” BJP MP Bhupender Yadav said. Addressing the media, defence minister Rajnath Singh said it is the prerogative of the chairman of the RajyaSabha to look into the no-confidence motion against the deputy chairperson.“The farmers grow gold from land, but the arrogance of the Modi government is making farmers shed tears of blood. Democracy has been shamed by the manner in which the government passed death warrants against farmers in the form of two farm bills in Rajya Sabha,” tweeted former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. PDT Acharya, a former Lok Sabha secretary general, said there is no precedent of a motion of no-confidence against the deputy chair. “As far as I know, there has been no such motion against the deputy chair in the Rajya Sabha. As per the constitutional provision, the notice period for such a motion is 14 days; which means if it is submitted today, it can be taken up after 14 days. Now if the house adjourns before that, we don’t know if the notice can be kept alive till the House reconvenes,” he said,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-trust-motion-moved-against-rs-dy-chairman/story-8QCDFzEl2aL7iDhfId3zhM.html
21-09-2020||India||As criticism pours in, ICMR denies it hid data||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) defended on Sunday its decision to not disclose disease prevalence data from the 10 cities hit hardest by Covid-19 earlier this summer, a move that was questioned by the scientists involved in the process and members of the country’s task force on the pandemic.The findings relate to the first round of surveys to detect antibodies to the Sars-Cov2 virus, which would indicate that the disease silently spread without people being symptomatic or recorded in disease testing. Known as a serological survey or a sero survey, the study was conducted between May 11 and June 4. “The first serosurvey had two parts: first was to determine the status of the country, and the second part was to check the disease status in high transmission zones which were called containment zones or hot spots. The first part was published but the second part has not been formally released, and we don’t really know why,” said one of the 70-plus researchers who was part of the survey, requesting not to be identified.That the agency suppressed the findings was first reported by The Telegraph newspaper on Sunday. In a series of tweets on Sunday evening, the ICMR responded to the report, saying: “Containment zones, that refer to a specific geographical area where positive cases of coronavirus are found, are dynamic in nature. They do not fit into nationally representative sampling. ICMR has been continuously communicating with the respective state authorities. The findings of the previous survey from the dynamic containment zones were communicated to the states for further action…”The agency added: “To further aid in developing state intervention plans, following the ICMR survey, states have also conducted their zone/city-specific surveys…”A member of the national task force on Covid-19 said the agency was being reluctant in sharing full data with the panel. “They shared the rural data but did not give out details of the urban data; initially it was said that they were awaiting results from certain cities that hadn’t been received. Then it just kept getting delayed and finally people actually forgot about it. Some parts of the survey were released during a press briefing, but that’s about it,” said this person, asking not to be named. Samples were picked up from hot spot areas in 10 cities: Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Kolkata, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Mumbai, Pune and Surat. According to the Telegraph report, the prevalence in these ranged from 15 to 48%. Some of the researchers who were involved in the study said the cities in Gujarat were among those with the highest disease prevalence, particularly Ahmedabad. “What we know is that exposure in Ahmedabad and Surat was higher even though the entire data set has not been shared with us so far. Whether it has been done for political reasons as they didn’t want certain cities to be seen in a poor light or for administrative reasons so that there is no panic, we do not know,” said the task force member quoted above.Dr Dileep Mavlankar, head of Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, said: “It’s high time that we stop being afraid of the disease, as the mortality is low. We know how to manage the disease effectively. The disease pattern tells us that in low transmission areas cases have gone up and cases are more or less stable in areas where high transmission was seen earlier. A situation like in Italy hasn’t arisen here, so we can afford to take calculated risks.” Dr DCS Reddy, one of the authors of the paper based on first sero survey published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, said, “The committee I chair is an advisory committee and our job has been to design the study. Why wasn’t the data published or when will it be published can only be answered by the implementing agencies such as ICMR or the individual states. It’s not our job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-criticism-pours-in-icmr-denies-it-hid-data/story-u50QdtqLIzBeciNBgW3BGK.html
21-09-2020||India||One in five bills sent to panels during NDA’s 2nd term: Data||Just one in five proposed laws during the second term of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government have been routed through Parliamentary committees for in-depth reviews, according to the data available with the PRS Legislative Research, echoing concerns of the Opposition over the bypassing of an important check-and-balance method in the Indian parliamentary system.The government has so far introduced 82 bills in Parliament since it won the general elections in 2019. Only 17 of them have been referred to various standing committees for in-depth reviews, the data says.To be sure, older version of some bills — such as Protection of Transgender Rights bill or the Wage Code was referred to standing committees during the previous Lok Sabha. But for many such bills, that came with heavy changes, the review route was not opted for.On Friday, the demand for review rocked the Rajya Sabha when the government tried to push two farm bills to replace related ordinances ignoring demand to send them to Select Committees. As the government pressed for a quick passage, fierce protests erupted in the House.The PRS data also shows that in the first term of the Narendra Modi government, 25% of the bills introduced were referred to committees. “The figure, however, is much lower than 71% and 60% in the 15th and 14th Lok Sabha respectively,” said a PRS note. The Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power in the 15th and 14th Lok Sabha. In the past, the Modi government had cleared the J&K reorganisation bill or the Triple Talaq bill directly without seeking reviews. In the budget session of 2019, the first one after the NDA won the national polls in 2019-- 38 Bills were introduced in Parliament (excluding the Finance and Appropriation Bills). Twenty-eight of these bills were passed, setting record for the highest for any session in the last 10 years. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi didn’t respond to the specific question of this larger trend, but refuted the impression that the government avoided scrutiny with the passage of the farm bills. ‘They [Opposition] didn’t even discuss the select committee properly. They just created a din. The question of division comes if they sit in their seats and ask,” he said.While standing committees have been formed to review work and bills of different ministries, there is no violation of rules if a bill is not sent to a House panel. The government can always seek the Speaker or the Chairman’s permission to pass the bills quickly if any urgent need arises. There are also instances such as the 2016 surrogacy bill, in which the government agreed for further scrutiny by the select committee even after the standing committee had reviewed it. While the UPA has sent more bills for review, it also holds the infamous record of pushing as many as eight bills without debate in 17 minutes in the winter session of 2008. It was the last full session before next year’s general elections and despite protests by the BJP (then the principal Opposition party), Speaker Somnath Chatterjee allowed bypassing the debates and hurriedly passed the bills.P Sreedharan, former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, said, “The departmentally related standing committee system, established since 1993, is now an integral part of our parliamentary procedure. There is a qualitative difference in the deliberations on bills in the House and within the committees. In the past, those committees have generally made substantial contributions in refining the bills. The standing committees should be got involved in the legislation process, as far as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-five-bills-sent-to-panels-during-nda-s-2nd-term-data/story-HtXilveLrWAfzWEAkk8nnI.html
21-09-2020||India||Stormy Sunday in House as 2 farm bills go through||New Delhi The government rushing through two contentious farm bills, and fierce protests from the Opposition — senior leaders charged towards the seat of deputy chairman Harivansh, who was presiding over the proceedings; jumped onto tables; and shot videos of the ruckus — turned the Rajya Sabha into a battleground on Sunday.The authorities called in marshals to form a double-layered barricade to protect Harivansh and remove an MP, muted live telecast of the proceedings, and refused to accept the Opposition’s demand for a division (voting through paper ballots) on the legislation.The two agricultural reform bills — the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 — were cleared by voice vote in Parliament even as the Opposition protested and stormed the well of the House seeking that they be sent to a select committee. The high-pitch protests were the most aggressive in recent years, and continued even after the House was adjourned at 1pm. Opposition parties sat in the Rajya Sabha after the House was adjourned and drafted a no-confidence motion against Harivansh, who was elected deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha on September 14, the opening day of the curtailed monsoon session, before posting comments and releasing videos on Twitter.Among the leaders who were seen on camera protesting near the chairperson’s desk were DMK leader T Siva, TMC MP Derek O’Brien, the Congress’s KC Venugopal and the AAP’s Sanjay Singh. Some other Opposition members were seen tearing pages, and rushing to the chairman’s desk to protest.“If Babasaheb Ambedkar was alive, he would have hung his head in shame seeing what tactics BJP used today, in an Independent India, to forcefully pass bills pertaining to farmers. Only a heartless and anti-farmer government like the colonial British can do this,” said senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel outside Parliament.The BJP hit back and slammed the “intolerance” of opposition parties. “The Opposition has showed height of intolerance in Parliament today. They think of themselves as baadshah (kings). We condemn the unruly behaviour of the Opposition and we will never budge to such threats,” said parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.The Narendra Modi government had brought amendments to three farm bills through ordinances in June to unleash reforms in agriculture and allow farmers more flexibility in selling their produce. Many experts had hailed the reforms as significant, but some farmer bodies and opposition parties alleged that the new laws would only benefit corporate entities and traders but not the farmers.Prime Minister Modi later described the passage of the bills — they now need to be signed by the President to be ratified as laws — a “watershed moment in the history of Indian agriculture”.“Congratulations to our hardworking farmers on the passage of key bills in Parliament, which will ensure a complete transformation of the agriculture sector as well as empower crores of farmers,” the PM tweeted.In the House on Sunday morning, the trouble started when the allotted time to discuss the two bills was reduced from four hours to three-and-a-half hours. Opposition leaders including the TMC’s O’Brien and DMK’s Siva gave notices to send the bills to a select committee of Parliament, but the government rejected the demand.Their second demand — for a division on the bills — too was rejected as the government was in a hurry to clear the bills amid indications that the monsoon session may be cut short because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ruckus began when agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar was replying in the House and the chair announced that the voting will be conducted the same day. The government side said the Opposition disrupted the House. It also said as per rules, division can’t take place amid ruckus. Trinamool floor leader O’ Brien, quoting the rulebook, later said, “This was clear breach of parliamentary procedure. You can’t brazenly break the rule and expect us to sit in our seats as you murder democracy.”Before the commotion erupted, several opposition parties including the Biju Janata Dal, which is considered friendly to the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), urged the government to consider the option of sending the bills to a select committee. The government’s ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, has already put on record its opposition to the bills; and the only minister from the party in the cabinet, Harsimrat Kaur, resigned in protest last week. Outside of the NDA, the YSR Congress Party that has six MPs in the House and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which has nine MPs, supported the government. As the government tried to push the bills through, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh, Trinamool’s Dola Sen and other MPs started raising slogans. Soon, other parties joined them and surrounded the Chair.Four motions to send the two bills to a House panel for greater scrutiny were negated by voice vote, but the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam members sought a division of votes on the issue. The chair pointed out that the division can only be done once the House is in order and the MPs in their respective seats.The Opposition alleged that Rajya Sabha TV chose to show only the floor of the Lok Sabha, where some Upper House members were present in line with new seating arrangements. Audio of the channel, too, was muted, they alleged.Quickly realising that their protests would not be recorded on the channel, Opposition MPs started taking videos of the action, which is not allowed on the floor of the House. While the government blamed the Opposition for not seeking a division of votes; a few opposition MPs said they had put forth the demand, but it was not accepted. “The government had the numbers, we were sure of getting about 120 votes in favour. If the Opposition was confident of the numbers, it should have sought a division,” said a BJP MP on condition of anonymity. The MP added that over 20 bills have to be taken up for discussion during the ongoing session of Parliament, which leaves little time for discussion.Outside Parliament, the Congress’s Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the bills should not have been passed, as the voice of the members seated in the Lok Sabha could not be heard in the Rajya Sabha because of the din. The ruckus that ensued in the House brought back memories of the pandemonium that erupted when the Women’s Reservation Bill was tabled in Parliament. In May 2008, when the Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, there were scuffles and pushing and jostling by members. Samajwadi party MPs tore up the bill, after snatching it from the then law minister HR Bhardwaj. During HD Deve Gowda’s regime, when then law minister M Thambidurai introduced the bill in July 1998, RJD MPs who went to the well of the House, snatched it from speaker GMC Balayogi and tore it to bits. In 2013, five Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh announced they would sit in for a 48-hour-long protest at the main entrance of Parliament to push for the creation of a separate state of Telangana. A year later, the Lok Sabha was disrupted when pepper spray was used in the House following a ruckus over the introduction of the Telangana bill. Congress member L Rajagopal, who was protesting against the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, had carried the spray into the House, which led to several MPs needing treatment. In 2015, the Lok Sabha against saw scenes of disruption play out when Congress members tore papers and threw them towards then deputy speaker M Thambi Durai. The Congress was protesting over the issue of Lalit Modi, the fugitive Indian businessman and cricket administrator, and alleged irregularities in the conduct of an examination and MP government recruitment. P Sreedharan, former secretary general, Lok Sabha, said, “Expression of protest in a proper manner is legitimate in a Parliamentary democracy. But it should not degenerate to unruly demonstrations.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stormy-sunday-in-house-as-2-farm-bills-go-through/story-Xfs0yTd8O0aTAxURSDaUQO.html
21-09-2020||India||India, China to hold sixth round of military talks today; IAF Rafales flying in Ladakh||The Indian Air Force (IAF) is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert amid heightened border tensions with China even as corps commander-ranked officers from both armies are set to meet for the sixth round of military talks on Monday, officials familiar with the developments said on Sunday. The military dialogue -- which is likely to start at 9am at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) across the Chushul sector -- will, for the first time, involve the participation of a joint secretary-ranked officer from the ministry of external affairs as a step to ensure that the talks yield a positive outcome, the officials said, requesting anonymity. The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs --- the diplomatic dialogue between the two countries --- involves a representative of the Indian defence ministry. Corps commander-ranked officers from the two armies have so far met five times, but failed to break the deadlock in the Ladakh sector, which has seen a significant military buildup by both sides. The IAF’s current fleet of five Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission, the officials cited above said. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. The air force formally inducted the planes at the Ambala air base on September 10 though they landed at their home base on July 29. At the induction, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made it clear that the warplanes were mission-ready and the ceremony marked their “full operational induction” into the air force. The Rafale jets are part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the Golden Arrows. The IAF chief said at the ceremony that after the Rafales arrived at Ambala on July 29, the squadron had been “really busy and in an overdrive to operationalise” the new fighters. “Within this time (after the jets arrived), they have already flown and familiarised in our operational environment and have undergone intense integrated training with other combat fleets including firing of advanced weapons. They are good to go and deliver,” Bhadauria said in Ambala, adding that the warplanes couldn’t have joined the air force’s combat fleet at a more opportune time considering the current security scenario. India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases. The Rafale weaponry includes Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles --- weapons that allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges. “The stalemate in talks is giving time for consolidation of forces. The Rafale too would have been put through its paces and integrated with the existing IAF network, augmenting the air force’s capabilities,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. The next batch of three to four Rafale jets is expected to reach Ambala from France in October followed by a third batch in December. All deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021. A high-powered panel on China reviewed the latest developments in the Ladakh sector last week, with a focus on charting the course of future negotiations to restore status quo ante of mid-April along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). The agenda for the upcoming military talks between Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers was discussed at the high-level meeting, even as the situation in Ladakh remains tense after a series of recent manoeuvres by the two armies in the Pangong Tso area. The officials said Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, who heads the Leh-based 14 Corps and has been leading the military talks with China to reduce border tensions, will finish his term next month and is expected to be replaced by Lieutenant General PGK Menon. Singh took charge of the corps in October 2019.The upcoming meeting of Indian and Chinese corps commander-ranked officers will be their first after the Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the People’s Liberation Army from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on September 10. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling borders, signalling a resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC. In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from reaching forward areas they could previously patrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-rafales-flying-in-ladakh-india-china-military-talks-today/story-aRD1uijVgvEd2M5PZRqfIP.html
21-09-2020||India||PLA mobilises theatre commands||After the military flare-up in Galwan Valley, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has mobilised four out of five of its military theatre commands, with reports suggesting that live firing drills and military exercises from the East China Sea and Yellow Sea to the South China Sea were intended to be a distraction for its calculated aggression in the Ladakh sector.While the next India and China military commanders’ meeting is due to be held on Monday, the PLA is continuing its build-up along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the western sector. After the India-China foreign ministers meeting on September 10 in Moscow, a decision was taken to ask the military commanders to implement a total disengagement and de-escalation agreement on the ground. It is understood that the meetings at the Corps Commanders level will restrict itself to disengagement of forces post-April, and the Depsang Bulge issue will be taken up at a separate Divisional Commanders level meeting.According to a report in Nikkei Asian Review, the PLA has mobilised its Southern Theatre Command, which oversees the South China Sea; Northern Theatre Command, which overseas the Korean Peninsula; and the Eastern Theatre Command, which oversees arch-rivals Japan and Taiwan. The paper said that just like the Chinese annexed Tibet in the 1950s against the backdrop of its intervention in the Korean war, the present mobilisation was a distraction for a real stand-off in the Karakoram-Zanskar ranges of the Himalayas. For the Ladakh operations, PLA’s Western Theatre Command has been fully mobilised with the military districts of Xinjiang and Tibet fully involved in the aggression.The Korean war in the 1950s also turned out to be distraction for the Jawaharlal Nehru government and Indian diplomacy as they got involved in sorting out the North Korea issue, leaving their own flanks in the western and eastern sectors open to the Chinese military in 1962. The PLA chose to attack India in 1962 when the entire world was diverted towards the Cuban missile crisis.While India is engaging China through both military and diplomatic channels for resolve the current stalemate, the military commanders are prepared for the worst on all the borders and the sea. They know that distraction, diversion and deception are part of Chinese information warfare with psychological operations playing the lead role before the flag goes up.By deploying three military commands against the US from South China to East China Sea and test firing both the DF-26 also, called the Chinese Guam Killer, and DF-21 D, also called the Carrier Killer intermediate range ballistic missiles, in the last week of August, the PLA is sending a message that it capable of taking on both the US on its eastern and India on its western flank. The missile firing was to showcase the Chinese capability to taken on the exercising USS Navy’s super carrier Ronald Reagan and Nimitz around the Chinese nuclear submarine base at Hainan Islands in the South China Sea. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-mobilises-theatre-commands/story-Fc3C941GFahd1aW3MPAOIP.html
21-09-2020||India||Racist machines? Twitter’s photo preview problem reignites AI bias concern||Social media users stumbled upon discrepancies on Sunday in how Twitter displays people with different skin tones, reopening a debate over whether computer programmes – particularly algorithms that “learn” – manifest or amplify real-world biases such as racism and sexism.The problem was first discovered when education tech researcher Colin Madland posted about how video-calling software Zoom cropped the head out of a black person on the other side of a call, seemingly unable to detect it as a human face. When Madland posted a second photo combination showing the acquaintance visible, Twitter’s image display algorithm appeared to show his face in the preview. Madland appeared to be a Caucasian with white skin. Soon, several users replicated Twitter’s seemingly discriminatory manner of prioritising faces. In one of the most shared tweets, posted by cryptography engineer Tony Arcieri, Twitter only showed the face of Republican senator Mitch McConnell – a Caucasian -- as the preview of a combo photo that also involved former US President Barack Obama, who is of partly African descent. A Twitter spokesperson acknowledged the problem and said the company was looking into it. “Our team did test for bias before shipping the model and did not find evidence of racial or gender bias in our testing. But it’s clear from these examples that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’re looking into this and will continue to share what we learn and what actions we take,” this person told HT.Twitter’s chief design officer Dantley Davis responded to some of the tweets, detecting variations in how the system responded based on further manipulations of the image. Davis also linked to an older blog by Twitter engineers that detailed how the auto-cropping feature worked. The feature uses neural network algorithms, a type of a machine learning approach that attempts to mimic how the human brain processes data.Multiple groups of researchers have found that such technologies, which usually rely on artificial intelligence are prone to reflecting sociological biases, in addition to flaws in design.“Automated systems are not inherently neutral. They reflect the priorities, preferences, and prejudices - the coded gaze - of those who have the power to mould artificial intelligence,” said the authors of the Gender Shades project, which analysed 1,270 images to create a benchmark for how accurately three popular AI programmes classified gender. The researchers used images of lawmakers from three African and three European countries, and found that all three popular software most accurately classified white and male faces, followed by white women. Black women were most prone to be incorrectly classified, found the research led by authors from MIT in their 2018 paper. “Whatever biases exist in humans enter our systems and even worse, they are amplified due to the complex sociotechnical systems, such as the Web. As a result, algorithms may reproduce (or even increase) existing inequalities or discriminations,” said a research review note by Leibniz University Hannover’s Eirini Ntoutsi and colleagues from multiple other European universities. This, they added, could have implications for applications such as where AI-based tech such as facial recognition is used for law enforcement and health care.An American crime risk-profiling software, Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), was found to have a bias against African-Americans, the authors noted as an example. “COMPAS is more likely to assign a higher risk score to African-American offenders than to Caucasians with the same profile. Similar findings have been made in other areas, such as an AI system that judges beauty pageant winners but was biased against darker-skinned contestants, or facial recognition software in digital cameras that overpredicts Asians as blinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/racist-machines-twitter-s-photo-preview-problem-reignites-ai-bias-concern/story-kYWMvpx1WaV77NiVOx8KDP.html
21-09-2020||India||Most states choose Rs 97k crore borrowing to plug GST deficit||A majority of state governments have chosen to borrow Rs.97,000 crore to plug a shortfall in revenue from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rather than borrow the entire deficit of Rs.2.35 lakh crore, which may leave no choice to dissenting states but to fall in line, finance ministry officials said.Otherwise, states that have opposed the proposal risk would have to wait 19 months to get the money, the officials said.The Centre has already received approval of 21 states for the first option of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore to plug the shortfall accruing because of implementation bottlenecks; the states wouldn’t have to pay either the principal or interest. Even Manipur, which had initially opted for the second option of borrowing the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore shortfall, accruing as a result of both implementation issues and the Covid-19 pandemic, has now revised its decision in favour of the first option, the officials {two} with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity. The larger borrowing comes with significant interest costsThe officials said the Centre is confident that the first option will be approved by the GST Council, which is headed by the Union finance minister and comprises state finance minister, as it needs only 20 states to pass any resolution if some members insist on voting.Opposition-administered states such as Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal have not yet communicated their choices to the government as yet, the officials said.States and Union territories that are in favour of the first option are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the officials said.The two options were put to the states at the 41st meeting of the GST Council on August 27. Some states, where opposition parties are in power such as Delhi, Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal (WB), Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh,, have opposing the Centre’s proposals, insisting that the central government borrow the money and reimburse them, instead..“If the rest of the states do not submit their options before the due GST Council meet on 5th October 2020, then they will have to wait till June 2022 to get their compensation dues, subject to the condition that the GST Council extends the cess collection period beyond 2022,” one of the officials said. As per the GST law, the cess collected on sin goods and luxury products such as liquor, cigarettes, other tobacco products, aerated water, automobiles and coal will cease to exist after June 30, 2022, unless the council extends it further. At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to June 30, 2022); any revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury and sin goods.“Manipur, the only state which had earlier opted for the option 2, later preferred to change it to option-1,” one of the officials said. Some states are expected to give their borrowing options in a day or two, he added.The 41st meeting of the GST Council was held against the backdrop of the opinion of the attorney general (AG) expressing the opinion that there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate state governments for the loss of revenue, a second official said.“It is the GST Council and not the Central government which has to find ways, according to the attorney general, to meet the compensation shortfall,” he added.It is expected that the GST Council’s meeting on October 5 would be stormy as the Opposition states would not relent easily on the subject. Addressing a press conference on August 30, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said huge debt was being thrust on states in the name of “act of God” — a reference to the phrase used by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to describe the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism.Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31, “FMs of Punjab, Delhi, WB, Chhattisgarh,Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God, humans or nature , to be paid back by extending the period of cess.” Isaac had tweeted on September 9, “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times, ipso facto, is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.”States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year, an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue, as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown, the officials said.According to an official statement released on July 27, the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1,65,302 crore, while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95,444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20, the lowest in 11 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-states-choose-97k-crore-borrowing-to-plug-gst-deficit/story-BQIfiostPbyZptCNQzmh2O.html
21-09-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear petition against Sudarshan TV’s controversial show today||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear the case related to aring of a programme by Sudarshan News channel which has been in controversy. The programme “Bindas Bol” is related to Muslims entering civil services which the channel had likened to “infiltration” and “Jihad”.During the last hearing, the top court had said that the claims made by the channel were “insidious” and it also cast aspersions on the credibility of the UPSC exams and was a great disservice to the nation.“Here is one anchor who says one particular community is trying to infiltrate UPSC. Can anything be more insidious (than such claims). Such allegations affect the stability of the country and also cast aspersions on the credibility of the UPSC exam,” Justice DY Chandrachud, who heads the three-judge bench, had remarked on September 15, restraining the channel from telecasting the remaining episodes of the programme.The bench will on Monday take up the petition filed by an advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan.The channel, meanwhile, filed an additional affidavit before the Supreme Court on Sunday saying that it will strictly comply with all the laws while airing the remaining episodes of the UPSC series in “Bindas Bol”.Sudarshan TV further stated in the affidavit that it will abide and comply by the programming code and directions of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting strictly.Sudarshan TV has broadcast four episodes in the programme series “Bindas Bol” at 8:00 pm on September 11, 12, 13 and 14, 2020, and there are around six more episodes remaining to be broadcast in the programme series, the additional affidavit stated.The channel urged the Supreme Court to lift the stay on the telecast of remaining episodes of the controversial programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-petition-against-sudarshan-tv-s-controversial-show-on-monday/story-UfWAwTW8OdZDlNOdBUf49M.html
21-09-2020||India||PM Modi to lay foundation of 9 highway projects of over Rs 14,000 crore in Bihar today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of nine highway projects in Bihar through video conference on Monday and also inaugurate optical fibre internet services through which the state’s all 45,945 villages will be connected. The information was released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Saturday. These nine highway projects involve a road length of about 350 kilometres at a cost of Rs 14,258 crore. Modi has recently inaugurated or laid the foundation of a number of development projects, including those related to railways, infrastructure, bridges, drinking water and sanitation, in the state which is set to go to the assembly polls in October-November. The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that the proposed highways will pave the way for the state’s development as they will enhance better connectivity, convenience and economic growth in and around it. Movement of people and goods will also improve substantially, especially with the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, it added. Modi had declared a special package for significant infrastructure development of Bihar in the year 2015. The package included 75 projects worth Rs 54,700 crore, of which 13 projects have been completed, and work is undergoing at 38 and others are in the process to be launched, the PMO said. With the completion of these projects, all rivers in Bihar will have bridges conforming to 21st century specifications and all major national highways will stand widened and strengthened. Giving details of the optical fibre internet services programme, the PMO described it as a prestigious project covering all 45,945 villages of Bihar which will enable a “digital revolution” to reach the state’s remotest corner. This project will be executed by the combined efforts of Department of Telecom, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology and Common Service Centres (CSC). The PMO said the CSC has 34,821 centres throughout the length and breadth of Bihar, and it will utilise this workforce to not only implement this project but also make it professionally run to provide optical fibre internet services for common citizens at every village. The project would also entail implementation of one Wi-Fi and five free of cost connections to government institutions like primary schools and anganwadi centres among others, it said. This will lead to digital services like e-education, e-agriculture, tele-medicine, tele-law and other social security schemes to be easily available to all citizens of Bihar at the click of the button, the PMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-9-highway-projects-of-over-rs-14-000-crore-in-bihar/story-GTx7Rbr90cEMhEHkp7nPFI.html

21-09-2020||India||China invokes 1962 war to put India on a defensive. It won’t work | Analysis||For the past 58 years, the Chinese propaganda machine, or psychological warfare machine, has used the 1962 border conflict to put the Indian Army on the defensive and convey to nation at large that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is vastly superior to its Indian counterpart on the battlefield.It is the same mindset that made PLA transgress the Finger 4 mountainous spur on the north banks of Pangong Tso as well as breach the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan. The Chinese hubris, however, took a hit at both Galwan as well as on both banks of the lake, with the Indian Army occupying dominant positions and in fact threatening the PLA garrison at Moldo across the Spanggur Gap in Chushul sector.Caught unawares by the Indian Army August 29-30 manoeuvres, a miffed PLA decided to place an anti-aircraft gun on Black Top, south of Pangang Tso, and rolled out main battle tanks to scare the Indians. The PLA propaganda machine is screaming war with India, without realizing that the tools of present-day war are standoff weapons and not World War II machines like tanks. Also Watch | China defends Pakistan after India & US call for action against terrorAlso read: India needs a refined toolkit to manage ChinaWhile both India and China, through their foreign ministers have decided to disengage from Ladakh, the exercise is very complicated and will take time despite best efforts of both the Corps Commanders. The disengagement has to be done in such a fashion that it gives mutual security and not a chance to the incorrigible PLA to occupy positions vacated by the Indian Army due to better border infrastructure and logistics. The best option available is status quo ante as existed in early April and anything less than that is an exercise in obfuscation.While the Chinese harp about India’s 1962 loss, the fact is that the present Indian Army does not fight with .303 Lee Enfield bolt action rifles, light machine guns, three inch mortars and light tanks. A transparent battlefield in Ladakh will surely tell the Chinese ruler in Beijing that the Indian troop deployment north and south of Pangong Tso is more than the total deployed during the 1962 war.Top Indian diplomats and military commanders are clear that the war, if forced by the PLA, will lead to more casualties on both sides in the first 15 minutes than the entire 1962 war due to standoff weapons, laser-guided bombs and beyond visual range missiles deployed by both sides. They understand that tanks and troops on the ground will have little role to play except to hold and capture territory as the big weapons and rockets will take over the theatre of war.Also read: Chinese PLA’s new expansion plans on BhutanEven though the Chinese ruler and his western theatre commander are blinded with ambition to prove to the world that a new global power has arrived, India has enough standoff weapons and deterrence to ensure that PLA takes a huge hit in already sensitive Tibet and Xinjiang province. A strong response from India can unravel the One China policy, but the opposite also could be true and erode the equity of New Delhi. It is time that Beijing woke up to stark reality on the ground as it is dealing with an Army that has been fighting on heights up to 24,000 feet since 1984 and insurgency in both Kashmir and the northeast since Independence. The 1962 war no longer puts the Indian Army on the defensive, it incentivises the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-still-using-62-war-to-put-india-on-defensive/story-J3xWiaXWvpmuuyifH8UakL.html
21-09-2020||Editorials||Maharashtra’s crumbling urban infrastructure | HT Editorial||In less than a month, another urban disaster has hit Maharashtra, with the collapse of a 30-year-old building in Bhiwandi, Thane, with at least 10 casualties. The building collapsed on Monday at 3:04 am. This comes after the Mahad building collapse which killed 16 people. The period between 2015 and 2019 saw 1,472 incidents of building collapses in Mumbai alone, with 106 people having lost their lives. This number is alarming.Maharashtra has been infamous for its urban infrastructure which is the result of a domino effect. With rapid urbanisation, buildings are often haphazardly constructed, flouting regulatory norms. The absence of planning often forces citizens to move into unregulated, unsafe buildings, and face the consequences of crumbling infrastructure. Older buildings are often forgotten in the bid to build more. While not unique to Maharashtra alone, the state has seen the unfortunate consequences of poor planning and governance as a product of rapid urbanisation.The Mahad tragedy should have served as a wake-up call for the Bhiwandi-Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC), which began to identify extremely dangerous buildings. Now, as a second tragedy unfolds, the only way forward is through proactive decision-making, inspections and administrative will. Changing weather patterns, heavy rainfall and the climate crisis must be regarded as key areas in the approach to building safer cities. Let this be a grave reminder to states to prioritise proper urban planning. Lives are at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/maharashtra-s-crumbling-urban-infrastructure-ht-editorial/story-jMFPQYqygvpFKApUmA5Z7O.html
21-09-2020||Editorials||The vaccine protocol | HT Editorial||The developers of the most promising coronavirus vaccines are making a concerted effort to convince people they will uphold scientific standards in their clinical trials. First, they signed what was described as a historic safety pledge. They declared they will seek emergency approval for their candidates only after a phase 3 trial is complete, and the priority would be to ensure the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals. Last week, some of them went a step further, disclosing granular protocols and yardsticks for these trials. The information is typically considered a trade secret.History is littered with examples of what happens when scientific process is victim to public anticipation and political pressure. The earliest of this was the Cutter Incident of the mid-1950s, when tens of thousands of children in the United States were accidentally injected with a live polio virus. It was the culmination of ignored warnings, skipped safeguards and impatience. A similar tale (although here, the errors lay more in development than manufacturing) played out in 1976 when a small but statistically significant proportion of people who got a swine flu vaccine developed an autoimmune condition. The incidents are now among several cautionary tales that have fed into how vaccines, drugs and therapies are developed today.For the leaders of some of the world’s leading powers, these tales seem to have faded from memory. Russia last month approved for public use a vaccine that is yet to complete phase 2 trials. China has begun inoculating thousands of people with its experimental jabs. The president of the United States said that a vaccine could be approved as early as October, less than a month before he faces an election. How any of this is possible till short- and medium-term safety implications of these experimental shots are determined is a question beyond the scope of scientific reasoning. It is important to insulate the worst health crisis in generations from political ambition and nationalistic bravado. The political rhetoric in India, in this regard, has been measured. It is encouraging that the health ministry has indicated that it will wait for adequate data before gambling on any vaccine, even if it is one touted by an all-weather ally. The country’s leaders must now make sure they don’t give in to the wrong examples. The best way for it is to let the scientists take the wheel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-vaccine-protocol-ht-editorial/story-4os8FgiFDAh4VrHiJtyGUP.html
21-09-2020||Editorials||National Board for Wildlife: Govt must follow due processes||The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), which Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads, has not met even once in the past five years with all its 47 members in attendance, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change ministry informed the Rajya Sabha recently. Only a standing committee of NBWL, which is authorised to exercise the board’s powers, met 23 times between 2015-16 and 2019-20. During this period, a report in this newspaper said, 680 projects were granted wildlife clearance. A full NBWL meeting is a necessity because while the committee’s function is to regulate land diversion within protected areas and eco-sensitive zones, a purely project clearance activity, NBWL has the power to deal with policy-level decisions. Wildlife conservation is a multi-disciplinary effort and NBWL members are from diverse fields. Therefore, it is the perfect platform to get stakeholders on board and evaluate projects much more rigorously. The Centre’s reluctance to follow green laws and conduct a rigorous project-approval process is not just dangerous for the country’s biodiversity but also endangers the fundamental right of citizens to a clean environment. There are many scientific reports — the latest being the Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 — that have warned that further destruction of flora and fauna will have serious effects of humans. It’s time to strengthen green regulations, introduce a stronger system of checks and balances, and make the clearance process more transparent and inclusive. And for that, two reasonable steps would be regular and full NBWL meetings and a robust Environmental Impact Assessment law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/national-board-for-wildlife-govt-must-follow-due-processes/story-6eMAuwEbI3CpeRIf6mcEPJ.html
