Unequivocally yes. Will the government’s recently-legislated farm bills grant this freedom to farmers? The answer is an unequivocal no.Let us understand this through the example of Prashant Gawande, a small farmer in Akola, Maharashtra, with a three-acre farm. He has just harvested soyabean and needs to sell his produce quickly so as to repay the debt taken to produce the crop. The nearest Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) market yard for Gawande is 25 km away where licenced traders will bid for his produce, starting with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) declared by the government. He can sell his produce to the highest bidder — whether a government procurement agency or a private trader — and collect his money.Ninety-four per cent of India’s farmers sell their produce for non-MSP prices. Official data disclosed in Parliament showed that, in the last season, only 1.24 crore paddy farmers and 44 lakh wheat farmers got the MSP. The reason is that farmers do not have an ecosystem with multiple, easily accessible and competitive markets. The painful conclusion is that, notwithstanding the operation of APMC Acts for a few decades, only a fraction of the farmers get MSP. The Bharatiya Janata Party government has passed new farm sector laws which it claims will establish a “One Nation, One Market” for agriculture produce and liberate farmers. “One Market” is a myth. Can you imagine Gawande in Maharashtra loading his soyabean crop onto a tractor and driving to Madhya Pradesh because he has learned that he can get a better price there! Or imagine Gawande pulling out his computer, log into the e-commerce market place, and complete a digital sale and purchase!! Neither the current APMC system nor the “One Nation, One Market” dream will serve the small farmer. Eighty-five per cent of farmers are small farmers, holding one hectare or less and with little surplus to sell in the market. He/she can be lured to a market only if there are, multiple, easily accessible and competitive markets in the area where the farmer produces his/her crop.Under the new laws, anyone can now operate outside the auspices of APMC and procure from farmers without the need for a licence or payment of a fee. Most traders will then abandon APMC and set up their own informal markets outside to avoid APMC transaction costs and regulations. Lack of activity will eventually lead to the shutdown of APMCs which means that the bidding process to establish the highest price for the produce will also vanish. Independent traders will collude to set up many fragmented thin markets for procurement which will lead to price gouging of farmers, most of whom are small and do not have collective bargaining powers. This is how the APMC and MSP systems will be slowly dismantled. When the MSP system is dismantled, farmers lose a very important price signal that can help them get better prices. The experience of Bihar after the Nitish Kumar government repealed the state’s APMC Act bears out this apprehension. Bihar farmers get a whopping 30% less as the price for their produce than the notified MSPs.If the government was indeed keen on retaining the MSP system, as it claims, then why is it not so stated explicitly in the new laws? Nothing would have been easier than to add a clause that a private transaction would be valid only if the price paid “is not less than the MSP”. MSPs play a vital role as an emitter of a price signal. The farmers face a real risk of exploitative prices without a proper price signal and an assured market place to sell their produce. Today, farmers neither have access to multiple markets nor the bargaining power to negotiate fair-price contracts.Farmers have seen through the falsity of the government’s propaganda and that is why farmers across the country are on the streets protesting against these laws.The objective to provide economic freedom to farmers through more choices of buyers is a laudable pursuit that the Congress supports fully. Farmers such as Gawande can be liberated only when they have access to multiple markets where different buyers compete for their produce and offer the highest price.Renowned agriculture expert Dr MS Swaminathan and scholars such as Sudha Narayanan and Mekhala Krishnamurthy have argued that the number of APMC market yards per square km is inadequate and severely inhibits market access for India’s farmers. Recognising the severe limitations of the APMC system, the Congress party’s manifesto for the 2019 elections clearly laid out the need to establish thousands of markets “in large villages and small towns with adequate infrastructure and support” as a pre-condition to free trade in agriculture procurement. The key word is markets, not One Market.Six years of the Narendra Modi government has revealed one clear pattern of governance — to confuse and conflate lofty goals and objectives with ill-thought-out policy execution. Eliminating black money was a lofty objective; but demonetisation as a policy to achieve that was disastrous. Ease of inter-state trade was a laudable goal; a plethora of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates was not the way to achieve it. Flattening the Covid-19 curve was a worthy pursuit, but a draconian lockdown was imprudent. Similarly, giving economic freedom to our farmers is a desirable goal, but the hastily-passed farm laws will not help achieve this.

23-09-2020||News||How politics eclipsed the Emmy Awards||Actress Uzo Aduba wore a tee-shirt with the name “Breonna Taylor” imprinted on it, when she accepted an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for Mrs America, and said, “Let’s change the world!”. Breonna Taylor was a Black woman who was fatally shot in her own home in Kentucky by the police during a drugs’ investigation. Through the night on Sunday, in almost every acceptance speech, A-list TV stars sat in their homes and spoke of hope, for a better America, and, in turn, a better world.In many ways, the 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards was nothing like ever before. Held in the middle of a global pandemic, host Jimmy Kimmel spoke to an empty auditorium. This while stars of the night sat in their homes with their families, friends and co-stars, and while fans across the world watched what became a night of passion, power and politics.Recognising that Covid-19 is changing the world as we know it, the winners did their best to make the most of the night, not just to triumph in their own glory, but to speak of and condemn the injustices exacerbated under the leadership of Unites States (US) President Donald Trump.From slamming Trump’s move to downplay Covid-19, to highlighting police brutality and racial inequality (which reignited the Black Lives Matter movement), the winners emphasised the need for TV fans everywhere to register to vote in the upcoming presidential elections, trust the US Postal Service and elect a government that promotes “inclusivity, love, compassion and kindness”.Major stars such as Mark Ruffalo (who won for I Know This Much Is True), Regina King (Watchmen), Dan Levy (Schitt’s Creek), Jesse Armstrong (Succession) and Anthony Anderson (the star of Blackish, who presented an award), spoke with passion and conviction for their various causes. Ruffalo, whose speech made headlines, said, “And if we have privilege, we have to fight for those who are less fortunate and more vulnerable — and that’s what is great about America, our diversity… We are stronger together when we love each other and we respect each other’s diversity.”King, said of police brutality, “The cops still haven’t been held accountable. She represents just decades, hundreds of years of violence against Black bodies – Breonna Taylor does.”, while wearing a tee-shirt honouring Taylor. This was reminiscent of award-winning author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates’ bestseller Between the world and me, in which he wrote of the fear of inhabiting a Black body in America.Even comedian Kimmel acknowledged that in hosting the event, he had the platform to do more, and so, he did. In his opening monologue, he said, “Of course we don’t have an audience. This isn’t a MAGA (Make America Great Again) rally, it’s the Emmys.” This was a dig at the president, who held a rally even as the pandemic required people to take precautionary measures such as physical distancing. The US has so far seen over six million cases of Covid-19 and over 200,000 deaths.What’s important about the political overtones that eclipsed the awards show was that these actors have been actively involved in various movements, both on and off screen: Be it the BLM movement, the climate crisis or Covid-19. Their passion-fuelled speeches only proved their resolve.But make no mistake. This messaging isn’t new. Awards shows in the US have been overtly political, more so since Trump came to power in 2016. This includes the Emmys. They have questioned government policies, highlighted gross inequalities in American society and stood up against oppressive structures that they claim destroy American culture. In this regard, it wasn’t surprising. But with rising intolerance, White supremacy and exclusionary right-wing populism on the rise, and with the US presidential election only months away, they pleaded with American viewers to make their vote count, to ensure that the November elections are a beacon to build an inclusive America.But it is often observed that Trump thrives in an environment where the elite attacks his presidency. He claims that the Hollywood A-listers are out of touch with “real America”. Therefore, the overt politicisation of the awards show can galvanise his campaign and his core base, which thrives in an “us vs them” narrative. All in all, the awards show was a signal fire, an attempt for viewers everywhere to dispel Trump’s idea of America and vote him out. The elections in November will prove if the messaging of influential artists from the thespian community can effect change. Time will tell. marika.gabriel@htdigital.inThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-politics-eclipsed-the-emmy-awards/story-WrAr2ajg9zCjat3hG5IlIO.html
23-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Higher education dept to initiate academic guidance visits in colleges||Gurugram: The state higher education department has proposed that colleges may allow students to visit their premises in a staggered manner to seek guidance from teachers. In a communication sent to the principals of all colleges on Tuesday, the department shared a tentative protocol with colleges for conducting these sessions and sought feedback on it by Friday. According to the tentative protocol, students from different courses have been allotted different days of the week for the guidance sessions. Students will be permitted to visit their college twice a week for a duration of three hours in a particular day, says the tentative schedule shared by the department. Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, has told principals that universities and colleges could prepare their own timetable, taking a cue from the proposed timetable. Verma said online classes will continue to take place along with these interactive in-person sessions. Colleges have been asked to share suggestions and preparedness of the institutions to implement these classes by Friday so that trial runs can begin from Saturday. Pooja Khullar, principal of the Dronacharya Government College, said that the college had received directions regarding the initiation of classes and would convene a meeting with faculty members before sending its response to the department. “We need to discuss various aspects with teachers before we can prepare a schedule and inform students. Since some students are already appearing for offline exams, they might want to visit the college for these guidance sessions as well. Students who don’t have access to smartphones or those who need assistance or guidance can use these sessions to get their doubts cleared,” said Khullar. ‘She said the college had already put in place sanitisation measures prior to conducting term-end exams and necessary measures would be taken once the trial classes start. Srishti Yadav, a second-year BSc student of Government Girls College in Sector 14, who is set to enter the third year, said students came to know about plans to conduct guidance classes twice a week. Yadav said she would prefer to visit colleges since online classes had not been taking place regularly. “If we look at the increasing Covid cases in the city, the situation doesn’t look good. However, I’d still prefer to go for physical visits since online classes are not very effective in terms of the delivery of lessons. If colleges allow us to visit for even two days in a week, we will be able to clarify our doubts and understand concepts that we struggle to comprehend via remote lessons,” Yadav said. From Monday, government schools across the city have already started allowing students studying in classes 9 to 12 to visit for voluntary academic guidance sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-higher-education-dept-to-initiate-academic-guidance-visits-in-colleges/story-xzgM0dQAqQumztTyWeVfJN.html
23-09-2020||City||Gurugram: MCG to pay biomedical waste lifters ₹300 per day incentive amid rising Covid-19 cases||Gurugram: As the Covid-19 cases continue to rise across the city, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to give monetary incentive to sanitation workers involved in lifting of biomedical waste from affected homes.As per officials, since April 1, 16 workers of MCG’s concessionaire for waste collection have been lifting biomedical waste collected from Covid-19 patients under home isolation across the city. To ensure they do not get deterred by the rising cases, each worker will be paid ₹300 per day to lift biomedical waste, the MCG officials said, adding that each of them will get a lump sum of ₹54,000 for the past six months (April-September). “We recognise the efforts and risks taken by biomedical waste lifters during this crucial period. Hence, we have decided to soon give them monetary incentives and also felicitate their contributions with a certificate. MCG is taking multiple steps towards ensuring the spread of coronavirus is minimised and careful waste collection is one of them,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The MCG officials said that the monetary incentive is likely to be paid on a monthly basis from October onwards, after paying the six-month lump sum to the workers. MCG had earlier outsourced the lifting of biomedical waste. However, the firm hired by the civic body refused to collect such waste from homes, saying that they didn’t have the necessary infrastructure for the same, the officials said. MCG has then asked Ecogreen, its door-to-door waste concessionaire, to step in. The MCG officials said that most workers refused to pick up biomedical waste, and it was only after asking hundreds of workers did they finally manage to find 16 workers who volunteered to carry out the task. “Our initial concessionaire was accustomed to only lifting hospital medical waste from a designated spot. It did not have the manpower and infrastructure to lift biomedical waste on a citywide scale and cancelled the contract. Hence, we asked Ecogreen take over the responsibility,” said an MCG official privy to the matter. Ecogreen has been lifting Gurugram’s waste since August 2017.The MCG official said that initially, they (Ecogreen) had attached one help with each driver of a garbage collection vehicle to lift biomedical waste from the doorstep of Covid-19 patients under home isolation. Then MCG decided to rope in RWAs in July to dump biomedical waste at a designated secluded spot or get them directly dumped inside garbage vehicles to ensure minimal human contact.The official further said that with coronavirus cases rising rapidly in the city over the last one month, the MCG feared that the 16 drivers may also opt against the task which could put the city at risk. “With the sudden rise in cases over the last month, we decided it was time to incentivise the workers to ensure they continue to lift biomedical waste and not get deterred by the growing spread of the virus,” said the MCG official. As per official data, on August 23, the total number of coronavirus cases in Gurugram was 10,971, which rose to 18,800 cases on September 23, an increase of 71%. Of the 18,800 cases, there are 2,629 patients under home isolation. On August 23, there were only 795 patients under home isolation, the data shows.A spokesperson of Ecogreen said, “When coronavirus had started surfacing in the city, MCG asked us for support. In correlation, we hired special vehicles and manpower for the lifting of waste from active Covid homes. All government norms and measures are being undertaken to not only protect our staff, but also the residents of Gurugram.”As per the MCG officials, all 16 vehicles are parked at a secluded spot near the community centre in Sukhrali where they are washed, disinfected, and sanitised every day after operations are completed.Sonia Duhan, waste consultant at MCG, said, “Workers were unwilling to volunteer as they feared contracting coronavirus. It was only after assurances that all safety measures would be adopted that we were able to form a separate team for biomedical waste collection.” Duhan said that the workers were informed that they will be provided PPE kits, regular health check-up, and training in lifting of biomedical waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-to-pay-biomedical-waste-lifters-300-per-day-incentive-amid-rising-covid-19-cases/story-UYnhPX89QdoNExYE2W8qjK.html
23-09-2020||City||Gurugram: HSVP installs cameras in office to watch late employees, touts||Gurugram: To keep a watch on visitors and employees of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) office in sector 14, the authority has installed 15 CCTV cameras, which will be monitored by senior officials. The move comes after a number of complaints regarding late arrival of employees and their absence from their seats. The cameras will also be used to keep a watch on the movement of middlemen as they misguide allottees and other visitors by promising to get their work done through their contacts, a senior HSVP official said. At least 12 cameras have been installed in office rooms and cabins of estate office one on the ground floor of the sector 14 office. “We have received repeated complaints that our employees are coming late and are not present on the seats. Allottees and other visitors complained that they are being called repeatedly for small formalities, which delayed things. To resolve the issue of late-coming and to keep a close watch on the activities of the employees, it was decided to install cameras,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer one. The cameras have been installed at the single window room, offices of deputy superintendent, JEs, clerks, assistant branch and the corridors. The employees have been asked to follow office timings strictly and ensure that issues of allottees are not delayed due to frivolous reasons.Gogia said action would be taken against employees who remain absent from their seats for too long. “We want to ensure there is no role of middlemen and allottees are given services within the time stipulated by the government. If any visitor has any issue, he can directly approach me for resolution,” he said.Gogia said the cameras would be used to ensure that safeguards pertaining to Covid-19 are followed strictly inside the HSVP office. “If any employee or visitor is found without a mask, then a penalty as per rules would be imposed on them,” he said, adding overcrowding will not be allowed in the premises at any cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hsvp-installs-cameras-in-office-to-watch-late-employees-touts/story-30HgiqkvLSCM8m90slWQ2N.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal registration of properties: HC dismisses bail plea of former Gurugram revenue official||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday dismissed anticipatory bail plea of a former revenue department official in Gurugram, Desh Raj Kamboj, who was booked by the state police for cheating and violating rules of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act.A former naib tehsildar, Kamboj, had approached the high court seeking anticipatory bail on September 14. In August, the Haryana police had booked six revenue department officials, including him, for alleged irregularities in registration of property deeds in Gurugram district. He had argued in the court that there is no violation of the Haryana Development and Regulations of Urban Areas Act, 1975, as the transferred land was not a agriculture land. However, the state’s additional advocate general, Deepak Sabharwal had told court that revenue records of majority of the lands for which the sale deeds were registered showed that the land was agricultural land. “He is required to unearth the nexus of the property dealers/ revenue officials including the patwaris, tehsildars and other revenue officials on behest of whom sale deeds were being illegally carried out,” Sabharwal had told the court while submitting that his custodial interrogation was required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-registration-of-properties-hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-former-gurugram-revenue-official/story-XqjzXSvMyPWbAKjGWwgRsL.html
23-09-2020||City||Bhondsi jail: Cleaner nabbed for drug supply to prisoners||Gurugram: A man working at the Bhondsi Jail was arrested on Tuesday over his alleged involvement in selling narcotics to inmates. Officers said upon inspection, the police recovered about 10 grams of opium which he had allegedly concealed in his undergarments.According to the police, the suspect, Balram Singh, was caught after a few jail officials noticed his activities on Tuesday afternoon in the jail pantry to be allegedly suspicious. In the police complaint, a jail official wrote, “It was observed that he was making rounds of the pantry repeatedly, following which senior jail officials were informed of his movements and he was frisked. The opium, concealed inside a tape, was recovered from him. He had hidden it in his underwear.”“The suspect worked as a cleaner and served water in the jail. After the incident was reported, we informed the police and he was handed over to the Bhondsi police team for further investigation,” said Sanjay Kumar, assistant jail superintendent, Bhondsi Jail.A police officer, privy to the investigation, said on condition of anonymity: “During preliminary questioning, he said he had handed over some narcotic substance on an earlier instance to a jail inmate. He is part of a larger nexus, who charge somewhere between Rs 2,000-Rs 4,000 for a small quantity of a drug and sneak it in by hiding it underneath shoes or clothes.” Police said they would question the suspect about his alleged supplier and the names of inmates who had procured the drug from him. “He has not given any names so far. We are checking his contact details,” said the officer quoted above.That the inmates allegedly have access to mobile phones and narcotics became known after the arrest of Dharambeer Chautala, who was posted as deputy jail superintendent at Bhondsi, on July 23 who, along with Ravi, an associate, was allegedly caught supplying these to the inmates. The police had recovered at least 11 4G SIM cards and 230 grams of hashish (a kind of narcotic) allegedly from their possession. Probe had found that one 4G SIM card was sold for over Rs 20,000 to inmates, who were using the phones to run their syndicates from inside the prison. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to probe the matter, following which two more allegedly aides of the suspects were arrested. Police have so far ruled out the association of Balram Singh with the earlier arrests. He was booked under sections 17/61/85 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and later released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhondsi-jail-cleaner-nabbed-for-drug-supply-to-prisoners/story-WHwwsieMXBfPXflJLrcKnL.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh veggie vendors charging up to 30% more than fixed rates||Even though the Chandigarh Market Committee has capped the vegetable prices, residents have been complaining that vendors are charging them up to 30% more than the fixed rates. With no apni mandis in place, people have been left with no option but to buy vegetables at exorbitant rates.To assess ground reality, this Hindustan Times reporter approached various vendors across the city and witnessed overpricing at almost every stall/cart. One kilogram of tomato, the cost of which has been set at ₹70/kg, is being sold for ₹90/kg. Cauliflower, which costs ₹60/kg, is available at ₹90/kg; cucumber at ₹50/kg; and bottle gourd at ₹40/kg. Guddu, who is selling tomatoes for ₹90 in Sector 18, said, “It is about the quality of vegetables. We make extra effort to procure tomatoes of ‘Himsona’ variety, which are expensive. That’s why I charge more for people.” Vikas from Sector 46 added that when they bought crates of tomatoes (one crate consists 20kg tomatoes), about two to three kg of the vegetable at the bottom perishes, cost of which has to be borne by them. A farmer from Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib district, Prahlad Singh Bhamia, said, “During the corresponding period in the past couple of years, prices of vegetables usually remained high, but apni mandis were an attractive option for people to buy vegetables directly from farmers at a fair price. Nowadays, people are at the mercy of vendors, who are charging as per their wish.”Federation of Sector Welfare Associations’ Chandigarh (FOSWAC) secretary Ranvinder Singh Gill said, “Officials aren’t doing enough to keep tabs on fleecing. They must involve the resident welfare associations (RWAs) to avoid such practice. Many unregistered vendors also visit our sectors. The authorities must provide us a list of registered vendors so that at least we can ensure that we aren’t fleeced.”As per the officials of Chandigarh Market Committee, rates are fixed on the basis of wholesale prices of vegetables. They said the municipal corporation has to ensure the compliance with the rate list and civic body inspectors can issue challans to vendors found overcharging customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/veggie-vendors-charging-up-to-30-more-than-fixed-rates/story-6ZGxB5tciQrAuDeSCEmiUJ.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||From Non-SCS to IAS: High court vacates stay on appointment of candidates||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday vacated stay on the selection of candidates for five posts of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from amongst the non-state civil service (non-SCS) officers in Haryana. The bench of justice S Muralidhar while posting the matter for final hearing on December 15 made it clear that appointments, if made, will be subject to outcome of writ petition. On August 18, the high court had stayed the final selection of candidates on the plea of Surender Singh Dahiya, 52, additional director, agriculture department, who challenged the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order of August 7. The CAT had upheld the Haryana government’s June 9 order on Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) conducting a written test to shortlist the candidates.The stay was vacated as the state had argued that August 18 order has stalled the process of filling up of the posts. As per the Haryana government, HPSC was only to conduct a written examination and then forward the list of 25 meritorious candidates to the chief secretary, who would then forward it to the UPSC. It says that the state is competent to evolve a criterion for the selections of candidates as it has been given complete discretion on adjudging a person to evaluate outstanding merit and ability for the purpose of shortlisting. The petitioner says that the HPSC can conduct the exam only with respect to state civil services and not the all-India services. Also, the only criterion for adjudging the outstanding ability and merit of the candidate is by way of service record of a candidate as a non-SCS officer and not the examination, the petitioner had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-non-scs-to-ias-high-court-vacates-stay-on-appointment-of-candidates/story-rAV9f7gs5F6IdOUZc7EvyI.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||JJP caught in a cleft stick over farm legislations||Caught in a cleft stick over the enactment of three farm legislations by the Parliament, BJP ally Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) has come under sharp attack from various quarters including the farmer organisations. The JJP, which considers itself to be the flag bearer of farmers rights and draws its strength from the legacy of farmer leader and former deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, has come under sharp attack for its failure to take an ostensible hard stance over the contentious farm laws. At the same time, the party has in bits and pieces tried to portray itself as an ardent sympathiser of the farming community from which it draws its political strength. Strategically deflecting demands of resignation by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, the party cadre led by his younger brother Digvijay has tried to undo the damage by apologising to the protesting farmers for the lathicharge at Pipli in Kurukshetra. Earlier, the deputy CM also said that he will step down if there was any attempt by the Centre to discontinue the minimum support price (MSP). His words, however, have not convinced his detractors as well as farmer leaders.His uncle and INLD MLA, Abhay Singh Chautala, who shares an acrimonious relationship with Dushyant says that the JJP leader has betrayed the trust of farmers. “Dushyant will not resign. But let me tell you that the people will take their resignations. People of Haryana will not let them tarnish the name of Chaudhary Devi Lal,” Abhay said. “Who is going to believe Dushyant now,” says former MLA, Jai Prakash reacting to Dushyant’s claims of stepping down.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Charuni has criticised Dushyant for yielding to the comforts of the chair. “Several JJP MLAs have extended their support to the farmers cause. Why is Dushyant hesitant? He should withdraw support from the government without any delay,” says Charuni. Commenting on the JJP’s strategy, professor Ashutosh Kumar of political science department, Panjab University, Chandigarh, said the JJP seems to be running with hare and hunting with the hounds. While the present phase of protests in the state seems to be subsiding gradually, thus, easing some pressure on the JJP, the party’s problems are far from over. During Sunday’s road blockade by farmer organisations, two JJP MLAs—Ram Karan Kala and Jogi Ram Sihag—also joined the protesters lending their support to the cause. While the JJP would not mind its MLAs supporting the stir, the episode does give some inkling to the growing friction in the party. Party MLAs Ram Kumar Gautam and Devender Babli have already been leading the dissenting brigade in the party with their repeated attacks on the JJP leaderships and coalition. “What kind of a coalition is this where MLAs of an ally come out in public attacking the government? And such MLAs are never held accountable by either of the allies,’’ said a political observer, who did not wish to be named. INLD leader Abhay Chautala said both JJP and Dushyant have been shown their place by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. “Dushyant met Khattar seeking a probe in the Pipli lathicharge. However, the CM has rejected the argument of lathicharge altogether. So what’s the stance of the JJP now,’’ he said. Professor Kumar of Panjab University said, “The decision of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal to resign from the Union cabinet has created problems for the JJP. “But being a regional party and with polls being four years away, the JJP will not sever ties with the BJP. The party needs funds and hence need to remain in power. Four year is a long time so they will bide their time to allow this issue to die down,” he said. The professor said though the JJP in one way or another would like to keep the pretense that they are championing the cause of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jjp-caught-in-a-cleft-stick-over-farm-legislations/story-BlteHbIp62UvjcvMqYmNWN.html

Vaccine will be administered to them in coming two to three days. The process of screening and recruitment will continue in the first phase for 100 volunteers on a daily basis,” PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said. To be eligible to volunteer, a person should be above 18 years of age, not have any underlying medical condition, and not have contracted the Covid-19 infection before. The family members of the candidates also have to test negative for the disease.Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had recently sent a show-cause notice to the Pune-based firm, Serum Institute of India, questioning why it has not stopped trials after a UK volunteer reportedly showed symptoms of neurological disorder, prompting four other countries to pause the study. At the PGIMER, recruitment of candidates was also put on hold while the safety approval for the first 100 participants from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) was awaited, which has now been provided.The premier institute is going to assess immunogenicity (formation of antibodies) along with the safety of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/9-volunteers-to-get-1st-dose-of-oxford-vaccine-at-pgimer-this-week/story-kMHQsLssKjsyKDAIPGwiqK.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Vigilance panel formed to ensure fair distribution of subsidised food grains in Chandigarh||To ensure effective implementation of all schemes under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), the Chandigarh administration constituted a vigilance committee, which will be headed by the UT adviser.The administration has also notified a grievance redressal mechanism under the act through which, any aggrieved person can make complaints to a district grievance redressal officer (DGRO). The NFSA aims to provide for food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people. The act provides for coverage of up to 75% of the rural population and up to 50% of the urban population for receiving subsidised food grains under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the population. Chandigarh has 2.57 lakh below poverty line (BPL) families under direct bank transfer (DBT) scheme. UT does not have any network of PDS shops or godowns. But, during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, the administration distributed food grains under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to the eligible beneficiaries.Grievance redressal mechanismComplaints can be made against officers or agency which has been entrusted with the implementation of the schemes under NFSA. Complaints can be about identification of eligible households, issuing ration cards, distribution of food grains, issuance of licences to fair price shop dealers and their monitoring, or DBT scheme among others. As per the notification issued by the administration, a complaint can be filed with the DGRO in writing or through email or dropped in the grievance drop box in DGRO office. All complaints will have to be acknowledged by a receipt in writing or through electronic means within one day of receipt of complaint. A unique grievance number will be allotted to the complainant.If DGRO is satisfied about the veracity of the grievance, necessary order for the redressal will be issued within 30 days from the receipt of the complaint.The DGRO to resolve complaints can direct officials to produce relevant official documents and direct persons to furnish such information as may be required.While deciding a complaint, the DGRO can recommend action to be taken by the competent authority against the employee of the department concerned, if found responsible.Disposal of complaints will be monitored by the secretary, department of food and supplies at least once a month.Any complainant or the officer (or agency) against whom any order has been passed by the DGRO, who is not satisfied with the redressal of grievances, can file appeal against such order before the state food commission within 30 days.What will vigilance committee doAs per the UT notification, the committee will regularly supervise the implementation of all schemes under NFSA.

23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Finally, people with mental illness to get a group home in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration has decided to set up a group home for mentally ill people at the Cheshire Home in Sector 21, while a halfway home would come up in the Disability Assessment Rehabilitation and Triage (DART) building in Sector 32.In a city with an ageing population, many emerging voices are demanding community (group) homes with long-term assisted living for persons with mental health issues.Despite having provisions for sheltered accommodation in the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, the union territory (UT) has no such facility so far.As reported earlier, at least 70 city-based residents have written over a hundred emails and letters and some have met the UT administrator and adviser, but have received only ‘sympathy and assurances’ in return, they say.UT adviser Manoj Parida, secretary social welfare Yashpal Garg, director social welfare Navjot Kaur and UT chief engineer Mukesh Anand inspected the Cheshire Homes on Wednesday.It emerged that 17 people, mostly handicapped, had encroached upon the property, which belongs to the administration. The inmates are mostly those who were earlier working at prepaid booths of the traffic police, which are now closed, stated an official press statement.The double storey building is constructed on a two-kanal plot.“Efforts will be made to engage some dedicated NGOs under the supervision of social welfare department to run these homes. The adviser has directed the officials to find out alternative jobs for handicapped persons, so that they could be gainfully employed and arrange their own accommodation independently. Further action on the issue will be taken in consultation with all departments,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/finally-people-with-mental-illness-to-get-a-group-home-in-chandigarh/story-cWATHa2fjpkdIBKTfh0ugL.html

Her husband had deserted the family in 2012.Acting on the complaint, the police registered a case under Section 376 of the IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.On her family’s request, the girl has been sent to a shelter home, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-15-year-old-impregnated-brother-his-friend-booked-for-rape/story-yxOggSMa9h5LXUcbc1rznO.html
23-09-2020||City||Mohali fully prepared to tackle stubble burning: DC||The district administration is fully prepared to check stubble burning, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said on Wednesday. “With paddy harvesting likely to pick up momentum in the next fortnight, we have devised a three-pronged strategy. We are focusing on awareness generation coupled with in-situ and ex-situ stubble management besides stringent action against the errant farmers,” he added. “Awareness vans have been flagged off which are touring villages and making people aware of the adverse effects of stubble burning and the machinery available to manage it. Posters, pamphlets, wall paintings, demonstration plots and anti-stubble burning announcements from local gurdwaras comprise the other information, education and communication (IEC) activities,” Dayalan said. The area under paddy cultivation in the district is around 25,800 hectares, which is expected to produce 1.29 lakh quintal crop residue. There are 1,700 stubble management machines in Mohali, which are provided on rent to farmers through 67 cooperative societies and 29 custom hiring centres. Besides, there are 75 combines with super straw management system and 4,000 harrows for the stubble management. Through the in-situ crop residue management scheme, 107 new machines are also being provided to the societies/farmers. “We expect to successfully tackle stubble management with these machines,” Dayalan said.“We have formed rapid response teams and appointed village-level nodal officers who would monitor the area under their jurisdiction and report stubble burning, if any,” the DC said, adding that they have been trained to use ATR mobile app through which they will share on-the-spot action taken report. “Response time is fixed and it is mandatory for every officer to update the report within the stipulated period,” he added. “Immediate response to the fire incidents resulting in quick slapping of penalties on errant farmers will deter others to follow suit,” Dayalan said. The other punitive actions include registration of FIRs and red entry in the revenue record of the erring farmers.Any land with red entry is difficult to sell or mortgage. Mohali was third in the state last year among the districts which recorded least stubble burning incidents. In 2019, 82 people were penalised to the tune of ₹2.55 lakh and seven FIRs were registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-fully-prepared-to-tackle-stubble-burning-dc/story-uNfjpeMLf1Roi3kb4HLYVK.html

23-09-2020||City||Banur school told to refund ₹1 lakh fee to parent, pay ₹25,000 compensation||The district consumer disputes redressal commission here has directed The British School (now, Bhartiya International Vidyapeeth) in Banur to refund ₹1 lakh with 9% interest per annum and compensation of ₹25,000 to a parent for not fulfilling the promises made prior to her two wards’ admission.In a complaint lodged on October 27, 2017, Narinder Kaur of Housefed Complex in Banur had stated that when she got her two children admitted in Class 7 and Class 4 for the session 2016-17, the school authorities promised they would provide air-conditioned (AC) classrooms for students, daily homework at school and lockers for keeping books. The school had also assured sports activities, no uniform, and personality development of students.Believing the school’s claims, the complainant paid ₹1.77 lakh as fee, but the promised facilities were not given. Following this, the complaint held a meeting with the school’s board of directors, and instead of paying heed to the grievance the latter said the parents who were not satisfied with the school’s working should withdraw their wards, she alleged.Kaur then removed her children from the school and sought a refund of ₹1.02 lakh along with 24% interest, but nothing was paid to her, she said.She then lodged the complaint with the redressal commission.While passing the orders, commission president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said. “It is seen that nowadays educational institutions are opened like shops. They charge exorbitant fees from parents. Poor and even middle class parents are not able to admit their children in such institutions. Since school authorities are ex parte and there is no explanation on how and in what manner the money was charged, so we have no alternative except to go by the averments of the complaint.”Ex parte refers to proceedings where one of the involved parties (the school in this case) is not present.The commission directed the school to refund ₹1.02 lakh along with interest of 9% per annum from the date of filing the complaint till realisation. The commission also asked the school to pay lump sum compensation to the tune of ₹25,000 to the complainant.When contacted, school director Nirpal Singh said, “I am not aware of any such case and will file a reply once we see the judgement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/banur-school-told-to-refund-1-lakh-fee-to-parent-pay-25-000-compensation/story-Ktsptn9rDlJg4xLfCFcKxN.html
23-09-2020||City||Bhiwandi buillding collapse: 3 days on, relatives still wait for news||Amid heavy rain, survivors and relatives of those staying in Jilani building, a part of which collapsed on Monday, continued to wait for news on their loved ones on Wednesday, more than 60 hours after the mishap. The tragedy turned out to be the worst faced by the loom town in the past few decades, with the toll crossing 40. The confusion over identification of a body added to the anxiety of the kin. Obaidulla Shaikh, 36, brother-in-law of Shabnam Mohammad Ali Shaikh, claimed she was missing as they could not get her body. However, the rescue team confirmed that 28-year-old Shabnam’s body was found at 5pm on Tuesday. Shabnam’s mother Zulekha survived the incident with a leg injury. Both mother and daughter lived on the third floor. Obaidulla Shaikh said, “The rescue team claimed she was sent to IGM Hospital. Some people told us that when a body was removed on Tuesday evening, people shouted Shabnam and that is why the record shows her name. Shabnam used to teach Arabic to students in the area and was well-known. If she was taken to a hospital, people would have known. Some people told us that she was rescued and was sent to some hospital. We don’t know whom to believe.” A fire officer from Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) said, “We will ask the rescue team to cross-check.” BNCMC commissioner Pankaj Ashiya said, “The police have claimed it is Shabnam’s body, but the relatives have refused it. Police might do a DNA test to confirm.” Senior police inspector of Narpoli station MB Shinde said, “The family had approached us to file a missing complaint, but we have not registered it as a body has been found. We will do a DNA test.”In a touching scene, Wasim Ansari, 27, and his friend, Faizan Ansari, 32, who were among the first from the nearby area to reach the site on Monday and continued to help with the rescue operation till Wednesday, broke down while removing the body of a six-year-old. The duo managed to rescue seven people alive from the third floor. “We quickly pulled out as many people we could,” said Wasim. “It is very painful now, as we are only looking for bodies,” said Faizan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-buillding-collapse-3-days-on-relatives-still-wait-for-news/story-I4oam0ZVbyOF87gyv7HgeO.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||For four days, fewer than 4k cases in Capital||Delhi has recorded fewer than 4,000 cases of the coronavirus disease for four days now, with the positivity rate lower than 7% over the last two days.On Tuesday, 3,714 people tested positive for the viral infection, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The Capital added 3,816 cases of the infection on Tuesday, 2,548 on Monday, and 3,812 on Sunday. To be sure, the bulletins on Sunday and Monday usually see a dip in testing and new cases, owing to the weekend.The daily average test positivity rate for the infection too has dropped to 6.89% in the seven days ending Wednesday, from 7.18% recorded over the seven days before that.“In Delhi, the cases that are being reported now are not from the same areas from where cases were being reported in June. It is likely that the numbers will go down after people in the areas where there were fewer infections earlier also get it. This is what happened in Bihar where the spread could not be controlled, but the numbers eventually dropped after several people were infected,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The city also recorded 36 more deaths due to the infection, according to Wednesday’s health bulletin, taking the death toll in the city to 5,087. Even as the number of cases have dipped below the 4,000-mark, the number of deaths has remained almost the same, with around 35 deaths recorded on average each day over the last one week. This has resulted in an increase in the seven-day case fatality ratio (CFR). The seven-day CFR stood at 0.9%, compared to 0.7% a week ago. The cumulative CFR in the city has been reducing, indicating that fewer deaths took place during the September surge than during the initial surge in the city in June. The cumulative CFR dipped below 2% for the first time on Wednesday; it stood at 1.98%. In comparison, India’s CFR stands at 1.6% “Fewer deaths due to Covid-19 are being reported now as the treatment protocol has been standardised. We have learnt that the patients respond better to high flow nasal oxygen than on ventilator. We now know that steroids work and are prescribing it early on. We have learnt the importance of early treatment. These have helped in bringing down the mortality,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor of pulmonology at Safdarjung hospital||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-four-days-fewer-than-4k-cases-in-capital/story-fQlfXwT7AgxMW6xCxJU58L.html

The bodies of Banu’s two other children, Farah, 6, and Falak, 5, too, were found nearby. The body of Banu’s husband, Mohammad Murtuza Khan, 35, was also pulled out from the debris on Wednesday evening. Banu’s father-in-law Mohammad Mustaffa Khan, 54, who lives near Jilani building with his wife, said, “I saw my daughter-in-law and her youngest daughter Riha being pulled out of the debris, while she was holding on to my granddaughter tightly. My two grandsons were also found dead. It was painful to watch them in that condition.”Banu’s son Sadiq, 8, was lucky as he stayed at his grandparents’ house on Sunday night. Murtuza owns a soap shop in Bhiwandi and he lived on the first floor of the building. Khan said, “Sadiq often stayed over at our place. He is the only surviving member of the family. He is very young to understand this huge loss. We don’t know what to tell him when he will ask about his parents and siblings.

23-09-2020||Delhi||Man opens fire at ex-girlfriend’s house in Sarita Vihar to threaten her, arrested||A 27-year-old man allegedly barged into his ex-girlfriend’s house in Sarita Vihar on Monday, opened fire and threatened to kill her and her family members if she married someone else, police said.The man, identified as Sumit Tomar, was arrested on Tuesday and a country made pistol used in the crime recovered from him, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said that late on Monday night, the police received a call regarding firing outside a house at Aali Vihar in Sarita Vihar. The caller, a 24-year-old woman, told the police that she was inside her home with her family members when her ex-boyfriend opened fire at their main gate. Nobody was injured in the firing. Two empty bullet shells were recovered from near the main gate that was partially broken because of the impact of the bullets, said the DCP.“The woman alleged that the bullets were fired by her ex-boyfriend, Sumit Tomar, who had been stalking, sexually harassing and threatening her. A case of act endangering the life of others, stalking, sexual harassment and criminal intimidation was registered at the Sarita Vihar police station and teams were formed to nab Tomar,” said DCP Meena.During the probe, a police officer said, the woman told investigators in her statement that she had been in a relationship with Tomar for nearly a decade. They wanted to marry each other but because of certain reasons the wedding had to be called off. “Then after Tomar’s marriage with someone else around two years ago, the woman started ignoring him, which infuriated him. Tomar wanted her to continue their relationship but she did not want to ruin his married life and her future as well,” said the officer.About two months ago, the woman’s wedding was fixed with someone and Tomar learnt about it. He began stalking and pressuring her to change her decision, but she was not ready to do so. Her refusal irked Tomar and to intimidate her and her family members, he purchased a country made pistol from an arms dealer in Uttar Pradesh last month. On Monday, he fired outside the woman’s house, threatened her and her family members before fleeing the incident spot. “We raided Tomar’s home and hideouts but found him missing. On Tuesday, the teams caught him after receiving information that he was hiding in the forested area of Aali Vihar,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-opens-fire-at-ex-girlfriend-s-house-in-sarita-vihar-to-threaten-her-arrested/story-57ozOPpjqbl8Iy9i5uWYHL.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||9 trees died, 24 damaged during digging work in Delhi Cant: Forest dept to high court||The Delhi government’s forest department has submitted a fresh status report to the Delhi high court stating that a total of 33 trees have been damaged (of which nine later died) in the deemed forest and morphological ridge land in Delhi Cantonment, by the army and the public works department (PWD) while carrying out separate excavation and construction work along the Ring Road. The report, which was submitted on September 18 after an inspection by forest officials on September 3, said fresh violations were observed by the PWD while taking up digging and levelling work near Dhaula Kuan bus stop. “For carrying out any kind of non-forest activity in the morphological ridge (an area having Ridge-like features), prior permission is needed from the Ridge Management Board, which the PWD did not have,” the report prepared by deputy conservator of forests (west division) Muan Guite said. On August 27, HT had reported that around 33 trees were damaged during the construction of a boundary wall (from Sawai Man Singh Dwar to Army Environmental Park and Training Area) by the army. The court had issued contempt notices to army officers as well as PWD officials over the alleged damage caused to trees and had asked the agencies to stop the work. On Wednesday, the high court directed the forest department to guide the PWD and the army in carrying out restoration of damaged trees. “The DCF shall specify the areas where the trees need to be planted and also specify the variety of trees along with their girth, size, and age, required to be planted,” the court said. The patch in question is located along the Ring Road in Delhi Cantonment and is both a deemed forest and a morphological ridge. Any kind of trenching, excavation and construction work here without due permission amounts to a violation of both the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, as well as National Green Tribunal’s 2015 order prohibiting such activities within a one-metre radius of tree trunks. As per Supreme Court order, in Delhi’s context, a deemed forest is one that is spread across an area of at least one hectare and the number of trees per hectare is 250 or above.The forest department report said nine trees were now dead. “Of the total trees damaged, 24 can still be saved by treating them and covering the exposed roots with soil,” the report said.It further said, “The total morphological ridge and deemed forest area affected due to soil excavation and digging work by PWD is 2,630 square metres. A total of seven full-grown pipal trees have been damaged by the PWD.”A senior PWD official, who did not wish to be named, said that corrective action will be taken based on the court directions. The report also highlighted that upon inspection, it was found that fresh construction, of the boundary wall, was being carried out by the army. “The excavated soil and debris were indiscriminately thrown into the deemed forest area thereby exposing some of the root system of trees and damaging secondary the root system as well. In the process of trenching for the boundary wall foundation, some of the trees have fallen completely. The ground flora has also been damaged thereby disturbing the ecology of the area,” it said. The report said a total of 26 trees such as bargad, shehtoot, subabool and gular, among others, have been damaged by the army. Indian Army spokesperson Aman Anand, who had earlier denied any damage to trees, said, “A statement has been issued earlier in the matter and now the case is subjudice.” “A status report has been submitted in the court. The excavation and construction work was stopped in the area on September 4 itself,” said Guite. CR Babu, professor emeritus at Delhi University’s Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems, said damage and felling of so many trees along a busy road will reduce the efficacy of the tree line to act as a filter for pollutants. Most of these trees have high dust-trapping efficiency, which has been hampered. “The trees that are still alive can be restored by covering the roots with fresh and good quality soil, which must be mixed with an anti-termite agent, as damaged trees are highly susceptible to termite infestation. The trees must be watered adequately until they start regrowing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/9-trees-died-24-damaged-during-digging-work-in-delhi-cant-forest-dept-to-high-court/story-hR5j0Y6Lf1wT2qebR6y4xL.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Set up helpline, create web link to register complaints over damage to trees: Delhi HC to govt||The Delhi high court has directed the state forest department to set up a telephone helpline and create a link on its website where people can lodge complaints against concretisation or other kinds of damage to trees.Justice Najmi Waziri said that on receiving a complaint, the ‘tree officer’ will promptly initiate measures by coordinating with the land-owning agency concerned and the police to redress the problem.Hearing a plea on unauthorised construction and damage to trees filed by one Nitin Gupta through advocate RK Kapoor, the court said, “The tree officer and the land-owning agencies shall ensure all concrete around trees is removed, as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal, and that a damaged tree is restored to good health.” It said the system should be notified to the general public through newspapers, electronic publications, etc.The court’s order came after the tree officer said several trees in old Delhi had been choked with concrete. He said that to save them from premature death, the current deconcretisation exercise will have to be extended till all such trees are freed and hence such a system has to be put in place.A senior forest official, who did not wish to be named, said, “Though we recently launched a new helpline to cater to complaints of both trees and wild animals in distress, and queries are being addressed in the shortest time possible, in this case, since we haven’t received the court order yet, we will be in a position to comment once we examine it in detail.” On an earlier occasion, the court had said it cannot be denied that there are hardly many trees in the Walled City, especially in the densely populated and heavily built-up area of Chandni Chowk.Each tree in that neighbourhood is valuable and would need protection, the court had said, and asked the tree officer and the municipal corporation to jointly embark on a tree-census exercise in the Walled City.The corporation submitted a list of old trees in Dariba Kalan, Urdu Bazaar, Jama Masjid and Jagat Cinema on the orders of the court, which was hearing a plea for the restoration of a 300-year-old tree damaged by unauthorised construction.On September 16, the north Delhi municipal corporation showed photographs of deconcretisation around trees in Urdu Bazar on the forest department’s orders.The court, after looking at the photos, said while the corporation’s work needed to be acknowledged, it had to be pursued and extended further. The judge said some of concrete cleared was evidently not enough.The court then asked the corporation to free more space around the trees to facilitate percolation of water and absorption of nitrogen and other minerals by the tree roots.The matter would be now heard on October 7.Aditya N Prasad, an environment lawyer who had petitioned against concretisation of trees, said, “Even if a dedicated helpline is set up, the question is who will attend the complaints as limited staff is available with the department. Concretisation or any other tree offence is directly linked to boots on the ground and hence the department must fill up the vacancies first to address these complaints.”The forest department had recently launched a tree and wildlife helpline number to attend to complaints regarding trees and animals in distress. The helpline launched on September 10 has received a high number of calls regarding trees. Of the over 300 odd calls till Monday, around 160 were related to trees.Prasad said the tree and animal helpline should not be mixed as it won’t be able to cater to the large volume of tree-related queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/set-up-helpline-create-web-link-to-register-complaints-over-damage-to-trees-delhi-hc-to-govt/story-lf3JL3RIY2hYt7iZ5qgsVN.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Analyse IARI tech to manage crop residue: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked the state development department to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a technology developed by Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) scientists for decomposition of crop stubble and provide an alternative to the practice of residue burning.Kejriwal directed the department to explore the possibility of using the technology at farms in the peripheries of Delhi, a statement issued by the chief minister’s office said.“Crop stubble burning is a major source of winter pollution in Delhi. I congratulate the Indian Agriculture Research Institute scientists for developing a low-cost, effective technology to deal with crop stubble burning. Governments need to listen and work hand in hand with scientists to address the issue of stubble burning,” Kejriwal said.The technology, called Pusa Decomposer, involves making a liquid formulation using fermented farm inputs, and then spraying it over the fields to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of crop stubble. At an estimated cost of Rs 20 per acre, the technology can effectively deal with 4-5 tonnes of raw straw, the statement said.“Research over the last four years in the farm fields in Punjab and Haryana have shown very encouraging results on the benefit of using this approach for reducing the need for crop stubble burning and at the same time reducing fertiliser consumption and increasing farm productivity,” it said.On Wednesday, a group of scientists briefed the CM, who is scheduled to visit the institute for a live demonstration of the technology on Thursday, the chief minister’s office said. “He instructed officials from the development department to carry out a detailed cost-benefit analysis and explore implementation of this technology across all farms in outer Delhi that face the issue of crop stubble.”Smoke emanating from crop stubble burning by farmers in Punab, Haryana and elsewhere in north India causes the air to plunge to hazardous levels every winter in Delhi and nearby areas.Every year these farm fires usually begin in full swing by mid-October. Last year, early fires were detected by September 25.

The woman is a government school teacher and lives with her husband at a rented house in Mansarovar Park. Her in-laws live elsewhere in East Delhi and drive the car she received from her parents during her wedding, she said. “I and my husband live separately but my in-laws were driving my car. Over the last three months, we kept receiving messages from traffic police about traffic violations,” the woman said. Since the car was registered in her father’s name, the challans would be sent her father’s mobile phone, leaving her “embarrassed”.“Each time my father would alert me about it, I would communicate it to my in-laws. They kept on promising to pay the penalties, but never did. It was me who was paying it all the time,” the woman alleged.According to the new Motor Vehicles Act, speeding draws a penalty of Rs2,000 and traffic line violation Rs500. On Sunday morning, there was yet another challan for red light violation, she said. “When I raised the issue with my husband, he turned aggressive and attacked me,” the woman alleged. In her complaint to the police, she accused her husband of banging her head on the wall and leaving her injured in her arm with a broken glass.Since the lockdown, cameras installed at multiple junctions and stretches kept on eye on vehicles and were used to send challans for speeding and red light violations as traffic police personnel avoided issuing manual notices to keep themselves safe from being infected by Covid-19.The high number of challans issued during the lockdown led to many essential service providers, particularly doctors, demanding that these be rolled back. One doctor, for example, was fined Rs50,000. But a senior traffic police officer said fines will continue to be issued even if a motorist gets penalised multiple times on a single stretch on the same day. There are a total of 236 speed-detection cameras in different parts of Delhi. During the first month of the lockdown, as many as 10 challans were issued every minute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teacher-assaulted-by-husband-with-glass-after-she-questions-multiple-traffic-challans-by-her-in-laws/story-bYwiZ5Zy3khFhIweCLzwwM.html

Mohalla clinics – a flagship project of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government – are primary health centres across the city providing free OPD service. Currently, there are around 480 of them – of which around 200 were briefly closed during the first few weeks of the lockdown.Unlike government hospitals and dispensaries, where the staff are either government employee or hired as ad-hoc, these clinics are run by private empanelled doctors and staff who are paid on a per-patient basis. Currently, mohalla clinics are also doubling up as free rapid antigen test centres from 2 pm to 5 pm.Most mohalla clinics are portable cabin-like setups which have an OPD room, a waiting area and a dispensary. As many as 212 of them also have facilities for pathology tests, X-ray and other services. On an average, any such clinic in the city caters to around 140-150 patients a day, said a senior official in the health department who did not wish to be identified.In January, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had inaugurated 152 mohalla clinics and the government had elaborated on a plan to have 1,000 such primary health centres ready by mid-2020. “The pandemic has delayed the plan,” said the health department official.The official further said that the first such clinic was opened in 2015 and over a period of five years, mohalla clinics in Delhi have collectively treated over 20 million patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-issues-tender-for-30-new-mohalla-clinics/story-bcCaPAxGU7aWRsvFVPjxuM.html

The visits were conducted on the directions of the high-powered committee formed for shifting the dairy units out of the city limits. Earlier, experts were asked to identify the drawbacks in the existing infrastructure so that they can be avoided when the new complexes are established. The officials also got feedback from dairy farmers regarding proposed change of land use (CLU) of the existing dairy complexes.MC joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh said, “The experts have analysed the existing infrastructure and will now submit a report regarding the design of new proposed complexes in the meeting which is scheduled for Thursday. Also, change of land use (CLU) of the existing dairy complexes were discussed. We will submit the dairy farmers’ feedback with the committee, who will take the final decision.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The committee was formed in the last week of July and has been asked to come up with a plan to shift the units in three months after examining all aspects. The dairy units have to be shifted to reduce pollution in the Buddha Nullah. The officials have also identified few sites in nearby villages where new and modern dairy complexes can be set up. I have asked them to submit a feasibility report.” CLU should be allowed free of cost: dairy farmersPresident of the Haibowal dairy complex association, Paramjit Singh, said,”We have demanded that CLU should be provided free of cost as farmers will also have to purchase plots to establish their units after they have shifted from the existing complexes.

23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Start rainwater harvesting in govt buildings: Industries’ body to Punjab officials||Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) on Wednesday organised an interactive online session with officials from Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority, including chairman Karan Avtar Singh, regarding issues related to the groundwater in Punjab. FICO raised issues including the cumbersome process for industrial bodies in Punjab to obtain NOC to extract groundwater.FICO officials said that the Ludhiana municipal corporation is unable to provide enough water to cater to the needs of the industry. Also, the lack of co-ordination between government departments, especially Punjab Pollution Control Board and MC was highlighted due to which industries could not get permission to harvest the rainwater on their premises. Karan Avtar Singh said the department is working on feasible solutions as National Green Tribunal is very strict regarding vulnerable ground water levels. “We need to develop a system to restore the ground water,” he said.“We are working on a model for use of stock as well as the groundwater. The draft will be finalised by October 15 and implemented within a month after that,” he added. FICO chairman KK Seth said the process to obtain the NOC is cumbersome and has clauses that are almost impossible to meet. He added that there are many units in the MSME sector who uses the water for domestic purpose only. So, Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority, should consider keeping such units in green category with minimum documentation required, Seth said. FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said rainwater harvesting channels along the highway crossing Ludhiana are non-operational and need to be made working. He added that government bodies like schools, colleges, government buildings and ITIs should be used for rain water harvesting throughout Punjab. FICO vice-chairman Vipan Mittal said they are planning common effluent treatment center for waste released by dyeing units. RK Gupta, ex-chief environmental engineer, PPCB, and executive member, FICO, said the industry uses only a margin of ground water compared to agricultural field. So, only industries should not be held responsible for indiscriminate drawing of ground water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/start-rainwater-harvesting-in-govt-buildings-industries-body-to-punjab-officials/story-azRkLiCr2N4rTCM6xLpBqN.html

23-09-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar DM warns banks having credit-debit ratio below 40%, asks them to improve it||Many banks in Gautam Budh district reported a credit-debit ratio (CDR) of less than 40%, an indication of poor lending. This has prompted the district magistrate (DM) to ask banks to improve credit.With the relaxation of lockdown norms, the engines of the economy are slowly getting back on track. Many businesses are, however, cash strapped with the 68-day lockdown and other restrictions.In the district level review committee (DLRC), meeting on Tuesday, DM Suhas LY asked banks to speed up their processes. He said that out of the 47 banks in the GB Nagar district, 14 had a CDR below 40%. The DM will to the banks’ regional offices to increase it up to 60%. “At present, the overall CDR of the district is 58.44%. It was also found during the DLRC meeting that out of stipulated loan disbursement target of ₹10,600 crore for the fiscal 2020-21, the banks in the district have disbursed ₹2,908 crore of loans till June 2020, which is 27.43% of the target. Out of this ₹2,908 crore, the banks disbursed ₹510.98 crore among 6,535 beneficiaries, under the centre-sponsored ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ scheme,” he said. The DM also said that at present, 650 housing loans in the district have been found non-profitable assets (NPAs). “The overall worth of these housing loans is ₹104 crore,” said Suhas. Meanwhile, the lead bank manager (LBM) in the district, Ved Ratna, said that GB Nagar has over 450 branches of 47 banks. “CDR below 40% means that out of every ₹100 that a bank raises as deposits, it lends less than ₹40 – besides compulsorily parking ₹24 in government’s statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and ₹6 as cash reserve ratio (CRR) with the RBI. The highest permissible limit of CDR is 70%,” he said.The lead bank scheme involves a bank assuming a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and the Government. Gautam Budh Nagar’s lead bank is Syndicate Bank that appointed Ratna as the LBM.The reason for a low CDR could be two fold, Ratna explained. One, it could be that the deposits have increased, or that advances have actually not increased.“Here deposit and advances both are in increasing order but deposit increases more than advances,” he said.The LBM further said that free training for unemployed persons aging between 18 and 40 years have been started in the district from September 21 at Canara Bank Rural Self Employment Training Institute (CBRSETI) in Surajpur. “The training sessions, which were running continuously before the Covid-19 outbreak, have been started again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-dm-warns-banks-having-credit-debit-ratio-below-40-asks-them-to-improve-it/story-Srdh0b1WaJ1rwms2HxWdQJ.html

According to the police, the robbers entered the house after cutting the window grilles. “After entering the house around 2.45am, the robbers overpowered the elderly woman and locked her in a bathroom. Likewise, they overpowered other two members of the family and also held them hostage in other rooms. Then they ransacked the house before fleeing with cash (about ₹80,000), jewellery and items like mobile phones, laptop, among others. The valuation of the stolen items is yet to be done. A wrist watch, suspected to be of one of the robbers, was found left behind,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). At the time of the incident, the victim, Suresh Mittal, who operates a departmental store in Mahagunpuram, was in the house with his wife Usha, 62, and their daughter Rashi who works as HR manager in Mumbai and had come to her parents’ house in July, the police said. The couple’s son, Mohit, who is a chartered accountant, had returned about 10 days ago to Kolkata where he works. According to the police, the family had taken up construction at their house in June and the robbers during the incident were repeatedly asking them about money they had kept in the house. “We have registered an FIR under Indian Penal Code Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery). The robbers were in the age group of 25-30 years and stayed in the house till about 4am before fleeing through the railway tracks nearby,” Verma added.

Neighbours said that the senior citizen couple was also taken for medical examination as one of the robbers had put a screw driver into the mouth of Usha Mittal and issued threats. However, the police said that they only threatened the woman with the screw driver. “The senior citizen couple was taken to hospital for medical examination and returned at 7.15am. A police team had arrived at the spot. Their house is about 50 metres from our home. The faces of the couple were swollen and it seemed that they were beaten up,” said one of couple’s neighbours who wished not to be named.

23-09-2020||City||Greater Noida: IIT-Roorkee to prepare master plan to recycle waste water||The Greater Noida authority is set to ready a master plan to recycle the city’s waste water by December end.In January, it had hired IIT Roorkee as a consultant to detail how to recycle the waste water that is generated from group housings, industries, commercial areas, institutions and other entities. The exercise was to be completed by the end of this month, but was disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We have a vision to start supplying recycled water to industries, irrigation use, nearby thermal power plant and other purposes once the master plan is prepared. Once everything falls into place, water from the Ganga will be used only for drinking purposes,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Greater Noida’s estimated drinking water requirement is 210 million litres per day (MLD). Currently it pumps this much from groundwater, which is processed for drinking as well as non-drinking purposes. By next year, the authority will receive a supply of 210 MLD from the Upper Ganga Canal thereby releasing its dependence on groundwater. While at present Greater Noida generates 185 MLD sewage, it is estimated that it will generate 250 MLD in the next 10 years. The sewage treatment plant in Kasna treats 137 MLD for industrial, residential and other sewage. Two other MLDs of 2 MLD and 10 MLD capcity in Badalpur treat industrial waste.

In the melee, one of the suspects escaped and so did the piglets. The other suspect was caught and handed over to the police.According to the police, the suspects, who had allegedly stolen two piglets, when chased by the public in Razapur locality, drove their car onto the railway tracks and kept going for about 2km in a bid to escape the crowd. An express train approaching on the same track, on spotting a car being driven on the tracks, came to a halt to avert a collision.The Ghaziabad police said the car was later removed from the tracks and one of the men, Vijay Valmiki, arrested for theft. The car he was driving was found to be stolen from Haryana, police said. The incident took place around 2.30pm, police said. Valmiki and his accomplice allegedly fled in their car after snatching two piglets from a locality near Razapur, but public spotted them and gave chase. “The Swift Dzire sped into an industrial area nearby on spotting the crowd giving chase. When they could not find any way to move out of the industrial area, they drove the car onto the railway tracks and kept going on the tracks (Ghaziabad-Hapur line) for about 2km,” said Bhairav Kumar Jha, a member of the police’s digital volunteer force who works in the industrial area. “A train was also coming from Hapur and when the train driver saw the car on the tracks, he slowed down and stopped the train. In the meanwhile, the public stopped the car, nabbed one of the suspects and handed him over to the police. The other car occupant fled the spot. In all the commotion, the piglets also escaped and could not be traced,” Jha said. “The train which was stopped was the Awadh Assam Express, which was bound for Delhi. It stopped for about seven to eight minutes at the spot and later arrived at Ghaziabad railway station,” said Ashok Sisodia, inspector from government railway police (Ghaziabad).Police said Valmiki is a resident of Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad. “The other suspect will be traced soon. They had stolen the piglets from a small hamlet in Razapur and drove the vehicle onto the railway tracks. During questioning, we found that the Swift Dzire was stolen from Haryana. We have booked him for theft. We have also informed railway police about the incident,” said Nagendra Chobe, SHO, Kavi Nagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chased-by-public-after-stealing-piglets-thief-drives-car-on-railway-tracks-for-2km-bring-train-to-a-halt/story-3ODoKxVYTjPoFIYD7Im56O.html

23-09-2020||City||Film policy may be tweaked by UP govt for Film City||The Uttar Pradesh government is likely to tweak the state government’s film policy 2018 to benefit filmmakers who are keen to set up studios at the proposed film city near the international airport at Jewar along 165km Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra.The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority has also expedited the process to ready land for the development of the dedicated infotainment (Film City) zone in sector 21, which would be spread across 1,000 acres of land just next to the Noida International Greenfield airport project site.“The Uttar Pradesh government has told filmmakers that it will make necessary changes in the film policy 2018 provided they are ready to invest in the project proposed to give boost growth in this region. Once the filmmakers submit their proposals pertaining to their plan of setting up studios, the state government will work accordingly and do the needful,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority, which has expedited work on land acquisition in sector 21.The YEIDA officials said they expect filmmakers to seek lower land rates, waiver on stamp duty and other benefits.If the state government feels the waivers will invite investment from filmmakers and fuel the local economy, then it will change provisions in the film policy 2018, officials said.The YEIDA has 835 hectares of land that it had bought from farmers long time back.“We have started taking steps to buy the remaining 165 hectares from farmers who are willing to give land for the project. With consent, the farmers will directly sell land for the film city,” said Singh.The Uttar Pradesh government had established the Yamuna authority in 2002 to encourage industrial development and notified 2.5 lakh hectares of land along the 165 km Yamuna Expressway for the purpose. Ever since the Noida International Greenfield airport project was approved at Jewar along the Yamuna Expressway, global investors have started showing interest in buying the land along this region. The concessionaire Switzerland Company Zurich is likely to start work at airport project on ground soon after restrictions over air travel imposed amid the Covid-19 pandemic are over.“With the airport at Jewar, expressways, the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and other world-class projects, the Film City will be a suitable project in this region,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/film-policy-may-be-tweaked-by-up-govt-for-film-city/story-Lc8jsRSXjJmQu9Sz5AJIXP.html
23-09-2020||City||Misplaced inquiry report: Court employee held in Ludhiana||The Division Number 5 police have arrested a court employee for allegedly misplacing an inquiry report concerning a 2014 murder case. The accused, Rajinder Singh, of Jhujhar Nagar, Mohali, was booked in the matter on December 28, 2018, following an inquiry order by the Punjab and Haryana high court. He was arrested from near his house in Mohali on Wednesday.ASI Kuldeep Singh, in-charge, New Court Complex police post, said the Sahnewal police had lodged a case of murder, attempt to murder, rioting under the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act after some men had shot dead one Gurjeet Singh, 45, of Sahabana village, Sahnewal. Later, some of the accused had approached the DIG office, claiming false implication, and an inquiry was marked.The inquiry report was submitted before the local court, but later went missing.After the complainant moved the high court, another inquiry was marked to find the person responsible for misplacing the report, and Rajinder, who was working as an additional ahlmad (record keeper) in the court of the then additional sessions judge, was indicted.However, he had been on the run since he was booked for the offence in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/misplaced-inquiry-report-court-employee-held-in-ludhiana/story-y31yKVNWkZwJBA3851gTCI.html
23-09-2020||City||RRTS project: For its Duhai depot, transport corp to buy land directly from farmers||Land for the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) depot at Duhai will be purchased directly purchased now from the respective owners, the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said, instead of the earlier plan to procure the same from the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA), at its Madhuban Bapudham housing scheme project.This means that the transport corporation will now buy the 51 hectares of land that it needs, directly from farmers.Officials said the depot at Duhai will also have a station nearby. The 17km Sahibabad-Duhai stretch, in Ghaziabad, was declared as a priority corridor and this will be the first one to be completed, likely by 2023. The entire corridor, 82km in total, will be completed by 2025. Deliberations for procuring land for the Duhai depot had been going on since December last year and NCRTC had approached GDA for its land requirement at the Madhuban Bapudham housing scheme. However, the plan now stands dropped and the NCRTC will now purchase 51 hectares of land directly from farmers.Originally, the depot was scheduled over an area of 60 hectares but officials said they fine tuned and optimised the depot area to fit into 51 hectares.“Public notice for procuring land from farmers has been issued, as is procedure. Land will now be purchased directly from farmers. The Duhai depot will be constructed at its originally proposed location (at the side going towards Meerut, on the Delhi Meerut Road). There were complexities at GDA’s Madhuban Bapudham scheme and the matter could not be seen through,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief PRO of NCRTC.Officials of the authority said they could not offer land due to certain issues. “The main reason was that carving out one single chunk of land for the depot was not feasible, as land was available in fragments. The plan is now dropped,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner of GDA.The entire RRTS project, which is proposed to run high speed trains on elevated and underground sections, is set to cost about ₹30,274 crore. The project will connect Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut and will have 24 stations, including 21 in Uttar Pradesh.The NCRTC has also planned an RRTS station near the Duhai depot. “To ease commuting in the densely populated areas of NCR, we have planned that an alternate train will go up to Duhai depot (from Delhi) and return while another alternate train will go up to Meerut. Having a train return from Duhai itself (instead of going all the way to Meerut) will mean that people in densely populated areas will be able to get trains at a frequency of about five minutes, while the other trains to Meerut will be available at a frequency of about 10 minutes,” Sharma added.NCRTC officials said that once the priority section is done, they will open it up for passenger operations which will further help them assess any further requirements for the entire corridor. RRTS trains will run at a speed of 180kmph. In Meerut, NCRTC has also proposed to run metro trains along RRTS trains.Apart from the work going on at full speed for the priority stretch, civil construction works for the 33km Duhai-Shatabdipuram stretch in Meerut has also started.Earlier in August, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also approved a loan of $1 billion to support the RRTS project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rrts-project-for-its-duhai-depot-transport-corp-to-buy-land-directly-from-farmers/story-uNPLBAPAp80StrAGUZHenM.html

Officials have been directed to keep a check on the quality of work and no humps should be created at the repaired sites. I will also be inspecting the ongoing work frequently.”The residents have been raising hue and cry over deep potholes and poor road conditions at different parts of the city including Dugri, Pakhowal Road, Haibowal, Model Town, Model Town Extension, Brown Road and Ferozepur Road among others.On September 12, some social activists planted saplings in deep potholes near Phullanwal, as a symbolic protest against the civic body for its failure to repair the roads. The residents slammed the MC stating that accidents are taking place due to this, but the civic body has turned a blind eye towards the situation. The councillors have also raised the issue in front of the mayor.A shopkeeper at Dugri main Road, Sanjay Tiwari said, “Accidents take place almost everyday at the main Dugri Road due to deep potholes. Several complaints have submitted to the MC officials in the past, but nothing has been done till now. The situation becomes worse when the city receives rainfall and the dirt turns into mud. It takes a toll on business and adds to the woes of shopkeepers amid the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/repair-of-roads-begins-in-ludhiana/story-sywQkycTEep95yTImeE5EJ.html

After wrapping up work, he headed home on his motorcycle when seven men intercepted him on Chimni Road around 11.30pm.While two men threatened him with pistols, the others brandished sharp-edged weapons, threatening to kill him. Within moments, they snatched his bag containing Rs 1.5 lakh and sped off.Victim alleges poor response by policeMehta claimed while he instantly sounded the police, cops took an hour to reach the spot, while the accused had already made good their escape. He alleged the cops also questioned him for commuting late at night.Further, his work day on Wednesday was ruined as the police kept him waiting at the Shimlapuri police station till 3pm while a meeting of police officials was underway. Hence, he had to skip jobs at 11 locations in Ludhiana and Jalandhar.However, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja refuted the allegations, stating that the police promptly reached the crime scene.MAN TRYING TO EVADE ROBBERS SHOT AT Not long after Abhimanyu was robbed at gunpoint, four men on two motorcycles opened fire at a 40-year-old man after he tried to escape being robbed.Mukesh Kumar Mehta, however, had a close shave as the bullet hit the backlight of his scooter and he managed to shake off the robbers.Mukesh, who works at the dry port at Dhandhari and lives in Gurpal Nagar, said normally he returned home from work around 6pm, but on Tuesday night visited a friend’s house on Daba Road to watch the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings.After the match was over, he left for home around 11.30pm. On his way, he realised two motorcycles were following him on Daba Road, so he started speeding to lose them. But the four men soon caught up with him and threatened him to stop. When he did not submit, one of the men opened fire, hitting his scooter’s tail light.He managed to frantically drive back home while losing the robbers and soon after alerted the police.The Division Number 6 police reached the spot and recovered a bullet shell.ADCP (City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said separate FIRs had been registered in both cases at the Shimlapuri and Division Number 6 police stations. “As per preliminary investigation, both attacks seem to be the handiwork of the same gang,” he added.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said after several robberies around Miller Ganj and Gill Road, police had intensified patrolling in the area, and special teams had been formed to solve these cases.ROBBERS HAVING A FIELD DAYSeptember 23: Four masked men robbed a factory worker of Rs 8 lakh in cash after throwing chilli powder in his eyes near Partap ChowkSeptember 22: Four miscreants snatched Rs 4.43 lakh from a factory owner in Shimlapuri.

Earlier,a mid-day meal worker wanting to go on maternity leave had to avail casual leave or temporarily depute a substitute in the school to prepare meals.Welcoming the move, workers in the district said that this will motivate more women to work as cooks in government schools. There are over 3,622 MDM cooks preparing meals in 1,536 government schools of the district. The state education department has also issued a pro forma through which the MDM cooks can apply for maternity leave and it is compulsory to attach a medical certificate. In the pro forma, details such as for how many students the cook is catering to, how many other cooks are there in the school, for how many years the worker has been working needs to be mentioned. The pro forma has to be duly signed by the school head and district education officer.As per Maternity Benefit Act 1961, “No women shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has actually worked in an establishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity benefit for a period of not less than one hundred and sixty days in twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery.”MDM worker at a government school Parvinder Kaur said, “I am preparing meals for 500 students on a daily basis and working here for the last five years.Now, with the government allowing cooks to take maternity leave with all benefits, MDM workers can take care of their child at home with full pay.” The MDM cooks get a meagre salary of Rs 1,700 per month and now will also be paid during the 180 days maternity leave.

The protest was against the passing of new agriculture reform bills in the Parliament.The rally was led by Dakha legislator Manpreet Singh Ayali and traversed from Sidhwan Bet to Savadi and Mullanpur to reach Badowal. Farmers drove their tractors holding black flags and shouting slogans demanding the NDA government revoke the Bills immediately or be ready for an even more intense agitation.Addressing the farmers at Savadhi Anaj mandi, Manpreet Ayali said the SAD had been taking up the need for revocation of the agriculture ordinances immediately after they came into being following apprehensions expressed by farmers as well as party workers. He said it was unfortunate that the BJP did not take the farmers and SAD into confidence while framing the agriculture ordinances. He said the Centre also failed to allay the apprehensions of farmers and did not secure the MSP regime by making its continuation a part of the bills. “It is due to this that Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Parliament,” he said while adding that the move had been taken in the interest of the farming community.Ayali also took a dig at chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for betraying farmers. He said that the CM had earlier backstabbed farmers by making false vows in the name of the holy Gutka Sahib and Dasam Pitah. “Now, he is trying to deceive farmers yet again by becoming a part of the high-powered committee constituted to frame the farm bills. Farmers have seen through this sham and now only trust the SAD to secure justice for them,” he added.The Dakha legislator also announced on the occasion that he was first and foremost a farmer. “I have been protesting against the farm bills ever since they came into being. I will not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the cause of farmers if need be. I will always stand with farmers and their cause,” he said.The SAD leader appealed to party workers to participate wholeheartedly in the ‘chakka jam’ on Thursday to force the Centre to revoke the ‘anti-farmer’ agriculture bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-workers-hold-tractor-rally-in-dakha-to-protest-farm-bills/story-1tGx6YgctgbEi1OON6zfDM.html
23-09-2020||City||Ludhiana: Traders want shops to open on Sundays in festive season, warn of protests||Already reeling under losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown imposed since March, traders under the umbrella of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal on Wednesday gave an ultimatum to the state government to lift the lockdown on Sundays for the upcoming festival season, or face protests. Traders said that they would raise an agitation if the government failed to take a final decision on the matter by October 3. They said that if the government can allow farmers to gather in thousands and protest on the streets, then why traders be allowed to open shops on Sundays.A meeting of the Beopar Mandal was held on Tuesday wherein they slammed the state government for not listening to their demands. State general secretary of Beopar Mandal Sunil Mehra said, “The retail trade business in the country has suffered a loss of ₹23 lakh crores due to the pandemic and the Sunday lockdown would further hit businesses. Traders are struggling to make ends meet due to low footfall in the markets. Many of them were forced to shut down business as they were unable to meet fixed expenses. Traders are pinning hopes on the festival season and many people from other districts and states visit the city markets on Sundays. If the government failed to lift the Sunday lockdown, then traders will take to the streets to protest against the government.”Traders have also slammed the state government for not providing relief in terms of electricity bills, bank loan installments, etc. Many people have lost their jobs as employers were not being able to cope up with the losses.State secretary Mohinder Aggarwal and district president Arvinder Makkar said, “We will wait for the government to take a decision by October 3 and it fails to provide any solution, a meeting of the Beopar Mandal will be held and agitation would be launched across the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-traders-want-shops-to-open-on-sundays-in-festive-season-warn-of-protests/story-FDprQcXeCsnBUHHteq5DIM.html
23-09-2020||City||Farm bills row: Cops use water cannons on protesters in Panipat, Ambala||The Haryana police on Wednesday used water cannons in Panipat and Ambala on agitators to stop them from proceeding to Delhi to protest against the Centre’s farm bills. In Panipat, the police used water cannons at a Haryana Youth Congress-led tractor rally while in Ambala, it used them on Punjab Lok Insaf Party-led motorcycle rally, trying to enter the state on their way to Delhi. While the Haryana Youth Congress activists dispersed after facing water cannons in Panipat, Punjab’s Lok Insaf Party workers sat on the road on the inter-state border near Shambhu village in Ambala. In Panipat, the protest was led by Youth Congress state president Sachin Kundu and Congress’ Samalkha MLA Dharm Singh Chhokar. The Congress workers had gathered at the Panipat grain market and decided to take out the protest march on tractors towards Delhi. However, police put up barricades to stop them on NH 44 near Samalkha. Police personnel used mild force and water cannons to stop the protesters from crossing over the barricades. The traffic was also disrupted on the Delhi-Chandigarh national highway and had to be diverted to the link roads. Panipat deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Satish Vats said the protesters tried to break through the barricades and police had to use water cannons to disperse them. He said no FIRs have been registered so far and the detained protesters have been released.While addressing the gathering, Kundu accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government at the Centre of imposing the anti-farmers laws. He said the new laws will affect the old mandi-system and end the MSP regime. He also slammed the Haryana government for using police force to suppress the voice of farmers and opposition parties. In Ambala, district magistrate Ashok Kumar Sharma had imposed Section 144 in order to maintain law and order in the morning. However, LIP workers, including founding member Simarjeet Singh Bains, tried to enter Haryana through the river basin of the Ghagger under the overbridge. “We want to raise our voice against the anti-farmer bills,” Simarjeet Singh Bains told reporters at the Shambhu border. Police had to use water cannons as the workers tried to cross the barricades put up at the inter-state border on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway. Despite facing water cannons, the LIP workers sat on the road after being denied permission for movement of a large group of protesters due to the restrictions in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Ambala Range inspector general of police Y Puran Kumar said, “Police used water cannon to disperse the crowd as the workers tried to break the barricades. Later, when some of them tried to enter through the river basin, they were stopped and asked to go back. After some discussions, they retreated and the protests ended at around 6:10 pm.”He said, “Other than following Covid-19 protocols, we could not allow them to enter Haryana because they didn’t have any permission to take out a procession of nearly 400 two-wheelers and 100 four-wheelers. Such a huge procession would have created heavy traffic jams on the highway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-bills-row-cops-use-water-cannons-on-protesters-in-panipat-ambala/story-7e2usqHo8HFNFljPdHqosL.html

23-09-2020||Pune||MSEDCL faces solar tender copy charge||The Maharashtra Solar Manufacturers’ Association (Masma) has alleged that the Maharashtra state electricity distribution company Limited (MSEDCL) published a tender on August 28 that was a direct copy of a tender published by the Gujarat state electricity distribution company. MSEDCL chief PRO Anil Kamble said, “I will contact the necessary department for details and revert.” Masma alleges that the tender was published “17 months late” and, “was a clear copy-paste job from the Gujarat electricity company’s website”. Masma claims MSEDCL was made aware of the “error” by email on September 9. According to Masma, MSEDCL republished the tender, with corrections, on September 17. Pradeep Kulkarni, president of Masma, said that there were several technical conditions in the tender which were incorrect, as per directions issued by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). “MSEDCL must conduct a pre-bid meet again and it may seek the help of the Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (Meda), or MNRE officials, to help clarify doubts raised by us. Instead of keeping it on a first-come-first-serve basis, MSEDCL has complicated the bidding process. Moreover, bidders will be forced to work across Maharashtra and have service centres in all zones for five years,” Kulkarni claimed. The association, in its petition to the state government, stated: “Despite all the ministers’ instructions, the MSEDCL again delayed the process for more than three months and finally on August 28 came up with an Express of Interest (EOI) to initiate the empanelment process for subsidy disbursement. When the said tender was published half-heartedly after 17 months, it was such a clear-cut copy-paste job from the neighbouring state of Gujarat, that MSEDCL even forgot to replace the GST number with its own.” The petition added: “The copy-paste conditions mentioned in the original tender were for an MW- level tender and beyond MNRE guidelines. The MSEDCL hastily corrected a few of these mistakes and published changes on the very last date of the tender sale, that is, on September 17. They gave an extension of just eight days without clarifying all the ambiguities pertaining to the EOI (expression of interest) terms asked in the pre-bid meet, which is simply in violation of norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/msedcl-faces-solar-tender-copy-charge/story-xxWkAB0oS4QLDoJSx5xhdO.html

23-09-2020||City||Farm agitation fertile ground for creative slogans||Sangrur To express political and ideological differences with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on farm bills that Parliament passed, despite protests from farmers and strong resistance from a number of MPs, opposition parties and farmer outfits in Punjab have coined slogans. ‘Corporate Bhajao, Kisan Bachao’, ‘Stop Killing Farmers’ and ‘Pind Pind Chon Aai Awaz, Kisan Ghol Zindabad (A voice is resonating every village, long live farmers’ agitation)’ are some of the slogans that farm unions are using to highlight their struggle. They are trying to show the power of the masses by romanticising resistance. “The previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government started anti-farmer policies and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) followed on its path. Multinational companies see India as a big market and are trying to capture it. We will not allow the government to hand over our land to the corporate sector,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Ekta-Dakaunda). The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are terming Prime Minister Narendra Modi as anti-farmer. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which once backed the NDA government on the issue, but opposed the ordinances in both Houses of Parliament, is inviting people to join the ‘Chakka Jam’ on September 25. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal has coined the slogan, ‘Ikko Naara Kisan Pyara’ assuring farmers that his party stands by them. “Farmers are SAD’s priority, along with other sections. Our slogan shows the party’s commitment to the farming community. Such slogans emerge from agitations and we will stand by farmers,” said SAD senior vice-president, Daljit Singh Cheema. AAP has been targeting the BJP, SAD, and Congress with its slogan ‘Badal-Captain-Modi, Tino Kisan Virodhi’. It is also calling upon the public to burn the effigy of Modi on September 24. “Modi introduced three ordinances and SAD extended its support. The Punjab government was aware about these anti-farmer bills, but did not oppose the ordinances at the high-powered committee on agriculture. If the SAD and the Congress had opposed the move three months ago, these ordinances could not have taken the shape of bills,” said Aman Arora, AAP Sunam MLA. The ruling Congress party in Punjab has been attacking the Centre, while targeting the PM with the slogan ‘Kisan Virodhi Narendra Modi’. “Rising above party lines, all Punjabis should oppose these bills. The Punjab CM has already decided to move court, but we will also hold demonstrations,” said Dalvir Singh Goldy, Congress Dhuri MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-agitation-fertile-ground-for-creative-slogans/story-woYzAh22OGD1YPe8QvrfgP.html

23-09-2020||Pune||Four volunteers awaiting vaccination at Sassoon in Pune test positive for Covid antibodies||Four of the seven people who had volunteered to be part of phase 3 of the Covishield vaccine tested positive for antibodies on Tuesday, thus, rendering them ineligible for the vaccination trials. Presence of antibodies indicate that the person may have been exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Covid-19 infection at some point of time. The antibody reports for the remaining three volunteers remained inconclusive. Phase three trials of Serum Institute’s Covisheild vaccine, which is a leading vaccine candidate against Covid-19 infection, will begin at Sassoon General Hospital next week. The hospital had invited volunteers to participate in the trials and seven had volunteered on Monday and submitted their samples for RT-PCR tests and antibody tests. The volunteers said that they were not aware that they had been infected which implies a high prevalence of the infection in the area.Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean of the hospital, said, “We had taken samples of seven volunteers on Monday for RT-PCR to check for current infection and antibodies test to check for any previous infection. Four volunteers tested positive in the antibodies test and the reports of others were inconclusive, so none of them could be vaccinated. We have collected samples from seven more volunteers again on Tuesday. Based on the results of both the tests, the vaccination trial will be decided.” Earlier when the first such trial took place at Bharati hospital and Research Centre on August 26, of the five volunteers who were ready to participate in the trials, three tested positive for antibodies. None of these volunteers knew that they were infected at some point in time. However, the first sero survey conducted across the city has hinted at a higher prevalence in the city (above 51%) with regards to antibodies found in random samples.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of the state technical committee on communicable diseases, said, “It is beyond doubt that there is more than 50 per cent sero prevalence in the city. This is the reason why we are now reporting fewer cases from areas like Bhawani peth and Dhole Patil road which were the hotspots earlier which is indicative of herd immunity. Like there is no fodder for fire, the virus has infected the majority in these areas and so there are no more cases coming up. However, we do not know for sure that when we can call it a herd immunity for sure with respect to this virus- be it 60%, 70% or 80%- only time will tell.” The phase 3 human clinical trial of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is undergoing at multiple places across the country. The hospital is currently registering volunteers for the trials. Those willing to volunteer for the vaccination can contact 8104201267. The volunteers will be tested for antibodies and Covid-19 infection wherein they have to test negative in both the tests. The volunteers should be aged above 18 years of age and if suffering from comorbidity, the condition must be under control.The volunteers will be insured as per the guidelines issued under ICMR. Earlier, the trials for the same vaccine were halted by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) after an ‘unexplained illness’ in one of the candidates in another country. The trials were restarted after clearance for the DCGI from September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-vaccine-trials-four-volunteers-awaiting-vaccination-at-sassoon-in-pune-test-positive-for-antibodies/story-HYxcxON20qqkNk82tA0npN.html
23-09-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand assembly session: Congress, AAP protest over ‘anti-farmer policies’||The one-day session of the Uttarakhand assembly in Dehradun on Wednesday saw a stormy start with protest by the Opposition Congress lawmakers against the recently passed farm bills in Parliament. The Congress members of the Uttarakhand legislative assembly (MLAs), including the state party president Pritam Singh, Qazi Nizamuddin, Manoj Rawat and Aadesh Singh Chauhan along with the Dehradun city unit chief Lal Chand Sharma, headed towards the assembly in a tractor in a symbolic protest against the farm bills that were passed by Parliament earlier this week. However, the protesting lawmakers were prevented by the police personnel from entering the assembly premises. Initially, though the opposition MLAs argued with the police, later they sat on a dharna in front of a barricade. MLA Nizamuddin attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre. “The government is anti-farmer, which has been proved in the farm bills passed in Parliament. The government is not only against farmers but everything related to them such as tractors due to which we have been barred from entering the assembly premises,” he alleged. “All gates would have opened had we come to the assembly in an expensive car instead of a tractor,” he further alleged.The protesting Congress legislators ended their stir after the police allowed them to proceed towards the assembly in the tractor.The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Uttarakhand unit also tried to gather at the assembly against the “anti-farmer policies of the Central government and the growing unemployment issue in the hill state”. AAP members tried to reach the assembly on foot from various parts of Dehradun such as Fawwara Chowk, Shastri Nagar and Defence Colony.The police barred them from proceeding towards the assembly following which they sat on a sit-in protest.“The recently passed farm bills will gravely impact the livelihood of farmers in the state and the country. These laws will end the concept of minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce,” alleged SS Kaler, state president of the AAP. “Besides, Uttarakhand is facing a major unemployment crisis, as the state government has failed to provide jobs to the youth. Chief Minister CM Trivendra Singh Rawat’s priorities are all mixed up. Instead of providing jobs to the state’s youth, he is busy focusing on hemp cultivation to push them in the drug trade,” he further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-assembly-session-congress-aap-protest-over-anti-farmer-policies/story-0i8XcLq732RdMat197SmlL.html

Mumbai is already struggling with severe waterlogging and traffic following heavy rains overnight. Normal life was severely affected on Wednesday in the financial capital as public transport took a major hit with waist deep water in parts of Mumbai and neighbouring areas.The intense spills on Tuesday night disrupted Mumbai’s rail services. Several local train junctions reported waterlogging issue. On Wednesday morning, the Wester Railways cancelled local trains services between Churchgate and Andheri.

23-09-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Since April, 150,000 Maharashtra residents got online liquor permits||Maharashtra residents have obtained 150,955 online liquor permits since April 1 – shortly after the nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak – according to the state excise department. About 3,000 people got their alcoholic beverages delivered at home on a daily basis during this period. On Monday, 3,709 consumers received home delivery of their alcohol beverages, said state excise officials. Also read: Most people infected with novel coronavirus develop symptomsLiquor permits are required for home delivery of alcoholic beverages, which have been allowed by the Maharashtra government to avoid overcrowding at liquor stores amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The excise department has simplified the process of obtaining a liquor permit online in a bid to increase its revenue that had plunged drastically owing to the lockdown restrictions.The Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 mandates that anyone, who is above 25 years of age, wants to consume alcohol needs to possess a liquor permit. These permits are issued on health grounds as preservation and maintenance of health. However, the prohibition was abolished in the state in 1972 and a permit system was introduced to allow an individual to consume a stipulated amount of alcohol, which should not exceed more than 12 units.Kantilal Umap, excise commissioner, Maharashtra, said the public has realised the advantages of obtaining a liquor permit. “A permit allows an individual not only to drink alcohol but also stock and transport liquor, ” said Umap. “We urged the public to obtain liquor licences following the easing of lockdown restrictions and also simplified the process for getting hold of a permit. We have been flooded with applications since the simplification of the process,” he added. The excise department received 156,085 applications, of which 150,955 were granted liquor permits between April 1 and September 21. The fee for a permit, which is valid for a year, is 100. A lifetime validity costs ₹1,000.Arvind Miskin, president, Association of Progressive Retail Liquor Vendors, a body of wine shop owners, echoed Umap. “A liquor permit allows an individual to stock up to 12 bottles of alcohol. People find it cheaper and convenient to obtain a permit,” said Miskin.The Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949 stipulates that possession, consumption, or transportation of alcohol in the state without a permit is liable to a penalty up to ₹50,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to five years.There has been a growing demand in the state to scrap the liquor permit rule to consume alcohol. Hoteliers and patrons have dubbed the rule as a means of harassment by excise officials.Liquor has been one of the major sources of revenue for the state government. Maharashtra garnered ₹15,434 crore during the last financial year as excise duty from the sale of liquor alone. The windfall gains prompted the state government to allow reopening of liquor stores from May 4 and also home delivery of alcoholic beverages, despite the contagion showing little signs of abating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-150-000-mumbai-residents-got-online-liquor-permits-in-six-months/story-qZUqD7QwUl0mxlSXreQlyM.html
23-09-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan: SHO, 2 constables suspended for extorting Rs 25 lakh from accused in drugs case||Dr Bhupendra Singh, director-general of police (DGP), Rajasthan, has suspended station house officer (SHO) and two constables of Harnawadashahji police station in Baran district on charges of extorting Rs 25 lakh from an accused, who was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and later releasing him.Earlier this year, Prabhulal Tanwar was booked under the NDPS Act, 1985, and he belongs to Mahuakhoh village in Kota district.Tanwar had complained to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and other state government officials against the alleged extortionist personnel of Harnawadashahji police station. Dr Ravi, superintendent of police (SP), Baran, said: “Prabhulal has alleged that he along with another fellow villager Bapulal was going to Kamkhera Balaji temple in Baran on May 7 when SHO of Harnawadashahji police station Ramswaroop Meena along with two constables stopped them.”SHO Meena allegedly made a call to Prabhulal’s son Govid and asked him to arrange Rs 25 lakh for his father’s release. “Govind arranged the sum with great difficulty and handed over the amount to SHO Meena, who later released Prabhulal. However, Bapulal was not released, as he is still languishing in Chhabra sub-jail,” the SP said.“A preliminary investigation has found all three policemen guilty following which DGP Rajasthan has suspended them until further orders,” the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-sho-2-constables-suspended-for-extorting-rs-25-lakh-from-accused-in-drugs-case/story-gQ2mQ77sWF2YFtr3u9xsdN.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu bats for farmers, says Punjab united against ‘black laws’||Emerging from a year-long political hiatus, Punjab Congress legislator Navjot Singh Sidhu hit the ground running as he led scores of farmers on a protest march against the three farm bills in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon. Terming the three bills “black laws”, Sidhu said, “The Centre is talking about providing free market to farmers. But they should know the battered condition of farmers of states where there is no grain market. You have made farmers labourers.” Dressed for the occasion in his trademark pathani suit with a black turban, Sidhu addressed the estimated 200 farmers from atop a tractor and said, “The Centre wants to forget the toil of five lakh labourers in building the infrastructure of grain markets. It has united Punjab by bringing in the black laws. The dues of employees have been increased 1,000 times, but the minimum support price (MSP) of farmers has gone up only 15 times.” During the 20-minute march from Deen Dayal Upadhyay market at Bhandari bridge to Hall Gate Chowk, Sidhu’s popularity was on display as he sat on a red tractor attached to a trailer packed with 50 supporters, most of them farmers, who raised slogans against the BJP-led central government and waved black flags and placards. Though the march began at 12.10pm, his supporters from his Amritsar East constituency, started gathering since 11am. TAKES DIG AT CONGRESS GOVT IN PUNJAB “My politics is a politics of solution. I will always talk about the solution. Though you (people) can see sand mining, cable mafia, liquor vend contracts and now the farm bills, I focus on solutions and hope the people will empower me to solve problems,” he said. This remark is being seen as against his own Congress government led by Capt Amarinder Singh in the state. Sidhu has raised the issues of illegal sand mining besides the cable and liquor mafia against his own government earlier. IS ROTI NOT AN ESSENTIAL COMMODITY? Striking a chord with the farmers, he said the Centre had excluded foodgrain from the list of essential commodities. “Is roti (meal) not an essential commodity? Hoarders have been legalised and they will sell farmers’ produce at higher rates. The prices of food will increase. The people of Punjab should stand together in this fight. They should not let the draconian laws to be implemented,” he said. Speaking against the electricity amendment bill, he said it will bar farmers from getting subsidies. “I will continue supporting farmers till I’m alive,” he added. When asked, he declined comment on the resignation of Shiromani Akali Dal Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navjot-singh-sidhu-bats-for-farmers-says-punjab-united-against-black-laws/story-5TjVDkj6IKtC37IjhMtcSO.html
23-09-2020||City||Maharashtra: Yavatmal tigress T2C1 captured, transferred to rescue centre||The Maharashtra forest department on Wednesday tranquillised and captured a two-year-old sub-adult tigress (T2C1) near the Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal days after the big cat killed a 60-year-old woman at a farm on Saturday. The tigress earlier attacked a farmer on September 4 and has killed at least six cattle and goats, triggering panic in the area.Forest officials said the tigress was regularly being spotted through camera trap images moving across four villages and the Pandharkawada Forest Reserve.“Around 10.30 am Wednesday, the tigress was darted at an agricultural field less than two km away from TWS [Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary]. She was tranquillised... and the operation was carried out smoothly as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority protocol,” said chief conservator of forests (Yavatmal) S V Ramarao.Two veterinary doctors, eight Special Tiger Protection Force officers, two rapid rescue teams, and 40 forest personnel were part of the team that captured the tigress.Ramarao said they deputed the large team to ensure the tigress was captured with any untoward incident. “Citizens had been advised not to leave their homes nor allow their cattle to stray [during the operation].”Maharashtra’s principal chief conservator of forests, Nitin Kakodkar, on Monday issued orders for the capture under the Wildlife Protection Act, which provides for declaring a protected wild animal a threat or danger to human life.“We are yet to decide whether she would be transferred to Gorewada Rescue Centre or another transit treatment centre in Nagpur. ...we will be consulting the state-appointed committee [that decides on the rehabilitation of big cats captured from the wild due to conflict]... for the future course of action,” said Kakodkar.T2C1 was captured in the same district, where two private hunters hired by the forest department killed tigress Avni in 2018 under questionable circumstances after she was said to have killed 13 people.State Board for Wildlife member Kishor Rithe said conflict incidents are common in the Chandrapur-Brahmapuri landscape, but similar cases have started in the Yavatmal-Tipeshwar landscape since Avni’s case. “It is a problem of managing the area. Our committee will review all previous conflict incidents pertaining to this tigress. If the animal is fit to be released, she will be, and the set procedure will be followed.”T2C1 is the fifth big cat to be captured in Maharashtra this year after human-animal conflict.Wildlife Protection Society of India director (central India) Nitin Desai said since T2C1 had become a problem animal and lost all fear of human beings, she needed to be captured. “For the larger cause of tiger conservation, these animals need to be removed and it is part of the tiger conservation strategy.”Operations are separately underway to capture another tiger (RT1) at Rajura since February when it killed six villagers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yavatmal-tigress-t2c1-captured-and-transferred-to-rescue-centre/story-ASDEQ03FzuUxWSqS5cZnlL.html
23-09-2020||Election:||NDA and Grand Alliance engaged in poster wars on Patna streets||A decade ago, a picture in an advertisement made Bihar chief minister cancel a dinner with the BJP top brass in a clear manifestation of his disapproval. It was a picture showing Nitish Kumar with the then Gujarat CM and present Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Cut to present, the two leaders are a version of best friends forever. At all the virtual functions to announce schemes and projects for the poll-bound state, PM Modi has been effusive in his praise for the Bihar CM. The roads are lined with posters of the two leaders who appear comfortable in each other’s company and a ready smile is seen playing on their lips. PM Modi’s statement that “Nitish jaisa sahyogi ho toh kuch bhi sambhav hai (Anything is possible with a partner like Nitish)” has found a pride of place at the Income Tax roundabout in the city with the pictures of the two leaders, a tagline “Nyay ke saath tarakki, Nitish ki baat pakki (Development with justice, Nitish’s words are a guarantee) underlines the point.” In another poster, PM Modi is seen describing Nitish Kumar as the ‘maker of modern Bihar’, with pictures of the two leaders on either side of it. There are also posters attacking the RJD, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav others for scams and lawlessness. From a bus named ‘loot express’ with pictures of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav and Misa Bharti, the caption says: ‘Ek parvar Bihar par bhar (One family that is burden on Bihar) to ‘Jungle raj’ and ‘Thagbandhan’, there is a lot visible on the streets. The counters to these happy posters have also emerged, showing PM Modi’s earlier quotes questioning the DNA of Nitish Kumar. Another one says: “Modiji, the mandate of the people was for your party to sit in Opposition. How could then it get into power? “Nitish jaisa sahyogi ho kuch bhi sambhav hai (Anythingis possible with a partner like Nitish),” it says. Who is getting the posters prepared is neither known nor openly accepted, but the messaging clearly manifests the National Democratic Alliance vs Grand Alliance divide. Some also attribute it to internal divide. Ahead of BJP’s ‘virtual rally’ addressed by home minister Amit Shah, Patna had witnessed a poster war. Picture of Lalu Prasad flanked by Md Shahabuddin and Raj Ballabh Yadav – all serving jail sentences – with a slogan ‘Kaidi bajaa raha taali, Janata bajao taali’. It was a reply to RJD’s call to oppose BJP’s virtual rally by beating utensils, though JD(U) feigned ignorance about it. Last year in December, when Kumar set out for his third leg of ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ yatra to Kaimur, Gaya and Aurangabad, Patna district administration was busy removing posters attacking him for his stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Who got those posters placed at important locations could not be ascertained, as the opposition parties like the RJD and the Congress denied any knowledge about it. Political analyst NK Choudhary said that the fight could only get more venomous through banners and posters in the days to come, as this election would not provide opportunities for rallies and public meetings due to Covid-19 pandemic. “Digital campaigning sounds good, but everyone knows about actual digital penetration and people’s choice to spend time on it when they are struggling with their daily needs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/poster-wars-on-patna-streets-between-nda-and-grand-alliance-in-bihar/story-DK8hjP0TjwfLJd2cIjD4DK.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Bar Council of Delhi asks Prashant Bhushan to appear before it over SC conviction in contempt case||The Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) has asked activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan to appear before it on October 23 following his conviction by the Supreme Court, which imposed a token fine of Re 1 on him, in a contempt case.  The BCD move has come in pursuance of the resolution of September 6 of the apex bar body, the Bar Council of India (BCI), asking its Delhi chapter to take a legally-mandated decision in this matter keeping in mind the conviction of Bhushan.  BCD has sought Bhushan’s response on as to why proceedings should not be initiated to revoke his enrolment as a lawyer in view of the conviction for his alleged contemptuous tweets against judiciary.  Bhushan, who has to appear either personally or through video conferencing on October 23, has to respond to the Council within 15-days of receiving the notice.A Bar Council of a state grants licence to a person to practice as a lawyer and has wide powers such as suspending or taking away the right of its members in certain situations to practice under the Advocates Act.“You are required to appear in person or through authorized advocate on your behalf on October 23 at 4.00 P.M. in the office of the Council... for personal hearing. You may appear physically or through virtual conferencing as suited to you,” the BCD said in the notice.It further said, “you are also required to send your response to the Council within 15 days of the receipt of this letter as to why proceedings under section 24A (Disqualification for enrolment) and section 35 of the Advocates Act be not initiated against you in view of your tweets in question and conviction under Suo motu Contempt Petition by the Supreme Court of India.” The BCD took the decision in a resolution passed on September 18.Bhushan acknowledged receiving the notice on Twitter this morning.It said that in case he does not choose to appear before the Council on the date fixed, the proceedings shall be taken “ex-parte”.  A bench headed by Justice Aruna Mishra (since retired) had convicted him for his two tweets against the judiciary and imposed a fine of Re 1 on him.As a punishment he was directed to deposit the fine with the Supreme Court registry by September 15, failing which he would have to undergo three-month jail term and debarment from law practice for three years.Bhushan on September 14 paid the fine imposed upon him, even though he said he would file a review petition before the apex court against the verdict.The apex bar body had said it deliberated upon the the apex court judgment in its general council meeting held on September 3 and held that the tweets and statements made by Bhushan and the SC judgment need thorough study and examination “in the light of the statutory duties, powers and functions conferred on it under the Advocates’ Act and the rules framed thereunder”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bar-council-of-delhi-asks-prashant-bhushan-to-appear-before-it-over-sc-conviction-in-contempt-case/story-LcVid0LIXouEHeA8vp7gPL.html
23-09-2020||Patna||‘Undecided on joining politics,’ says Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey after voluntary retirement||Former Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey, whose voluntary retirement was approved a day earlier, on Wednesday said people were pressing him to join politics but he is yet to make up his mind over it.Pandey has been in the news over his intemperate statements and aggressive stand on actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case and they have been linked to his political ambitions.“...if I do so [join politics], I will make it known to all,” said Pandey amid speculation that he could join one of the Bihar’s ruling parties ahead of the state assembly polls due later this year.Pandey, who is likely to contest the Shahpur assembly or Valmiki Nagar parliamentary seat that fell vacant after ruling Janata Dal (United) lawmaker Baidynath Mahto’s death in February, denied having taken the aggressive stand for electoral politics after retirement. He maintained he pursued the case vigorously to ensure that justice for Rajput’s family. “I could see how Rajput’s father was disappointed and helpless. The state police filed an FIR [First Information Report] and it was validated by the Supreme Court. We have taken all steps in the case as per legal norms. The case is now with the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation],” he saidThe Supreme Court in August ruled the CBI’s probe based on the FIR filed against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting Rajput’s suicide is lawful and allowed the federal agency to continue its investigation. It rejected Chakraborty’s plea to transfer the case to the Maharashtra police. The Bihar police in late June constituted a team to probe the case following a complaint by the actor’s family and triggered a jurisdictional turf war. The Bihar government has been accused of trying to hijack the emotive issue for political capital ahead of the assembly elections.Pandey rejected the links drawn between his aggressive statements, including against Chakraborty, and his post-retirement plans. “Please see the meaning of aukaat (stature),” he said referring to the statement he made questioning Chakraborty’s “aukaat”. The post of CM [chief minister] of any state is a constitutional post. Any person who is accused in a criminal case should not speak against the person holding a constitutional post. Rhea Chakraborty is an accused in the Rajput death case. Besides, I also made some statements related to the Rajput case when our officers were humiliated in Mumbai,” he said.Pandey on August 2 alleged that a police officer sent to Mumbai in connection with the case was “forcibly quarantined” and that his hand was stamped indicating the isolation period till August 15.Pandey insisted he is now an ordinary man meeting people from his and other districts, where he served over his 34-year-long career. “ I am meeting people from Buxar, Begusarai, Bettiah, and Jehanabad.” He dodged queries whether he would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or its ally Janata Dal (United). “I have not joined any party. I have also not said I will contest polls.”Pandey praised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar saying the Janata Dal (United) leader has a clear vision of not allowing any political interference in policing matters. Pandey said he always tried to ensure justice for the poor and depressed classes while cracking hard on criminals. “ [I] was sent to Jehanabad and other districts in Magadh when there were clashes on caste lines during the 90s and the entire central Bihar was burning. During my stint as SP [superintendent of police] in Jehanabad, there were no big clashes. I also brought innovative methods in policing during my stint in Begusarari. It was done out of my commitment to serve people and society.”Pandey’s batchmate and director-general rank officer Sunil Kumar joined the Janata Dal (United) after retiring on July 31 and is likely to contest assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/undecided-on-joining-politics-says-bihar-dgp-gupteshwar-pandey-after-voluntary-retirement/story-GzAf26CgJyYqho4xWnaOBL.html

23-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi government’s plan of action to curb pollution in winter: All you need to know||Every year, Delhi’s pollution levels soar in winter due to a combination of factors, including changes in meteorology such as cold weather, calm winds, local emissions, coupled with stubble-burning in neighbouring states. This year too, the Delhi government is working to curb pollution from spiking in the next few months by putting together a plan of action. Here are some of the points on the government’s agendaAsk neighbouring states to intervene early and curb stubble-burning Some districts of Punjab and Haryana have already started burning crop residue. The central government as well as Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority EPCA have asked the two states to ensure that subsidies to purchase equipment reach farmers in time so that they don’t need to burn the paddy stubble, especially during the harvest season mid-October, leading to a spike in pollution levels. Also Read: As paddy harvesting starts, Punjab farmer unions adamant on burning straw if not paid for disposalClear pollution hot spots within Delhi There are 13 major hot spots in the city, besides several industrial areas, where pollution levels spike more than average during winter, mainly because of waste burning, road dust and traffic congestion. The burning needs to be stopped and roads paved to prevent pollution from increasing here.

23-09-2020||Bhopal||With Madhya Pradesh bypolls drawing nearer, personal attacks on rise in campaigns||Personal attacks by politicians against each other have intensified as the by-election for 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh (MP), which are likely to be held with the upcoming Bihar polls in end-November, draws closer. Though the Election Commission of India (ECI) had earlier announced that polls would be held in end-November, no dates have been announced yet.Several ministers of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and belonging to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet are involved in personal attacks. But the ministers claim that themselves and the CM have been at the receiving end of the personal attacks by rival Congress leaders. Suresh Raje, who is slated to contest the upcoming assembly by-polls from Dabra constituency on a Congress ticket in MP’s Gwalior-Chambal region against state minister for Woman and Child Development (WCD) Imrati Devi, has been accused of making provocative personal comments against his opponent and her family members a few days ago. Devi and the ruling BJP also fired a salve at Raje amid the Congress distancing itself from his alleged comments. Raje denied that he insulted the minister. Devi slammed the Congress and alleged that the comments exposed the opposition party’s mindset. In another incident, state minister for tourism, culture and adhyatm Usha Thakur regretted her statement that she had made against a tribal youth organisation in MP’s Malwa region on Saturday. Thakur reportedly described Jay Adivasi Yuva Shakti (JAYS) as an anti-national outfit while speaking at a programme in her assembly constituency Mhow. She questioned the organisation for working among tribals and urged the public to take a pledge not to allow the outfit’s alleged anti-national activities in the region.The minister’s statement drew condemnation from JAYS and the Congress, who demanded her resignation from the Chouhan cabinet. The BJP was quick to dissociate itself from Thakur’s remarks. The minister also put out a statement on Monday, where she regretted for her momentary lapse of reason.“I respect all such organisations that are working for the uplift of the tribals. I apologise for my statement, if it has hurt anyone. My statement stemmed from my pain and anguish that I had undergone due to certain elements making attempts to mislead tribals and convert them to other faiths while creating hurdles in the way of my public welfare work.” However, JAYS’ members were not assuaged by the minister’s apology and staged a protest at Mhow on Tuesday. Heeralal Alawa, a founder member of the organisation and a Congress lawmaker, said, “The minister’s statement ahead of the by-polls is not a coincidence. It is a part of the BJP’s pre-planned strategy for the upcoming by-polls. The party wants to provoke the tribals against the organisation and better its prospects on those by-poll seats, where the indigenous people of the state hold the sway.” Similarly, state minister for cooperatives Arvind Bhadauria, who belongs to the Gwalior-Chambal region and had played a key role in the defection of the Congress lawmakers to the BJP in March, is in his parent party’s crosshairs.Former CMs Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh and ex-minister Jitu Patwari have all piled up on him for his act of betrayal by switching sides that led to the collapse of the Congress government in MP.However, Bhadauria has not fallen for his former party leaders’ provocative jibes.Kamal Nath and CM Chouhan have also locked horns over the Congress’s claims that it had waived loans of over two million farmers when the party was in power. The slanging match is restricted to the alleged use of the word “nalayak” by Kamal Nath against the CM.“Shivraj ji says Congress didn’t waive farmers’ loans in 10 days. Shivraj ji, are you so incapable (nalayak) that you can’t see the loan waiver in the records? It’s for the first time that not only current loans but also those of the defaulters were waived off (by the then Congress government).” Kamal Nath, who heads the MP Pradesh Congress Committee (MPPCC), had reportedly said at an election rally in Gwalior on September 19. Chouhan reacted to Kamal Nath’s use of the adjective. “I have no objection, if Kamal Nath ji likes to indulge in mudslinging. It’s the public which decides who is capable and who is not. He himself should think about the capability quotient. Who takes care of the state with an unbiased outlook, respects the poor, formulates schemes for farmers’ welfare and ensures uplift of girl child,” the CM had hit back at his predecessor. Political analyst Dinesh Gupta sees a pattern and discernible trend in these personal attacks.“It’s unfortunate that whenever elections draw closer, we see a similar surcharged atmosphere. Instead, political parties and leaders should discuss the development issues and welfare of the public. There is seldom any debate on lack of roads, electricity, irrigation, poverty, farmers, unemployment etc. Serious issues are always glossed over and trivial matters take a centre stage in the run up to an election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-madhya-pradesh-bypolls-drawing-nearer-personal-attacks-on-rise-in-campaigns/story-8QlZmqqTA9BjSm9iiZ8CcJ.html

23-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Maharashtra Congress raises questions over probe by central agencies||Alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is highlighting cases relating to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s (SSR’s) death for the forthcoming Bihar elections, Maharashtra Congress on Wednesday also raised questions over the probe by central agencies.In a series of tweets, Maharashra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the voluntary retirement taken by Bihar’s director general of police Gupteshwar Pandey has ‘shed light on the conspiracy’. Sharing a news report of Pandey’s resignation and reported plans to fight Bihar elections, Sawant said the police officer was being ‘rewarded’.“It is a big conspiracy to defame Maharashtra and reduce its national importance. Bihar DGP, who was used in this episode, is being blatantly rewarded. BJP has no sympathy for SSR, but saw political opportunity to use his death for Bihar elections and now for the new film city,” Sawant tweeted.Big dirty conspiracy of BJP to defame Maharashtra to reduce its national importance! Bihar DGP who was used in this being blatantly rewarded.

All arrests are made in FIR 16/2020, which is about the drug dealing and not related to the SSR case. The NCB should clarify and educate us as to why it has abandoned SSR case and why did government tell the parliament that there was no actionable inputs found revealing nexus between film industry and drugs dealing,” Sawant said.He also alleged that it is an attempt to control and arm-twist the film industry. He said the investigation which started around the death case of SSR shifted to nepotism, murder conspiracy and then to drug dealing and Bollywood’s nexus with it.Also read: NIA may join actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probeSawant said that the investigation by all central agencies, including NCB, CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, have raised many questions which will be asked by the party over next few days. Reacting to Sawant’s attack, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “All the central agencies have been probing the cases on the basis of the facts and the proofs they have come across. We do not need to use these cases for elections in any state. We have already clarified that the Bihar elections will be fought on the development plank. There is no need to take Sawant and his allegations seriously as he is known for his baseless ranting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-maharashtra-congress-raises-questions-over-probe-by-central-agencies/story-KrFCfZxThEyHFykeFnxu2I.html
23-09-2020||Lucknow||Prayagraj’s Lakshagriha, said to be Mahabharat-era site, to get research center||Lakshagriha, a religious site located in Handia development block of Prayagraj district in Uttar Pradesh, believed to date back to the Mahabharata era, would soon have a dedicated center of study for researchers, said officials. Efforts have already begun to set up the Mahabharata research center at this site under the chief minister tourism promotion scheme and Ganga circuit development plan by the tourism department, they added. According to mythological belief, during the Mahabharata era, the Pandavas had foiled an attempt by the Kauravas to burn them alive at Lakshagriha. It is believed that Kauravas built an entire house made up of ‘lac’ (a resinous material) which catches fire easily, and burnt it down as part of their conspiracy to kill Pandavas, but they had escaped unhurt. Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati, a member of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra Trust, too supported this belief that the original Lakshgriha was in Prayagraj. Locals call this place by different names including Pandav Kutti, Meti kila (one which is made of mud), court (read fort) and Pandav Gufa (tunnel) etc. The site has also been excavated by teams of Archeological Survey of India (ASI), once in mid 1970’s and recently in 2004-05. The team in 2004 had excavated around half a dozen places in the entire stretch. There had been demands made by Lakshagrah Vikas Samiti, an organisation led by its convener Onkar Nath Tripathi, to develop the place and put it on the tourist circuit. “Following a proposal by Dharmakshetra Lakshagriha Tirtha Kshetra Tourist Places committee for the development of the place, we have proposed the setting up a Mahabharata research center here. The proposal has been made and sent to the state government for approval,” said Tripathi. He further said that it was believed that Pandavas came to Lakshagriha and now scholars would be able to research on subjects spanning from their entry, their residence and evacuation etc. Some new facts regarding the Mahabharata era’s Prayagraj can get revealed by studying this site of mythological importance, he claimed. Also Read: Mosque in Ayodhya may be square-shaped like Kaaba: Trust officialA proposal worth Rs 79.27 lakh has been prepared for the proposed Mahabharat research institute.

23-09-2020||Mumbai||Housewife’s role most challenging, least appreciated: Bombay HC||The role of a housewife in the family is most important and challenging, but least appreciated, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) observed last week reiterating that family members are entitled to compensation on account of death of a homemaker.Justice Anil Kilor said a housewife holds a family together, as a pillar of support for her husband, a guiding force for her children and a caretaker for senior citizens in a household.The judge added that a homemaker works round-the-clock, without a day off, but her work goes unacknowledged and is not considered as an occupation because it doesn’t fetch a monthly income.Also read: Bombay high court tells BMC to seal unauthorised Wadala temple, stops its demolitionThe court made the observation following an appeal filed by Rambhau Gavai, a resident of Amravati in Maharashtra, and his two sons. They moved HC to challenge a previous order of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Achalpur in Amravati district. The tribunal had issued an order on February 3, 2007, which had rejected the claim for compensation on account of the death of Gavai’s wife, Babybai, in a road accident.The accident had occurred in March 2005 when Babybai’s vehicle had rammed into a tree at a high speed. Babybai had succumbed to her severe injuries.The tribunal had dismissed the claim of her husband and the sons primarily on the ground that the deceased was a housewife and not an earning member of the family.However, the HC reversed the tribunal’s order, as it was contrary to settled legal principles. Justice Kilor said it is impossible to count the services rendered by a homemaker and her contributions to the family in monetary terms.The judge referred to a 2001 judgment of the Supreme Court (SC), which had clearly laid down, the loss to husband and children following the death of a housewife or mother has to be computed by estimating the loss of personal care and attention given by the deceased.The judge also cited the loss of gratuitous and the multifarious services rendered by a housewife for managing a family.HC fixed the income of Babybai at Rs 3,000 as a housewife and an additional Rs 3,000 for doubling up as a labourer, and held that her husband and sons were entitled to Rs 8.22 lakh towards compensation for her accidental death.HC held that since the driver of the vehicle was holding a valid driving licence at the time of the accident, the car’s insurer was not liable to pay any compensation. However, the court directed the insurance company to pay the compensation to the father and the two sons within three months and granted it liberty to recover the amount from the vehicle’s owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/housewife-s-role-most-challenging-least-appreciated-bombay-hc/story-WlZlcoyZh7JvOP6rrfy02I.html

The passage of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 during the ongoing 18-day uninterrupted monsoon session of Parliament has riled opposition parties, including the TMC-run government in Bengal.The BJP delegation, led by Jay Prakash Majumdar, state vice-president, will comprise other senior members of the opposition party, who will meet Governor Dhankar. Also Read: Trinamool Congress to launch series of protests against farms bills from todayThe TMC has since started staging protests in Kolkata from Tuesday against the contentious farm bills passed in the Rajya Sabha (RS) on Sunday and the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020 in the Lok Sabha (LS).

These measures are likely to provide more flexibility to employers for hiring and firing of workers without government’s permission.On Wednesday, the TMC’s youth wing is scheduled to hold a rally against these new laws.

However, Governor Dhankhar, a trenchant critic of the Banerjee-led dispensation, targeted the state government over the CM’s proposal.

23-09-2020||Lucknow||International flights from Kushinagar by Diwali: Yogi||Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Tuesday night that international flights from Kushinagar airport in the Gorakhpur administrative division would start by Diwali. He also announced that the centenary celebrations of the historic Chauri Chaura movement would be held with fanfare in the state next year. The CM made the announcement while speaking at a review meeting of the development programmes in the state’s Gorakhpur administrative division that comprises districts such as Gorakhpur, Deoria, Kushinagar and Maharajganj.He said international flights would increase foreign tourists’ inflow since the region is part of the Lord Buddha pilgrimage circuit. The CM directed the officials to make an integrated action plan to find a permanent solution to the flood menace in eastern UP. He asked them to engage in extensive dredging of rivers. He cited that the move would have dual benefits: relief from floods and an availability of sand that can fetch revenue for respective district administrations. He told the officials that his government has managed to control the annual menace of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) to a large extent. “Make a project for house-to-house water supply in every JE-affected village,’’ he told the officials. The CM ordered a bid to expedite work in the twin projects of an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and a fertiliser factory in Gorakhpur. The fertiliser factory is likely to become operational by July next year.The CM said the region would get an economic face-lift after the under-construction Gorakhpur Link Expressway project would get linked to the Purvanchal Expressway. He urged the officials to come up with a comprehensive plan for next year’s centenary celebrations of the historic Chauri Chaura incident. The Gorakhpur region, which had played a significant role in the country’s freedom movement, is replete with sites related to pilgrimage and the struggle for independence. The CM wanted to highlight the region’s historical contribution for the country’s younger generation.He also reminded the officials about an effective surveillance system and contact tracing in a bid to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He added that mass awareness would be the key to prevent the spread of the viral infection until a vaccine is launched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/international-flights-from-kushinagar-by-diwali-yogi/story-wuNCREYmeG0GHDbn85AUDJ.html

It will be discussed at the meeting.” Officials said the lack of Centre’s assistance has added to the state’s financial burden. “The Centre is yet to pay the compensation for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to the state.

23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Give week’s notice before arrest: High court tells Punjab on plea of ex-DGP Saini||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday directed the Punjab government to issue a notice of seven days to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini if the state contemplates to arrest him in a criminal case. The order was passed by the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi on a fresh application moved by Saini in a 2018 petition. “The earlier order has been modified to the extent that if he is to be arrested in any case registered for the time period of his service, he should be given seven days’ notice,” said senior advocate Vinod Ghai, who appeared for Saini. In his fresh plea, Saini demanded that the interim order passed in October 2018 be extended to his entire service record as the state’s agencies are “hell bent on implicating” him. If he appears before the police in the 1991 Balwant Singh Multani disappearance case, there is apprehension that he will be arrested in some other case, Ghai told the court. In October 2018, the high court had denied him blanket bail but asked Punjab to give one week’s notice to Saini, in case he is to be arrested in a criminal case pertaining to when he served in the vigilance department and other important positions in the state. The order was extended twice but after the Covid-19 outbreak, the plea could not be taken up. Wednesday’s order covers any FIR registered by the police against Saini for any ‘crime’ committed by him during his entire service period. In the October 2018 petition, Saini demanded that directions be given to the state to get the probe done by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the event of any FIR against him since he fears false implication due to “mala fide and ulterior motives” on the part of the political party in power in Punjab. He also demanded that he should not be arrested in any criminal case. During his stint as head of the state vigilance, a number of criminal cases were registered against present chief minister Amarinder Singh, his family members and other political leaders for corruption. He had given example of FIRs in the Ludhiana City Centre scam, Amritsar Improvement Trust scam and one against Bharat Inder Singh Chahal, media adviser of the chief minister, and Amarinder’s son Raninder Singh. He told the court that now he is seen as the man who launched criminal prosecution against the present chief minister and his coterie and the state’s agencies have become “persecuting agencies” instead of “prosecuting agencies” for his false implication. He had also expressed fear of implication in the 2015 sacrilege cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/give-week-s-notice-before-arrest-high-court-tells-punjab-on-plea-of-ex-dgp-saini/story-3SPPBCAChzTq0lSpzzJSEI.html
23-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea Chakraborty’s custody extended, files bail plea in HC||Actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik, both arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), on Tuesday filed an application in the Bombay high court seeking bail. Their lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, said the plea will be heard on Wednesday before a bench of justice Sarang Kotwal.Rhea, 28, was arrested by the federal agency, which is probing the drugs angle in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, on September 9. Her bail plea was rejected at that time by a special court and she was remanded to 14-day judicial custody. The special court on Tuesday extended her judicial custody till October 6.According to NCB, Rhea and Showik financed and arranged drugs for Rajput at his instructions. NCB has so far arrested over 10 people in the case. Rhea says she is innocent, falsely implicated in the case, and was coerced into making “self-incriminatory” confessions by the NCB. The agency, meanwhile, summoned Bollywood talent management KWAN Agency’s CEO, Dhruv Chitgopekar, in connection with its probe, NCB deputy director KPS Malhotra said. Chitgopekar reached the Bombay Port Trust (BPT) guest house, where NCB officials are questioning people, around 2pm.Malhotra denied that any summons was sent to KWAN employee and Deepika Padukone’s manager, Karishma Prakash. “No summons has been issued to Prakash. But we will summon her later this week,” Malhotra said. NCB director general Rakesh Asthana said the agency did not send any summons to Padukone.On Tuesday, actor Dia Mirza also dismissed reports that she was involved in consumption and procurement of drugs, a claim she said was made with “mala fide intentions”. Rajput was found hanging in his residence in Bandra on June 14.

23-09-2020||Delhi||Jamia stir was a ‘beta test’: Charge sheet||The key conspirators behind the communal riots in north-east Delhi, in which 53 people were killed and over 400 suffered injuries, learnt lessons from the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests near Jamia Millia Islamia, and used these learnings to organise and fan violence in the area this February, according to Delhi Police.The charge sheet, filed by the police’s special cell last week, has named 15 people who allegedly conspired to orchestrate the riots in February across north-east Delhi localities. In the 17,500-page charge sheet, the police have named Abdul Khalid Saifi, Ishrat Jahan, Meeran Haider, Tahir Hussain, Gulfisha Khatoon, Safoora Zargar, Shifa-ur Rehman, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Shadab Ahmad, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Taslim Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim and Athar Khan as accused. They have all denied wrongdoing.Former JNU student and activist Umar Khalid, who was arrested on Sunday night in connection with the case, has not been charged. Sharjeel Imam, who was earlier arrested for giving an alleged seditious speech, has also been not charged, though both Khalid and Imam have been named in the document. Police have said that they may file supplementary charge sheets into the case. Khalid and Imam have said that they have no role to play in the riots.Also Read: Delhi riots: Police unprepared, failed to anticipate scale in numbers, shows dataThe police have annexed statements of over 100 protected witnesses, call details and chat records of the different WhatsApp groups that the arrested persons were part of.A copy of the charge sheet was provided to the lawyers of the accused on Monday. Anti-CAA protests The charge sheet describes the anti-CAA protests near Jamia, which turned violent last December, as the “beta version of the carnage”. Violence followed an anti-CAA protest near Jamia in December, in which several vehicles and public property were damaged. Besides cracking down on those outside, the police had also barged into the Jamia campus and beat up students sitting in the library. This was followed by protests at the university gate, then at the nearby Shaheen Bagh and different parts of the city and the country. “The key conspirators had learnt their lessons drawn from December 2019 and while executing the continuing conspiracy in February 2020 chose north-east Delhi with its unique economic, social and demographic matrix as being the ideal ground for mass scale mobilisation and violence as it was found to be much more vulnerable and dispensable as compared to south east Delhi,” reads the charge sheet. “Almost every character who gained notoriety in February 2020 had been noticed as being present in the incidents of December 2019,” the charge sheet adds. Also Read: Facebook India moves supreme court against Delhi assembly panel summonsAccording to the document, the members of Pinjra Tod were brought on board to ensure that the protests were not branded as one being led by only one particular community. The police said that sites for sit-in protests were chosen in pockets dominated by the Muslims, and which were close to arterial roads that led to areas with mixed population. The Pinja Tod activists have denied any wrongdoing.Hate speech The charge sheet mentions that the conspirators “by their ingenuity and criminality of thoughts”, gave a new meaning to hate speech. It says that the speeches were sugar-coated with nationalism, aimed “at igniting and reinforcing a pan-Islamic identity.”According to the investigators, the accused kept the “audience” confused by raising several issues at once, including CAA, fascism and interests of Dalits and the marginalised. ”The conspirators had something for everyone who was looking up to their intellectual corpus in the belief that they represented a bonafide alternative in India’s democratic palette.”BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who had also given a speech a day before violence erupted in north-east Delhi, was questioned by the police but he denied giving any speech. He was summoned on July 28 and he told the investigators that he had gone to the protest site in his personal capacity. “I have not delivered any speech. I just told police to clear the road in three days. If they did not do it, I said that we would also sit on dharna,” Mishra told the police, as per the charge sheet. Critics of the police probe into the riots have often pointed out while the police targeted anti-CAA and anti-government voices, it did not take any action against people like Mishra, who belonged to the ruling party even though there was video footage of them giving inflammatory speeches and leading slogans.Financing The charge sheet claims that five accused in the case got Rs 1.61 crore in cash through bank transactions to allegedly “manage” the anti-CAA protest sites and “execute the conspiracy” for riots. Police have named former councillor Ishrat Jahan, activist Khalid Saifi, suspended municipal councillor Tahir Hussain, Shifa-Ur-Rehman and Jamia Milla Islamia student Meeran Haider for collectively receiving the money, of which around Rs 1.48 crore was withdrawn in cash on separate occasions to implement the plans. Police have cited the bank details of arrested accused Ishrat Jahan, and claimed that Rs 4 lakh was transferred in her bank account from a Corporation Bank account in Maharashtra. The money was transferred by a man who worked as a driver for Samir Abdul Sai in Sindhudurg Maharashtra, according to the police. Sai, who has recorded his statement before a judge, alleged that he was conned into sending the money by his business partner who was allegedly funding the anti-CAA protests. Key names The charge sheet mentions suspended councillor Tahir Hussain, Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Khalid Saifi as some of the main conspirators who planned and executed the protests and then the riots. Both Khalid and Imam, however, are yet to be charged.According to the charge sheet, Hussain, also the prime accused in the murder of IB official Ankit Sharma, arranged funds for the riot and mobilised rioters. Police have attached the statement of an “insider”, who has claimed to have seen Hussain preparing for the violence by stocking petrol, acid and bottles. According to the police, it was Saifi who brought Hussain and Khalid together. Khalid, the charge sheet says, planned the conspiracy which had to be executed during the visit of the US President Donald Trump. Imam was involved in the conspiracy since the first clashes outside Jamia, the charge sheet says. Imam, who was arrested for making an alleged inflammatory speech, has been accused by police of using social media “for large scale indoctrination and mobilisation of youths for chakka jaam as a protest against CAA”. Pinjra Tod activists Police have attached WhatsApp chats of Pinjra Tod activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal with Khalid, Sharjeel and other alleged co-conspirators as the ones mobilising people on the roads before the violence. It also contains statements by protected witnesses, claiming women who were part of the protests were given chilli powder to be used during violence. The charge sheet mentions that there were at least 25 WhatsApp groups, which were created to for the purpose of mobilising support to block roads, for protests against the CAA and, ultimately the riots. One such WhatsApp group (the chat records features as evidence of conspiracy) was created by Pinjra Tod member Gulfisha Khatoon. Lapses in deployment According to the charge sheet, the riots in north-east Delhi coincided with Trump’s visit when the national capital was on a high alert. However, the police deployment data related to the violence-hit areas cited in the charge sheet shows police were unprepared or had not anticipated the scale of the clashes. On February 23, when the first incidents of violence were reported from Jafrabad, there were 1,393 police personnel deployed there. On February 24, there were 1,361 police personnel on the ground, and on February 25, 1,399 police personnel were posted. Most cases of rioting and murder were reported between February 23-25. What defence says Advocate Mahmood Pracha, who is representing Gulfisha Khatoon, called it a ghost charge sheet. “The informer of this FIR is ghost and more than 100 main witnesses are also ghosts. If police is shying away from disclosing their names, one can imagine the worth of this charge sheet,” he saidAdit S Pujari, appearing for Pinjra Tod activists Natasha and Devanga, said: “The only place we will respond is in the court.” Advocate Rizwan, counsel for Tahir Hussain, said his client was being made a scapegoat. “These are all concocted facts because people first came to know about Trump’s to India on January 13. Police have alleged that the conspirators met at Shaheen Bagh on January 8.” Pradeep Teotia, counsel for Ishrat Jahan, said his client had no role in the riots. “We have video footage, which shows my client was not leading any mob. She was forced to sign disclosure statements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamia-stir-was-a-beta-test-charge-sheet/story-g2dqlRu4lkH028V75hyU8J.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Rumi’s roomie||It’s almost midnight. He picks up his guitar, strums the strings and starts to croon Feeling Good. The Nina Simone classic instantly catches Rumi’s attention. He leaps up to the chair, jumps on the writing table, and listens intently to the rendition.Rumi is used to these guitar songs. Because Rumi’s roomie is a musician.Rumi is a cat. His mate, Ehmad Ridwan, is a human.This is their pad in south Delhi’s East of Kailash. They are the only guys in the flat. Both the other flatmates are women, who have their own rooms.“While I often play the guitar in the drawing room, our common room, I prefer to listen to music alone in my room, with eyes closed,” says Mr Ridwan. In his mid-20s, he is giving a tour of his small room. Since it is pandemic-time, the visit is unfolding through WhatsApp video.Mr Ridwan returned a week ago from a summer spell in his hometown, Srinagar. A graduate in Peace and Conflict Resolution in Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, he confesses that “things aren’t going well because of the pandemic.” His main source of income in the Capital was giving performances in public and private gigs, but both have temporarily stalled. He also had a series of jobs in Gurugram and Delhi, but gave up that regular career to be with his mother during the pandemic—his father passed away in January last year. He isn’t unduly worried for his prospects, though, “for everyone is suffering financially these days.”Mr Ridwan calls his music genre Urdu blues rock, “in which I set music to lyrics by well-known poets as well as some I write myself.” Poet Faiz is a passion, though there isn’t any of his books in the room. It is an elegantly sparse place, with a few potted plants scattered around. The most noticeable elements are two guitars, and the wall decked with a dozen postcards sent by friends during travels to various places.As the outside world remains mostly out of bounds, one wonders why Mr Ridwan came back to this windowless room instead of staying in his Srinagar family house, with six rooms, where the windows look to a great variety of views—a graveyard, a panorama of poplar trees, and the famous Shankaracharya temple on the top of a hill.“Because this room is me. And I need to be alone to create my music.”He now again picks up his guitar and starts an Urdu song. This time Rumi sits by a potted plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-rumi-s-roomie/story-OfszgVIGiPmKXXKeOq3t4I.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy to be procured at 4,500 locations in Punjab, 2,650 temporary purchase centres set up||With no signs of Covid-19 subsiding anytime soon, the Punjab food and civil supplies department has decided to stagger paddy procurement on the lines of wheat purchase made from April to June amid pandemic-induced lockdown. But this time, 2,650 temporary purchasing centres have been set up besides the existing 1,850 such facilities, taking the total to 4,500. There will be at least 1,000 more centres than the one set up during the wheat procurement season. To maintain social distancing, a cluster of 3-4 villages will have one designated procurement centre. The department is contemplating to use the compounds of schools and colleges, rice shelling mills, defunct mandis and open plinths besides other public places with concrete floors for paddy procurement which will begin from October 1. “Since coronavirus cases are hitting the peak this time around, we want to take all precautions to ensure that minimum number of farmers gather at a place. We are looking for premises which have concrete floors,” said principal secretary (food and civil supplies) KAP Sinha. The department has sought reports from all 22 deputy commissioners to enlist the public places in the districts which have space for unloading and weighing produce and can be used for purchase by the government agencies. This is the second procurement since the lockdown was imposed in March to check the spread of Covid19. Wheat procurement that began in April 15 was carried out from over 3,600 centres. At that time, to stagger the procurement, the premises of 1,650 rice mills were used along with existing 1,850 mandis and procurement centres managed by the state mandi board. Officials said paddy procurement poses a bigger challenge since the volume of produce is at least one-third more than the wheat crop during the rabi season. Also, paddy arrives at a faster pace in mandis, they said. An average 120 lakh tonne wheat arrives in mandis while the paddy arrivals are expected to touch 170 lakh tone this time. CCL BY FIRST WEEK OF OCT A cash credit limit (CCL) of Rs 35,500 crore has been sought for procurement of paddy at a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,888 per quintal. Sources in the state food and civil supplies department said the amount is expected to be sanctioned by the first week of October as some issues related to the previous rabi crops are being sorted out.

But the farmer unions in Punjab have announced that they will not bow down under any pressure and will opt for the cheapest way to handle the crop residue until paid for its proper disposal. Despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT)’s directions against any such move, red dots (farm fires) on Punjab map have started appearing from Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts, where harvesting of early sown paddy is going on to clear fields for sowing the potato crop. Already, 43 such cases have been detected by the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. “Why you expect everything from farmers and that too without paying anything extra? The farmers have no option as neither the Centre nor the state government provide any incentive to them to handle the residue. The government should give Rs 200 per quintal as handling charges as farmers cannot afford it,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda). “The farmers are already upset over the agriculture ordinances. How could the government stop us when we are being exploited and forced to protest on the roads with passing of these bills. Even the last year, the government didn’t pay any amount to farmers who shunned straw burning,” he said. Manjit Singh, district president of the BKU (Ugarahan), said the farmers will confront the police and officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the agriculture department if they visit villages to stop them from burning stubble. “We are aware of the environmental issues but the farmers have no alternative to burning of the straw. They do not have money to manage the stubble with the latest technology,” he said. “The government must set up power plants where we can sell the crop residue and earn money. But officials are busy in doling out subsidy for machines which are much cheaper in the open market,” Jagtar Singh, a farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib, said. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh last week had blamed centre for not announcing incentive to handle paddy straw. Also, chief secretary Vini Mahajan had directed all the deputy commissioners to ensure zero tolerance for paddy straw burning in view of the NGT guidelines. Doctors worried inview of Covid-19 Dr Vishal Chopra, a professor in pulmonary medicine at the Government Rajindra Medical College, Patiala, and incharge of Covid-19 said in view of the pandemic, people must be extra cautious and should avoid burning of straw. “It is for the welfare of all, especially those suffering from ailments of heart and lungs. The Exposure to smog will increase the trouble of such patients,” he said.

The former two-term chief minister said, A few years ago the Prime Minister had constituted a high-level committee under my chairmanship to recommend changes in farm sectors.Agricultural scientist Ashok Gulati was a member of the committee. The committee report pointed out that agriculture was no longer a remunerative business but the world could not do without it.”“To help farmers, almost all countries in the world give direct income support to the farmers. I am happy that the PM has also implemented our recommendation of direct income support as Kisan Samman Nidhi,” said the 86-year-old veteran leader.He said the second major recommendation given by the committee was that farmers should be freed from the clutches of middlemen in mandis. By bringing the most revolutionary laws, the government has tried to provide the farmers much needed relief, he said. “However, the naive farmers have not read the law. Those who used to exploit farmers are the behind the ongoing farmer protests,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shanta-kumar-slams-opposition-for-unruly-conduct-in-rajya-sabha/story-1BUh3LUjg72KBYV157ho0H.html

23-09-2020||City||GCR master drain unable to handle intense rainfall: DLF to GMDA flood committee||Gurugram: Private developer DLF has attributed the flooding of Raghavendra Marg, popularly known as Golf Course Road, on August 19 and 20 primarily to intense rainfall, saying that the intensity of rainfall was more than 16 times the area’s master drainage capacity. DLF is the custodian of Golf Course Road (GCR) and responsible for its maintenance.In a letter submitted to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA’s) flood protection committee earlier this month, DLF said, “(The) master drainage system has been designed by the HSVP/GMDA at 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) rainfall intensity per hour. As you are aware that on 19.08.20 approx 125mm rainfall occurred over a period of 3 (three) hours i.e. 41.66 mm/hour. The intensity of the rainfall was 16.66 times of the designed capacity of master stormwater drain.” On Tuesday, the developer shared a copy of its submission to GMDA. Following heavy showers on August 19 and 20, the stretch of Golf Course Road between Sectors 26 and 56 was severely waterlogged, with the underpass at DLF Phase 1 rendered unusable for over 30 hours. To probe the matter, GMDA on August 20 constituted a seven-member expert committee to submit a report within a week. The committee includes a representative of DLF. While the final report has been delayed, after multiple GMDA staffers involved in the exercise tested positive for Covid-19 in the last two weeks, officials in the authority’s infrastructure department confirmed that they have received the developer’s assessment.DLF’s letter, authored by Sunil Arora, a committee member and vice-president (infrastructure) at DLF, states that it would not have been possible to drain out such a large quantity of stormwater through the master drainage system. “The waterlogging occurred not only on Raghvendra Marg but also in sectors 27,28,42,43, 52 & 56,” states his submission. Moreover, Arora maintained that DLF’s own preparatory measures to facilitate drainage of stormwater from the DLF Phase 1 underpass, and along Sectors 26, 26A, 27, 28, 42 and 43, are adequate. “We have four pumps capable of pumping out 5,400 litres of water per minute along with a sump well with a capacity of 2,093 kilolitres. The sump well is sufficient to store rainwater for a rainfall of 125 mm, as we saw on August 19,” Arora said, reiterating from his letter to the GMDA, dated September 7. “Adequate saucer drains on both end of underpass have also been provided to accumulate and dispose of the same in the sump,” his letter goes on to state. According to the developer, during field visits conducted in the wake of last month’s flooding, a DLF team had noted major bottlenecks in the region which may have exacerbated the waterlogging. “There was a natural creek starting from the Nathupur bundh in Sector 24 carrying the discharge of catchment area of Biodiversity Park, part of Sector 24, 25A (Ambience areas). The same does not exist further in Delhi area and presently, rainwater is being pumped out near sector 20,” Arora mentions. Secondly, a portion of the master drain (known as Leg-1) passing through Palam Vihar, which was once an open drain, has since been covered up. “During heavy rains, some portion of the drain collapsed leading to interruption in flow of water. The same was got cleaned by the GMDA... there is possibility that the cleaning of the drain before the monsoon may not have been carried out due to Covid lockdown,” Arora wrote on September 7. Ranjana Chaudhuri of the department of regional water studies at TERI, who will be spearheading a privately funded hydrological study of the region following last month’s floods, said, “I cannot comment on the developer’s assessment of the situation, but yes, the intensity of rainfall was a huge challenge on the day. Moreover, with so much concretisation in the affected area, the run-off comes down from the Aravallis at a high velocity. Such extreme weather events are likely to occur again, so it’s not enough for one just stakeholder to be well prepared. A long-term, ecological solution needs to be considered.” A DLF spokesperson on Tuesday said, “DLF has submitted its assessment of the flood situation to GMDA, as stipulated. We have also discussed possible solutions to resolve the flooding issue with officials concerned, and will be taking the matter forward in the interest of Gurugram and its citizens. While VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, did not respond to request for comment on Tuesday, Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer of the authority’s infra division and member of the flood protection committee, said, “I have received DLF’s assessment, but will only be able to comment once the committee has convened and had a discussion about the same. Their submission will be carefully evaluated and we are working with them to find a solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gcr-master-drain-unable-to-handle-intense-rainfall-dlf-to-gmda-flood-committee/story-FrgPltuVLeeK5dFbdutJGM.html

He was 89.Air Marshal Singh was commissioned in the IAF in January 1951. During the 1971 war, he was in command of an operational fighter squadron in the Eastern Sector. “His squadron flew a total of 110 sorties in Bangladesh in close support and anti-shipping roles and met all its operational commitments without damage to any of its aircraft. He personally led 19 sorties and successfully engaged enemy defence positions, gunboats and ships despite the heavy ground fire,” reads his Vir Chakra citation, which he received on the Republic Day in 1973.“When the heliborne operations across the Maghana River commenced, his squadron provided very effective air cover for the successful completion of the task. In addition, the squadron provided valuable close support to the Army in the Agartala Sector inspite of the fact that the aircraft had to operate from a short runway at Agartala,” it further reads.Air Marshal Singh was set to lead the air force in 1988, but was reportedly superseded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vir-chakra-awardee-air-marshal-mm-singh-dies/story-LAkAj2rRosOtSCiwx3nrfK.html

23-09-2020||Gurugram||Deadline for restoration work of John Hall pushed forward by seven months||The deadline for the completion of the first phase of the restoration work of the 94-year-old John Hall has been pushed forward by roughly seven months due to Covid-related restrictions, officials helming the project said. Work on the project was supposed to start by April this year as per the earlier plan but couldn’t take off due to the nationwide lockdown imposed in March, said officials. John Hall, a colonial structure, was built in 1925 in the memory of John Goble Brayne, the second son of FL Brayne, who was the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon in 1920. Over the years, it has occupied an important place in the administrative functioning of the city. Currently, the place is used by the administration for meetings and is opened only for official work. The hall was renamed Swatantra Senani Zila Parishad Hall a few years ago and is presently under the ownership of the Zila Parishad. In November 2019, the district administration signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a city-based firm as a funding partner for a three-year-long restoration project of the structure. The restoration work is being handled by the Haryana corporate social responsibility advisory board (HCSRAB) and is aimed at establishing John Hall’s importance as a historical structure in the city. The restoration project will be divided into four phases. It would cost around ₹3.59 crore in total. The first phase is estimated to cost ₹51 lakh, the second and third ₹1.5 crore each, while the last phase will cost nearly ₹27 lakh. Gaurav Singh, additional CEO and regional head of HCSRAB, Gurugram, said that a review meeting was held last week for the resumption of the first phase of the project. “Last week, we convened a meeting with all stakeholders and discussed the survey report that had been prepared earlier. We have formed a committee, including members of the Zila Parishad and our team, to carry forward the restoration work. Following the recommendations of the survey, our next step is to finalise an architect with a background in heritage conservation, the tender for which will be floated within the next 15 days,” said Singh. He said that the timeline for the first phase had been pushed forward by seven months since the administration had been busy with Covid-related measures. “Under normal circumstances, the first phase of the project should have been completed by now. We lost out on five-six months due to the lockdown and other restrictions. The project is on but it will take another seven to eight months for the first phase to be completed,” said Singh. Singh added that the project design prepared by the conservation architect will be assessed as per the survey report created by ASI members before tenders are floated. Anu Sheokand, who recently took charge as the CEO of the Zila Parishad, said that the Zila Parishad and CSR board would be working on the restoration project together to preserve and enhance the structure’s historical importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/deadline-for-restoration-work-of-john-hall-pushed-forward-by-seven-months/story-YMUtqsqNqjiEqs8MmXvVyO.html

23-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi transport dept urges owners of older vehicles to fix HSRPs, fuel stickers||The Delhi government’s transport department has asked owners of old vehicles registered in the national capital to get high security registration number plates (HSRP) and colour-coded fuel stickers issued for their vehicles.In a public notice issued Tuesday, the department advised vehicle owners to get the HSRPs and stickers from registered dealers without delay and added that it will soon launch a drive wherein violators will be prosecuted. The vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, will have to get HSRPs and colour stickers. The newer vehicles (registered after April 1, 2019) come equipped with HSRPs and stickers, an official said. Also Read: Delhi: How you can get HSRPs and fuel stickers for your vehicleThe colour-coded stickers are meant for identifying vehicles based on their fuel type, with light blue indicating petrol and CNG, and orange indicating diesel-run vehicles. It also bears details such as the registration number, the registering authority, a laser-branded PIN, and engine and chassis numbers of the vehicle, officials said.The HSRPs are chromium-based hologram plates made by hot stamping, besides a laser-branding of a permanent identification number. “Almost 30 lakh old vehicles will require HSRPs and the fuel-based colour stickers. Various auto makers have appointed a vendor for HSRPs and the plates can booked online. Around 236 dealers will be providing HSRPs and stickers. We will start our enforcement drive only after giving a reasonable period of time to the public to get both fixed on their vehicles,” a transport department official said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has urged the lieutenant-governor to direct the transport department to withdraw its notice for fixing HSRPs and colour-coded stickers, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the exercise will involve around 70 lakh vehicles, and can be postponed till such time when the pandemic has subsided completely.People should fix HSRPs only through online booking from the vendor as the same are not available in the open market, officials cautioned.HSRPs and colour-coded stickers are mandatory for all vehicles registered in Delhi and action can be taken against owners who fail to do so under motor vehicle rules, said a senior transport department official.Last year, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) had directed the fixing of HSRPs and colour-coded stickers on all vehicles by October 2019. However, this could not be done due to various reasons, including the unavailability of HSRPs, officials said.Meanwhile, the transport department on Tuesday extended till September 30 the validity of CNG leakage test certificates that had expired between February 1 and June 30, 2020.

The decision comes at a time when hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients from Haryana, as well as those from other parts of the country, has been witnessing a steady spike in Gurugram. Gurugram is perceived to have a robust private healthcare infrastructure in place, a primary reason for many outstation patients opting to undergo treatment for Covid-19 in the city rather than their own hometowns. Presently, 225 patients from Gurugram and 156 patients from other parts of Haryana are hospitalised in the district. Apart from this another 255 outstation patients— 55 from Delhi, 97 from Uttar Pradesh and 103 from other parts of the country — are also admitted in the private and government hospitals in Gurugram, which have over 2000 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients.The new order issued by the director general health services on September 18 says that an earlier order capping treatment charges will now be applicable only to Haryana residents. On June 25, the state government had fixed per day rates in hospitals accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH) at Rs 10,000 for isolation bed, including supportive care and oxygen; Rs 15,000 for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed without ventilator and Rs 18,000 for ICU bed with ventilator. Likewise, the rates in non-NABH accredited hospitals are Rs 8000, Rs 13,000 and Rs 15,000, respectively for the same services. About the treatment cost for patients from outside Haryana, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Private hospitals may have to decide their treatment charges on their own.” A city-based senior doctor, privy to the matter, said, “It is probably one of the ways by which the state government is trying to reserve Covid-19 beds for residents of Haryana as number of cases and hospitalisation has seen an upward trajectory.”When HT contacted senior management officials of two private hospitals, where maximum outstation patients are getting treated, they did not comment on the issue.In June, officials said, the purpose behind the standardization of rates was to eliminate disparity in charges across various private hospitals. The treatment cost in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was going up to Rs 50,000 or more, while for general ward it was Rs 20,000 a day. Therefore, under the fixed charges the state included all laboratory investigation, radiology diagnostic, drugs, consumables, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and masks, doctors consultation among others. It did not include experimental drugs like Remdesivir. Also, pregnant women, who have normal or Cesarean delivery and for the care of the infant, the hospitals were allowed to charge extra. K Sujatha Rao, former secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, said that there is no merit in introducing price differentiation for Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in hospitals. “Asking a patient coming from Bihar to pay more, while a resident of the state who is having the same illness pays less for the same treatment, is totally discriminatory. The decision might have been taken under the pressure of private hospitals, who want to earn profit from outstation patients, while obliging the state government by giving treatment to its residents at a lower cost,” Rao said. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, was unavailable for a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/capped-price-for-covid-19-treatment-for-haryana-residents-only-orders-state-govt/story-GHSjq2pIQI4OtBFPzRsmgL.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Gang of thieves stealing MTNL cables busted; cops recover earth mover, forged papers from them||Police Tuesday claimed to have busted a gang of thieves that posed as contractors and labourers and stole underground telephone cables using forged documents of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL), authorising them to carry out digging and repairing of cables. Eight members of the gang were arrested for allegedly stealing over 200 kilograms of MTNL cables from west Delhi’s Janakpuri on the night of August 31, police said. “The gang members used to wear safety gear, including helmets and florescent jackets, used all necessary machines such as earth movers, and even carried forged work order permit to avoid any suspicion. They used to take the copper wires from the cables and sell them,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit. Those arrested were identified as Azharuddin, leader of the gang, Moshir Siddiqui, Parvez alias Baijal, Shakib, Laddu, Manzoor Alam, Shahid, and Mohammad Yusuf. All of them are originally from Bihar but have been living in Delhi for the past few years. Nine pieces of stolen telephone cables, of a total length of 60 feet and weighing 218 kilograms, forged MTNL order orders, an earth mover, ten yellow helmets and as many fluorescent jackets, six red bollards, two torchlights and two traffic bar lights, and other documents were seized from them, said the DCP. “Azharuddin is a scrap dealer by profession and is into crime for over a decade. The other seven belong to his village in Bihar. Together, they planned to steal underground telephone cables using the unique modus operandi. Azharuddin has been previously involved in three similar crimes,” DCP Purohit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gang-of-thieves-stealing-mtnl-cables-busted-cops-recover-earth-mover-forged-papers-from-them/story-P6OpSjCIjmRSZ4xwotHyBO.html
23-09-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: New Covid cases emerging from prime locations of city||Nearly 19% of the Covid-19 cases that emerged in September are located in some of the prime localities of the city — like Golf Course Road, sectors under Golf Course extension, Sushant Lok (I,II) and DLF phase (I-V) — data available with the district administration highlighted. Of the 19%, the five urban primary health centres — at Tigra, Chanderlok, Wazirabad, Patel Nagar and Laxman Vihar — have reported the maximum number of new cases this month, when compared to August. In August, the district reported 2,850 new cases, of which 344 were from these five urban primary health centres. Till September 20, the district had recorded 6,225 new cases, of which at least 1,150 were from the urban primary health centres. Overall, Gurugram has witnessed a 54% spike in cases this month so far, when compared to August. As per the data, Tigra urban primary health centre reported the highest jump from 93 new cases in August to 315 in September. It caters to areas such as Golf Course Road and sectors under Golf Course Road Extension, along with villages like Ghata. Dr Hardeep Kaur , medical officer, Tigra urban primary health centre, said that the sudden surge has been due to international and domestic movement of people. “Many upscale areas are covered under this urban primary health centre. The new cases are more in high-rise buildings, where mostly travellers including expats, students coming from abroad, employees going to offices located in Delhi or within Gurugram, stay. It also includes people who are holding parties. There are many cases where one infected person has transmitted the infection to almost 10 people after attending a party or a get together,” said Kaur, who herself is in home isolation after testing Covid positive earlier this week.. Since the urban primary health centre covers 1.5 lakh population under it, Kaur said numbers are likely to continue to grow. “There is no prohibition on any activity, people are easily moving about. Many people do not want to stay indoors anymore,” said Kaur over the phone. In the contact tracing of these 315 cases from Tiigra, at least 2,524 high risk contacts have been identified. Tigra also has the highest number of containment zones — 25 — when compared to all other urban primary health centres.Likewise, Chanderlok urban primary health centre has shown the second highest surge in new cases — from 59 in August to 281 in September. The Chanderlok urban primary health centre covers areas like South City I, sector 30, 40, 41 among others. The medical officer of Chanderlok urban primary health centre was confirmed positive for Covid on Tuesday and was not available for a comment.Wazirabad urban primary health centre, which also cater to a large percentage of population, has the third highest growth in the number of cases. The number of cases in the area has increased from 70 in August to 268 in September. Health staff at the centre said most of the new cases in the area are health care workers of private hospitals. “Nearly 40% of the cases reported in the area are health care workers. Big hospitals like Paras, Artemis and Medanta comes under our jurisdiction. The remaining 60% are mostly random cases. We cover some of the more congested areas like Silokhera, Chakkarpur, Sikanderpur, Islampur where cases are emerging,” said Dr Ashma Sheoran, medical officer of Wazirabad primary health centre. The health team has traced 1,759 high risk contacts of new cases and tested them. Currently, Covid-19 cases are counted under 35 areas, including 19 UPHCs. Out of the 35 areas only eight have reported more than 100 new cases in September so far. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, said, “People will now have to be cautious since there are no more mandatory restrictions. Following government norms, within the containment zones we are creating micro containment zones, since the entire locality cannot be sealed. If there are more than three cases in condominium tower or a lane, they are being declared as containment zones. Also, mass survey is being conducted using rapid antigen test and active surveillance through RT-PCR and antigen test, depending upon the requirement, to timely detect cases and prevent mortality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-new-covid-cases-emerging-from-prime-locations-of-city/story-mPIgwHU4gMo5uxZRObif4O.html

23-09-2020||Delhi||Contactless e-ticketing on Delhi buses from November: Gahlot||Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Tuesday said the city administration will launch contactless e-ticketing services in all its buses from November, a day after the transport department completed the second phase of the system’s trial.“The mobile application through which the ticketing in buses will happen has received a good response from passengers. We have rectified all glitches that were noticed in the previous trials. We are also in the process of incorporating daily and monthly passes, along with developing a system for users without smartphones to buy tickets. We are looking forward to covering all cluster and DTC [Delhi Transport Corporation] buses under this app by the first week of November,” he said.The second phase trial of the contactless e-ticketing App ‘Chartr’ was conducted from September 7 to 21 and covered more than 60 routes from four depots of the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) — Dilshad Garden, Kair Depot, Kushak Nallah Depot, Sunehri Pullah Depot, apart from one route from two DTC depots — Hasanpur and Gazipur depots. Of the 51,644 total tickets purchased through the app in the 14-day period, 79.4% were free Pink tickets for female passengers. An average of 6% ticketing was done through the app during the trial, whereas the AC buses observed a 7% tickets sold through the app. The app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store which is now available as a full version, as well as from a WhatsApp number.The app automatically recommends a Pink ticket (free) for female passengers, based on the gender entered by the user. The app supports both Hindi and English languages. A user can also see all stoppages of a bus and can view by typing the name of the stop, all the buses arriving in the next half an hour with details like ETA. The ETA also gets updated in real-time during the passenger’s journey in the bus. The ticket becomes invalid once the passenger reaches their destination as entered in the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/contactless-e-ticketing-on-delhi-buses-from-november-gahlot/story-bIg8WSgBlN9FIWSlSSGJEN.html
23-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s iconic Wankhede stadium to soon be open for tourists||The Wankhede stadium could soon be open to tourists for a tour of the iconic cricket venue, which has been host to several key matches, including the 2011 Cricket World Cup final where the Indian team lifted the trophy. State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday announced that Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), which manages the stadium, has given its “in-principle” nod to opening the stadium for tours.“We at the Tourism Dept had requested @MumbaiCricAssoc to work with us on opening up of Wankhede Stadium for a stadium experience tour to tourists and fans from around the world. They have agreed in principle to work together on the same,” Thackeray tweeted.The concept is already popular abroad, with leading cricket, football and tennis clubs providing such stadium tour experiences. It also provides revenues to these clubs. Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu, Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium, Barcelona’s Camp Nou, among others, are open to tourists and fans when matches are not held there. In India, HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala is open to tourists.The minister added that apart from the Wankhede stadium tour, there will be a museum dedicated to Indian Cricket “emanating from Mumbai”. The proposed museum will either come up inside the stadium premises or at some other location in the city.“Along with the stadium experience tour, I had discussed with Hon’ble Sharad Pawar sir earlier, and MCA President Vijay Patil ji, on having a museum of “Indian Cricket emanating from Mumbai”. The MCA has agreed for this as well, to be either in Wankhede or any suitable place,” he added.Thackeray added that once the stadium is opened in Mumbai, it would be a place for “devotees of cricket”. He said, “I’m thankful to the MCA apex committee for this key partnership. For most of us, cricket is a religion. Wankhede is where India won the World Cup. This truly shall be a place for not just tourists, but for devotees of cricket and their favourite players.”The decision fits perfectly in MCA president Vijay Patil’s vision to create a brand identity for Mumbai cricket. In his proposal during the MCA apex council meeting couple of months ago, other points he listed included expanding its digital footprint—using its stature and history—merchandising, making its website user friendly and upping its social media game. Patil said the “details are still worked out” but he is happy with the development. “On the advise of Sharad Pawar (we) are establishing a cricket museum and (now) we are delighted to partner with MTDC to promote the iconic Wankhede Stadium as a must visit place for sports fan visiting Mumbai from around the world . My deep appreciation to Aaditya Thackeray for taking this initiative on behalf of Government of Maharashtra to promote Mumbai cricket,” he said.Meanwhile, as an honour to MS Dhoni, a proposal had been mooted by apex council member Ajinkya Naik last month to devote “a permanent seat on his (Dhoni’s) name at the stand where his 2011 World Cup-winning six landed”. The MCA has identified the seat where the ball landed. The seat number is 210 in Block L of MCA Pavilion. It can also play a crucial role in attracting tourist to the Wankhede Stadium. The MCA got a huge help from Sunil Gavaskar in this regard. “I got a call from a dear friend of mine from Hong Kong that the ball is with a friend of his who was sitting in that seat,” said Gavaskar in a mail to Naik. Later, he shared the pic with of the ball and match ticket which helped MCA identify the exact location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-iconic-wankhede-stadium-to-soon-be-open-for-tourists/story-CZi8t6zSgIJrn2rTdXzLLK.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Amid strict safety protocols, CBSE conducts compartment exams||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)Tuesday began conducting the compartment exams for its class 10 and 12 students amid strict safety measures to restrict the spread of Covid-19. These are the first set of in-person exams being conducted by the board since the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in March leading to the suspension and, eventually, the cancellation of the remaining papers of the board examination.Shaad Ali, a resident of Yamuna Vihar in north-east Delhi, who appeared for his class 12 mathematics compartment exam, said he walked to his exam centre nearby to avoid using the public transport. The board has increased the number of examination centres from 500 (last year) to 1,268 this time to maintain social distancing among students. In Delhi, the exams were conducted at 247 centres.“My family had asked me to repeatedly sanitise my hands while at the exam centre. There is a health risk, but I could not miss my papers because that would affect my academic future. I wrote my papers wearing mask and gloves, and both were a bit uncomfortable. Although I could not take any tuitions due to the pandemic, my papers went well,” said Ali.This year, around 2,37,000 students from India and 16 other countries will be appearing for the compartment exams which will continue till September 30. Students of class 10 will be appearing for a maximum of two subjects while those of class 12 will appear for a maximum of one subject. The board had also allowed class 12 students to appear for improvement papers if they wish to better their existing score in the subject.Himani Singh, a class 12 student of a government school in New Kondli, was among those who gave her improvement papers on Tuesday. “Apart from a slight delay in distributing the papers due to the Covid-19 precautions, the exams were conducted smoothly. Students were made to sit at 6 feet apart and wrote their papers while wearing masks and gloves. We have gotten quite used to wearing masks for long hours, so it wasn’t much of an issue,” she said.Her father Sukhpal Singh had taken a leave from work to accompany his daughter to and from the exam centre. “There is not much fear because we have been taking all necessary precautions. Since the pandemic struck in March, people have had time to process things and take the necessary precautions. I took a leave from work today so that Himani wouldn’t have to use public transport,” he said.BP Dhyani, head of a government school in Trilokpuri, which is an exam centre, said the school was taking all necessary measures to ensure safety of staff and students. “Only 12 students are allowed per room and they are provided with sanitisers, masks and gloves if they don’t have their own. We will be locking the rooms that were used for the exams today and using another set of rooms for the examination tomorrow to ensure desks aren’t repeated. Since compartment exams have fewer students (than regular exams), we can take these safety measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-strict-safety-protocols-cbse-conducts-compartment-exams/story-bqlOKqC47ibyXgbDIyIihL.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||High drama as Chandigarh MC staff, BJP workers face off||A high drama was witnessed at the Chandigarh municipal corporation office in Sector 17 after a Bharatiya Janata Party local leader allegedly slapped the private secretary to commissioner KK Yadav on Tuesday afternoon. In turn, the BJP accused MC employees of attacking party workers.While MC work and public dealing remained suspended after lunch as employees blocked the entrance to the office, demanding registration of a police complaint against BJP leaders involved in the incident, the party workers protested carrying placards that accused Yadav of corruption.BJP workers withdrew their dharna after party’s state president Arun Sood reached the spot and intervened around 3pm, but the MC workers’ protest continued till 5pm, during which they raised slogans against the ruling party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi .The allegationsThe alleged incident took place around 1pm when BJP workers, led by state general secretary Ramveer Bhatti, and employees posted at the MC commissioner’s officer entered into an argument over a meeting with Yadav.In his police complaint, commissioner’s private secretary Jatin Saini alleged, “Around 1pm, a delegation of 8-10 BJP workers came to meet the MC commissioner. I told them the commissioner was meeting somebody else, and they should wait as they didn’t take prior appointment. At this, they started shouting at me, used abusive language and manhandled me. I was on official duty and he (BJP spokesperson Gaurav Goel) obstructed me in my duty. He also threatened me of dire consequences and to remove me from service.”A daily diary register (DDR) entry has been made against Goel at the police station in Sector 17. Threatening an indefinite strike, MC employees have demanded strict action and immediate registration of an FIR. Rakesh Kumar, general secretary, coordination committee of government and MC employees and workers, said: “In case no action is taken against these criminal people, MC employees will go on an indefinite pen down strike from 10am on Wednesday.”BJP leaders refuted the allegations of manhandling and slapping any employee. BJP state secretary Amit Rana, who was present at the time of ruckus, said: “The party workers were waiting since 11:30am to meet the MC commissioner regarding problems being faced by villagers in the UT. The commissioner came around 1pm, and straight away called a Congress leader. We were told by his PS that he would not meet us. This was followed by heated arguments and some jostling. But there was no incident of a BJP worker slapping an MC employee.”BJP office-bearers, including Bhatti, Goel and Rana, submitted a counter complaint against Saini to the UT director general of police. They alleged it was Saini who became “aggressive” and started punching and kicking BJP workers, and that “on his instigation, the rest of office persons accompanying him also became even more aggressive and started punching”, leading to injuries to workers. What high-ups sayYadav, on his part, said: “We will follow up with police on the complaint made by MC employees, and ensure action is taken as per law.”On BJP workers accusing him of corruption, he said: “They never said on what basis they are making these allegations. They didn’t even share why they had come to meet me.”Terming it “simply a matter of miscommunication”, Sood, who is also a former mayor, said: “BJP workers had gone to meet the MC commissioner on an issue of public interest, particularly problems being faced by people in villages. It is not an issue of MC employees versus the party.”Meanwhile, the Congress condemned the BJP for the incident. In a press statement, Pardeep Chhabra, local unit chief, said: “Over the past five years, BJP leaders and councillors have faced serious complaints of corruption, fighting with officers, accusations of sexual harassment, cheque bounce and even hooliganism, but the party has not learnt any lesson and refuses to take any action against the criminal elements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-drama-as-chandigarh-mc-staff-bjp-workers-face-off/story-BTIK6ApEWJMefKbyooBSKL.html
23-09-2020||Delhi||Restaurateurs demand waiver on liquor licence fee for lockdown period||The restaurant owners in the Capital have requested the Delhi government to waive the liquor licence fee for the lockdown period stating that their alcohol sales have been negligible so far. Restaurants were allowed to serve liquor just a month back and bars were allowed to operate from September 9 in the city on a trial basis.The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has given multiple representations to the excise department and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. The association has now written to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in this regard, as the last date to pay the second instalment of the liquor licence fee is September 29, 2020.The annual liquor licence fee, which is charged as per the seating capacity of a restaurant, varies between Rs 9.25 lakh to Rs 22.41 lakh. The fee has to be paid in advance before the start of the financial year. It can also be paid in two instalments: one before the start of the financial year and the second half before September 29. For instance, the licence fee for financial year 2020-21 was paid by restaurants, either full or partially, by February 28, 2020.While restaurants were allowed to open from June 8 with only 50% seating capacity, the permission to serve liquor on tables was granted much later in mid-August. Bars in the city were allowed to operate only from September 9.A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the demand by restaurant ownersManpreet Singh, owner of Zen restaurant in Connaught Place and treasurer of NRAI, said, “We want the government to waive the licence fee for the lockdown period and adjust it for the months when the permission to sell liquor was given to us. While the licence fee was paid for this financial year, sale of liquor started only recently. Restaurants are already bleeding money as we are operating on 50% seating capacity and turnout is also low right now. The government should support us.” According to NRAI, most restaurants pay the licence fee in installments. Prakul Kumar, secretary general of NRAI, said, “There is panic and confusion among restaurateurs as they have just a week before payment for the second instalment becomes due and there is no clarity on whether the fees will be adjusted or not. Moreover, there is uncertainty whether bars will be allowed to operate or not in the future, as the permission was given only on a trial basis. We have sent representation to the Delhi chief minister in this regard. We requested the government to address this issue at the earliest.”The association has also held several meetings with the excise department and met Sisodia recently to take up the issue.With expired beers and other alcohol stock still lying in their government-authorised storage spaces, NRAI has also requested the government to grant them permission for its disposal. “We need space to keep the new stock of liquor. A lot of liquor has expired and we have to dispose it,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restaurateurs-demand-waiver-on-liquor-licence-fee-for-lockdown-period/story-fwj6J89Rj55t4SqYPSWsVI.html
23-09-2020||Gurugram||Notice issued to Malibu Towne developer for layout plan, other violations||The district town and country planning department (DTCP) has issued a notice to the developer of Malibu Towne colony on Sohna Road for layout plan violations and for poor maintenance, after receiving complaints regarding the same from a former resident. The department has now sought a clarification from the developer and asked them to take necessary steps for resolution of these issues else action would be initiated, said officials.Malibu Towne is a township spread over 300 acres. It has group housing, floors and plots, a large majority of which are occupied. As per the notice issued to the developer on September 14, the district planner said that an inspection was conducted in the colony on the same day as the complaint received and it was found that despite regular water supply by GMDA, illegal borewells were operational in the colony. The inspection was conducted by a team led by RS Bhath, district town planner. It observed that a large generator had been installed at a site meant for a public health facility and half of that land was being used as a dumping ground. The team also observed that a number of borewells were operating and pumping ground water despite GMDA supply. The notice also mentioned that a small part of land, which is meant as green area had been occupied by a private school and it also observed that a revenue road — which passes through the colony — was occupied by the developer. A sewage treatment plant has been set up adjacent to a site meant for a primary school, the notice said. “We conducted an inspection of the colony and found a number of violations. A notice has been issued to the developer and action will be taken as per rules of the department,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram. Another issue raised by the department is that the developer had sold independent floors in 2009 whereas this policy came into existence after 2013, said officials. The inspection follows a complaint lodged by former president of the Malibu Towne RWA, Raman Sharma, who said that multiple violations had been carried out and the department must take action in this regard. The developer of the colony, when asked about the matter, said that they had not carried out any violation and responded in detail to the notice issued by DTCP. “We have not committed any violation of rules and the response has been submitted to the notice. There are hundreds of residents who are living in Malibu Towne but there are only one or two residents who have issues and have lodged complaints with different agencies,” said Subash Raghav, vice president, Malibu Estate Pvt Ltd, which has developed the residential complex. Vijay Shivnath, member of the Volunteer Group, which is working in the colony in absence of the RWAs said that some of the issues taken up by DTCP are important and must be resolved. “We would like the DTCP to take the developer and all residents in confidence while addressing these issues,” he said, adding that a composting site against which also complaint has been lodged needs to be saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/notice-issued-to-malibu-towne-developer-for-layout-plan-other-violations/story-IIyT8jmWJ7NFDQKNVMwgjM.html

Estimated cost of other buildings and development/ redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue shall be worked out after finalization of plans,” Puri said.Last week, Tata Projects Limited had emerged as the lower of the two bidders for the tender for constructing the new Parliament complex by quoting Rs 861.90 crore, when the financial bids for the project opened last Wednesday. According to the Central Public Works Department’s (CPWD) tender, the estimated cost of construction for the new building is Rs 889 crore.In response to a question from Roy seeking ‘the rationale behind the project in light of the fact that economy is in doldrums’; Puri said that the ‘facilities and amenities of the 93-year-old existing Parliament building “are highly inadequate to meet the current demand of the Parliament.’The Central Vista redevelopment project has come under criticism from different quarters. While the Opposition has called for suspending around Rs 20,000 crore project due to the pandemic, some conservationists have argued that it would change the historic nature of Lutyens’ Delhi.“This building is already 93 years old and has since been declared heritage grade-I building. Its facilities and amenities are highly inadequate to meet the current demand of the Parliament. There is acute shortage of office space and there are no individual chambers for Members of Parliament. This building was not meant to be for bicameral Parliament and has been over-stressed through large scale retrofitting done over the years,” Puri said.Puri said that In the current economic scenario, the project will generate large number of direct and indirect employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/new-parliament-to-cost-rs-971-crore-centre-informs-parliament/story-Z72sNtvnBLBcgyimKw9WuJ.html

23-09-2020||Delhi||EPCA asks agencies to jointly patrol industrial areas to check pollution||The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Tuesday directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to ask all agencies concerned to begin joint night patrolling of pollution hot spots across Delhi from October 15. EPCA also asked the government and civic agencies to make plans for removal of garbage, construction and demolition waste from these spots and ensure that vacant plot of lands were not used for dumping waste or garbage and also that it is not burnt. “We have directed the DPCC to write to all agencies concerned to begin night patrolling of hots pots from October 15 to prevent burning of waste and streamlining of vehicular traffic, which contributes to pollution in these areas. Also, we have asked them to prepare long-term plans for removal of waste dumped in these areas. The situation will be reviewed in two weeks,” said Sunita Narain, member EPCA.After a month in which Delhi saw its cleanest air in five years, air pollution has gone up in Delhi over the past few weeks. With little possibility of more rainfall this month, the air quality may deteriorate further by the end of this month, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have said. Air pollution in Delhi usually peak in winters.In Delhi, 13 areas —Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri—were identified as hot spots by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and DPCC last year since pollution levels, specially particulate matter (PM) concentrations, in these areas were higher than the city’s average.In an action taken report prepared by the EPCA based on inspection of 15 locations, including the hot spots and surrounding areas, the anti-pollution watchdog found that dumping of garbage/construction and demolition waste/industrial waste, road dust as well as traffic congestion are major contributors to high pollution levels in these areas.EPCA inspected several locations, mostly having confirmed and non-confirmed industrial pockets, during August-September. They include Dwarka, Okhla Phase II, Wazirpur, Mayapuri, Rohini, Gandhi Nagar, Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, Jhilmil industrial area, Mandoli, Vivek Vihar, Mundka-Tikri, Punjabi Bagh, Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Urban Extension Road-Narela and Narela industrial area. “In most industrial areas, plastic, rubber and cloth waste was found dumped and burning in some places. More material was found stacked for burning. We have asked concerned agencies to file an action taken report in the matter before the next review meeting. Also, to prevent dumping of waste on vacant plots, we have asked the agencies to convert them into green patches like parks and put up boards to display ownership. The DPCC has also been told to use Google maps to identify locations of such vacant plots,” said Bhure Lal, chairperson, EPCA.Lal said burning of plastic and rubber waste produce fumes containing carcinogenic elements. “This leads to pollution and health hazards to those living around. The [municipal] corporations and the DPCC have been asked to improve waste management and not allow dumping at any cost. Also, use of unapproved fuels such as coal was observed in many areas and 16 such units have been sealed,” said Lal.Also, the report highlighted that at Punjabi Bagh crematorium, pollution was observed during the peak Covid period in April, after which two more CNG furnaces were set up there. “The municipal corporation has informed that they are installing air pollutants control devices for wooden pyres,” the report stated.A senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named, said that a plan is being prepared to curb emissions at all hot spots. “We are in process of meeting all agencies to clear the hot spots. The plan will be implemented soon,” the official said.A senior North corporation official, not wishing to be named, said waste is being lifted from all these areas. “At many places the dumps have been cleared and industrial associations have been asked to not let waste be dumped on roadsides or in vacant plots,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/epca-asks-agencies-to-jointly-patrol-industrial-areas-to-check-pollution/story-V1ebGD3wBQsrVHF5nM2fPL.html
23-09-2020||City||Gurugram: Protests over farm bills driven by vested interests, says JJP||Gurugram: The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) on Tuesday said that the two agriculture bills passed by the Parliament will not harm the farmers’ interests and that the protests are driven by “vested interests”. However, the party said that it would take strong steps if the MSP (minimum support price) system is tinkered with by the central government. Addressing a press conference in Gurugram on Tuesday, Anant Ram Tanwar, national vice-president of JJP, said their party is closely connected with farmers and based on the ideology of Chaudhary Devi Lal. “The interests of farmers will not be compromised and the MSP system for buying of grains is not being changed. The government itself has announced the rates for buying of crops. A large number of farmers have now come forward in support of these new rules, and the protests are being organised by some people with vested interests,” said Tanwar. The newly appointed JJP district president for Gurugram, Rishi Raj Rana, said that the party would reach out to farmers in south Haryana to make them aware of the matter. He further said that the work is on to strengthen the party rank and file and soon the district and rural executive bodies will be announced. The party also announced that blood donation camps across all districts of Haryana would be organised to mark the birth anniversary of farmer leader Chaudhary Devi Lal on September 25. Rana said that their party leader and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has already made it clear that any tinkering with MSP system will lead to strong steps from the party. “The party will reach out to farmers in south Haryana and Gurugram, and make them aware about the positives of these new laws. Also, we will strengthen the party organization in the district and announce district level organisation soon,” said Rana. Earlier in the day, Chautala said in Chandigarh that he has always been advocating for the interests of farmers and will continue to do so. By increasing the MSP of Rabi crops, the central government has proved that this system will continue even further, so farmers should not worry at all, he said. Chautala had said on Monday that he would quit his post in the BJP-led government in Haryana if any step was taken to eliminate the MSP system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-protests-over-farm-bills-driven-by-vested-interests-says-jjp/story-wa3MJcEgoAImkttdLcWC3N.html

23-09-2020||Delhi||EPCA writes to Punjab and Haryana to act against stubble burning||The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority on Tuesday wrote to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, asking the states to control cases of crop stubble burning, after early instances began appearing in satellite imagery. In his letter to the two primary stubble-burning states in the country, Epca chief Bhure Lal said crop residue burning had been spotted on satellite data recorded by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) and the United Nations’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). He said it was imperative that early action be taken to control these fires ahead of the winters to control the annual pollution spike in Delhi.Delhi government data shows that in 2019, stubble burning accounted for 44% of air pollution in the national capital. Citing the Safar and Nasa data , Lal said 42 fires Monday, shown as ‘red dots’ on the map, were seen around various districts of Punjab, while 20 cases were observed on Sunday. “EPCA has been monitoring progress with you on the implementation of the different measures in this past two months and has also worked out the clear benchmarks and targets that need to be achieved before the coming season. We would now request that these steps are taken with urgency,” Lal said in his letter. The letter added, “We recognise that we have lost time because of Covid-19, but given that the winter season is now fast approaching, we need to tackle this with urgency and ensure compliance.” The SC-appointed body also said that even though the impact of these early instances of burning is expected to be negligible on the air quality of Delhi at least in the next three days, because wind speeds are not currently supportive for transport and accumulation of smoke, the situation in Delhi will deteriorate in the coming weeks once the wind pattern changes. Lal also asked state governments to set up control rooms ahead of the harvest season that will start functioning in full-swing from mid-October, to ensure that harvest machines are available easily to farmers and enforcement is prompt against violations. Hindustan Times had reported on Tuesday that NASA had started observing early instances of crop residue burning is some districts of Punjab and Haryana. Recordings show that such instances had progressively been increasing from September 13, but had seen a spike over the last five days. The worst affected district was Amritsar in Punjab, followed by Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and parts of Kapurthala, Mansa and Jalandhar. Krunesh Garg, member secretary, Punjab Pollution Control Board, said the satellite imagery catches all kinds of fires, and said the images were not necessarily stubble burning. “It is too early panic. Our teams are tracking any signs of early burning, but what we have largely observed is that compared to previous years farmers are more aware and are spreading the message of among their own neighbourhoods of not burning stubble,” he said. Garg said monitoring teams will begin thorough monitoring from Wednesday to check for any violations. In Haryana, where the only two or three instances were observed in parts of Fatehabad and Ambala, officials said the government has zero-tolerance for stubble burning this year. “We have marked 38 villages that will be intensely monitored. Till now, we have not observed any instances of stubble burning on the ground. We are hoping that the cases will be less this year. We have see over the past few years that cases have progressively been reducing every year,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana Pollution Control Board. In Punjab last year, 9.8 million tonnes out of 20 million tonnes of paddy crop residue was burnt. As many as 50, 738 cases of stubble burning was recorded by the state pollution control board in 2019. In Haryana, on the other hand 1.24 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes of paddy crop residue was burnt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/epca-writes-to-punjab-and-haryana-to-act-against-stubble-burning/story-HMrcPnohVYc49vjBCteCUO.html

23-09-2020||Gurugram||30-year-old man found dead on railway tracks near Dhanwapur; cops suspect suicide||A 30-year-old man from Jhajjar was found dead on the railway tracks near Dhanwapur on Monday evening. The police said that a probe revealed that he had died by suicide. The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). The police said the deceased was found dead around 7pm by a team of government railway police (GRP). A blood-stained kitchen knife was found next to his body and he had injuries on his head and body. This led the police to initially suspect that he was killed and that his body was dumped at the tracks. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “A preliminary probe, however, suggests that he died by suicide after coming in front of a train that was passing through. He was suffering from a mental illness and was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Gurugram. According to his family members, on an earlier occasion too, he had gone missing from his house and had taken a knife along.” The police said no suicide note was recovered, adding that his body was handed over to the family after a post-mortem examination on Tuesday. “The family has not filed any complaint. Prima facie, foul play has been ruled out. We have filed an inquest report in the case,” said the police official, quoted above. Gurugram does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/30-year-old-man-found-dead-on-railway-tracks-near-dhanwapur-cops-suspect-suicide/story-MGiMcvE3nTok9UdzIrYRfJ.html

23-09-2020||City||As Covid-19 plays demon, Ravana to take a back seat this year||Dussehra celebrations are set to remain a subdued affair this year as the city takes on a battle of a different kind—the one against the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid fears of the infection spread, the famous Daresi Ground fair has been cancelled in view of the restrictions on large gatherings. Members of the Shri Ram Lila Committee, who organise this fair, said that although all rituals will be performed in keeping with the traditions, there would be no gatherings. There would only be small effigy of Ravana, instead of the 90-ft high effigies burnt every year. This year, the organisers have also decided to do away with the bursting of crackers. Apart from that, the ‘Singhasan Yatra’ of Lord Ram, which used to pass through different parts of the old city for 11 days before Dussehra, and the staging of Ramlila, has been suspended this year. Instead, they will be holding a Ramayana Path at Sita Mata Mandir in Daresi, but the entry restricted. Committee member Dinesh Marwaha said, “The Daresi fair is famous all over the country for being one of the biggest in North India. We used to hear stories about this from our fathers and grandfathers. This is for the first time in many years that it won’t be held. It was held even during the emergency era. But right now, the situation is different. We cannot put thousands of lives at stake by organising this fair.” Reminiscing on the effort that went into organising the fair, Marwaha said, “We used to build 90 to 95-ft tall Ravana effigy every year and effigy makers used to come from Agra and Meerut.” He went on to proudly recount how people from far and wide used to come just to see Ravana going up in flames. Kamal Bassi and Sukhram Mahajan, other members of the committee, said, “The preparations for this fair used to commence three months ahead of Dussehra and thousands of people used to come to see the fair every day. But this time, we would miss the pomp and show.” Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said,”Restrictions have been imposed on gathering due to the ongoing pandemic. Till now, we have not received any directions from the state government regarding granting permissions for Dussehra events. The state government will review the situation on September 30 and final decision has to be taken by the state government only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-19-plays-demon-ravana-takes-a-back-seat-this-year/story-riYkMmk16cwL9M4OucFAnI.html

The number of injured has risen to 25.The owner of the 36-year-old Jilani building, Sayyed Ahmed Jilani, who was booked for culpable homicide and negligence causing hurt, is still absconding. After carrying out rescue operations manually for more than 30 hours, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and other teams used machinery around 12.30pm on Tuesday, from both sides of the site, to clear huge portions of debris on the first floor of the ground-plus-three storey structure. The building had 48 flats, of which 24 collapsed. “According to families and relatives of the victims, around 12 people are still trapped in the rubble, while 26 have died so far. Rescue operations will continue till all bodies are recovered,” said Pankaj Ashiya, commissioner, Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC). NDRF, along with Thane Disaster Response Force (TDRF) personnel, managed to rescue nine people who were trapped under the debris since Monday 3.30am. The rescue team had to raze a nearby chawl structure, which was vacated by the municipal corporation, for search operations. A team of 100 plus people has been conducting rescue operations at the spot. “We had to hold up [collapsed] slabs with the help of bamboos on Monday, so that we could rescue those trapped on the second floor. Clearing the slab with machinery was necessary to reach the first and ground floors, which have more people trapped. After clearing labs, manual searching was again initiated in the evening,” said Ashish Kumar, deputy commandant, NDRF. State help and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar inspected the spot on Tuesday morning. He assured a compensation of ₹4 lakh to the victim’s families and ₹50,000 for those injured in the incident. “We will take action against those found negligent and caused the incident.

23-09-2020||City||Nandgram residents protest razing houses for government institute||Residents from Nandgram, where the Ghaziabad municipal corporation had launched a demolition drive last week, staged a protest outside the corporation’s headquarters on Tuesday.The corporation officials said that the land from where the encroachments were removed last week was government land and was earmarked for Uttar Pradesh ’s first political training institute. They added that they will continue with demolition drives which will start from next week.The protesters on Tuesday first staged a sit-in outside the corporation headquarters at Navyug Market and later tried to enter the premises, but were prevented from doing so. In the evening, municipal commissioner MS Tanwarmet met a delegation of 15 protestors and asked them to vacate the land.“The land belongs to the government and it has to be freed up from encroachment for developing the project. So, we will resume the drive again within a week. The occupants were duped by middlemen who sold them the land. In the next phase, we will crackdown on such persons and also issue recovery certificates and seize their properties,” he said. “In the meantime, we have offered help to the occupants. We have told them that we can offer them temporary accommodation at our facilities, and they also have an option to apply for government schemes to get houses. We have also offered them help with transportation, in case, they wish to relocate elsewhere. However, due to large-scale encroachment, the cost of the project has increased by about Rs 17 crore. So, we need to start construction and encroachments will be removed,” he added.Officials said they had been able to remove 20 out of 100 “illegally” built structures.The proposed institute is meant to train politicians and activists in public policy and other advanced political subjects, and is planned to come up on land owned by the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. Located near the Hindon Elevated Road, it measures a little over 3 hectares, but about 1.37 hectares was encroached with people constructing houses and boundary walls. The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet had cleared the proposal in 2018 and the project is estimated to cost about ₹168 crore.“We are trying to get the corporation to not proceed with further demolition, but the officials are not ready to listen. Many people purchased land and also got it registered. But the corporation officials said that we got duped by middlemen. It is only poor people like us who are at the losing end. The officials must nab people who sold the land to the occupants and make alternate arrangements for us,” said Somvir Singh, one of the protesters, said.Maya Devi, local councilor from ward number six also objected to Saturday’s demolition drive and said that action must be taken up against the people who sold the land to poor people. “ Poor people have been duped as they invested hard-earned money to buy land. The middlemen who sold them government land have run away. So, there has to be action against them,” she added. “Occupants should have been given time for making alternate arrangements before the demolition,” she added.Corporation officials maintained that before starting the demolition drive they had been pursuing occupants for past one-and-a-half years to vacate the land, but they were not ready to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nandgram-residents-protest-razing-houses-for-government-institute/story-TejFlWwAprMvPKF7zfPM8O.html

23-09-2020||City||Ghaziabad to take legal action those who violate home isolation norms||To ensure Covid-19 patients recuperating in home isolation strictly follow all protocols, the district administration officials on Tuesday said they will take legal action against those patients who violate home isolation norms apart from shifting such patients to Covid care facilities.“Since the numbers of those opting for home isolation is increasing, we have decided that anyone who violates the norms may be shifted to Covid facility. Apart from this, the erring person may also face legal action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. So, all those under home isolation should strictly follow social distancing protocols and the isolation norms laid down by the state government,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Officials of the Ghaziabad health department said it has already issued warnings to 31 erring patients so far.According to state Covid portal figures records on Tuesday, till 4pm, of the 3,339 Covid-19 patients who had opted for home isolation so far,773 are active patients. The Uttar Pradesh had allowed home isolation for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients on July 20, following some conditions.The health status of those under home isolation is monitored daily by teams stationed at integrated command and control centre. Members of mohalla nigrani samiti apart from the patients’ neighbours have also been asked to keep an eye on those under home isolation.About the warnings issued to patients who had allegedly flouted the home isolation norms, chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, said, “ In some cases, the erring patients often tried to move out in their locality which could have led to the infection’s spread. In some cases, they did not provide the reports, that need to be submitted twice daily, of their oxygen levels and temperatures to the teams stationed at the control room. From now on, such patients may be shifted to Covid facility and may also face legal consequences.” As per norms, the home isolation is allowed for patients who are asymptomatic and those having very mild symptoms. The conditions to be fulfilled for home isolation include an undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home, and a separate isolation room. Patients also have to purchase medical kits equipped with a pulse oximeter, a thermometer, masks and gloves, among others. Before allowing home isolation, rapid response teams arrive for physical inspection at the house of the patient and he/she is also required to sign an undertaking in which they give consent to follow health protocols and adhere to all norms.Recently, the administration had also increased the number of teams stationed at the control room for better monitoring of those under home isolation.“We have also asked our teams to carefully monitor patients aged over 55 years and those with co-morbidities, and shift them to Covid care facilities if they develop any complication. Of the overall cases in home isolation, we had to refer about 190 patients to L1 (for mild cases), L2(for moderate cases) and L3( for severe cases) category Covid hospitals, when their condition deteriorated,” Dr Gupta added.As per norms, the patients in home isolation are required to stay at home for 10 days after which they are marked as “recovered”, and are then required to be under home quarantine for seven days.Of the 3,339 persons who had opted for home isolation, those between the age group of 21-40 years formed the highest share at 51.36%. The second highest share is constituted by the 41-60 age group at 31.96%, while those between 11-20 years comprise 8.39% of total patients in home isolation. Those above 60 years of age form a share of 4.79%, while children till 10 years of age make up for 3.5% home isolation cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-to-take-legal-action-those-who-violate-home-isolation-norms/story-QMqpj65lCDFzWp0Bvj9dOP.html
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh dentist booked for cheating Kenyan woman||A Chandigarh-based dentist has been booked for allegedly cheating a Kenyan woman by providing her ‘substandard’ dental implants. Enid Nayabundi, 52, of Nairobi has accused Dr Mohit Dhawan of Avance Dental Care at Sector 21 of cheating her when she came to India for dental implants between December 12 and 15, 2017, and again from May 14 to 27, 2018. She alleged that Dr Dhawan told her that she would get soft dentures, but will have to wait for the second part of the procedure. By the time of her departure, she was told that her implants were not ready yet and they would be delivered to her in a few days. Enid finally received a set of dentures via courier on March 14, 2018, but found them to be of ‘poor quality’ which would not even fit on her gums. She said during her second visit, she had to wait for long before her crowns were installed at the last minute and as she was due to leave for the airport, the job was done in a hurried manner. On July 7, 2018, she said she visited her dentist in Nairobi for assessment, who detected some faults in the work done. Acting on her complaint, police registered a case under sections 419 and 420 of IPC against Dr Dhawan. The dentist, meanwhile, has denied the allegations and claimed that he was being falsely implicated. “Sinister attempts to tarnish the persona and reputation are being made with not an iota of evidence,” he claimed, adding that “senior IPS officers, police and administrative authorities were pursuing a vendetta against him”. He said the patient was not in India on the days she claimed that she had visited the country to get implants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-dentist-booked-for-cheating-kenyan-woman/story-GhbjZPQuqbwxp7GJn6orUO.html

The recovery rate in the state has improved to 75.36%.A senior health department official said that recoveries were not being reported regularly on the portal, therefore, there was a lag for a few days. “Last week, the department has directed districts to pull up their socks and report recoveries regularly.

Our target is to cross and maintain 80% recovery rate,” the official said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will participate in the high-level virtual meeting convened by prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday to review the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in the seven worst-affected states in the country.Maharashtra accounts for 22.34% of the country’s total confirmed cases and 37.56% of the overall fatalities recorded in the country. Senior bureaucrats said that the chief minister is expected to raise the issue of discontinued support of the Centre. “From September 1, as it had intimated, the Centre has stopped providing PPE kits, N95 masks, ventilators, testing kits.

23-09-2020||Lucknow||Film City to come up over 1,000 acres in Greater Noida, Adityanath shares blueprint with filmmakers||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath Tuesday shared the blueprint for the proposed film city -- to come up on 1,00 acres along the Yamuna Expressway -- with filmmakers and said the city, once ready, would have ”great connectivity” and boast of a dedicated “infotainment zone”. After a presentation by Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) CEO Arunvir Singh, the chief minister told filmmakers that the film city would have ”great rail, road and air connectivity”. “The site is close to Agra, the city of Taj Mahal;Mathura, the birthplace of Krishna; the proposed logistic hub in Noida; and the proposed dry port and freight corridor, thus providing all facilities of transport and movement,” Adityanath said.Filmmakers Vijayendra Prasad, Ashoke Pandit, Vinod Bachchan, actor Manoj Joshi, art director Nitin Desai, and singers Udit Narayan, Anup Jalota and Kailash Kher sat through the presentation.Producer Saundarya Rajnikant, actor Anupam Kher, filmmaker Atul Agnihotri, chairman of National School of Drama Paresh Rawal, lyricist Manoj Muntasir and actor Satish Kaushik interacted with the CM virtually.According to the presentation, the film city would come up in Sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway and, of the total 1,000 acres, 220 acres would be reserved for commercial activity. Adityanath said the Jewar international airport, which is coming up about 6km from the film city site, would be functional by 2023 and the region would also boast of an international electronics city and a global financial hub in the coming years. Adityanath said his government was aware of the present trend of OTT (over the top) and media streaming platforms. “That is why we intend to provide a high capacity, world class data centre along with all pre-production and post-production infrastructure, processing labs, VFX and digital studios of international level in this zone,” he said. “We have locations, we have cultural diversity, we have the manpower and now we will also have a film city with state-of-the-art facilities,” the chief minister said. Officials later disclosed that ace art director Nitin Desai has offered his expertise in setting up the film city. Sandeep Singh of Vistas Media, a Singapore-based Company, has offered to set up a film academy with an initial investment of $10 million, officials said. Pandit said, “One should look beyond Hindi films and even multilingual films can be made here. After all, the Bhojpuri films are already made here (in UP).”“About 80% technicians and workforce in Mumbai film industry is from Uttar Pradesh and, hence, the availability of manpower will never be a problem for the film city,” Desai said. Although there is no official deadline as yet, UP Film Development Council chairman Raju Srivastava hoped that the project could be ready by 2023. “Desai will submit a development proposal in the next 15 days. We will let them know other details of the allotment, paving way for setting up of film studios, artificial villages and other facilities required in the film city. This city will have a film institute, music academies and world-class facilities,” Yeida CEO Singh said.The state government zeroed in on the Yamuna Expressway location as Noida and Greater Noida did not have the required land for such a big project, officials said. “We evaluated proposals of Noida and Greater Noida authorities on this. But the two cities do not have adequate land and the Yamuna Expressway has the required land,” said Alok Tandon UP infrastructure and industrial development commissioner. “The sector 21 is surrounded by sector 20, 34 and 28 located just next to the airport site. This area will become the most happening spot in the time to come in terms of art and film activities,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/film-city-to-come-up-over-1-000-acres-in-greater-noida-adityanath-shares-blueprint-with-filmmakers/story-5dBZJ05j99awVeFTnpql3O.html

We then asked people on the first floor to vacate, but they wanted to wait till morning or collect their belongings. We went downstairs and in minutes, the structure came crashing down.” ‘Had one litre of water with me when I was stuck under the debris’Khalid Khan, 42, who joined the rescue operations on Tuesday, a day after she was rescued from under the debris said, “I had one litre of water with me when I was stuck under the debris. I sipped water, and was hopeful to survive. When I heard the sound of the rescue team, I was sure of getting out alive. They asked me to stay calm and not worry, and within minutes I was pulled out,” he added.

23-09-2020||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar receives income tax notice, Supriya Sule likely next||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has received a notice from the income tax (I-T) department over declaration of his assets in the election affidavits filed in more than a decade. His daughter and Baramati Member of Parliament (MP) Supriya Sule is also likely to receive a similar notice soon. Pawar took a jibe at the Centre, saying it reflected a “feeling of love” for him, and also pointed out that the chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and his son and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray have received similar notices.“I received a notice from the income tax department yesterday. It was sent on the directives of the Election Commission of India (ECI). They have sought information and clarification related to the details on assets shared by me in election affidavits filed in 2020, 2014 and 2009-10. I heard that Supriya [Sule] is also likely to get a similar notice soon. I will have to immediately respond to the notice as it also warned of things like raids,” Pawar told reporters.“They have chosen us from so many other members [Members of Parliament]. I’m happy they have a feeling of love for us. I have read somewhere that similar notices have been served to the chief minister [Uddhav Thackeray] and his son [Aaditya Thackeray],” the 79-year old leader said in response to a question on being targeted as an ally of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Other NCP leaders believe that MVA leadership is being targeted for obvious reasons. “On one hand, notices have been served to Pawar saheb and his daughter, and on the other, CM Thackeray and his son have been served notices. The intention is very clear that the Central government is trying to scare us. So far, they have been randomly choosing members for serving notices. In this case, we are specifically targeted. Surprisingly, no leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was sent a notice,” said a senior NCP leader, on condition of anonymity.Last year, Pawar was booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case in connection with an alleged scam of Rs 25,000 crore in Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank – the apex body for all district central cooperative (DCC) banks in the state.Pawar had declared a visit to the ED office which was cancelled on the request of the Mumbai Police as party workers from across the state started coming to the city to support their leader.ED had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), equivalent to a first information report (FIR) filed by police, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-receives-income-tax-notice-supriya-sule-likely-next/story-JdQd2Rmq71wWIjs9pGu4wN.html
23-09-2020||Pune||Of 17K suspected cases found across Pune dist, over 2K are Covid positive||Out of the 17,196 people found suspected during the ongoing “My family, My responsibility” campaign in the district, 2006 were detected Covid-19 positive. The survey is part of the campaign launched by the state government to detect cases. The campaign will be testing each individual for Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) symptoms and also screen comorbid people. It will keep a check on them so that early treatment can be initiated if need be, according to district officials. The survey conducted by Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations (PCMC) and zilla parishad (ZP) for Pune district aims to screen every individual for various symptoms through oral questioning and diagnosis for temperature and oxygen levels. The district’s population is over 1 crore and till date close to 20.22 lakh people have been screened. Out of over 20 lakh people, about 17,196 were found to be suspected and tested for Covid infection, and close to 2006 were found Covid positive. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “We started the survey in rural areas and all gram panchayats have been screened once. We have a thorough data on comorbid conditions of each individual. Till date, over 6.26 lakh have been screened in Pune city, 1.26 in Pimpri-Chinchwad and over 12.70 lakh in Pune rural.” The sero survey which was to be launched by the district administration for Pune city and PCMC areas is yet to begin, said divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. He said, “I have just got a detailed proposal from Sassoon hospital which will be initiating the survey which will also be conducted by the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana. In a few days we will process the proposal.” The sero survey will determine the exact spread of the virus and how many were infected at any given point of time and have recovered on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/out-of-17k-suspected-cases-found-across-pune-dist-over-2k-are-covid-positives/story-Z3VjmToZkxJvrBoTBtR1pI.html

Subject-wise, each paper will have 60 questions for the exam. We will conduct mock tests before the real exams happen. Soon, the detailed exam time-table will be declared,” said SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar. Optical mark recognition (OMR) scans paper forms to detect darkened marks at pre-determined positions.Of a total of two lakh students appearing for the final-year exams across three districts, 85 per cent chose the online option to appear for papers. They will give the exams in an “offline mode” for which the SPPU has identified 50 centres where the examination will be held. As per instructions issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the SPPU must finish the final-year exams before October 31. On Wednesday, a group of students raised the issue of the duration of the papers – currently, an hour for the 60 multiple choice question papers. Kamlakar Shete, a final-year student said, “An hour is very little and it should be increased to an-hour-and-a-half. As most students are giving the exams online, there might be various issues, like technical problems, or students not understanding the system. So, time may be consumed. Hence, the exam duration should be increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sppu-final-year-exams-optical-mark-recognition-method-to-be-used-to-grade-online-papers-in-trial-run/story-5Dxaq1546vDMQqoMiT2seN.html

23-09-2020||Pune||Marathi actress Ashalata Wabgaonkar passes away at 79 after contracting Covid on sets of TV serial||Prominent Marathi film and theatre actor Ashalata Wabgaonkar, 79, passed away at Satara hospital on Tuesday. Her crew members claim that she died of Covid after contracting the virus during the shooting of Marathi television show “Aai Mazi Kalubai”. Her death has raised questions within film and theatre fraternity over whether to allow senior citizens to shoot for films, web series and television. According to Alka Kubal Athalye, an actress and producer of “Aai Mazi Kalubai”, around 22 crew members, including Wabgaonkar, had tested positive for Covid. Initially, the Satara village where the shoot was taking place, did not allow the production crew though after promise of to all the precautions, they were allowed. “Around 22 crew members, including Ashalata, had tested positive for Covid in Satara on September 16. Ashalata was admitted to Pratibha hospital in Satara and was put on ventilator support as her oxygen levels were low. The other crew members are stable and later underwent tests at Sassoon General Hospital in Pune,” Athalye said.As per a press statement, her last rites will be performed at Satara. She is survived by her son. A PTI report quoted a senior doctor from the hospital as saying, “Her condition worsened on Monday evening and she was put on ventilator support. She breathed her last today morning.”Dr Sanjay Sathe, intensive care unit head of Prathibha hospital, said, “ She was admitted for five days and was on ventilator. She was in the Covid special section, ICU on ventilator, but she did not respond as she was severely affected by coronavirus. She passed away around 4.30 am on Tuesday.”“For the past one month, Ashalata was shooting for a serial in which she was playing the lead role. She had undergone Covid test in Mumbai prior to joining us here (Satara) for the shoot.” Meghraj Rajebhosale, president, Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal, said, “It is very sad and tragic that we lost a senior actor while on an outdoor shoot. I feel that senior actors should avoid being part of shoots during this pandemic.” According to Rajebhosale, members of Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) had approached the court, which allowed senior citizens to participate in shooting. Sushma Shiromanee, general secretary, Film Makers Combined, and ex-president IMPPA said, “Even as shooting during this pandemic poses virus risk, senior actors also need financial stability when others are allowed to work. As long as everyone is following the rules laid by the court and the government, there should not be any problem in working.” Athalye said that a doctor always accompanied the crew at the shooting set in Satara. “Apart from a doctor and Covid inspector at the set, we santitised the set three times a day. Ashatai’s health took turn for the worst four days ago and I have always been by her side. Her oxygen levels dropped because of her advanced age. She was like a mother to me and we have been working together for 35 years. This disease is very unpredictable,” said Athalye. Ashalata was popular in theatre for Konkani and Marathi plays and has acted in more than 100 plays. She began her career with Sangeet Natak (musical) Matsyagandha, while her debut in Hindi film was with Basu Chatterjee’s Apne Paraye (1980), for which she was nominated for a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress. “Umbartha, Sutradhar, Navari Mile Navryala, Vahinichi Maya” were some of her hit Marathi films. She has also written a book on music called “Gard Sabhovati”. She had trained in singing under Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki.With Agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/marathi-actress-ashalata-wabgaonkar-passes-away-at-79-after-contracting-covid-on-sets-of-tv-serial/story-zIlG4TUdLHCEmJmOFSwsgL.html

Bhagwan Ramchandra Nikam had been undergoing treatment since September 12 when he tested positive. He was working at the special branch of Pune police and stayed with his family at Vishrantwadi police lines, according to the police. Nikam is the fifth personnel of Pune police to have died of coronavirus infection. “He was also diabetic,” said Mitesh Ghatte, deputy commissioner of police, special branch and headquarters, Pune police. The other Pune police staff who had died of Covid-19 are Vinod Potdar (51), Suresh Dalvi (56), Dilip Londhe (57) and Deepak Sawant (42). “The government grants Rs 50 lakh and Rs 10 lakh from the Police Director General’s (DG) office along with the gratuity to the personnel who died of Covid infection.

23-09-2020||World||Covid vaccine to be widely available by April, says CDC chief||Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told senators that he didn’t mean to imply last week that it could take into the second half of next year for enough Covid-19 vaccine to be available to inoculate all Americans.Redfield said at a Senate health committee hearing Wednesday that about 700 million vaccine doses should be available by April, echoing a timeline laid out by Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, last week.The vaccine candidates that are furthest along in development will require a two-dose regimen. Redfield’s comments last week, in an appearance before a different Senate panel, were “alluding to how long I thought it would take to get those doses into the American public,” he said. It could take through July to disburse the vaccine to all Americans that want one, Redfield said.President Donald Trump said last week that he had called Redfield after his earlier testimony to tell him his comments weren’t correct.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed Wednesday with the timeline of 700 million doses by April.Political QuestionsThe heads of U.S. health agencies attempted during the hearing Wednesday to reassure the public that staff are making decisions, particularly surrounding a vaccine, based on science, not politics. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn committed to taking any inoculation his agency authorizes.“FDA will not authorize or approve a vaccine that we would not feel comfortable giving to our families,” Hahn said.The agency plans to “provide additional information so that it is clear what we expect” from vaccine manufacturers that apply for emergency authorization of a shot, Hahn said. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s biologics office that oversees vaccines, said Sept. 10 that the agency would put out guidelines for vaccine makers that will set a higher bar for emergency authorization.Redfield said that CDC data indicates 90% of Americans are still susceptible to the virus.Health officials also said they were dismayed at studies showing that “a disturbing number” of people who recover from Covid-19 experience inflammation in their heart muscles, Fauci said. The inflammation is “really quite puzzling,” Fauci told lawmakers, and it remains to be seen whether it will subside or whether those who have had the virus could suffer from cardiovascular issues later on.“These are the kinds of things that tell us we must be humble,” Fauci said, “that we do not completely understand the nature of the virus.”Childhood CasesIn another area of concern, hospitalization rates among children with Covid-19 increased during the summer, according to CDC’s prepared remarks for the hearing.“Though the mortality rate is low for children aged 18 years and younger, Covid-19–associated hospitalization rates increased among this age group during the summer,” according to the testimony.The CDC has previously reported that from March 1 through July 25, 1 in 3 children admitted to a hospital for Covid-19 ended up in an intensive-care unit. The number of pediatric hospitalizations is still small compared with adults, but the data do highlight that kids aren’t immune to the virus -- as President Donald Trump has claimed -- and can suffer serious illness.The percentage of all hospitalizations for Covid-19 that involve children rose from 0.8% May 21 to 1.7%, totaling 5,016, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on Sept. 17. Children represented 10.3% of the more than 5.7 million Covid-19 cases in the U.S., the academy said. When the coronavirus pandemic began earlier this year, the CDC originally said children represented 2% of Covid-19 cases.Redfield didn’t immediately expand on the prepared remarks, but a CDC report shows that weekly hospitalizations for all ages related to Covid-19 hit a second peak the week ending July 18. Weekly adult hospitalizations fell between the weeks ending Aug. 1 and Sept. 12, while the rates among children remained steady during that time period, the CDC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-to-be-widely-available-by-april-says-cdc-chief/story-BbBjplJBJPVS0PswmNXwKN.html

23-09-2020||World||Pak oppn divided over army dictating policy on Gilgit Baltistan||Cracks have emerged in Pakistan’s newly formed opposition alliance over Gilgit Baltistan, with PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif saying the issue of giving provincial status to the disputed region should have been discussed in parliament and not at the GHQ, the military headquarters. “They (leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement) were called (to the GHQ) on the issue of Gilgit Baltistan. This is a political issue that should be settled by the people's representatives.... These issues should be decided in the parliament, not in the GHQ,” she told media on Wednesday.Her comments came a day after Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence director general Lt Gen Faiz Hameed discussed the prospects of giving GB the status of a province in a meeting with the opposition alliance leaders. Leader of the opposition in parliament Shehbaz Sharif, who is Maryam Nawaz’s uncle, along with his party colleagues Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal, attended the meeting on behalf of the PML-N while the PPP was represented by party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and senator Sherry Rehman.She also pointed out that no representative of her father, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, met the army chief. This statement is seen as an attack on Shahbaz Sharif, who is also the president of the PML-N party. Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the meeting with the military leadership ahead of the opposition parties’ all parties conference but made no further comments. Reacting to Maryam Nawaz’s statement, railways minister Sheikh Rasheed said that the PML-N leadership held two, not one, meetings in the last two months with the military leadership, adding a rift had emerged between Maryam Nawaz and Shahbaz Sharif over the leadership of the PML-N party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-divided-over-army-dictating-policy-on-gilgit-baltistan/story-4aHlJAy9CMJUpkmX0OEG5O.html
23-09-2020||World||Pakistan to hold assembly elections in disputed Gilgit Baltistan on Nov 15||After moving ahead with plans to create a province in disputed Gilgit Baltistan (GB) despite India’s strong protests, Pakistan is planning to hold general elections for its legislative assembly on November 15, local media reported on Wednesday.New Delhi considers GB a part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and has consistently opposed changes made in the disputed region by Islamabad.A summary regarding the assembly election has been approved by President Arif Alvi and sent to Prime Minister Imran Khan for the final go-ahead, reports said. Analysts have said that once the elections are held, the government will move towards making GB a full province. The election date was announced after a meeting on Tuesday between opposition parliamentary leaders and the army high command, in which Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence director general Lt Gen Faiz Hameed discussed the prospects of giving GB the status of a province. Leader of the opposition in parliament Shehbaz Sharif, along with his party colleagues Khawaja Asif and Ahsan Iqbal, attended the meeting on behalf of the PML-N while the PPP was represented by party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and senator Sherry Rehman. With all stakeholders on board, the process to make GB a full province within the Pakistan federation has been started, said an observer. Earlier this month, the minister for Kashmir and GB affairs, Ali Amin Gandapur had announced that the government had decided in principle to elevate GB to the status of a full-fledged province with all constitutional rights, including representation in parliament. He told a delegation of visiting journalists from GB at a meeting in Islamabad that Khan would visit the region and make a formal announcement in this regard. Gandapur had also clarified that after the grant of constitutional rights, the subsidy and tax exemption on wheat given to the region would not be withdrawn. New Delhi had conveyed to Pakistan several times that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession. In May, the external affairs ministry said Pakistan or its judiciary had no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it and rejected attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. “Instead, Pakistan should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” the ministry had said.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-assembly-elections-in-disputed-gilgit-baltistan-on-nov-15/story-WNJJ3YiClYMNcKxCnjx1eL.html
23-09-2020||World||Russia’s Navalny released from German hospital after 32 days||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been released from a Berlin hospital after more than a month’s treatment for poisoning, with doctors now believing that a “complete recovery” from the Soviet-era nerve agent is possible for him, the hospital said Wednesday.Navalny spent 32 days at Berlin’s Charite hospital, 24 of them in intensive care, before doctors deemed his “condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged from acute inpatient care.”As he was released Tuesday, the 44-year-old displayed his characteristic sarcastic sense of humor. In an Instagram post, he took swipe at Russian President Vladimir Putin, scoffing at reported comments by the Russian leader suggesting that Navalny might have intentionally poisoned himself.Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is Putin’s most visible opponent, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. He spent those two days in a coma in a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk, where Russian doctors said they found no trace of any poisoning.German chemical weapons experts have determined that he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.The hospital said based on Navalny’s progress, physicians believe that a “complete recovery is possible,” but added it ”remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.”In recent days, Navalny has been posting regular photos of his convalescence from the hospital on Instagram, first showing him sitting up in his bed surrounded by his family, then up and about in the building.In his post Tuesday night, he laughed off a report in the French newspaper Le Monde saying that Putin suggested to French President Emmanuel Macron in a call that he “could have taken the poison himself.”“Good theory, I believe it deserves the most careful attention,” Navalny wrote in Russian. “Cooked Novichok in the kitchen. Took a sip from a flask on the plane. Fell into a coma.”He wryly wrote that the “ultimate aim of my cunning plan” must have been to die in Siberia, where the cause of death would be “lived long enough.”“But Putin outmaneuvered me. You can’t fool him,” Navalny wrote. “As a result, I lay in coma for 18 days like a fool, but didn’t get my way. The provocation failed!”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said the report about Putin’s conversation with Macron was “inaccurate in its reported wording,” but refused to elaborate as to which part was inaccurate. Macron’s office refused to comment on the report.The nerve agent used in the attack was the same class of Soviet-era poison that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the poisoning attempted murder and she and other world leaders have demanded that Russia fully investigate the case.Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote. Members of his team accused the Kremlin of involvement in the poisoning, charges that Russian officials have vehemently denied.Russia has bristled at the demands for an investigation, saying that Germany needs to share medical data in the case or compare notes with Russian doctors.Germany has noted that Navalny was in Russian treatment for 48 hours and that Russia has its own samples from Navalny. Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow needs data from Germany “to compare” tests results.Germany has also enlisted the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for technical assistance in the case. The agency has collected independent samples from Navalny for testing but results have not yet been announced.The Charite statement was released in consultation with Navalny and his wife, and the hospital would not comment further on any outpatient care for him.Navalny’s team has said he eventually plans to return to Russia, but had no immediate statement after his release from the hospital.Peskov said Wednesday that Navalny, “as any other Russian citizen,” is free to come back to Russia “at any moment.” He reiterated that what happened to the him remains “a big question” for the Kremlin, as Russian investigators “don’t have any facts pointing to” poisonous substances in Navalny’s body.Peskov once again called for Germany, France and Sweden to share their data with Moscow.“We’re still expecting it and are convinced that it can help us make significant progress in this case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-navalny-released-from-german-hospital-after-32-days/story-eZbsjbKRpNUlJiIdlcyP9N.html

23-09-2020||World||Pakistan’s 39-yr-old NSA a key player in army’s Gilgit move that suits China||Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa has fronted Pakistan’s exercise to create a province in disputed Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the occupied Northern Areas, holding a quiet meeting with the country’s politicians on the topic before a minister went public with Islamabad’s plans last week. But the army, people familiar with the matter said, isn’t driving the creation of the fifth province alone.A 39-year-old has also been hard at work. Moeed W Yusuf.Yusuf, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on National Security Division and Strategic Planning, has been a principal player in Islamabad’s decision to revoke the notional autonomy granted to Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and incorporate the disputed region as one of Pakistan’s five provinces, Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said, describing Pakistan’s young National Security Adviser as one of the project’s key driving forces.Gilgit-Baltistan’s assimilation into the Islamic Republic works well with China that has poured billions of dollars - even if much of it is a loan - into the China Pakistan Economic Corridor to build an alternative supply route to the choked, and vulnerable Malacca Strait, the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The army has scaled up its presence in the GB region over the years to secure the CPEC that has faced some opposition from locals over concerns that it destroys the environment, culture and social fabric without much benefit to the people.The effort to change Gilgit-Baltistan’s disputed status also fits in well with Moeed Yusuf’s long-standing project to turn the Line of Control with India into an International Border. Back in 2009 when he was still an academic and building his ties to the establishment in Pakistan and the United States, Moeed Yusuf had advocated converting the LoC into the IB, with both sides maintaining sovereign control over the respective parts of Jammu and Kashmir.A Pakistan watcher said Moeed Yusuf explored the possibility of formalising the LoC as the border between the two countries nearly a decade later when he visited New Delhi in 2018. “By then, he had entrenched himself in the establishment in Washington via the US Institute of Peace and worked closely with the Pakistan Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence.,” he said.Yusuf had cultivated an image of being an advocate of Indo-Pak peace and resolution of the Kashmir issue at USIP. He did run into a bit of a controversy at USIP months before Imran Khan picked him as his special adviser in December 2019 when objections were raised about the public-funded institution becoming a venue of choice for hosting Pakistani officials at events reserved for select invitees. One South Asia expert Dr Christine Fair also alleged that Yusuf had been sharing sensitive information with Pakistani agencies using his position and access within the USIP.Moeed Yusuf is said to have continued to speak about his ideas on Indo-Pak relations after he joined Imran Khan’s team as well and plugged the agenda with General Bajwa and other top military officers.In his new role in Imran Khan’s team, his understanding and familiarity with the American system helped to position him as the main strategic thinker for the Pakistani leadership, particularly on dealing with the US Administration, Congress, bureaucracy and the think-tanks.Not much is known about his views on Pakistan’s support of terrorism to achieve political and diplomatic ends, particularly in Kashmir. Indian counter-terror officials said they had not heard of any instance where Moeed Yusuf had spoken of ending the establishment’s support to terrorists operating in India.“What we do know is that he did come up with the idea that Pakistan should not seek mediation on Kashmir over concerns that Islamabad could be placed in an awkward position if the US came up with a unilateral proposal, akin to Donald Trump’s Middle East Plan,” a senior Indian official said. This idea, however, did not find any support within the military and the foreign office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-39-yr-old-nsa-a-key-player-in-army-s-gilgit-move-that-suits-china/story-HWCRNNF2r0cYWFlY1T3KoL.html
23-09-2020||World||Trump administration’s ambassadorial nominee calls on Pakistan to act against terror||The Trump administration’s nominee for ambassador to Pakistan has said that Islamabad must take “sustained and irreversible” action against terrorism. In a statement to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Tuesday as part of his confirmation process, William E Todd said he will actively engage Pakistan on terrorism, strategic stability and non-proliferation if he is confirmed. “To truly reduce regional tensions, and rebuild a strong relationship with the United States, Pakistan must take sustained and irreversible action against terrorism. Pakistan has suffered terribly itself at the hands of terrorists and has committed publicly to ensure terrorists cannot use Pakistani territory to operate,” he said in his statement. He added, “Pakistan has taken important steps toward fulfilling that commitment but needs to continue that work. If confirmed, I will work with Pakistan to advance our shared interest in eliminating terrorism from its territory and advancing security in the region.” Also Read: Pakistan Hindu Council chief discusses Jodhpur deaths with foreign minister QureshiTodd referred to what he described as “regional dynamics” and said “although we have a strong relationship with India, that does not need to come at the expense of Pakistan”. He added, “I believe that under the right conditions, we can have a strong relationship with both countries. Our hope is that both countries will take the necessary steps to reduce tensions, and as President [Donald] Trump has offered, we are prepared to facilitate dialogue if both sides request it.”India has accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, especially in Kashmir. It has also repeatedly spurned all efforts by Trump to mediate between the two countries, saying differences with Pakistan are a bilateral matter. In his statement, Todd described the US-Pakistan ties as “a longstanding and important, but always complicated and sometimes contentious relationship”. He said: “We certainly have our differences, but Pakistan is an essential regional partner, and this is an opportune moment in our relationship to work together on shared goals. Peace in Afghanistan is in both our countries’ best interests, and effective US-Pakistani cooperation is essential to achieve that objective.”He recalled secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s remarks during a visit to Islamabad in 2018 about an “opportunity to reset the relationship between our two countries across a broad spectrum - economic, business, commercial - the work that we all know that we need to do to try to develop a peaceful resolution in Afghanistan that benefits certainly Afghanistan, but also the United States and Pakistan”. Also Read: India slams Turkish President Erdogan’s Kashmir remarks at UNGATodd said Pakistan played a “critical role in creating the conditions that brought Afghan leaders and the Taliban to the historic start of Afghan Peace Negotiations” and noted Islamabad has an “even more important role to play in supporting efforts toward a negotiated political settlement”. This represents an opportunity for Pakistan to “continue to forge a new and better role in the region”, he added. He said he would also engage Pakistan on strategic stability and non-proliferation, “carrying a clear message on the threat that nuclear weapons pose to the United States, the region, and our allies and partners”. Pakistan needs to “demonstrate it is prepared to live up to international commitments on weapons of mass destruction”, he added. Todd also listed three other key priorities that he would focus on if confirmed—advancing human rights, particularly freedom of religion and expression, increased bilateral trade and investment, and expanded youth engagement. “I was shocked and heartbroken that US citizen Tahir Naseem was killed in a Pakistani courtroom in which he was facing an accusation of blasphemy. I grieve with the family of Mr Naseem, and if confirmed, will engage Pakistani authorities on full accountability for the perpetrators,” he said.“I am also concerned about increasing restrictions on civil society, including the growing harassment and disappearances of journalists without accountability, which undermines the exercise of the right of peaceful assembly and freedoms of expression and association,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-s-ambassadorial-nominee-calls-on-pakistan-to-act-against-terror/story-yhkdtFGlgNdOtOMhh1IvZM.html
23-09-2020||World||UN unearths record low temperature for Northern Hemisphere||For all the recent talk of global warming, climate historians hunting for past temperature extremes have unearthed what the UN weather agency calls a new record low in the Northern Hemisphere — nearly -70 degrees Celsius (-93 F) was recorded almost three decades ago in Greenland.The World Meteorological Organizations publicly confirmed Wednesday the all-time cold reading for the hemisphere: -69.6 Celsius recorded on Dec. 22, 1991 at an automatic weather station in a remote site called Klinck, not far from the highest point on the Greenland Ice Sheet.“In the era of climate change, much attention focuses on new heat records,” said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas in a statement. “This newly recognized cold record is an important reminder about the stark contrasts that exist on this planet.”The temperature tally surpasses the -67.8°C recorded twice at Siberian sites of Oimekon in 1933 and Verkhoyanksk in 1892. The latter Russian site made headlines in recent months for recording what may be a new record-high temperature north of the Arctic Circle during a heatwave in the region.The new low was confirmed by so-called “climate detectives” working with the WMO’s Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes in Geneva.The agency, which was created in 2007, has been poring over historic data in search of records like high and low temperatures, greatest rainfall, and even of “heaviest hailstone” and “longest lightning flash.”It said that the record came to light after “a WMO blue-ribbon international panel of polar scientists tracked down the original scientists involved” from the Klinck automatic weather station than ran for two years in the early 1990.The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was the -89.2 Celsius (-128.6 F) recorded in 1983 at the high-altitude Vostok weather station in Antarctica, WMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-unearths-record-low-temperature-for-northern-hemisphere/story-GJrR3Ky4DdXkNPlpyiP0MO.html

He currently remains in federal custody.Federal prosecutors said the two companies owned by Syed provided high-performance computing platforms, servers, and software application solutions. From 2006 to 2015, Syed and BSI conspired with company employees in Pakistan to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by exporting computer equipment from the US to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) without obtaining the required authorisation from the US Department of Commerce, according to an indictment returned in the District Court in Chicago. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is a Pakistani government agency responsible for “the design, fabrication, and testing of high explosives and nuclear weapons parts, uranium mining and enrichment, and the development of solid-fuelled ballistic missiles.The indictment charged Syed and BSI with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and foreign trade regulations, and one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Syed, BSI and the other conspirators falsely represented to the US-based computer manufacturers that the illegal shipments were intended for Pakistan-based universities, Syed’s business, or Syed himself.As a matter of fact, they knew that the true end user and ultimate consignee of each shipment was either the PAEC or a research institute that trained the agency’s engineers and scientists, the indictment stated.In so doing, according to the indictment, Syed and his company caused the US-based computer manufacturers to submit to the US government shipping documents, including Shippers Export Declarations, that listed false end-users for the US-origin goods, thereby undermining the US government’s ability to stop the illegal shipments, the Department of Justice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-american-arrested-for-illegally-exporting-computer-equipment-to-pak-s-atomic-body/story-6ztyTXY0RjHpTckN9rzluO.html

You need that with the unsolicited millions of ballots that they are sending. It is a scam. It is a hoax. Everybody knows that. The Democrats know it better than anybody else. So you are going to need nine justices out there,” Trump told reporters.Last Friday, Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer at her home in Washington. Before the liberal-leaning judge’s death, the High Court already was stacked with a 5-4 conservative majority.Trump has repeatedly warned that mail-in ballots will lead to mass election fraud. Many believe the Democrats will benefit more from mail-in ballots because their constituents are more concerned about the pandemic.The presidential election is scheduled to be held on November 3 but some states will allow ballots to come in up to six days late.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-full-supreme-court-needed-ahead-of-us-polls-amid-mail-in-ballot-scam/story-tX28xlyzeBtdOxcsRS33kN.html

23-09-2020||World||Most people infected with novel coronavirus develop symptoms: study||Most people who are infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that causes Covid-19, are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection, a review of studies carried early in the pandemic suggests. While some people who contract the novel coronavirus never experience any symptoms, there remains disagreement about what proportion of total infections these cases represent. The latest study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, suggests that true asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 comprise a minority of infections. According to the researchers at the University of Bern, Switzerland and colleagues, the full spectrum and distribution of the severity of Covid-19 symptoms are not well understood. Some people with the virus may experience severe infections resulting in viral pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and death, while others remain completely asymptomatic or develop mild, nonspecific symptoms. The researchers wanted to better understand the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and never develop any symptoms, as well as the proportion of people who are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but develop symptoms later. They systematically reviewed literature using a database of SARS-CoV-2 evidence between March and June, 2020. The researchers analysed 79 studies reporting empirical data on 6,616 people, 1,287 of whom were defined as asymptomatic, in order to determine the proportion of infected people who never developed symptoms. While the study was limited by its inability to ascertain the impact of false negatives, the researchers were able to estimate that 20 per cent of Covid-19 infections remained asymptomatic during follow-up. Accurate estimations of true asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and for populations to adopt appropriately tailored public health strategies, the researchers said. Improved accuracy of serological tests is also needed to reduce the number of false negatives, they said. Since each person infected with SARS-CoV-2 is initially asymptomatic, the proportion that will go on to develop symptoms is estimated to be around 80 per cent, suggesting that presymptomatic transmission may significantly contribute to overall SARS CoV-2 epidemics. “The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection,” said Diana Buitrago-Garcia at the University of Bern. “The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing and tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed,” Buitrago-Garcia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-people-infected-with-novel-coronavirus-develop-symptoms-study/story-kKgFwtJFxd6MGGqpG4X4wI.html
23-09-2020||World||Covid-19 cases surge as Israel prepares tighter measures||Israel on Wednesday reported a new record level of daily cases of coronavirus, shortly before government officials were to meet to discuss tightening a new nationwide lockdown.The health ministry reported 6,861 new cases Wednesday as a raging outbreak showed no signs of slowing. Israel, a country of some 9 million people, now has one of the world’s highest rates of coronavirus on a per capita basis, and health officials say hospitals are quickly approaching capacity.The government last week imposed a nationwide lockdown that closed schools, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants. The coronavirus cabinet was meeting later Wednesday to discuss further tightening the restrictions.Israel won international praise for its handling of the outbreak last spring, moving quickly to seal its borders and impose a lockdown that appeared to contain the virus. But the government reopened the economy too quickly, and a new outbreak has quickly spread throughout the summer. The economy, meanwhile, has not recovered from a serious downturn caused by the first lockdown.The health ministry has instructed hospitals to delay non-essential surgeries and to open additional coronavirus wards as the number of serious cases continues to rise.Beyond further limiting economic activity, officials have been discussing shuttering synagogues and clamping down on protests — both of which risk sparking a public backlash. The limits would come at a time when Israeli Jews are celebrating the High Holidays and when weekly demonstrations have been held against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his handling of the coronavirus crisis.Deputy health minister Yoav Kisch said restrictions would have to be tightened in the near future.“Educational institutions will be closed, the economy will be limited to essential work, synagogues will have no indoor prayers, with arrangements for outdoor prayer, and demonstrations will be allowed without protesters traveling between cities,” he told Channel 12 TV. “Everyone will demonstrate where he wants, will pray where he wants and will stay at home. That is what is required now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-surge-as-israel-prepares-tighter-measures/story-dzGlehyBWCZ6LA6sSLWWkO.html

I sincerely hope that justice for the victims and their families will now be served.”El Sheikh’s mother had sought to block the evidence transfer for more that two years, arguing that turning over the information would violate data protection laws because it could lead to the execution of her son.US Attorney General Robert Barr last month promised that the two suspects wouldn’t face the death penalty if they were tried in American courts.Kotey and El Sheikh are alleged to have beheaded 27 people, including three US and two British hostages, while fighting for the so-called Islamic State group in Syria. They are believed to have been part of a four-man cell that became known as “the Beatles” because all four spoke with British accents.Both men were raised in London before traveling to Syria to join Islamic State. British authorities revoked their citizenship because of their actions in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-turns-over-evidence-to-us-in-islamic-state-beatles-case/story-DC2i4braGgojMYeSImBLPO.html
23-09-2020||World||China trails US in development of sixth-generation aircraft: Report||China, which in recent years tried to catch up with the US in the design and production of new generation warplanes, is trailing the American air force in the development of the sixth-generation fighter jets by several years, according to a media report. America is leading the world in the sixth-generation fighter jets with the US Air Force saying it has flown a prototype – a milestone that is still years away for China, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday. The US has two fifth-generation fighters in service: the Lockheed Martin F-22 and F-35, both with stealth, supersonic cruise, super maneuverability and superior avionics.Though lagging behind in the development of aircraft engines, China has produced a variety of new generation fighter aircraft including the stealth fighter, J-20 which is officially stated to be the fourth-generation fighter jet. The bulk of its advanced jets mostly comprise of Russia’s Sukhoi aircraft, including Su-27, Su-30KK and Su-35S, besides J-15 which has been specifically developed to operate from the decks of the aircraft carriers being developed by it. China currently has one aircraft carrier, Liaoning, a refit of the Soviet-era ship which was commissioned in 2012 and the second indigenously developed carrier, Shandong, is undergoing sea trials while the third one is under construction. The official media report says China plans to have six aircraft carriers. While focussing on the up-gradation of avionics, China’s new generation aircraft mostly rely on Russian engines. Also, China which helps its all-weather ally Pakistan to jointly produce JF-17 fighter jets, recently upgraded it with new Block-3 version. The upgraded JF-17 fighter jet featuring the technologies of China’s stealth fighter J-20 made its maiden flight early this year in the Chinese city of Chengdu. JF-17 Thunder, which was previously referred to as FC-1 Xiaolong, was previously a single-engine multi-role light fighter jointly produced by the two countries for several years with engines supplied by Russia. China’s fifth-generation fighter project began in 1997, but it was not until 2011 that the Chengdu J-20 had its first flight, and 2017 when it entered the service.Wang Haifeng, the chief designer of Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, which makes the J-20, confirmed earlier that China had started working on its next-generation fighter. “We have chosen and supplemented some technological features in line with various war scenarios,” the Post quoted Wang as saying. “I believe in 2035 or earlier you will see these efforts translated into powerful weapons to defend our airspace,” he said. The features of the future jets are still unknown but Wang said the aircraft could involve the application of artificial intelligence, extreme stealth and omnidirectional detection. He also mentioned laser weapons, self-adapting engines and hypersonic weapons as technologies that had the potential to change the future of warfare. Besides the US and China, Russia is at work on a sixth-generation combat plane, testing some of its technologies on the fifth-generation Su-57. A model of the Franco-German Future Combat Air System by Dassault and Airbus was also on display at last year’s Paris Air Show, with its maiden flight set for 2026. The British sixth-generation fighter Tempest by BAE reportedly had a wind tunnel test in August and is expected to be ready by 2035.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trails-us-in-development-of-sixth-generation-aircraft-report/story-4eh3653BUdeFACUixvHU1J.html
23-09-2020||World||Putin critic Alexei Navalny released from German hospital 32 days after ‘poisoning’||The German hospital treating Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny for poisoning said Wednesday that his condition improved enough for him to be released, and suggested a “complete recovery” from the nerve agent was possible.Navalny, 44, spent 32 days in treatment in Berlin’s Charite hospital, 24 of which were in intensive care, before doctors deemed his “condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged from acute inpatient care.”The hospital said that based on Navalny’s progress, treating physicians believe that “complete recovery is possible,” but added that it ”remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.”Navalny, the most visible opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia.German chemical weapons experts have determined he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok — findings corroborated by labs in France and Sweden.It was the same class of Soviet-era agent that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018, and Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders have called for Russia to fully investigate.Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than two weeks as he was treated with an antidote. Members of his team accused the Kremlin of involvement in the poisoning, charges that Russian officials have vehemently denied.Russia has bristled at the demands for an investigation, saying it needs Germany to share medical data or compare notes with the Russian doctors who said they found no trace of poison in his system while he was at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk.Germany has noted that Navalny was in Russian treatment for 48 hours, and that Russia has its own data.Germany has also enlisted the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for technical assistance in the case.Last week, the international agency said its experts had “ independently collected biomedical samples from Mr Navalny for analysis by OPCW designated laboratories”Results have not yet been announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-critic-alexei-navalny-released-from-german-hospital-32-days-after-poisoning/story-jGQS6W42XdWOwfSELU77TL.html

It was in reference to an incident in the Indian village of Lodta in Rajasthan state’s Jodhpur district on August 9, when 11 Pakistani Hindu migrants were found dead at a farm under mysterious circumstances, according to reports.According to a PTI report, the family had moved to India from Pakistan’s Sindh province in 2015 on long-term visas. They had been living in Lodta for the past six months, where they were hired to work on a farm.Earlier this month, Pakistan had summoned the India’s charge d’affaires in Islamabad to convey the government’s concern over the deaths, as per news reports.The Pakistan foreign ministry’s press statement said Vankwani briefed Qureshi about the anxiety in the Pakistani Hindu community over last month’s incident in Rajasthan. He said that Shrimati Mukhi, the daughter of the deceased head of the family, had filed an FIR in Sanghar over the incident. As per the press statement, Vankwani claimed that according to Mukhi, her father, mother and other family members were murdered after refusing to spy on Pakistan and issue anti-Pakistan statements at the behest of an Indian intelligence agency.The statement also said that the Pakistan foreign minister informed Vankwani that the government had taken up the issue with India through diplomatic channels in Islamabad and New Delhi.Immediately after the incident, the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi had asked the Indian government for access to a surviving member of the family, sharing of copies of the FIR and initial investigation report, and facilitating the presence of the high commission’s representatives during post-mortem of the deceased persons, the statement added.According to the press note, Qureshi assured Vankwani that the safety and security of Pakistani nationals was the responsibility of the Pakistan government. He added that since the victims of “Jodhpur incident” were Pakistani nationals, it was incumbent upon Islamabad to be fully aware of the circumstances under which the Pakistani nationals died in India.Appreciating the efforts made by the Pakistan government over the incident, Vankwani said the Hindu community would take necessary steps to register its protest over the deaths, the press statement concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hindu-council-chief-discusses-jodhpur-deaths-with-foreign-minister-qureshi/story-b0TF3zRi13PxvTgZyAgNYK.html

In Brooklyn, officials are concerned about Williamsburg, with a 2% positive rate, and a southern part of the borough that includes Midwood, Borough Park and Bensonhurst, where the positive rate is 4.71%.“It is now clear that these signals in the south of Brooklyn have coalesced into one cluster we are calling the Ocean Parkway Cluster,” Gallahue wrote in the email. “At this point in time, these increases could potentially evolve into more widespread community transmission and spread to other neighborhoods unless action is taken.”The department said it would continue to urge people to avoid large indoor gatherings, wear masks when socially distancing is not possible and to get tested for the virus frequently.“We will have more to say in the days ahead,” Gallahue wrote.

23-09-2020||World||Protest outside embassy in Nepal after new row over Chinese ‘encroachment’||The construction of 11 buildings by China in a part of the remote border district of Humla that Nepal claims as its own territory has triggered a border row between the two countries, with a spontaneous protest outside the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The buildings were constructed by the Chinese side in an area where a border pillar has been missing since Nepal built a road several years ago. There was only a hut in the area in 2005, according to Nepalese officials who visited the disputed area recently. “The Chinese side claimed that the area where the houses are built falls within the Chinese territory,” Bishnu Bahadur Tamang, chair of Namkha rural municipality, who visited the area on Sunday with a team of officials, told The Kathmandu Post. The construction of the buildings by Chinese security and border forces has been reported to Nepal’s home ministry. There was a spontaneous protest in front of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu on Wednesday afternoon against the “encroachment” of Nepalese territory in Humla district. The protesters chanted slogans and demanded China should vacate Nepalese territory immediately, videos posted on social media showed. Also Read: Fake pages from China tried to disrupt US politics, says FacebookBefore they were dispersed by police, the protesters also demanded the reopening of two border posts at Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi, which have been shut for 10 months and where goods imported from China worth billions of rupee have been stuck. A statement issued by the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu said the buildings in question “have been verified to be on the Chinese side of the China-Nepal border”. The statement added: “The Nepali side may make verification again. China and Nepal have no territorial disputes.” The statement described the two countries as “friendly neighbours” and said China has “always respected Nepal’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Media reports said that during an inspection by a Nepalese team led by chief district officer Chirinjbi Giri on Sunday, Chinese security officials claimed their territory extended one kilometre further south from the area where the buildings are located. Tamang, however, said Nepal’s territory extends two kilometres north from where the buildings are, The Kathmandu Post reported. “Of the 11 houses in the disputed area, security forces live in one and the others are empty,” Tamang said. Also Read: LAC row: Five things you need to know todayAfter Nepalese officials reached the disputed site on Sunday, Chinese security personnel arrived in a truck, a tanker and a jeep. They used a microphone to speak with the Nepalese officials and asked them to go to the border for talks. “We spent around one-and-a-half hours at the disputed area. After we reached, a team of Chinese army and security officials came and said talks cannot be held on their territory. Then we left,” Tamang said. “We claimed that area to be our territory, they showed us the map and said it is theirs.” Nepal’s home ministry dispatched a team comprising government officials, the head of security agencies and local government representatives to Namkha rural municipality to conduct an inspection and submit a report, which is expected at the end of the week. Chakka Bahadur Lama, the MP from Humla, said the dispute emerged after a border pillar in the area went missing. “As long as both sides do not ascertain the location of the missing pillar, the dispute will continue,” Lama said. “The pillar was damaged during a road construction on the Nepali territory some 12 years back. That area where the Chinese have allegedly built the concrete buildings is on the old yak caravan route used for trade between Nepal and Tibet.” During a meeting in 2015, Nepal and China had agreed to ascertain the location of the missing pillar, but no steps were taken subsequently, local officials said. The officials further said that if a straight line of demarcation is drawn from the last existing pillar towards the location of the missing pillar, the disputed land falls inside Nepalese territory. Parliamentarian Lama blamed negligence on the part of the Nepal government for the problem as the country’s security presence in the border area is less than that of the Chinese side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-11-structures-in-disputed-area-triggers-border-row-with-nepal-report/story-MmKmvpAwCbDJDSltHsZj7O.html
23-09-2020||World||Fake pages from China tried to disrupt US politics, says Facebook||Facebook says it has removed a small network of fake accounts and pages that originated in China and focused on disrupting political activity in the US and several other countries.The US-focused activity was just a “sliver” of the accounts’ overall activity and gained almost no following, Facebook said. Their primary focus was Southeast Asia, including the Philippines.In the US, the accounts posted material both in support of and against presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.Facebook did not link the network directly to the Chinese government. It said the people behind the network tried to conceal their identity and location via virtual private networks and other methods.Concerns about foreign efforts to interfere in the election were underscored by a warning Tuesday from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to try to spread disinformation regarding the results of the election, including by creating fake websites or social media content aimed at discrediting the process. The agencies noted that even if a foreign actor managed to tamper with an election-related website, the underlying data would remain uncompromised.US intelligence officials warned last month about ongoing or potential efforts by China, Russia and Iran to interfere in November’s election. In an August public assessment, the country’s chief counterintelligence official, William Evanina, said officials had determined that Beijing regards Trump as unpredictable and wants to see him lose to Biden.The statement said that China had been expanding its influence operations ahead of the election to “shape the policy environment in the United States” and had been weighing the pros and cons of taking more aggressive action.Notably, though, the intelligence assessment was more specific in its characterisations of Russian interference, saying that Moscow was using a range of measures to denigrate Biden and that Kremlin-linked actors were propping up Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.The question of which country poses the biggest threat to election security has emerged as a politically fraught issue.Trump and several senior administration officials have repeatedly insisted that China is more aggressive, even though that characterization is not in line with the August intelligence assessment. After FBI Director Chris Wray outlined the threat of Russian interference at a congressional hearing last week and warned of its ongoing danger, Trump harangued him on Twitter by calling China a “FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.” Facebook said the network focused mainly on Southeast Asia, where it posted in Chinese, Filipino and English about global news and current events.These included Beijing’s interests in the South China Sea, Hong Kong, support for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter’s potential run in that nation’s 2022 presidential election, and criticism of Rappler, an independent news organization in the Philippines.Facebook also removed a second network originating in the Philippines. These accounts posted in Filipino and English about local news and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, a pending anti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-pages-from-china-tried-to-disrupt-us-politics-says-facebook/story-Pq9Vme8aJ1FIntJ6qzJdXO.html
23-09-2020||World||No deal with Israel, but Saudi pushes outreach to Jews||From scrubbing hate-filled school textbooks to a taboo-defying religious sermon, Saudi Arabia is pushing for another kind of normalisation after declining to establish formal relations with Israel -- co-existence with Jews.Saudi Arabia has said it will not follow its allies Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in establishing diplomatic relations without a resolution to the Palestinian issue, even as it cultivates clandestine ties with the Jewish state.Having Saudi Arabia, an Arab powerhouse and epicentre of Islam, forge a similar deal would be the ultimate diplomatic prize for Israel, but the kingdom is wary that its citizens -- sympathetic to the Palestinian cause -- may not be ready for a full embrace.Saudi Arabia, however, is pushing to change public perceptions about Jews with a risky outreach to a community that has long been vilified by the kingdom’s clerical establishment and media, laying the groundwork for an eventual recognition.School textbooks, once well-known for denigrating Jews and other non-Muslims as “swines” and “apes”, are undergoing revision as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s campaign to combat extremism in education, officials say.“The Saudi government has also decided to prohibit the disparagement of Jews and Christians in mosques,” said Saudi analyst Najah al-Otaibi.“Anti-Jewish rhetoric was common at Friday prayers of the imams in mosques used to address Muslims around the world.”In a stunning U-turn, a preacher in the holy city of Mecca triggered a social media storm this month when he spoke of Prophet Mohammed’s friendly relations with Jews to advocate religious tolerance.The sermon was by Abdulrahman al-Sudais, the imam of Mecca’s Grand Mosque who courted controversy in the past for strongly anti-Semitic views.‘When, not if’ Mohammed al-Issa, a Saudi cleric who heads the Muslim World League, won praise from Israel in January after he travelled to Poland for events marking 75 years since the Nazi death camp Auschwitz was liberated.Earlier this year, the kingdom announced the screening of a Holocaust-themed film for the first time at a movie festival, before it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.The kingdom has also pursued a bold outreach to Jewish figures, including in February when King Salman hosted a Jerusalem-based rabbi, David Rosen, for the first time in modern history.“When it comes to Saudi Arabia and Israel establishing relations, it is a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’,” said Marc Schneier, an American rabbi with close relations to Gulf rulers.“Part of the process that all Gulf countries have and are going through on the road to normalisation is first pushing warmer ties between Muslims and Jews and then moving more boldly into discussing Israel and the Gulf.”Arab News, the kingdom’s main English-language daily, whipped up a social media storm at the weekend when it briefly changed its social media banner on Twitter and Facebook with a greeting in Hebrew for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.The newspaper recently published a lengthy series on the Jews of Lebanon, and plans a similar instalment on an ancient Jewish community that lived in what is today Saudi Arabia.The newspaper’s editor Faisal Abbas told AFP the coverage “was not tied to Israel” but aimed at connecting with “Arab Jews worldwide”.‘Difficult to happen’ The coverage marks a departure for tightly controlled media in the absolute monarchy.Saudi media outlets have previously branded the Jewish state as the “Zionist” enemy, but largely hailed the recent deals struck with the UAE and Bahrain.Fuelling speculation about quietly warming relations with Israel were two television dramas on the Saudi-controlled MBC network during this year’s fasting month of Ramadan.In a controversial scene in one of the shows, “Exit 7”, one Saudi character brushes aside the taboo of doing business with Israel, saying Palestinians are the real “enemy” for insulting the kingdom “day and night” despite decades of support.The moves indicate that the kingdom is not opposed to normalisation with the Jewish state after having resolutely supported the Palestinians politically and financially for decades, observers say.But Israel formalising relations with unelected Arab governments “is not the same as Israel making ‘peace’ with Arab people”, said Giorgio Cafiero, the chief executive of Gulf State Analytics.Data from a rare Saudi public opinion poll published last month by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy suggests many Saudi citizens are not in favour of a deal.Despite the Saudi media outreach to Israelis and Jews, “a mere nine percent of Saudis” agreed that people in favour of business or sports contacts with Israelis should be allowed to do so, according to the Institute’s David Pollock.“What peace? Peace after all that (Israel) has done, killing and war?” Bader, a young Saudi citizen in Riyadh, told AFP.“It’s difficult for this to happen between (Saudis and Israelis). I won’t support it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-deal-with-israel-but-saudi-pushes-outreach-to-jews/story-gOXFJ8vtWz2JDyPEgW8UBI.html
23-09-2020||World||US passes 200,000 Covid-19 deaths as spread quickens worldwide||The United States has passed 200,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, as a record-breaking wave of new infections forces authorities in Europe to reimpose lockdown restrictions.The world’s most powerful nation hit the figure just 41 days before a presidential election, and as the World Health Organization warned that new cases worldwide have risen to record highs.US President Donald Trump -- who faces a tough re-election fight and is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in the polls -- said the 200,000 milestone was “a shame” and deflected blame onto China.Trump used a video address to the annual United Nations General Assembly to attack Beijing for not stopping the spread of what he called the “China virus.”“We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world -- China,” he told the UN’s diplomatic showcase event, which is being held almost entirely online because of the pandemic.Trump has repeatedly played down the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis, even as the United States has suffered one of the world’s highest death tolls.According to an AFP tally, worldwide more than 31 million people have been infected and nearly 962,000 have died from Covid-19 since the virus emerged in the eastern Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The World Health Organization reported late Monday that almost two million infections were recorded around the globe in the single week to September 20.The six percent increase versus the previous week is “the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic”, the UN health agency said.Get through’ winterIn Europe, a surge forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce fresh steps to try to allay the rising death toll. “To help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so,” the government said, despite fears of a devastating economic impact.New rules come into force for pubs and other hospitality venues on Thursday and plans to allow fans back into sporting events have been ditched.Several Premier League football players have tested positive, sending them into isolation and forcing games to be postponed. Johnson warned the new restrictions could last up to six months and called for a collective effort to “get through this winter together”. His scientific advisors had said the United Kingdom could see a devastating 50,000 coronavirus cases a day by mid-October if no action is taken.“Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour,” said Johnson, who like Trump has been widely criticised for his handling of the pandemic.Even with citizens weary of months of social distancing and previously unthinkable restrictions on their lives, hundreds of millions face harsher measures to come.After months of brutal lockdown was eased, Spain’s health minister on Tuesday called on Madrid residents to limit their movements and social contact to the “essential”.Some 850,000 people in part of the Madrid region are now again under lockdown.Across Europe, hundreds of major events have been scaled back or cancelled. For the first time since 1944 the most august of all gatherings, the Nobel prize ceremony, will not take place as normal in Stockholm this year, and will instead be televised.The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Norway in December will also be scaled back.Austria Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told AFP that fighting the pandemic remained “a very big challenge”, as his country extended mandatory mask wearing and re-instated some restrictions imposed earlier this year.“I am still relatively young, but I have been part of the Austrian government for many years and I thought I had already been through a lot politically,” the 34-year-old conservative leader said in an interview. “The corona crisis now exceeds all previous experiences of course.” Return to MeccaIn a rare glimmer of hope, Saudi Arabia announced that it will gradually resume the year-round umrah pilgrimage for Muslims from October 4.The kingdom had suspended the umrah in March and later scaled back the annual hajj in a blow to millions of Muslim pilgrims around the world amid fears that the coronavirus could spread to Islam’s holiest sites.In the first stage, “6,000 citizens and residents within the kingdom will be allowed to perform the umrah per day from October 4”, the interior ministry said in a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency.In Australia, authorities eased some restrictions that had seen domestic inter-state travel virtually banned.Like neighbouring New Zealand, restrictions have driven the rate of community transmission close to zero in much of Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-200-000-covid-19-deaths-as-spread-quickens-worldwide/story-6lWYa7cUIWAZ2PookZaY1K.html

Results of the study, conducted by subsidiary Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, were statistically significant, the company said in a release.The announcement sent Fujifilm shares up more than 4% in Tokyo to their highest level in four months.Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had touted Avigan’s potential as Japan’s contribution to a global race for coronavirus treatments, aiming for domestic approval in May.The government called on Fujifilm to triple national stockpiles of Avigan, approved in 2014 as an emergency flu treatment, and pledged to donate it to countries on request.But a lack of patients in Japan hampered clinical testing. In July, researchers at Fujita Health University said their Avigan study failed to reach statistically significant results.In its statement, Fujifilm said it would perform further analysis of the trial data and seek to file for approval of Avigan for use in Covid-19 as early as October.This week, the Nikkei newspaper cited ministry sources as saying approval could be granted within a month of receiving such a request.In July, Fujifilm sold its global rights to Avigan to India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. Already available generically in many countries under the name favipiravir, the drug has been approved to treat Covid-19 in India and Russia.Avigan acts on the RNA of viruses, inhibiting their ability to replicate. It is the subject of dozens of trials worldwide, but concerns remain over birth defects it caused in animal studies.Dr Reddy’s shares were 0.7% higher at 0430 GMT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fujifilm-s-avigan-shown-to-be-effective-in-japanese-phase-3-trial-for-covid-19/story-aLdqcrZHSplmSzS4UME1iM.html

Some other antigen tests must be read using a small, portable device.“You know that companies like Abbott or Roche are bringing these tests to the market and we are definitely looking into this,” said Bjoern Becker, senior director, product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group.“You will see us applying them for new products within the next few weeks in October,” he told reporters during a virtual call. “That’s definitely the next thing to come.”Becker said Lufthansa is considering making the new antigen tests initially available to its first-class and business class passengers, given limited supply.Lufthansa is also looking at ways to expand its network of testing centers to airports in the United States and Canada, given that they are important markets, he said.

23-09-2020||World||India slams Turkish President Erdogan’s Kashmir remarks at UNGA||India on Tuesday categorically told Turkey to “learn to respect the sovereignty of other nations” after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue in his address at the UN General Assembly earlier in the day.“We have seen remarks by the President of Turkey on Indian UT of Jammu & Kashmir,” T S Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, said in a tweet. “They constitute gross interference in India’s internal affairs and are completely unacceptable. Turkey should learn to respect sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply.”Erdogan called the Kashmir “conflict” a “burning issue” in his virtual address during the UNGA debate and said, “Steps taken following the abolition of the special status of Jammu-Kashmir further complicated the problem.”He added, “We are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue, within the framework of the United Nations resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.”Watch l ‘Gross interference’: India slams Turkish President Erdogan’s Kashmir remarks India considers the Kashmir dispute as something to be settled bilaterally with Pakistan, and under the Simla Agreement. It is a position that is widely accepted by the international community, including eventually by US President Donald Trump who had tried, and failed, to intervene in the dispute with offers to mediate.Erdogan had raised the issue in 2019 as well, rallying around Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s attempt to garner greater international attention on Kashmir at the UNGA. Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the only other leader to take Pakistan’s side at that time.In his 2019 speech, the Turkish president had accused the international community of having “failed” to devote enough attention to Kashmir, saying, “In order for the Kashmiri people to look at a safe future together with their Pakistani and Indian neighbours, it is imperative to solve the problem through dialogue and on the basis of justice and equity, but not through collision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-slams-turkish-president-erdogan-s-kashmir-remarks-at-unga/story-ann6FVUwGjTW7Ez37afnvI.html
23-09-2020||World||Thousands expected to honour Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Supreme Court||Thousands of people are expected to pay their respects at the Supreme Court to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the women’s rights champion, leader of the court’s liberal bloc and feminist icon who died last week.Even with the court closed to the public because of the coronavirus pandemic and Washington already consumed with talk of Ginsburg’s replacement, the justice’s former colleagues, family, close friends and the public will have the chance Wednesday and Thursday to pass by the casket of the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.The sad occasion is expected to bring together the remaining eight justices for the first time since the building was closed in March and they resorted to meetings by telephone.Ginsburg will lie in repose for two days at the court where she served for 27 years and, before that, argued six cases for gender equality in the 1970s.Following a private ceremony Wednesday in the court’s Great Hall, her casket will be moved outside the building to the top of the court’s front steps so that public mourners can pay their respects in line with public health guidance for the pandemic.Since her death Friday evening, people have been leaving flowers, notes, placards and all manner of Ginsburg paraphernalia outside the court in tribute to the woman who became known in her final years as the “Notorious RBG.” Court workers cleared away the items and cleaned the court plaza and sidewalk in advance of Wednesday’s ceremony.Following past practice at the tradition-laden court, Ginsburg’s casket is expected to arrive just before 9:30 a.m. EDT Wednesday, the court said. Supreme Court police will carry it up the court steps, which will be lined former Ginsburg law clerks serving as honourary pallbearers.Chief Justice John Roberts and the other justices will be in the Great Hall when the casket arrives and is placed on the Lincoln Catafalque, the platform on which President Abraham Lincoln’s coffin rested in the Capitol rotunda in 1865. A 2016 portrait of Ginsburg by artist Constance P. Beaty will be displayed nearby.It’s unclear whether President Donald Trump would visit the court before he leaves town Wednesday afternoon, though he did pay respects when Justice John Paul Stevens died last year and President Barack Obama visited the court after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in 2016.The entrance to the courtroom, along with Ginsburg’s chair and place on the bench next to Roberts, have been draped in black, a longstanding court custom. These visual signs of mourning, which in years past have reinforced the sense of loss, will largely go unseen this year. The court begins its new term Oct. 5, but the justices will not be in the courtroom and instead will hear arguments by phone.After the private ceremony inside the court, Ginsburg’s casket will be on public view from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday and 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday.On Friday, Ginsburg will lie in state at the Capitol, the first woman to do so and only the second Supreme Court justice after William Howard Taft. Taft had also been president. Rosa Parks, a private citizen as opposed to a government official, is the only woman who has lain in honour at the Capitol.Ginsburg will be buried beside her husband, Martin, in a private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery next week. Martin Ginsburg died in 2010. She is survived by a son and a daughter, four grandchildren, two step-grandchildren and a great-grandchild.Ginsburg’s death from cancer at age 87 has added another layer of tumult to an already chaotic election year. Trump and Senate Republicans are plowing ahead with plans to have a new justice on the bench, perhaps before the Nov. 3 election.Only Chief Justice Roger Taney, who died in October 1864, died closer to a presidential election. Lincoln waited until December to nominate his replacement, Salmon Chase, who was confirmed the same day.When Scalia, Ginsburg’s closest friend on the court, died unexpectedly in 2016, Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama’s high-court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-expected-to-honour-ruth-bader-ginsburg-at-supreme-court/story-eLKBy0ami8RfPp3yBc4dzN.html
23-09-2020||World||Indian Americans have powered economic growth of United States, says Biden||Indian Americans, with their hard work and entrepreneurship, have powered the economic growth of the United States and helped forge cultural dynamism in the country, Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden said on Tuesday.Addressing a national virtual fundraiser organised by Indian Americans, Biden assured the community members and the mega donors that as a president, he would address their concerns with regard to H-1B visa and legal immigrants that attract the best and the brightest to the US.Think about what this community has done for the country, he said. Entrepreneurs running businesses around the country and around the world, innovators who make the foundation for Silicon Valley and lead some of the most influential companies in the world come from the community, the former vice president said.“You have helped forge an economic and cultural dynamism in this country. That is a continuation of who we are, we are a nation of immigrants,” Biden said.Hitting out at President Donald Trump, he said all the harmful actions on H-1B, racial injustice or climate crisis are a common threat. “This president makes things worse, not better,” Biden added.It makes parents wonder whether their kids will have the kind of future they dreamed of when they came here, he said.“As president, I promise I am going to draw on the best, not the worst, beat this pandemic and build the economy back, help our kids get a good education and make sure healthcare is a right not a privilege, and build an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values,” Biden said.“We do not talk enough about how the Indian American community has powered our economic growth,” the former vice president said in his address to the virtual fundraiser, which according to his spokesperson Remi Yamamoto was attended by 268 people.Highly appreciative of the cultural, social and family values of Indian Americans, Biden said that is why he values the Indian American Diaspora so much.Seema Sadanandan, a senior policy adviser to the campaign, opened the fundraiser and asked Dr Vivek Murthy, former surgeon general, to start off by talking about his relationship with Biden. Family was the main theme of the conversation with a few references thrown in about Indian food.“Joe Biden is the kind of guy I would love to bring home to have dinner with my mom and dad,” Murthy said in his opening remarks, adding that some homemade masala dosa would be served.“He is authentic. He is real. And he says what he thinks and that is something I really love about him. He says what is on his mind. He is honest and true,” he said.Biden, Murthy said, is a man who generally meets with his values and those values are reliably centred around generosity and community. “It is who he is,” Murthy said.In a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council and National Finance Committee member of the Biden campaign, said the former vice president will bring hope, unity, change and healing to the country.“He will restore the soul of America and its glorious position on the world stage. He will be the best friend of India and Indo-Americans. He will streamline H1Bs, remove green card backlogs, sign new trade deals, implement climate change agreements, protect us against hate crimes, guard our places of worship and ensure that South Asians are well represented in his administration,” Bhutoria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-have-powered-economic-growth-of-united-states-says-biden/story-ZX6lGgWeBKGT3wApGXju5L.html
23-09-2020||World||Follow Covid-19 precautions or face another lockdown, PM Johnson tells Britons||Hours after outlining a new set of restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson implored Britons in a special broadcast on Tuesday evening to follow precautions to curb the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19), or face fines and even another lockdown, if the minority who flout rules continue to do so.As the day-rise of new cases climbed to 4,926 on Tuesday evening, and a cumulative total of 403,551 with 41,825 deaths, Johnson abandoned his earlier optimistic outlook, and said if need be, the army would be deployed to ensure official guidance is followed.He said: “(Unless) we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later…If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs”.“And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend…We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further”.The country, he told Britons, came together when the virus took hold in March, when people scrupulously followed official guidance by staying at home and taking basic precautions such as frequently washing hands and maintaining social distancing.That collective action kept the virus at bay, which was reflected in falling numbers of new cases and admissions in hospitals from June onwards. But September has seen an exponential rise at various levels, after what Johnson called “too many breaches” of guidance.Johnson said: “The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell…That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary”.The new curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres, which has further unnerved the industry struggling to balance the books in recent months. Wearing of masks has been made compulsory, including in taxis.Another key advice was to ‘work from home’, a reversal of the recent ‘back to work’ advice when new cases were in the hundreds. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covod-19-behave-or-face-another-lockdown-johnson-tells-britons/story-xFT9EIHXzlUh2vytQXErBL.html
23-09-2020||World||Hillary Clinton chides senate GOP for Ginsburg replacement rush||Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Republican rush to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court could spell the end of Obamacare, but that she opposes increasing the size of the court in response.In an interview taped for the Bloomberg Equality Summit to take place on Wednesday, Clinton cited Ginsburg’s reported last wish -- that the seat she had held since 1993 remain vacant until the presidential election was decided.“She was offering a measured opinion that’s in the best interest of the country and the court to let the election go forward,” said Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.She acknowledged that Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm an appointment from President Donald Trump before the Nov. 3 election.A decision by Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to go forward with confirming a nominee is a “very unfortunate display of partisan power to push through whoever the president nominates,” Clinton said.She said she wouldn’t, however, favor a strategy being discussed by some Democrats to increase the size of the court in the event they win control of the Senate and White House to dilute the conservative majority. She called that idea “a step too far.”The 2016 Democratic standard bearer said her party should be “absolutely clear what’s really at stake and first and foremost in this case is health care,” noting that the high court is scheduled to hear a case on the Obama administration’s signature health care legislation shortly after the election.“It really speaks to the fervent desire of Republicans under Trump and Mitch McConnell to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,” Clinton said. “What that means is for millions of Americans, their cost will go up, if they can even get insurance.”Clinton framed the high court and health care battles in terms of the coronavirus pandemic.“Having the seat filled right now, rather than waiting until we know who the president is, may well mean the end of the ACA and millions of Americans who have been exposed to Covid-19 will have pre-existing conditions that won’t be covered,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-chides-senate-gop-for-ginsburg-replacement-rush/story-IcmoSOgbIutTARbwY4NR3N.html
23-09-2020||World||Covid fatalities top 200,000 in US as UK tightens curbs||The US death toll from Covid-19 topped 200,000 on Tuesday, a figure unimaginable eight months ago when the scourge first reached the world’s richest nation. The grim milestone in America was reported only hours after the UK announced new restrictions short of a total lockdown, with the country’s authorities reporting a sharp increase in cases in recent weeks.The deadly disease has so far claimed more than 965,000 lives globally and has infected over 31.3 million people. The US remains the worst-hit nation, surpassing 200,000 fatalities and reporting nearly 6.9 million Covid-19 infections. In the UK, the disease has claimed over 41,800 lives and infected at least 400,000 people.Critics in the US said the latest statistics exposed the Trump administration’s failure to meet its sternest test ahead of the November 3 election. President Donald Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden said, “With this crisis that required serious presidential leadership, he just wasn’t up to it. He froze... and America has paid the worst price of any nation in the world.”In the UK, concern over managing the crisis was prompted by modelling that showed new cases doubling every seven days. The new measures would last at least six months, Johnson told the House of Commons. The curbs include a 10pm curfew for pubs, restaurants and hospitality centres. Fines of up to £10,000 and compulsory wearing of masks are among the new steps.Another advice from the UK PM was to “work from home”, a reversal of the recent “back to work” advice. Weddings will also be limited to 15 people, instead of 30, while planned pilot events for the return of spectator sport have been cancelled.The advice to last six months means Johnson has dropped his earlier optimism of a return to normal by Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-fatalities-top-200-000-in-us-as-uk-tightens-curbs/story-aNYXwpZkSvSmYjuO7d9zNM.html
23-09-2020||World||US set to make it tough for firms to hire H-1B holders||The Trump administration plans to make it harder for US companies to hire foreign workers on H-1B non-immigrant short-term visas, by narrowing the definition of “speciality” occupation and raising minimum wages for the employees. Both measures are intended to ensure American workers were not displaced or denied jobs because of cheaper foreign workers. Critics of the H-1B programme argue that US companies are hiring foreign workers to displace American ones, and that they are not highly skilled as they ought to be. More than 70% of these H-1B visas go to Indians hired by US companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, and US subsidiaries of Indian IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS.Office of Management and Budget of the White House has posted a notice on its website saying a review was under way of H-1B and other visas, but no details were available.White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Reuters news agency that these measures will be “utterly transformative” and will ensure there is “no market for someone to drive back down wages on H-1Bs to displace American workers”.The administration would expect to have them in place for maximum impact before elections on November 3. Reuters reported that these measures were being fast-tracked and the final bunch of orders could also include restriction on international students.The H-1B visa programme has been on the cross-hairs of the Trump administration from the beginning and it has been changed and altered incrementally since, through executive orders. It was suspended temporarily in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs that were becoming available from the lockdown. The president has also suspended all immigration till December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-make-it-tough-for-firms-to-hire-h-1b-holders/story-S1uDidm9iBPKDdZVdiKuWO.html
23-09-2020||World||Confidence crisis at UN, reforms needed: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the United Nations faces a “crisis of confidence” as it commemorated its 75th anniversary, and reiterated India’s long-standing call for reform at the world body to reflect “today’s realities” and “give voice to all stakeholders”.In a declaration adopted at the end of the day-long commemorative meeting, the General Assembly committed itself to “instil new life in the discussions on the reform” of the UN Security Council (UNSC), one the principal organs of the world body. India is seeking a permanent seat on the reformed and expanded UNSC.The Prime Minister was participating in a virtual high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly to commemorate the historic session. He is scheduled to deliver his speech at the high-level General Debate of the assembly on Saturday, as the first speaker for the day.“We cannot fight today’s challenges with outdated structures,” Modi said in a short address.He added: “Without comprehensive reforms, the UN faces a crisis of confidence. For today’s interconnected world, we need a reformed multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, gives voice to all stake holders, addresses contemporary challenges and focuses on human welfare.”The Prime Minister recalled for listeners that India was a founding signatory of the United Nations that was born out of the “horrors” of World War II, and shared India’s own “philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’” (the whole world is one family).“Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations,” Modi said. “We pay tribute to all those who have advanced the cause of peace and development under the UN flag, including in UN peacekeeping missions, where India had been a leading contributor.”But, he added, “while much has been achieved, the original mission remains incomplete” — something acknowledged by the declaration the General Assembly adopted at the end of the one-day meeting to commemorate the anniversary. The declaration said more needs to be done towards preventing conflict, ensuring development, addressing climate change, reducing inequality and leveraging digital technologies.There is a “need for reform of the United Nations itself”, Modi added.The declaration did make a forceful case for it. “We commit to instil new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalize the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council,” it said.India and many countries have called for reforming the UN arguing that it must reflect the changing world order and accommodate the aspirations of emerging powers. India itself has sought a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council.The US, the UK, France and Russia — four of the five permanent members — have endorsed the country’s demand, but there has been no real progress in the process, called the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN), which has been under way for a long time.India has “accorded the highest priority to permanent membership”, the ministry of external affairs said on Monday in a parliamentary reply.It has pursed this on both bilateral and multilateral platforms, especially in concert with countries that are also seeking a permanent membership of the council such as G-4 partners Japan, Germany and Brazil and with IBSA’s other two members Brazil and South Africa.IBSA foreign ministers met last week virtually for their annual meeting around the UN General Assembly sessions, and expressed “frustration with the slow pace of progress” on Security Council reforms in the IGN process which, they complained, “lacked transparency in its working methods”.“Expressed our collective frustration with the slow progress of reforms in the Inter-Governmental Negotiations,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Twitter after the meeting. “Time has come for substantive negotiations in a formal setting on a single comprehensive text.”Serving and former diplomats and experts are clear-eyed, however, about the challenges in the way. UNSC reforms will not be easy, and will require India to be persistent. “Global action to meet global challenges of today demands that the UN reforms to strengthen multilateralism in keeping with contemporary realities,” said Manjeev Puri, a former top Indian diplomat to the UN.“Demanders for change, including India, need to be resolute and determined as reform is unlikely either easily or quickly but is a must for themselves and the world,” he added.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at Wilson Center, said that as long as China was standing in the way, it will be difficult for India. “India’s hopes of a permanent UNSC seat have long been dashed by the veto power of China. And given the trajectory of India-China relations, which are free-falling and are likely to remain in crisis for an extended period of time, it’s highly unlikely that Beijing will change its position anytime soon.”He added: “India’s best hope is that UN rules eventually change so that a majority of votes, as opposed to unanimity, are required to have a new permanent member.”India will begin a two-year term on the Security Council coming January as a non-permanent member, for the eighth time. It hopes to use the opportunity to further burnish its credentials for a seat as a permanent member. Its previous non-permanent terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confidence-crisis-at-un-reforms-needed-pm-modi/story-ebu9Lb9K6R0GDoIeY4cv7J.html
23-09-2020||World||Influenza vaccine does not increase Covid-19 risk: Study||Receiving the influenza vaccine does not increase a person’s risk for contracting Covid-19 or worsen associated conditions or mortality, according to a study. The research, published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, shows the flu vaccine is the single most important intervention to help stay healthy. Seasonal flu activity is unpredictable, and otherwise healthy people are hospitalised due to serious respiratory infection each year, the researchers said. It is even more important to receive the flu vaccination this year to help prevent a ‘twindemic’ of flu and Covid-19, they said. Researchers led by Joe Zein, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic in the US, analysed over 13,000 patients tested for Covid-19 between early March and mid-April. They compared those who had received unadjuvanted influenza vaccines in the fall or winter of 2019 (4,138 patients) with those who did not receive the vaccine (9,082 patients). The study found that influenza vaccination was not associated with increased Covid-19 incidence or disease severity, including risk for hospitalisation, admission to the intensive care unit or mortality. “Our findings suggest that we should proceed as usual with our vaccination strategy for global influenza this flu season,” said Zein. “Getting the annual flu vaccine remains the best safeguard against the influenza virus -- both for yourself and the people around you,” he added. The researchers noted that much is still unknown about the possible outcomes of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes Covid-19 -- and influenza infection, including disease pathology and burden to the healthcare system. They believe that the population’s adherence to widespread and early flu vaccination while researchers continue to collect data will help to mitigate the risk of simultaneous viral infections and pandemics. “We have already seen the stress that Covid-19 can put on our hospitals and resources,” said Zein. “While we’re not yet sure how flu season will affect Covid-19 susceptibility and infections, we strongly advise people to get their influenza vaccines, both for their individual health and the collective health of our care systems,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/influenza-vaccine-does-not-increase-covid-19-risk-study/story-rqs84SBDVF9iYCqHXgtSaM.html

The video, published online last week by a local network in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, showed the young soldiers inside a bus and singing a well-known Chinese military song “Green Flowers in the Army”. Nearly all of them seemed emotional, with some crying.WATCH | Chinese soldiers ‘cry’ on way to India border; Taiwan media mocks Taiwanese media such as Liberty Times and Taiwan News, known for their pro-independence, anti-China stand, seemed to mock the soldiers for crying, interpreting it as a sign of fear against deployment at the border with India amid the ongoing tension in eastern Ladakh. Also read: India-China military commanders to meet at least twice more before disengagement commencesChina considers Taiwan as a breakaway region to be reunified by force if necessary and currently – much like with India – military tension between the two is rapidly escalating. The recruits in the video are from the Yingzhou district of Fuyang city in Anhui. The video was shared across online platforms in China as well as on Twitter and on Facebook, interestingly by a Pakistani comedian Zaid Hamid.“As tensions continue to simmer on the Sino-Indian border, a video surfaced on Sunday (September 20) showing PLA soldiers crying as they are allegedly deployed to the border,” the Taiwan News reported on Tuesday.Also read: Chinese airforce uses Hollywood film clips in propaganda videoThe new troops were “reportedly college students, and five of them had ‘proactively volunteered to serve in Tibet’, which borders the Ladakh region where the bloody Galwan Valley skirmish took place in June of this year,” it said.“In the video, the soldiers can be seen sobbing hysterically as they struggle to sing the words to the PLA song ‘Green Flowers in the Army,’” the report added.It said Hamid, the Pakistani comedian, seemed to be “poking fun” at the recruits despite him saying: “We Pakistani support you China. Stay Brave.”The Chinese state-controlled media reacted strongly against its Taiwanese counterparts, saying they deliberately misinterpreted the emotional video involving the PLA soldiers. Also read: How Chinese propaganda is using the 1962 war to shape public opinion“At that time, they were bidding farewell to their parents and sang the famous military song ‘Green Flowers in the Army’, and they sang ‘Go home when you celebrate your work’, completely contrary to the mood created by Taiwanese media,” the nationalist tabloid Global Times said in a report on Tuesday.The report added that though the Taiwanese media report “tried to use all kinds of explicit hints to shape the image of the PLA fighters being ‘afraid of war’, when describing all the key information, the author used vague terms such as ‘reported’ and ‘probable’, which seemed very guilty.”The Global Times report added that many who re-posted the content mocking the PLA were Twitter users from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crying-pla-troops-on-way-to-india-border-causes-china-taiwan-media-war/story-i7tpbeTb3x1lBNvyk0XV5L.html
23-09-2020||India||Supreme Court should migrate from Vidyo app: Survey||A majority of Supreme Court lawyers who participated in a survey on the virtual court hearings did not favour the Vidyo app used by the apex court for video conference hearings and suggested that the top court should migrate from Vidyo to a different software application.227 lawyers participated in the survey which was carried out online by 5 Supreme Court lawyers. Out of the 227, 13 lawyers were senior advocates and 133 were Advocates-on-Record (AoRs). To be sure, the number of participants who took the survey was limited when compared to the total number of practicing lawyers in Supreme Court. There are more than 2,700 AoRs in the Supreme Court while the SCBA has nearly 2,000 members on its voter’s list. “An overwhelming majority of participants [155 of 218 (71.1 percent) who answered the question on Vidyo app] strongly felt that, owing to the technical issues with Vidyo, the Supreme Court should migrate to a different software application for conducting hearings through Video Conferencing,” the survey report said.Vidyo app has proved to be problematic in practice and needs a complete overhaul and technology/ bandwidth issues needs to be immediately improved, the report dated August 29 suggested. The top court could consider exploring the possibility of developing a separate software application which integrates the best practices across various applications, it added.The report said that advocates were routinely either unable to log in or were automatically logged out during court proceedings, probably due to bandwidth/ capacity issues with the App. They also faced difficulties in re-joining the hearing if they were logged out for some reason.“Participants also complained that they were completely subject to the mercy of the Control Room and, on several occasions, were not unmuted in time, and hence were unable to present their arguments,” it said.These problems were more acute in batch matters involving large number of parties, the report added.The survey was conducted by 5 AoRs - Bhabna Das, D Abhinav Rao, Harsh Parashar, Krishna Dev J and RV Yogesh.The apex court started hearing cases through video conferencing on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the national lockdown in view of the Coronavirus pandemic.The hearing in Supreme Court is conducted through Vidyo app which can be downloaded on mobile phones and desktop. The platform is hosted on the servers of National Data Centre of National Informatics Centre. While the judges on the bench join the video conference from the residence of one of the judges, the lawyers join from their respective houses.Another issue regarding video conference hearing which was highlighted by the survey report was that the lack of proper technical assistance from the court staff and a grievance redressal mechanism.“There is absolutely no clarity on who is to be contacted in case of any technical issue in connecting via the link shared,” the report said.A significant number of advocates experienced some stress owing to the link to the video conference being shared at the last minute, especially if they had to forward the link to a Senior Advocate / Arguing Counsel, it was pointed out.Currently, links to the hearing are shared on Whatsapp groups specifically created each day for each court. It was suggested that the link for hearings for different virtual courts be published along with the cause list or sent to the concerned AoRs by automated e-mails sufficiently in advance.“This can, in the long run, eliminate the time and resources consumed in creating WhatsApp groups for different virtual courts every day for this purpose, and also reduce the anxiety caused due to receipt of links at the last minute.”94.7 percent of the participants (213 out of 225) also felt that the above issues can be best addressed by having separate designated officers for each virtual court, a demand which seems to have been accepted by the top court which on September 22 issued a circular giving contact details of dedicated court masters and court moderators for each court, who can be contacted for any assistance during video conference hearings. The apex court has been frequently updating the standard operating procedure to address various issues faced by lawyers during video conference hearings. The court had on August 29 also invited sealed tenders for “a comprehensive plan for video conference hearings including hardware and support”.The survey also covered other aspects like E-filing and listing of cases.79.3 percent out of 213 advocates stated that they had used the E-filing Platform of the Supreme Court. 8 advocates (3.8 percent) stated that they had been unable to use it because of technical issues.98 out of 166 (59 percent) advocates stated that they preferred E-filing to physical filing. However, a significant portion [41 percent] of advocates had faced some problems with the E-filing mechanism. “By and large, advocates feel that the interface is not user-friendly, unnecessarily requires filling in of too many details at the advocates’ end, and that the support from the Registry is inadequate. Advocates are also anxious about the diary numbers not being generated immediately on E-filing, unlike a physical filing. This leads to uncertainty for the advocate and the client about whether the filing has been acknowledged by the registry and whether this would cause further delay in the process,” the report stated.Only 4 participants actually expressed “satisfaction” with the existing E-filing system, it added.68 out of 116 (58.6%) participants stated that they found the E-filing system of the Delhi High Court to be the most efficient.The survey also pointed out shortcomings regarding listing of cases. 41.8 percent of the participants said they were able to get their matters listed only after filing a mentioning application indicating some urgency, the report said.“There was a significant delay of 10 days or more in listing of the cases of a large proportion of participants i.e. 34 percent. On some occasions, this delay was caused despite filing a mentioning application, which has remained pending for several days,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-should-migrate-from-vidyo-app-survey/story-S5mMZD3K29bYTfoUvZUi2J.html
23-09-2020||India||IICT partners with Mylan for combination therapy trials||Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) has partnered with the Indian subsidiary of global pharmaceutical company, Mylan, to test combination therapies for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The institute had identified first three combination therapies, for Phase 3 clinical trials, based on computational modelling of molecules and laboratory-based data. Another five combinations are also in the works and will be finalised after preliminary data for the same is received.“Mylan is a global company with a big portfolio of antiviral drugs. Some of these drugs, in combination with antibiotics or other medicines, will be used for the first three-arm trial. All the drug combinations that we are working on include either one or two antibiotics in combination with medicines that boost the immunity of the host or make the human cells not receptive to the virus. So, the drug combinations will work both on the virus and the host to produce the best results,” said Dr S Chandrashekhar, director, IICT.He said the first three combinations to be tested will have the antiviral drug Favipiravir, currently in use for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms, antiviral drugs used against Hepatitis C, and antiviral drugs used against HIV.“Some of these antiviral drugs have received a nod for experimental use by the drug controller, but these trials will actually produce data to show how effective the drugs are. And, Mylan, being a big global company, can use the data for global approvals,” he said.The trial sites for the combination therapies are yet to be identified, but the institute hopes to collaborate with hospitals in four to five cities in India.“We are still looking for clinical partners — maybe in Hyderabad, Delhi, and even Kolkata. Anywhere between 100 to 400 patients will be enrolled for the trials,” said Dr Chandrashekhar.Only adult patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 at risk of complications will be enrolled for the trials. The application for conducting the trials has been submitted to the Drug Controller General of India, he said.“The current collaboration with Mylan is a significant milestone during the current Covid-19 pandemic. CSIR {Council of Scientific and Industrial Research} has prioritized conducting clinical trials of well-proven drugs in partnership with industry towards the development of multiple therapeutic options for Covid-19,” said Dr Shekhar Mande, director general of CSIR, in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iict-partners-with-mylan-for-combination-therapy-trials/story-JjtQt9HznZ2Iy2LtuLWObL.html
23-09-2020||India||CM Mamata invites flak from BJP for seeking Ayushman Bharat, Kisan Samman Nidhi funds||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has drawn flak and ridicule from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for saying that she is willing to implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme for farmers and the Ayushman Bharat Yojana healthcare scheme if the funds are transferred to her government for disbursement. Banerjee said this in her letters to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on September 9. Under these schemes, the Centre transfers money directly to bank accounts of beneficiaries. Banerjee’s letters were released on social media by the state government on Tuesday afternoon while the BJP was heightening its campaign, accusing her of depriving millions of farmers of the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme against the backdrop of her opposition to the farmers’ bills passed by the Parliament. Banerjee also said in her letter to Dr Harsh Vardhan that the Centre would have to bear 100 per cent cost of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana since the state government spends a huge amount of money on free treatment at government hospitals and an insurance cover for treatment of critical diseases at private hospitals. BJP leaders and even governor Jagdeep Dhankhar have said that if the funds were directly given to the state there could be misappropriation. “The chief minister wants the money so that it can be pocketed to fight the coming assembly polls. Relief funds given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after Cyclone Amphan was misappropriated by TMC leaders,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said in Delhi. Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national information technology cell, taunted Banerjee and her nephew, Lok Sabha member Abhisek Banerjee, by referring to them as ‘Pishi’ (aunt) and ‘Bhaipo’ (nephew) in his tweet on Wednesday. “Under pressure, Mamata Banerjee writes to Centre, says WB ready to disburse PM Kisan Samman Nidhi ‘provided’ money is transferred to the state government. Pishi, heard of DBT? No Bhaipo in between, no cut money either. Money will go directly to farmers and not to TMC workers,” wrote Malviya. In West Bengal, the term ‘cut money’ is synonymous with bribe or commission. In his tweet, Governor Dhankhar also talked of corruption and asked why the chief minister wants to be an intermediary. “Hallmark of #PM-KISAN is transparent direct transfer of fund to farmer without intermediary and cut. Government @MamataOfficial wants to be its agent intermediary. For what! OMG- fishing for opportunity #MAP. Glaring injustice and corruption #AmphanRelief and PDS an open secret,” Dhankhar tweeted, tagging the chief minister. The TMC reacted by saying that Banerjee asked for the funds purely to uphold the spirit of the country’s federal structure. “The allegations being made by the BJP are baseless. The chief minister wants to uphold the spirit of federalism. In any scheme, the beneficiary should get the money from the state government. Direct transfer to bank accounts of beneficiaries will help the BJP create a political influence. This cannot be allowed,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and spokesperson Saugata Roy. “If the Centre intends to give the money let it do so through the state. That would be subscribing to the federal structure laid down by the Constitution,” said Roy. The Bengal unit of the BJP on Wednesday even started posting on its social media page short videos to target the chief minister. Made with selected clippings from televised footage, the videos showed Banerjee expressing her apprehension about the plight farmers might face because of the new bills and the Prime Minister dismissing her charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-invites-flak-from-bjp-for-seeking-ayushman-bharat-kisan-samman-nidhi-funds/story-eF7TCwnFJebLbwJ5KQXN0L.html

23-09-2020||India||G4 countries call for urgent steps for reform of UN and Security Council||The G4 countries – Brazil, India, Japan and Germany – on Wednesday expressed disappointment at attempts to derail reforms of the United Nations and called for text-based negotiations within a fixed timeframe to revamp the world body. The foreign ministers of the four countries, during a virtual meeting during the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, highlighted the urgency of reforming the world body and updating its main decision-making bodies to better reflect contemporary realities. The move is in line with India’s position on the reforms of the UN, including the expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council, its main decision-making organ. The foreign ministers – Brazil’s Ernesto Araújo, India’s S Jaishankar, Japan’s Motegi Toshimitsu and Germany’s minister of state in the federal foreign office, Niels Annen, who represented foreign minister Heiko Maas, said the declaration adopted by all heads of state and government on the 75th anniversary of the UN reaffirmed the “common resolve to finally take decisive steps towards the early and comprehensive reform of the Security Council”. Jaishankar tweeted that the G4 ministers had “called for a decisive push for UNSC reforms during #UN75”. He said there was a “unanimous call for text-based negotiations in a fixed timeframe” and India’s approach to the UN is guided by reformed multilateralism. In a joint statement, the G4 ministers noted that the declaration said the “world of today is very different from what it was when the United Nations was created 75 years ago. There are more countries, more people, more challenges but also more solutions. Our working methods need to keep pace and adapt.” “In keeping with this call, G4 Ministers highlighted the urgency of reforming the United Nations and updating its main decision-making bodies, in order to better reflect contemporary realities,” the joint statement said. The ministers also “expressed disappointment at attempts to derail this process and committed to addressing the issue in a meaningful way and with increased urgency at this 75th anniversary of the UN”. They also said the expansion of the Security Council in both categories “will be indispensable to make this body more representative, legitimate and effective, enhancing therefore its capacity to deal with the complex challenges the world faces today on questions of international peace and security”. The ministers insisted that only the reform of the Security Council will stop the body “from becoming obsolete”. Broader membership of the Security Council, “with increased and enhanced representation of countries with the capacity and willingness to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, including from Africa, will allow it to preserve its credibility and create the political backing needed for the peaceful resolution of today’s international crises”, the joint statement said. The G4 countries have backed each other’s candidature for permanent membership of an expanded Security Council. Except for China, all the other P5 countries – the US, the UK, France and Russia – have also offered unstinted support for India’s membership of the Security Council. The G4 ministers also expressed concern at the lack of “any meaningful movement forward in the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on Security Council reform and expressed their concern that – after two sessions in February and March – the IGN was adjourned due to Covid-19 and no further meetings were held”. They said these negotiations lack the “necessary openness and transparency” and are constrained by flawed working methods. They further said they were convinced the “time has come to leave behind debates based solely on general statements, without substantive text based negotiations actually taking place in an intergovernmental setting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g4-countries-call-for-urgent-steps-for-reform-of-un-and-security-council/story-Ma6tZlvhBDUmNQGpAAD2ZP.html
23-09-2020||India||Twitter, Facebook arbitrarily censuring ‘nationalistic’ content: BJP MP||BJP member Tejasvi Surya on Wednesday raised the issue of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook allegedly arbitrarily censuring content posted by users, especially those with a “nationalistic approach” and sought government intervention for protection of such content.Raising the issue during Zero Hour in Lok Sabha, Surya said for a long time there have been many “credible” allegations made against Twitter, Facebook and their affiliates of “arbitrary and unilateral regulation and censuring” of content posted by third party users, especially those with a “nationalistic approach”.“This poses a significant constitutional challenge not only on the grounds of unreasonable restriction of free speech but also amounts to illegal interference during elections,” he said.The MP said Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms claim themselves to be intermediaries within the meaning of the term under the IT Act, 2000.He said the key element of this definition is that the role of the said intermediaries is limited to processing, storing and transmitting data of third party users and does not include intervention on content of the users. Therefore, Section 79 of the Act provides these intermediaries exemption from liability. An intermediary receives protection that a regular publisher does not receive, he said.Surya said while this is the explicit spirit of the statute, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, while laying down what sort of third party content must be prohibited by the privacy policy and terms and conditions of the intermediary, goes far beyond the remit of Article 19(2) of the Constitution read with Section 79 and 69 of the IT Act. Article 19(2) of the Constitution authorises the government to impose, by law, reasonable restrictions upon the freedom of speech and expression “in the interests of… public order”, whereas section 69 of the IT Act allows the government to intercept any information and ask for information decryption.Surya said the guidelines essentially empower private party intermediaries to remove on the basis of user complaints or suo moto any content deemed to be in violation of its guidelines.He said these guidelines are not only ultra vires the parent statute but also unconstitutional as the grounds they provide are too wide and will fail the standards of constitutionality set out by the Supreme Court in the Shreya Singhal case while striking down Sec 66A of the IT Act (which provided police the power to arrest a person for posting “offensive” content online). The guidelines are problematic because they empower private enterprises performing essentially a public function to act as censors of free speech without government oversight, thus effectively and severely impacting safeguards of the fundamental right to free speech, he said. “I therefore urge the government to repeal such unconstitutional guidelines and issue new ones to govern social media platforms, thereby protecting the fundamental right to free speech of our citizens and protect our democracy from foreign interference,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-facebook-arbitrarily-censuring-nationalistic-content-bjp-mp/story-Gb2UgoT1cHAA12yv3AbdzI.html
23-09-2020||India||Analysis of quakes in and around Delhi in past 20 yrs doesn’t show any definite pattern: Vardhan||An analysis of the earthquakes which occurred in and around Delhi in the past 20 years did not show any definite pattern in the frequency of the quakes which could suggest an increase in seismic activity, Union Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday.A total of 745 earthquakes have been recorded by the National Seismological Network, including 26 such events in the National Capital Region (NCR), during the last three years (September 2017 to August 2020) with magnitude three and above (on the Richter scale), the minister said.In a written response to a question in Lok Sabha, Vardhan said during the last few months (April 12 to July 3, 2020), four earthquakes of magnitude in the range of 3.3 to 4.7; and 13 smaller earthquakes, including the aftershocks (magnitude 2.5- 3), were recorded in NCR.He, however, said it is difficult to state that any increase in seismicity is an indicator of likely occurrence of major earthquakes.“An analysis carried out by the National Centre for Seismology (NCS), an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, on past 20 years’ earthquakes which occurred in and around Delhi, does not show any definite pattern in frequency of earthquake occurrence which could suggest any increase in earthquake activity,” Vardhan said.However, during the recent years, seismic monitoring over Delhi has improved considerably and even lower magnitude events are automatically detected and disseminated quickly through NCS website and mobile application.“It is perhaps giving the impression of enhanced earthquake activity in the region, which was otherwise not noticed earlier. It is difficult to state that any increase in seismicity is an indicator of a likely occurrence of a major earthquake,” he said.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded 198 quakes during this period (September 2017 to August 2020), while Jammu and Kashmir registered 98 tremors. Both are known to areas with high seismic activities, the minister told the Lower House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/analysis-of-quakes-in-and-around-delhi-in-past-20-yrs-doesn-t-show-any-definite-pattern-vardhan/story-ydMM44mOedyHGrJsJrUMWJ.html

District superintendent of police Sunil Dutt said the encounter took place in the forests of Chennapuram of Cherla block at around 7 pm, when the security forces were engaged in combing operations following information that a team of Maoists was moving in the forests. “In the exchange of fire between the Maoists and the special party police forces, three Maoists, including two women, were killed. Some more Maoists escaped from the spot,” the SP said. The police recovered an 8 mm rifle, kit bags and explosive material from the encounter spot, alongside the bodies of the Maoists.

23-09-2020||India||Jagan Reddy’s Tirumala visit kicks up a row, protests follow||YSR Congress Party president and chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday visited the popular hill shrine of Lord Venkateshwara at Tirumala in Chittoor district without signing the mandatory declaration proclaiming his faith in the presiding deity, leading to protests from Hindu groups and opposition parties. The chief minister, who arrived in Tirumala straightaway from New Delhi, was accorded a rousing reception at the temple. He wore traditional attire of a Hindu devotee, sported the “Thiru Namam” (the Vaishnavite style of tilak on the forehead) and carried the silk clothes on his head into the temple to present them to the Lord on behalf of the state government, amidst chanting of Vedic hymns. However, Jagan, a protestant Christian by faith, ignored the demands of the Hindu groups and the opposition parties, including Bharatiya Janata Party, Telugu Desam Party and the Congress, that he should follow the decades-old tradition of signing the declaration form meant for non-Hindus stating that he has faith in Lord Venkateshwara. Though Jagan had visited Tirumala several times in the past without signing the mandatory declaration, it kicked up controversy this time following a statement from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams trust board chairman that there was no need for non-Hindus to sign the declaration compulsorily and as such, Jagan didn’t have to sign the same. The TTD chairman’s statement triggered massive protests from Hindu groups. On Wednesday, activists of Bajrang Dal tried to lay siege to Jagan’s Lotus Pond residence at Banjara Hills in Hyderabad and courted arrests. A tense atmosphere prevailed in Tirupati, where the police took hundreds of TDP and BJP leaders and activists into preventive custody as they planned to take out protest rallies on the occasion of the chief minister’s visit. TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu demanded that Jagan should respect the temple traditions and sign the declaration meant for non-Hindus. He also demanded that as per the traditions, Jagan should also be accompanied by his wife Bharati. He accused the Jagan government of hurting the sentiments of Hindus. Popular seer of Sri Peetham Swamy Paripoornananda told reporters in Hyderabad that Jagan should respect the feelings of the Hindus, as he would not lose anything by signing the declaration. However, YSRCP leaders rejected the demand of the opposition parties and Hindu groups. State civil supplies minister Kodali Nani questioned the propriety of imposing such a rule in Tirumala. “Only those who have faith in Lord Venkateshwara come to Tirumala temple. Why should anybody declare their faith again?” he asked. He said the BJP leaders should first advice Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the temples along with his wife. “When Modi can go alone to Ayodhya temple to lay foundation stone, why should Jagan bring his wife to the Tirumala temple?” he asked. BJP leaders fumed at the minister and demanded that Jagan should immediately sack him from the cabinet. “We should not rest till Kodali Nani is sacked from the cabinet for insulting Modi,” BJP national spokesman and MP GVL Narasimha Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-tirumala-visit-kicks-up-a-row-protests-follow/story-bGSUHyJLC26pU0s1w1xJON.html

23-09-2020||India||Delhi govt asks ‘willing’ staff from other hospitals to join its 3 new facilities||The Delhi government has called for “willing” medical personnel from its existing hospitals to apply to work at two of its newly operationalised hospitals in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar, and another one yet to open in Dwarka. There have been no new appointments for the hospitals in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar, which is being run by already diverted staff from other hospitals. The two hospitals together have 500 beds for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Presently, health and family welfare department has deputed staff (medical, nursing, and paramedical) in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar hospitals on diverted capacity from other government hospitals. Now, this department intends to post willing staff in the aforesaid hospitals,” read a circular by the deputy-secretary (Human Resources-Medical) Surinder Narang. The circular has asked all medical superintendents to send a list of staff willing to be posted at the three new hospitals within two weeks. The 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, which is the biggest Covid-19 treatment facility in the city, has also diverted staff to the hospitals. “We have already sent 15 of our nurses to the hospital in Burari. Now, we are looking at staff who live near these areas to join the three hospitals,” said a senior official from the hospital management. The doctors from the hospital have reported severe shortage of staff, especially to run the intensive care unit. “We just have 33 senior residents in the anaesthesia department who run two ICUs, the operation theatres in the hospital, and the operation theatre at the trauma centre in civil lines. The doctors are burnt out now,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-asks-willing-staff-from-other-hospitals-to-join-its-3-new-facilities/story-oyPbGyXNje38S4RKRqgacO.html
23-09-2020||India||School toilets without handwashing facilities in 15 states: CAG report||Over half of the government school toilets built by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) do not have even the basic hand-washing facility, an even greater necessity in Covid-19 affected times, a survey of over 2,000 schools by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found.Lack of running water, poor maintenance and unavailability of separate toilets for girls too continue to affect school students, according to the CAG report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.The report mentions that the HRD ministry (now named the Education ministry) had under the Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan (SVA) sought help of CPSEs for construction of toilets in government schools. Separate toilets for boys and girls have also been suggested under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 (RTE Act) norms.As many as 53 CPSEs participated and constructed 1,40,997 toilets.Seven CPSEs - NTPC, PGCIL, NHPC, PFC, REC, ONGC and CIL - constructed 1,30,703 toilets at a cost of Rs 2,162.60 crore. The CAG examined the construction of toilets by these seven by surveying 2,695 toilets across 2048 schools in 15 States.According to the findings, the CPSEs did not construct 83 toilets though these toilets were identified by them for construction. Of the remaining 2,612 toilets which were reported to have been constructed, 200 toilets were not found constructed in the respective schools and 86 toilets were only partially built.“The non-existing and partially constructed toilets constituted 11 % of toilets surveyed,” the CAG report pointed out.Of the 1,967 coeducational schools, 99 schools had no functional toilets while 436 schools had only one functional toilet. The aim of providing separate toilets for boys and girls was not fulfilled in 535 schools, a sizeable 27 % of the sample.Out of 2,326 constructed toilets surveyed, 691 or 30% were found not in use mainly due to lack of running water, lack of cleaning arrangements, damages or other reasons like use of toilets for other purposes.During the survey, 1,679 (72 %) out of 2,326 constructed toilets were found without running water.Further, hand washing facility was not available in 1,279 (55 per cent) out of 2,326 constructed toilets, according to the report.There were also cases of defective construction of toilets, non-provision of foundation/ramp/staircase and damaged/overflowed leach pit etc.The audit also found that proper maintenance or sanitation was not available in 1,812 out of 2,326 toilets. 715 out of 1,812 toilets were not being cleaned. 1,097 toilets were being cleaned twice in a week to once in a month.Thus, 75 per cent of selected toilets were not maintained hygienically. Cases of non-provision of soap, bucket, cleaning agents and disinfectants in toilets and inadequate cleanliness of pathway were also noticed, the report found.The CAG recommended the concerned ministries to look into the issue of non-existing and incomplete toilets that were claimed as constructed. It also asked the Navratanas and the ministries to address absence of basic amenities in the toilets like running water, hand wash facility, urinals, drainage of waste water, etc.Since the audit survey covered 2 per cent of total toilets, the CPSEs are advised to review the remaining 98 per cent toilets and take appropriate action, the report said.The report also found that the Power and Coal ministries as well as the ONGC declared construction of 1,30,703 toilets by the selected seven CPSEs on time (15 August 2015). However, as per MHRD data and the Swachhta Status Report (2016) of the National Sample Survey Office, the CPSEs constructed all the approved toilets as of 1 March 2016 and the number of toilets completed by these seven CPSEs was 1,19,530.Comparison of the two reported figures indicated that the figures for number of toilets completed was overstated to the extent 11,173 toilets by power and coal ministries, it said.The report also mentioned that pre-fabricated structures were used for constructing many toilets leading to extra expenditure, dilution in durability and non-compliance with direction.The audit also found that some of the CPSEs appointed implementing agencies on nomination basis which was not in accordance with the directions. Further, the agencies were paid implementation charges at 10 to 15 per cent of completion cost which were high as compared to 2.5 to 3 per cent paid to State Government Agencies (SGAs) and involved an extra expenditure of Rs 49.30 crore, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-without-handwashing-facilities-in-15-states-reveals-cag-report/story-JlshSR01lfPuLHsIbHGrjK.html

However, Congress MLC Govindraj alleged that in spite of the metro rail work being completed and a letter written to reinstall the statue in 2017, no action had been taken. He was supported by several of his party colleagues who accused the ruling party of disrespect being shown to a national leader.Even as fisheries minister Kota Srinivasa Poojary said that “the government would look into the matter” several Congress legislators protested leading to the CM later giving a written response that it would find a suitable spot to reinstall the statue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nehru-s-statue-to-be-reinstalled-in-karnataka-vidhana-soudha-assures-cm-yediyurappa/story-0ErY1RnqgzMVZRghhMAPUO.html
23-09-2020||India||‘Railways resorted to window dressing to show operating ratio in better light’: CAG||The ministry of railways took to “window dressing” for presenting its working expenses and operating ratio in a “better light”, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said in a report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.The operating ratio measures expenses as a proportion of revenue or the amount spent on every rupee earned. A higher ratio indicates poor ability to generate surplus.In December last, the auditor had said the Railways had the worst operating ratio in the last ten years at 98.44% and its revenue surplus had decreased by more than 66% from Rs 4,913 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,665.61 crore in 2017-18.Against the target of 92.8 per cent in the budget estimates, the operating of railways was 97.29 per cent in 2018-19. This meant that railways spent Rs 97.29 to earn Rs 100, the CAG noted.“However, if advance freight of Rs 8,351 crore from NTPC and CONCOR was not included in the earnings of 2018-19, or would have been 101.77 per cent instead of 97.29 per cent. The Net surplus in 2018-19 was Rs 3,773.86 crore. The railways would have ended with a negative balance of Rs 7,334.85 crore but for receipt of advance freight and less appropriation to DRF and Pension Fund. The Ministry of Railways (MoR) resorted to window dressing for presenting the working expenses and operating ratio in a better light,” the CAG report on railways’ finances noted. During 2018-19, the railways generated total internal earnings of Rs 1,90,507 crore against the targeted internal earnings of Rs 2,01,090 crore, the report noted.“The Railways could not achieve even revised estimate target of Rs 1,97,214 crore. The total internal earnings also included freight advance of Rs 8,351 crore received from NTPC and CONCOR for transportation of goods in 2019-20,” it added.The national auditor also raised concerns over delays in projects over the past five years due to inefficiency of zones and weak monitoring by the railway board.“Projects were to be completed during 2015-20. However, due to inefficiency of Zonal Railways and weak monitoring at the Railway Board level, the progress of projects was slow,” the report said.The CAG also raised doubts over railways’ utilisation of its Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) for financing projects which started from 2015-16 onward. Scrutiny of records relating to 395 projects funded from EBR revealed that 268 projects were still in progress as on 31 March 2019. This had resulted in a blockade of Rs 48,536 crore EBR funds besides defeating the intended objective of generation of revenue for debt servicing, the CAG noted.“Ministry of railways resorted to Extra Budgetary Resources for project financing from 2015-16 onwards. Financial assistance of Rs 1.50 lakh crore was agreed to by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) over a period of five years (2015-20). Audit observed that the financing arrangement with LIC materialized partially due to regulatory constraints. During 2015-19, only ` 16,200 crore could be raised from LIC. MoR recouped the shortfall of Rs 49,164 crore by raising funds through short-term/medium term market borrowings which carry a higher rate of interest,” it said.The national auditor said there were instances of irregular utilisation to the tune of Rs 1,495 crore from EBR funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-resorted-to-window-dressing-to-show-operating-ratio-in-better-light-cag/story-NZbgQvGUJXTVdEBTx4zKuM.html
23-09-2020||India||Bengal CM Mamata inaugurates green projects to be built in collaboration with EU countries||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday virtually inaugurated two major green projects worth around Rs 1226 crore to be built by European Union countries in Kolkata and East Midnapore district. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) for these projects were signed at the global business summit held at the beach town of Digha in East Midnapore in December 2019. The ambassadors of Italy, Netherlands and the European Union and the deputy ambassador of Germany took part in the virtual inauguration. One project involves waste management and sustainable development at the Kolkata Leather Complex at Bantala in the eastern outskirts of the city. It involves foreign investment worth three million Euros (around Rs 26 crore), said the chief minister and will be built in collaboration with Dutch partners. The second is a solar power project worth Rs 1200 crore to be set up in East Midnapore by a German company. The West Bengal government will invest Rs 200 crore in the project. Once complete, it will generate 350 million units of power annually. “I am happy to announce that the projects are being inaugurated within six months of signing the MoU. Where there is a will there is a way. The leather complex project will create five lakh jobs and help medium, small and micro enterprises grow. Several leather companies from other states have also set up units at Bantala,” said Banerjee. State finance minister Amit Mitra said the solar power project will save the climate from 50,000 tons of carbon emission every year. “Sustainability is the way to go forward in future. We look forward to friends and partners. India is the largest exporter of leather goods in the world and Europe is the largest market,” said Ugo Astuto, the EU ambassador to India. Addressing Banerjee, Italian ambassador to India Vincenzo de Luca said, “Without your leadership we could not have promoted our objective in West Bengal and could not have been able to share our expertise and technology. The challenge is to promote green energy in India and Europe.” Marten van den Berg, the ambassador of Netherlands, said, “We look forward to work internationally with West Bengal, Italy, Germany and European Union.” For Banerjee, who has been accused on numerous occasions by the opposition parties of failing to bring in foreign investment despite her trips to many countries since 2011, Wednesday’s development could help the Trinamool Congress politically in the run-up to the assembly polls to be held in 2021. Recently, even governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had taken up the issue and sought details of the outcome of the Global Business Summit that the state government holds every year. “WORRISOME (ELOQUENT) SILENCE of otherwise vocal FM @MamataOfficial on details of Bengal Global Business Summit speaks volumes. Baffling- Why not give details of claimed ‘resounding success’ investment of over Rs 12.30 lakh crores investment! Is there nothing to showcase!” Dhankhar tweeted on August 31. “Surely there should be accountability of spending crores on ‘futile’ extravaganza @MamataOfficial. Corruption by way of favoritism and patronage calls for probe. My worst fear- was it ‘dream merchant’ affair! Just a PR exercise! Awaiting CM response!” he said in another tweet, tagging the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-inaugurates-green-projects-to-be-built-in-collaboration-with-eu-countries/story-oQoYq2zjnCR516QdtNVieL.html
23-09-2020||India||As RS clears bills amid Oppn boycott, Naidu defends action; expresses anguish at ‘unpleasant turn of events’||Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said it is “extremely unpalatable” when bills are passed amid a boycott of proceedings by some sections of the House, but not taking up legislative work in such a situation may legitimise their action as an “instrument of blocking legislation”. He was speaking before adjourning the Upper House sine die, eight days ahead of schedule, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rajya Sabha passed 15 bills in the last two sittings with opposition parties boycotting the proceedings to protest the suspension of eight members on Monday for their “unruly” behaviour in the House during the passage of two key farm bills. “Though it is not the first time that some members are suspended and bills are passed when some sections of the House boycott the proceedings, I find it extremely unpalatable. “This kind of situation needs to be avoided by all means,” Naidu said in his remarks on the conclusion of the 252nd session of Rajya Sabha. Expressing concern over the conduct of some of the members, he said it was “deeply painful” and all need to “collectively ponder” over these issues.Naidu, who has been associated with the Upper House for the last 22 years, said he gets anguished whenever bills are passed in the din.Over the suspension on the eight members, Naidu said rules of the House do provide for such action when it becomes inevitable. “If legislative work is not taken up during the boycott by some sections of the House, it may legitimise such boycott as an effective instrument of blocking legislation,” he said. Naidu said the House had to hold 18 sittings but it held only 10. “We have to conclude this session eight sittings ahead of the scheduled 18 sittings as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to challenge humankind across the globe even after nine months of its outbreak,” he said.The Chairman also said that for the first time in the history of Upper House, a notice of motion for removal of the Deputy Chairman has been given, which was rejected by him. “The developments in the House surrounding this unprecedented move have been deeply painful for all those who hold the stature and the dignity of this august House dear to their hearts,” he said Most of the opposition including the Congress, Left parties, the TMC, the Samajwadi Party and the NCP had decided to boycott House proceedings in protest against the suspension of the eight MPs Terming it an “unpleasant turn of events”, Naidu appealed to members to ensure that “such unseemly behaviour is not repeated”. “I am naturally more pained to see that happen as the chairman of this august House. It hurts me the most when the Chair is rendered helpless by the turn of events and has to perforce take action against the members as per the rules,” said Naidu. Earlier in the day, the House passed key bills including three on labour reforms, two Appropriation Bills and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment. Naidu said the 10-day session was productive and as many as 25 bills were passed and six were introduced. “The productivity of the House during this session has been 100.47 per cent. As against the scheduled available time of 38 hours and 30 minutes, the actual functional time of the House has been 38 hours and 41 minutes,” said Naidu. Though the Upper house has lost three hours and 15 minutes due to disruptions, it sat for an extra three hours and 26 minutes. “The new normal of high productivity witnessed during the last three sessions has continued during this session as well,” he said, adding “as a result, the overall productivity of the last 4 sessions comes to a praiseworthy 96.13 per cent. This high productivity for four consecutive sessions is the best during the last 5 years.” In this 252nd session, the Upper House has spent 22 hours 03 minutes on discussions over the government’s legislative proposals during these 10 sittings, which is a record 57 per cent of the total functional time of the House during this session. Besides, 1,567 unstarred questions were replied to in writing by the government “Members raised issues of urgent public importance through 92 Zero Hour and 66 Special Mentions on which a total time of four hours 15 minutes was spent, accounting for 10.99 per cent of the total functional time of the House,” he said. Despite the pandemic, 198 members participated in the discussion on various Bills During the session, Rajya Sabha had done readjustment of the sitting patterns to maintain social distance. It functioned from six different locations including the chambers of both the Houses - Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and four galleries of the upper house. “We are living in extraordinary times warranting several adjustments requiring us to live a new normal life,” he said. The Monsoon session had started on September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-rs-clears-bills-amid-oppn-boycott-naidu-defends-action-expresses-anguish-at-unpleasant-turn-of-events/story-m5DJT5xM4mvnwX4rOsnnxK.html

The top court said that the steps taken by the government in pursuance to the show cause notice against the channel will be subject to the orders of the court. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that Sudarshan TV has to give reply to the show cause notice by September 28, failing which an ex parte decision will be taken. “During the course of the hearing today, Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India stated that the Central Government has, in exercise of the power conferred upon it by sub-section (3) of Section 20 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995, issued a notice to show cause dated September 23, to ‘Sudarshan News’,” the bench said in its order. It said that since the notice is stated to be ‘returnable’ on September 28, Mehta has requested the Court to defer the hearing in the present case so as to enable the central government to take a considered view of the matter. Since the notice has been issued today, the hearing is deferred to October 5, the court said. It added: “The notice shall be dealt with in accordance with law and the Central Government shall submit a report to this Court indicating the outcome of the notice. “Since the notice has been issued during the pendency of these proceedings, further steps in pursuance of the notice to show cause shall be subject to the result of the present proceedings and to such orders as may be passed by this Court.” The top court also said that its interim order of September 15, 2020 (injuncting the telecast of remaining episodes of the programme) shall continue to remain in operation pending further orders. During the brief hearing, Mehta said that the four page notice to the channel has sought an explanation on various points regarding violation of the programme code and why action should not be taken against it. The detailed notice under Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995 has been issued today itself, showing facts that are, according to the government, prima facie not in accordance with the programme code, he said. The bench observed that if the case wasn’t heard by the court then all episodes would have been aired by now. At the outset, it asked intervenors in the matter to file written submissions, if any. On September 21, the top court had pondered over the nature and extent of its order regulating ‘Bindas Bol’ programme on alleged infiltration of Muslims in bureaucracy saying it did not want to “curtail” freedom of speech as the programme has “public interest” involved on issues of “foreign funding” and “reservation”. The apex court, which has already imposed the pre-telecast ban on episodes of ‘UPSC Jehad’ on a plea raising grievances against it on grounds including hate speech, was irked over the fact that the channel, in his affidavit, has named one English news Channel for running two shows on Hindu terror earlier.   “Why have you said about the programmes (of the English news channel)? Who asked about your opinion about the programmes,” it had said. Lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke, had said that his affidavit contained reference of the English Channel and their programmes on Hindu terror as he was asked earlier as to why the ‘UPSC Jehad’ episodes have “shown Muslim men in skull caps and wearing greens”. The bench then said: “Does this mean that every time, the judges asked questions you will shoot your mouth with your views? If that is the case then judges will stop asking questions. You are not supposed to file affidavits on all the questions which judges ask. Judges ask questions to elicit a better response.” On being told by the petitioners that the episodes have violated the programme code under cable TV rules, the top court pondered over the extent of control and curb which can be imposed by it through its orders. “This programme (‘Bindas Bol’) has public interest involved on (issues of) foreign funding or on reservation. If we are to issue injunction (stay) then what kind of injunction will be like, whether it should be a blanket injunction. There is also public interest involved with it,” the bench had observed. The top court had observed that constitutional values, human dignity are needed to be protected but the court cannot “become the enforcers of programme code”. Earlier, the top court had questioned Sudarshan TV over its programme asking whether the media can be allowed to “target whole set of communities”.   It had asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the National Broadcasters Association to give suggestions for strengthening the “self-regulating mechanism” of NBA for electronic media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/programme-code-violation-by-sudarshan-tv-issued-show-cause-notice-centre-tells-sc/story-K9mIsLgDhcnB8Qi43jqqnN.html

Bijapur witnessed 10 killings, including six civilians. These killings are a matter of serious concern for both the senior police officials and human rights activists working in the Maoist-hit region.On Wednesday, a 22-year-old villager was killed by Maoists on suspicion of being a police informer in Jagargonda area of Sukma district. Similarly, a villager was killed in Bijapur on Tuesday for the same reason.Police officers posted in the region said that there are several reasons for the increase in killings by the Maoist cadres.“The state policy of going soft on frontal organisations of Maoists in the past one year has emboldened militia commanders. Second, the Maoists have realised that they have suffered heavy casualties in past few years due intelligence-based operations conducted by security forces. The intelligence is mainly human intelligence, so Maoists have started a brutal campaign to eliminate civilians,” said a senior intelligence officer.An IPS officer posted in one of seven districts of Bastar region said that Maoists are now not afraid of any public outcry over killings of civilians.“Maoists want to create an environment of fear among villagers which can help them increase recruitment. There has been a decrease in recruitment of sentries in 2017-18. The other very important factor behind the killings is that there is total indiscipline in ranks of Maoists, with local cadres now doing mass executions without even taking approval of senior cadres. And lastly, there is total ideological disarray with movement becoming an armed war with no ethics,” the officer added.Sunderaj P, Inspector General of Police ( Bastar range ), said that as a result of conducting an effective campaign against Maoists, many of their camps were demolished.“Realising that there is no future in Maoism, a large number of Maoists have also surrendered due to which the Maoists are frustrated and are trying to terrorise by killing and beating innocent villagers,” said the IG.He further said that roads, bridges, culverts and other basic facilities have been provided to the villagers in the Bastar region in the last few years even in situations of lockdown and floods, which has increased the confidence of the villagers in governance, administration and security forces.“They panicked after losing the confidence of the villagers and they are killing them,” said the IG.Another IPS officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that for Maoists this is part of their extreme terror strategy.“The present government is not that aggressive in comparison to the earlier one towards Maoists. Hence in 2016-17, the recruitment almost stopped. Now due to government policies, many lower cadres are surrendering and villagers are supporting the government which is rattling them,” said the officer.What activists and tribal leaders say about the increase in killing?Human Right Activist Bela Bhatia said the killings going on in Bastar should be condemned.“Maoist killings of ‘police informers’ must also be condemned. Most of those who get implicated are also from the same villages or area, often the same ethnicity and class. The police put a lot of pressure on locals for information and some people do succumb. The question is whether these villagers have a choice in the matter. Can they say ‘No’ to the police? or the Maoists?,” Bhatia said.Soni Sori, the tribal leader of Bastar division, also said that Maoists should be condemned for the killing.“I don’t know why Maoists are killing villagers but this should be stopped. If Maoists claim they are here for tribals why are they killing them? Maoist should answer this question? Second, most of the killings took place in Bijapur district from where I am getting information that local police, specifically district reserve guard ( DRG) are beating common villagers which should also be condemned,” said Sori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-killings-by-maoists-in-chhattisgarh-s-bastar-raises-questions/story-fy30XCe6izKPS6CtOkgUaL.html
23-09-2020||India||India, Sri Lanka to hold virtual bilateral summit on September 26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa will hold a virtual bilateral summit on September 26, their first official engagement after parliamentary elections in the island nation last month. The implementation of developmental projects by India, cooperation on counter-terrorism and defence matters, trade, and the devolution of powers to Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority are expected to figure in the talks, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. “The virtual bilateral summit will give an opportunity to the two leaders to comprehensively review the broad framework of the bilateral relationship soon after the parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka and in the context of the time-tested friendly ties between the two countries,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Rajapaksa began a fresh term as prime minister after his Sri Lanka People’s Front party secured a two-thirds majority in parliamentary polls in August. In July, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), though New Delhi is yet to take a call on Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had sought the special swap facility of $1.1 billion during a phone conversation with Modi in May. President Rajapaksa also made it clear recently that Sri Lanka’s strategic security policy will have an “India first” approach though Colombo remains open to dealing with other key players for economic development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sri-lanka-to-hold-virtual-bilateral-summit-on-september-26/story-ggqmh9TZYuAvpnzLQHZnUK.html

We have to understand that when the government says something in the Parliament, it is a sovereign promise to people of the nation,” Irani was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Upper House of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) on Sunday cleared two key agriculture reform bills amid protests and uproar by Opposition parties. The Opposition, led by Congress, boycotted Parliament on Tuesday after Centre refused to accept its demand for withdrawal of the bills. Recalling the Swaminathan Report, Irani took a dig at the Congress and applauded Modi government for implementing the recommendations made in the report and giving 1.5 timers higher minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.“Congress in its 10 years in power didn’t implement the Swaminathan Report. Modi government implemented the report and gave 1.5 times higher MSP. Under Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme, more than Rs 90,000 crore was transferred into the accounts of more than 10 crore farmers,” Irani said, as quoted by ANI.Irani also slammed the Opposition for standing against the farm bills. “The bills allow the farmers to trade their produce freely, secures the farmers’ land and ensures that traders have to mandatorily pay farmers within maximum three days. Then why is the Opposition opposing these bills?” she added.The Opposition has, meanwhile, decided to press for the withdrawal of the bills. Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad met President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday, urging him to not sign the bills.The Congress party has also decided to launch a nationwide protest from Thursday demanding that the bills should be taken back by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-committed-to-farmers-welfare-smriti-irani-slams-opposition-for-protesting-against-farm-bills/story-mF5BpOaPApgjwJR59lMFhN.html

He appreciated the efforts being made by the states to check the spread of the disease and also announced increasing the cap on the amount they can spend from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF).“Today, I announce that the states can spend 50 per cent of the SDRF amount on efforts to check the spread of Covid-19. This limit was earlier 35 per cent,” PM Modi said.He also emphasised that micro zones should be formed for effective management of the coronavirus disease.PM Modi further highlighted the importance of masks and said it is a very important tool in fight against Covid-19.“We need to increase our focus on effective testing, tracing, treatment, surveillance and clear messaging,” said PM Modi.“Effective messaging is also necessary because most Covid-19 infections are without symptoms. In such a situation, rumours may rise. It might raise doubts in the minds of the people that testing is bad. Some people also make mistake of underestimating the severity of infection,” he added.The Prime Minister said that India has said that India has ensured the supply of life-saving medicines all over the world even in difficult times. “We have to work together to see that the medicines easily reach from one state to another,” he further said.The states with high Covid-19 caseload are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Punjab. The Union health ministry said that more than 63 per of the active cases in the country are concentrated in these states.They also account for 65.5 per cent of the total confirmed cases and 77 per cent of the total deaths, a statement had said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-now-use-50-of-state-disaster-relief-fund-cap-of-35-removed-pm-modi-says-in-meeting-on-covid-19-with-chief-ministers/story-eNDL3f013GcO2d76Ts8R8J.html

The next day, the number of home isolation cases dropped to 18,464, according to data shared by the Delhi health department.Since last week of August, both the number of home isolation cases and containment zones have shown a steadily rise, except on September 19 when the count of home isolation cases was 18,648, a very marginal fall from the previous day’s figure of 18,701.However, this Tuesday, for the first time in nearly 30 days, home isolation case count fell by a sizeable margin of 749, to 18,646.Experts feel the drop could be due to two reasons, with a senior doctor at a Delhi government-run dedicated Covid-19 facility asserting that home isolation as been very effective in managing the pandemic in the city.“One reason for the drop in numbers could be people are getting better and finishing their home isolation. The other could be some patients at home being transferred to Covid-19 care centres. But, in my opinion, the first reason is a bigger factor,” Dr B L Sherwal, Medical Director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital told PTI.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who recently tested Covid-19 positive and was in home isolation, was shifted to LNJP hospital on Wednesday.Asked if the situation is likely to improve in Delhi after the surge in cases in September, the doctor said, “We will have wait and watch for a week or so at least. It is too early to comment now”.Covid-19 cases have shown a surge since the beginning of this month with September 16 recording 4,473 cases, the highest single-day spike here till date. The daily surge in cases in Delhi had breached the 4,000-mark for the first time on September 9 while the number of fatalities recorded that day was 20.From September 9-19, fresh cases have been recorded more than 4,000 per day except on September 14 when the figure stood at 3,229 with 26 deaths being recorded that day, according to official data.The Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days.The number of tests conducted and corresponding fresh cases reported, ranged from 24,198 and 2,312 respectively on September 1 to 61,973 and 4,071 on September 19.Delhi recorded 3,816 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, as the tally in the city rose to over 2.53 lakh, while the death toll climbed to 5,051.On September 20, fresh cases and home quarantined cases stood at 3,812 and 18,910 respectively. On September 21 the city had 2,548 new case and 19,213 patients in home quarantine.Delhi had seen a big surge in cases in June, but the spike had come down in July.The home isolation figures on July 1 stood at 16,703 with 437 containment zones marked in the city. On July 31, while the home isolation cases count had come down to 5,763, the containment zones had risen to 692, according to official data.On August 3, the number of Covid-19 patients under home isolation, and containment zones count, both came down to 5,577 and 496 respectively. On August 25, there were 5,949 home isolation cases and 654 containment zones or localised areas from where infections were reported.Home isolation cases rose to 6,850 with 763 containment zones on August 28; then to 7876 home isolation cases with 833 containment zones on August 31; and 8,407 home quarantined cases with 894 zones on September 2.On September 5, the number of home isolation cases jumped to 9,822 while the containment zones count stood at 946.Delhi government had been laying a lot of emphasis on home isolation, especially for asymptomatic patients as part of its Covid-19 management strategy in the past several months.In an interview to PTI, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on September 7 had asserted that home isolation policy had proved a “game-changer” in taming the surge in June, a strategy the city government will continue to pursue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-fall-in-covid-19-cases-under-home-isolation-in-delhi-for-first-time-since-august-last-week/story-AidjnQcQ7IX4K2GNEkavuN.html
23-09-2020||India||Court stays arrest of ex-minister Arun Shourie in hotel sale case||The Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday stayed the arrest warrant issued against former Union disinvestment minister, Arun Shourie, and another person by a special CBI court in connection with alleged corruption in the 2002 sale of a hotel in Udaipur.On Tuesday, the court provided relief to three other persons from arrest in the same case.The court’s decision came on petitions filed by Arun Shourie and Kantilal Vikamsey, then head of valuation firm Kanti Karamsey & Co.The single bench of Justice Dinesh Mehta noted that Shourie because of his age, his wife’s ailments and a child who requires his care would find it difficult to appear before the Court, particularly in the present scenario.“Considering the age and family circumstances of the petitioner, a small indulgence of appearing any time by October 15 is granted to him. The petitioner (Shourie) shall not be arrested in pursuance of the arrest warrant issued in relation to the order passed by special judge, CBI cases, Jodhpur. The petitioner may appear before the Court on any date by October 15 and furnish a personal bond of Rs 2 lakh and two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each. The petitioner shall be permitted to appear before the court with his counsel,” justice Mehta said. Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Shourie, said that the trial court has committed an error in holding that the prosecution sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not required. He further said the petitioner was not even named in the FIR.Meanwhile, the CBI clarified its stand on the matter on Wednesday. Addl. Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the CBI, said that the order of the Special Judge, CBI is not in conformity with law. He emphasised that the CBI is reiterating its stand that no irregularity had been committed and the very order of taking cognizance is not proper.On September 15, along with Shourie and Pradip Baijal, the special CBI court ordered the registration of cases against Ashish Guha, the managing director of Lazard India Ltd who was the financial adviser, valuer Kantilal Karamsey of Kantilal Karamsey & Company and Jyotsana Suri, director of Bharat Hotels Ltd.The CBI court’s order came despite the agency filing a closure report.The case centres on the sale of the Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur, earlier run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation, to Bharat Hotels Limited in 2002. The CBI filed an FIR in 2014, alleging that the government lost Rs 244 crore in sale as the hotel was evaluated at Rs 252 crore and was sold for Rs 7.52 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-stays-arrest-of-ex-minister-arun-shourie-in-hotel-sale-case/story-dRtlMlJmHKWVn5GpYg9TLK.html
23-09-2020||India||CBI books BSF official, 3 traders for cattle smuggling at Indo- Bangladesh border||An investigation conducted by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged cattle smuggling at Indo-Bangladesh border has revealed that the Border Security Force (BSF) and Customs Department takes play an active role in the illegal trade for which huge bribes are paid. The agency on Wednesday conducted raids at 15 places in several cities including Delhi, Kolkata, Siliguri, Murshidabad, Ghaziabad, Amritsar and Raipur after filing a case against a BSF Commandant - Satish Kumar and three traders – Mohammad Enamul Haque, Anarul SK and Mohammad Golam Mostafa. Interestingly, Enamul Haque was also involved in bribing another BSF Commandant Jibu D Mathew, who was arrested by CBI in January 2018. It was alleged that Enamul had paid Rs 50 lakh to Mathew for letting the illegal cattle smuggling trade run smoothly at the border. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also raided Enamul’s premises’ in January this year. Based on the 2018 probe, CBI had launched a preliminary enquiry to investigate a larger conspiracy as well as role played by Kumar. The agency decided to register an FIR on Monday, which not only indicts Kumar but the border guarding force at large. The FIR states – “The enquiry revealed that cattle from India to Bangladesh across the International Border of these two countries are sent in large numbers not through ports of trade but illegally by paying bribes to the BSF personnel responsible to prevent cross border movement of men and property, safeguarding interests of India”. Citing alleged bribe paid to Satish Kumar, CBI FIR says when the Commandant was posted in 36th battalion of BSF at Malda, West Bengal between December 2015 and April 2017, more than 20,000 cows were seized by the BSF before they could be transported across the border to Bangladesh. However, BSF didn’t seize any vehicle carrying these animals or arrest the smugglers. “Further, due to close nexus between the BSF and Custom officials with traders like Enamul Haque, Anarul and Golam Mostafa, the seizure list of such seized cattle was prepared arbitrarily categorizing the breed and size of animals with an intention to reduce the upset price of the cattle during auctions,” said CBI FIR. Describing the role played by BSF and Customs after the seizure, CBI FIR says that these cattle were auctioned immediately (within 24 hours of seizure) with the help of nearest Customs station i.e. Jangipur, Murshidabad. “Since the cattle were shown mostly small in size/common breed in the seizure memo of BSF, the auction value of such cattle were reduced which were then procured at a considerable lower price by the above named traders due to their unholy nexus with the officials of Customs department”. The agency further alleged that Enamul Haque used to pay Rs 2,000 per cattle to BSF officials and Rs 500 to concerned Customs officials. “Besides, Customs’ officials used to take 10% of the auction price as bribe from successful bidders like Enamul Haque, Golam Mostafa and Anarul SK etc,” CBI FIR adds. Subsequently, BSF was to be paid Rs 50 per seized cattle for feeding it by the successful bidders. After showing the auctioned cattle to have been disposed of at local market, the same were illegally smuggled across the international border. Commandant Satish Kumar, according to CBI, got his son Bhuvan Bhaskar employed in the company of Enamul Haque at a salary of Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 per month. When contacted, BSF refused to comment. A query sent to Customs remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-bsf-official-3-traders-for-cattle-smuggling-at-indo-bangladesh-border/story-g6512esydGNE9Z5OKVyMnI.html

23-09-2020||India||After a hold-up of 4 days, woman, pregnant daughter cremated in Odisha||After four days of intense negotiations, the villagers in Odisha’s Kendrapara district allowed the bodies of a mother and her pregnant daughter to be cremated this afternoon.Pramila and her daughter Satyapriya Nath had gone missing from their home in Manpada village on September 19. Their bodies were found floating in Hansua river and a pond, respectively, the next day. Thereafter, the elder daughter of the deceased lodged an FIR with police.Earlier, hundreds of villagers resisted all attempts of police and administration to cremate the bodies even as the corpses started decaying.“After the post-mortem of the bodies on September 20, the family of the deceased was handed over the corpses. However, the deceased woman’s husband and other villagers did not allow the corpses to be cremated demanding that the brother of the woman as well as other people allegedly involved in the murder be arrested. The villagers finally saw reason after Sanjay Behera, the nephew of the deceased woman was arrested today,” said Tapan Nayak, inspector-in-charge of Rajnagar police station.Nayak said delay in cremation of the corpses had turned the village into a huge cauldron of stench as flies were seen swarming over the bloated corpses. Pus and blood had started leaking out of the bodies.“The SP as well as the BDO had tried to reason with the villagers about the necessity of cremating the bodies. But they were too stubborn,” he said.Police said the anger of the villagers probably stemmed from the report that the woman’s daughter was found pregnant during post-mortem. The woman after marriage was staying with her own parents while her husband lived in the same village in another house.“The villagers suspected the woman’s own brother to be behind the deaths. They alleged that the nephew of the deceased woman was in a relationship with the latter’s daughter which led to her getting pregnant. They accused the woman’s family to have killed her and her daughter and then threw the bodies separately. But the level of anger did surprise us a bit,” a police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-a-hold-up-of-4-days-woman-pregnant-daughter-cremated-in-odisha/story-Z9UbvpK7yuYhE9v3CvqIUK.html
23-09-2020||India||Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter approaches Supreme Court for mother’s release||Iltija Mufti has again approached the Supreme Court against the detention of her mother and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti under Public Safety Act (PSA) as the Peoples Democratic Party leader continues to be in jail since August 5 last year, when the Centre revoked the special status of J&K.Iltija Mufti filed a habeas corpus petition in the apex court last week challenging her mother’s detention under PSA since February 5 and the two subsequent extensions. Habeas corpus is a writ seeking production of a person, who has allegedly been in illegal detention, before a court.Mehbooba Mufti was booked under PSA on February 5 after her preventive detention of six months had expired. Under PSA, a person can be put behind bars without trial from three months to two years.Iltija said that her mother’s detention is illegal and questionable in a democracy. “A key opposition leader has been jailed for over a year without recourse to trial,” she said.The former CM is currently lodged in her Gupkar home, which has been turned into a sub-jail, where she was shifted on April 27.Iltija has challenged the detention on several grounds, including that the dossier based on which grounds of detention have been framed are “ stale, vague and that they suffer from non-application of mind, malice in law and that they violate the provisions of sections 8(3)(b) of the PSA”.Iltija had filed the petition in February and the case was scheduled to be listed for March 18 when countrywide lockdown was announced to contain the Covid-19.She said she was bringing to the top court’s notice that despite its order in February, the J&K administration is yet to even file a reply. “And it shows you the respect they have for courts and SC,” she said.The applicant has prayed before the court to command the respondents i.e respective representatives of government of India and the union territory to produce Mehbooba Mufti before the court to set her free.She has also urged for quashing of her detention orders and award compensation for her illegal detention.Iltija has argued that the detention of her mother was extended on February 5 as she declined to sign a bond asking her not to make any statement on the recent events in J&K.“This bond and surety which she was repeatedly asked to sign,… included the promise that: ‘In case of release from detention, I will not make any comment(s) or issue statement(s) or make public speech(s) hold or participate in public assemblies related to the recent events in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, at the present time, since it has the potential of endangering the peace and tranquility and law and order in the State or any part thereof’,” the petition says.“Thus, the admitted basis of the detention is a blanket undertaking not to make any comment on the recent events in the State,” it says.The petition says that the detenu has not been allowed any visits by her close relatives, barring a solitary visit by her brother and her sister’s husband on August 19 after multiple requests.“Furthermore, the detenu has not been accorded a chance to attend to her duties as the president of her party, the Jammu and Kashmir’s Peoples Democratic Party. Even party officials and cadres who had applied to visit her on several occasions have not been granted permission by the respondent administration,” it says.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained in August 2019, hours before the central government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one.Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, the two former chief ministers, were released on March 13 and March 24, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-s-daughter-approaches-supreme-court-for-mother-s-release/story-lVbOp5aenj9oheS9ayrQUO.html
23-09-2020||India||Farm bills: Protests in Panipat, Ambala; Haryana Police use water cannon||The Haryana Police on Wednesday used water cannons at several locations where the protests are being carried out against farm bills recently passed by Parliament.Several Opposition parties along with farmers have taken to street across the country to protest against the two bills.In Haryana’s Ambala, the police used water cannon against Lok Insaaf Party workers, who were taking out a bike rally from Punjab to Delhi to protest against the farm reform bills. The police resorted to using water cannons after party workers tried to jump over barricades placed at Shambhu village on the inter-state border near Ambala, according to reports.The police had warned the party workers to not cross the barricades and also denied them permission for movement of large group in the wake of restrictions placed across state over rising Covid-19 cases.“We want to raise our voice against the anti-farmer bills,” LIP leader Simarjeet Singh Bains told reporters at the Shambhu border, as quoted by PTI.Earlier on Wednesday, the police had stopped a tractor rally, which was being carried out by Haryana Youth Congress.The Rajya Sabha on September 20 passed two key farm bills - Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.During the farm bills debate, the house witnessed a lot of ruckus and uproar as several Opposition parties raised strong objection.On Tuesday, the Opposition boycotted Parliament over Centre’s refusal to accept its demand for withdrawal of farm bills. The Congress party has also called for a nationwide agitation on September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-protests-in-panipat-ambala-haryana-police-use-water-cannon/story-a5U8ncPK8gnbWXJ4xAOacK.html

The accident occurred at Eegalapenta village in Nallamala hill range on the Telangana side of the Srisailam reservoir at around 9 pm, while the victims were going for a darshan of Lord Mallikarjun Swamy of the famous Srisailam temple located on the Andhra Pradesh side of the reservoir in Kurnool district. The deceased were identified as Neetu Singh (45) and Raj Kumari Bai (65), who succumbed to injuries while being shifted to a private hospital in Hyderabad in the early hours of Wednesday. The injured – Namrata Singh, Hemalatha, Anil Singh, Asmith Singh, Dharmik Singh, Dharmesh Singh and Suman Latha, were given first aid at the local hospital being run by the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TSGenco) and later shifted to Hyderabad for better treatment. According to Eegalapenta sub-inspector of police S Pochaiah, three families belonging to Dhoolpet and Mangalhat areas of Hyderabad left in the evening in three different vehicles for a darshan in the Srisailam temple. “The Ghat road on the Nallamala hills near Eegalapenta has steep turns. While the first two vehicles managed to negotiate the turns, the third vehicle, a Toyota Innova, lost control and crashed into a wall, before falling off into a 20-feet gorge,” the SI said. One of the injured managed to come out of the vehicle and alerted his friends in the first two cars. They returned to the accident site and with the help of locals and the police, rescued the victims. “The condition of Neetu Singh and Raj Kumari Bai was critical and they were immediately rushed to Hyderabad, where they were declared brought dead. The other injured were admitted to the local hospital of TSGenco for first aid treatment. They were also taken to Hyderabad later,” the police official said. The bodies have been shifted to the Osmania General Hospital mortuary. “We have booked a case of accident and are investigating,” Pochaiah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-killed-7-injured-as-vehicle-falls-off-srisailam-ghat-road-into-a-gorge-in-telangana/story-w8GhCV9DSl6jryv6pLiKzL.html

We have written to the MoEF about the matter. The Central ministry will now study our findings before taking measures to address the issue which we have raised,” Cabral said.In 2013, a study by the National Institute of Oceanography had conducted a study on the source of the tar balls that wash ashore on beaches of Goa, sullying the water and the sand and coating it with a slimy coating that makes it unsafe to bathe in the sea.The studies had said that the source of the tar balls was from passing tankers that wash their tanks en route between the Middle East and Southeast Asia or from accidental oil spills.A subsequent study in 2016 found that the tar balls that washed ashore in late May were from Bombay High, but the ones seen in August-September after the monsoon were from the tankers on the high seas. The soft and sticky tar balls are a huge deterrent to tourists visiting the beach and threaten the footfalls at beachside businesses.Tar ball deposition along the West Coast of India (WCI) is a common phenomenon during the southwest monsoon season, particularly along the coast of Goa and Gujarat, and it is a major concern to the stakeholders especially tourism stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerned-over-tar-balls-sullying-beaches-goa-writes-to-centre/story-Rv7JlmwHqSIU6oJlZZTxkM.html

23-09-2020||India||Kerala to move Supreme Court against farm bills, says move violates federal structure||The CPI (M)-led Kerala government on Wednesday decided to move the Supreme Court against the agriculture bills passed by the Parliament three days ago saying the move was a violation of the federal structure as agriculture falls into the concurrent list.Earlier state agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar had sought legal opinion and got advice that these bills can be challenged in the apex court. The state cabinet which met on Wednesday discussed the issue in detail and felt that the Union government’s decision was interference into powers of states and against the spirit of federalism.“Agriculture falls into the state list as per the seventh schedule of the Constitution. Not a single state was consulted before bringing these bills and farmers’ bodies were also kept in the dark. We feel these legislation will only benefit big corporates engaged in the sector,” said Kumar who attended the cabinet proceedings online after he tested Covid-19 positive. He is the third minister to test positive for Covid-19 after finance minister Thomas Issac and industry minister EP Jayarajan.The minister said the state will introduce an alternate mechanism roping in agriculture co-operative societies and self-help groups in a big way. “Lakhs of farmers across the country are eking out a miserable life and many have committed suicide. Reeling under the pandemic, now the Modi government has brought in a fresh set of policies in the name of reforms. They will only serve interests of big farming corporates,” said the minister. Though Kerala is not an agrarian state many farming bodies have pledged their support to the nationwide stir called on September 25. Two left MPs from the state, KK Ragesh and Elamarom Kareem, were among eight members from the Rajya Sabha suspended for making a noisy protest over the passage of these bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-move-supreme-court-against-farm-bills-says-move-violates-federal-structure/story-ylcsdaPvNddgTGuh8NHO2L.html
23-09-2020||India||Parliament passes Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020||Parliament on Wednesday passed a Bill for inclusion of Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi in the list of official languages in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in addition to the existing Urdu and English. The Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020 was passed by Rajya Sabha through voice vote. Lok Sabha had cleared the legislation on Tuesday. Replying to a debate on the Bill, Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said it was a long-standing demand of the people of Jammu and Kashmir that the language they speak should be included in the list of official languages. The minister pointed out that around 74 per cent people in the Union Territory spoke Kashmiri and Dogri languages. He said that according to 2011 census, only 0.16 per cent population in Jammu and Kashmir spoke Urdu, while 2.3 per cent spoke Hindi. Reddy said the government would also take steps to encourage other local languages like Punjabi, Gurjari and Pahari in the region. Participating in the debate on the Bill, Naresh Gujral (SAD) termed it “unfortunate” that Punjabi was not included in the Bill and urged the government to reconsider it. The J&K Constitution included Punjabi and the first Chief Minister of J&K was a Punjabi, he said and added: “It hurts the feeling of those who are settled there. I would urge the government to reconsider because language is the basis of cultural heritage of the community.” He said 13 lakh Punjabis live in Jammu and Kashmir. Mir Mohammad Fayaz (PDP) demanded inclusion of Gurjari, Punjabi and Pahari in the Bill, saying that the motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” was lacking in the state. “Include Punjabi, Gurjari and Pahari so that we win the trust of everyone in J&K,” he said. Ramdas Athawale (RPI) expressed “support to Dogri and Kashmiri languages” and in his poetic style said that a day will come when PoK will come to India. Mamata Mohanta (BJD) said the bill will facilitate integration of the UT into mainstream. Shamsher Singh Manhas (BJP) spoke in Dogri. Surendra Singh Nagar (BJP) supported the Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-jammu-and-kashmir-official-languages-bill-2020/story-mF3yw1MkRYMKdspP7WbfeJ.html

This was the first incident of the sacking of the V-C of a central university.The President’s approval came after the Union law ministry and the attorney-general said there was nothing illegal about the recommendation seeking the removal of the V-C.Dattagupta was facing charges of serious financial irregularities. Even though he was drawing his salary from Visva-Bharati, he continued to draw pension from an earlier assignment. Under the law, he was required to have his pension amount deducted from the pay he received from Visva-Bharati as the V-C.The government had formed a three-member panel to probe chages against Dattagupta. The HRD ministry had also found him guilty of gross misconduct and dereliction of duty.He is also accused of paying exorbitant legal fees to a private law firm, and giving illegal honorarium to a retired justice.Dattagupta was earlier charged with making several irregular appointments by creating post for which he had no sanction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-case-against-former-viswa-bharti-v-c-sushanta-dattagupta-sacked-for-alleged-financial-irregularities/story-BFe1impTxSdwYOrWZRsZaN.html

23-09-2020||India||Ganga’s water did not improve during lockdown; less flow may have deteriorated quality||The quality of the water in the Ganga did not improve and rather deteriorated at many stretches including possibly due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage despite curbs on human activities during the 68-day lockdown imposed from March 25 to check the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report released on Wednesday. Seven out of 19 major rivers in India, including the Brahmani, however, recorded an improvement in water quality in April, as compared to the period before the lockdown, it added. The Ganga’s compliance with primary water quality reduced from 64.6 % to 46.2% during the lockdown. The report suggests that this may also have been because of negligible seasonal flow, which increases the concentration of pollution, and no freshwater discharges from the upstream. Compliance also reduced in the Beas, the Chambal, the Sutlej, and the Swarnarekha.The Baitarani, the Mahanadi, the Narmada, and the Pennar were 100% compliant with outdoor bathing water quality criteria.The CPCB sought to assess percentage variation (increasing or decreasing) trends in water quality only for bathing criteria parameters such as pH, DO (dissolved oxygen), BOD (biological oxygen demand), and FC (Fecal Coliform excluding Fecal Streptococci). These are all measures that show if a river can sustain life and is safe for bathing.For the Ganga, during pre-lockdown, 42 out of 65 monitored locations (64.6 %) and during the lockdown, 25 out of 54 monitored locations (46.3 %), were found to be within the desirable limits of primary water quality criteria for outdoor bathing.The Brahmani river’s compliance with primary water quality criteria for outdoor bathing improved from 85% in the pre-lockdown period to 100%. For the Brahmaputra, it improved from 87.5 % to 100 % and for the Cauvery from 90.5 % to 96.97 %. In the case of the Godavari, it went up from 65.8% to 78.4 %, the Krishna 84.6 % to 94.4 %, the Tapi 77.8 % to 87.5 %, and the Yamuna 42.8 % to 66.67 %.Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said the lockdown happened during the lean season for all rivers, particularly those originating from the Himalayan region. “The river flow contributes to the dilution of pollutants. So, their analysis pertaining to the Ganga and other Himalayan rivers is correct.” Mishra said rivers including the Narmada, the Pennar, and the Mahanadi anyway have a low industrial effluent load. “So, it is not a surprise that they met bathing water quality standards before and during the lockdown.” Mishra said CPCB should not have compared apples with oranges because the issues facing these rivers are very different. “The clear impact of lockdown was seen in the Yamuna downstream of Wazirabad because it has high industrial effluent load which became nil during the lockdown and in March and April… there was rain in Yamuna’s catchment leading to higher water discharges.” The 2,525-kilometre-long Ganga originates in the northernmost part of Uttarakhand, flows through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal before it discharges into the Bay of Bengal.The report said the lockdown period offered a unique situation to carry out assessment of water quality of surface water bodies including major rivers. It provided an opportunity to re-comprehend and redesign existing frameworks and put in place robust mechanisms to cleanse identified polluted river stretches, it added.CPCB scientists said there might be separate reasons behind the improvement of water quality in Yamuna during the lockdown and the worsening of the condition around the same period in many stretches of the Ganga.“We found that the water in the Ganga had improved in Uttarakhand and some stretches of UP during the lockdown. However, no improvement was seen in West Bengal and Bihar in the downstream. This combined with a lean flow led to fewer locations recording improvement in the quality of the river water. Sewage may have a higher contribution to pollution in these stretches. While in Yamuna the contribution from industrial effluents, which was nil during the lockdown, appears to be moderate. Yamuna in Delhi received freshwater from upper reaches during the lockdown. There were rains in the river’s catchment areas in upper reaches in March, according to our analysis,” said a CPCB scientist, who was involved with the study, on condition of anonymity.CPCB separately observed its 46th Foundation Day on Wednesday and announced its plans for the next decade until 2030 to provide technical leadership for “science-based environmental management” and guiding policy decisions to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-s-water-did-not-improve-during-lockdown-less-flow-may-have-deteriorated-quality/story-c4dBziGjlhrsnooE5naW3H.html

The Bru migrants have been staying at six relief camps located at Kanchanpur and Panisagar sub divisions in North Tripura for more than two decades after escaping from an ethnic clash in Mizoram in 1997. After these years, the Centre signed an agreement with Tripura and Mizoram governments to settle Bru migrants permanently in Tripura. “The strike was peaceful. No violence was reported. And no picketer was detained,” said Kanchanpur sub divisional magistrate Chandni Chandran. She added that no prior permission was taken from the administration for the strike. During the strike, the JAC also submitted a memorandum to chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb through Chandran, giving the government a seven-day deadline to reconsider the decision to rehabilitate Bru migrants, or else, they would choose the path of movement, said the protestors. Also Read: Mizoram CM requests Tripura not to resettle Bru migrants in Mizo habitatsChairperson of Nagorik Suraksha Mancha Ranjit Kumar Nath said, “The resettlement of the Bru migrants in Kanchanpur area will put pressure on the residents who are living here for years.

Azad will also apprise the President about the Rajya Sabha passing important legislations in both Houses of Parliament in the absence of Opposition parties, which boycotted the rest of the monsoon session after the government rejected their demands to withdraw the farm bills. They had also requested Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to revoke the suspension of eight members—Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Bora of the Congress, Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen of the Trinamool Congress, KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Also Read: Rajya Sabha adjourns sine die; second-shortest monsoon session so farThe two agricultural bills—the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020—were cleared by voice vote in Parliament on Sunday even as the Opposition protested and stormed the well of the House seeking that they be sent to a select committee. The ruckus resulted in the suspension of the eight members. Parliament on Tuesday also passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. On Tuesday, Azad had said that the opposition will not end its boycott till the government introduces another bill making it illegal for private players to buy food grains from farmers below the minimum support price (MSP), and making it mandatory for all state agencies to comply by the MSP and fix the procurement price as per the Swaminathan panel’s recommendations. Representatives of the Opposition parties met in the Parliament House on Wednesday to chalk out their future strategy. It was decided at the meeting that a delegation will meet the President in a delegation and hand over a memorandum to him, urging him not to give his assent to the farm bills. Also Read: Claim pro-farmer reforms, but no data on their suicides: TMC attacks CentreRepresentatives of the Opposition parties then sought time from the Parliament and were told that only five leaders would be allowed to meet the President in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, a Congress leader said. He said the leaders of the 18 Opposition parties then decided that only Azad would meet the President on their behalf. The standoff between the government and the Opposition over the farm bills has escalated with both sides taking a hard stand on the issue. While the Rajya Sabha adjourned sine die on Wednesday afternoon, the Lok Sabha will follow suit in the evening. While the Congress has decided to hit the streets across the country to protest against the farm bills Thursday onwards, other regional Opposition parties are planning an agitation against the farm bills in their respective states too. Earlier in the day, Opposition leaders, including Azad, Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh (Congress), Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party member Jaya Bachchan, took out a protest march from the Mahatma Gandhi statue to the Ambedkar Statue at the Parliament house complex. The leaders carried placards with messages such as ‘Save Farmers’, Save Workers’ and ‘Save Democracy’. Prior to their protest, the leaders had also written to the Rajya Sabha chairman urging him not to pass the three labour codes in the Upper House in the absence of Opposition parties. “It will be a blot on democracy if the bills are passed unilaterally,” they wrote in the letter. Azad later said he would meet the President and tell him that there was no division of votes during the passage of bills in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-ghulam-nabi-azad-to-meet-president-today/story-KXHeku1NnQI514ysbcJbsI.html

The Indian Prime Minister, who turned 70 a few days ago, had also made it to the TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people’s list earlier as well. Bilkis was an unlikely face among the names who made it to the 100 most influential people’s list. She was among the leading figures who led peaceful protests in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area against the Citizenship Amendment Act or CAA last year. The 82-year-old was known for sitting at the protest site from early morning till midnight almost everyday for three months until the protests were disbanded due to Covid-19.Actor Ayushmann Khurana was the only actor from India who made it to the list. Khurrana is the youngest Indian to be featured in this year’s TIME Magazine, according to news agency PTI. Khurrana told PTI that he has used his acting to bring a positive change to the world. Deepika Padukone wrote an essay to introduce Khurrana to TIME magazine’s readers. He has acted in award-winning movies like “Vicky Donor”, “Shubh Mangal Saavdhan”, “Badhaai Ho”, and “Article 15.”The others to bring laurels to the Indian community by being included in the coveted list include Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google’s parent Alphabet and clinical microbiology professor Ravindra Gupta.Gupta, who is a professor of clinical microbiology at the Cambridge University, has been featured by the TIME magazine under the ‘Pioneers’ category. A doctor of Indian origin, Gupta achieved the feat of curing the London Patient Eric Castellijo of human-immunodeficiency virus or the HIV. Castellijo, who is the second person to be functionally cured of HIV wrote of Dr Gupta in the introduction, “Gupta has shared his knowledge and his enthusiasm to find a feasible cure for everyone. He has championed me and empowered me to become an ambassador of hope to millions of people living with HIV around the world.” Castellijo also narrated how Gupta’s compassion moved him and also brought him respect among colleagues in the HIV research community. Pichai was put into the category of ‘Titans’ along with Miami Heat forward Dwayne Wade, actress Gabrielle Union and Formula One racer Lewis Hamilton among others. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said Pichai embodies the real American dream as he emigrated from India as an adult and worked his way up to become the CEO of Alphabet.

Constitution was undermined in the temple of democracy. We have given a representation to president that farm bills have been passed unconstitutionally and he should return these bills,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The government should have consulted all parties and farmer leaders before bringing the bills, Azad said after meeting the President.Previously, it was decided that leaders of five Opposition parties - Congress, TMC, Samajwadi Party, TRS and DMK - will meet the President to raise the issue but due to Covid-19 safety protocols the parties decided to submit the memorandum through Azad.The Opposition has launched a staunch protest against passage of two agricultural bills — the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 — by voice vote in Parliament on Sunday.Several leaders from the Opposition including TMC’s Derek O’Brien and Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh entered the well of the Rajya Sabha demanding that the bills be sent to a select committee. The ruckus ensued and resulted in the suspension of eight Rajya Sabha MPs, including O’Brien and Singh, who then camped overnight in Parliament complex in protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-ghulam-nabi-azad-to-meet-president-kovind-amid-farm-bills-crisis/story-EaKMNTYzD0WwbGQSv9FsCO.html

Incessant rainfall also caused landslides at 29th Mile in West Bengal’s Kalimpong district on Tuesday. “Though NH-10, which connects Sikkim and Siliguri, north Bengal’s biggest town, via the Kalimpong district, was opened for a couple of hours on Tuesday afternoon, it had to be closed again late at night,” said Subodh Chettri, executive engineer-II, public works department (PWD), division-9, West Bengal. Chettri said repair work has been hampered due to heavy rainfall and the NH-10 stretch at Rambi in Kalimpong district is likely to have suffered further damage. Repair work has to be suspended because a portion of NH-10 between Sethi Jhora and Birik Dara is still inundated, the officials said. Vehicles operating between Sikkim and Siliguri and Kalimpong and Siliguri are taking a detour. In north Bengal, many rivers are in spate, as heavy rainfall was recorded until Wednesday afternoon. “Though it is raining incessantly since Tuesday, we have not yet received any report about a loss of human life. The Siliguri-Mirik road was closed on Wednesday morning at Ghayabari. Several wards under the Siliguri Municipal Corporation have reported waterlogging,” said S Poonambalam, district magistrate (DM), Darjeeling. Tenzing T Kaleon, district collector (DC), North Sikkim, said, “The roads leading to the border with China are open because the area has not recorded heavy rainfall yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-north-bengal-affected-as-landslides-damage-nh-10-following-heavy-rain/story-86Ct20TV5OxXc0tWdJLIdI.html

23-09-2020||India||Supreme Court directs no action to be taken against Facebook’s India head till October 15||The Delhi Assembly told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that Facebook India’s vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan was not summoned as an accused and that no coercive action was intended against the company.The court was hearing a petition filed by Facebook India and Mohan against the notice issued by the Delhi Assembly for deposing before it on Wednesday for the social media company’s alleged role in the Delhi violence in February.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Delhi Assembly, said that Mohan was summoned as a witness to get the social media giant’s suggestions on devising mechanism to prevent misuse of Facebook.“He was called as a witness, not as an accused. No coercive steps were intended. During previous hearings, it came to light that Facebook was misused (in connection with communal riots). So, we want to get suggestions from them and devise mechanism so that Facebook is not misused,” Singhvi said.Justice Kaul, who is heading the three-judge bench hearing the case, said that the notice issued to Mohan by the Delhi assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee did not give such an impression. “That is not what you have said in the notice. Then you may recall the notice,” justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.Singhvi offered to will file a counter affidavit clarifying the stance of the Delhi Assembly.The court then adjourned the hearing till October 15 and Singhvi submitted that no further meeting will be held on this subject matter till the petition is disposed. The court recorded Singhvi’s submissions and asked Delhi Assembly to file it’s response within a week.During the hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Mohan, said that right to free speech under Article 19(1)(a) includes right not to speak. Salve also told the court that if his client doesn’t appear, he can’t be compelled to face penalty.Salve also said that Mohan works for a US-based company and doesn’t want to comment on a politically sensitive issue in India.The petitioners had moved the apex court challenging the two summons issued by the Delhi Assembly and others against them on September 10 and 18.The committee’s insistence on compelling Ajit Mohan to speak, and its categorical threat to his non-appearance as a “breach of privilege of the committee and [to take] necessary action as deemed fit”, gives rise to a clear and present danger to the fundamental rights and liberties of petitioners in the ultra vires proceedings before the Committee, Mohan had claimed in his petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-india-head-not-summoned-as-accused-no-coercive-action-was-intended-delhi-assembly-in-supreme-court/story-Z3ryYFZ3liy57TASkan6OO.html

23-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha adjourns sine die; second-shortest monsoon session so far||With the passage of 25 bills and introduction of six others, Rajya Sabha records showed 100% productivity during the monsoon session that was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic and adjourned sine die on Wednesday. This was also the second-shortest monsoon session of the Upper House since 1952. Instead of the scheduled 18 sittings, only 10 sittings were held between September 14 and 23. The House was scheduled to wind up on October 1. Chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu said the session was concluded ahead of time as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to challenge humankind nine months after its outbreak. He said Rajya Sabha consistently recorded its highest productivity in the last four sessions and it was “praiseworthy”. In his closing remarks, Naidu said a record amount of time (about 58% of the number of business hours) was spent on bills during the session, as against an average of 28% over the years. Also Read: Parliament passes Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts BillMore allotment of time to bills, he said, justified the purpose of this session in which the Question Hour was dispensed with. Opposition parties had protested the doing away of the Question Hour, pointing out that it infringed upon their right to seek answers from the government. The monsoon session that was marked by many firsts—including the schedule being limited to four hours, no weekend breaks and staggered sitting arrangements for MPs—also witnessed a ruckus on Sunday when some members of the Opposition surrounded deputy chairperson Harivansh’s desk to protest against the decision of not spending more time discussing the contentious farm bills. Referring to the ruckus that led to the suspension of eight Opposition MPs, their day-long protest inside Parliament complex, the Opposition parties’ subsequent walk-out and the deputy chairperson’s one-day fast, Naidu said the session had brought forward some concerns, like the notice for the deputy chairman’s removal. “It is our collective responsibility to avert such an unpleasant turn of events. The suspension of members is unpalatable but forced,” he said, adding that while protesting was the Opposition’s right, it was the manner of protest that needed attention. Also Read: Rajya Sabha passes Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020According to Rajya Sabha Statistical Information 1952-2018; the 252nd session saw just 10 sittings, making it the second shortest of all the 69 monsoon sessions that have been held so far. Records show that the 110th session held in July, 1979, and the 187th session held in October, 1999, which were also monsoon sessions, comprised six sittings each. The 89th session of the House, the monsoon session, held during July-September, 1974, remains the longest monsoon session with 40 sittings. This is also the longest of all the 252 sessions of the House held since 1952. So far, three sessions, including the current session, have had 10 sittings or less;16 sessions were held for 11 to 20 sittings each; 40 sessions had 21 to 30 sittings each; nine had 31 to 39 sittings each and one session had 40 sittings. The 76th session of Rajya Sabha, also the monsoon session, had 18 sittings during August-September, 1976. Six other monsoon sessions had 16 to 17 sittings each. Rajya Sabha records show only the 187th session with 6 sittings was held in October. This was the first session that took place after then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee assumed office for the third time. Of all the 252 sessions of the Rajya Sabha so far, the 111th session remains the shortest with just one sitting on August 20, 1979. This was on account of then Prime Minister late Shri Charan Singh resigning the same day. Typically, monsoon sessions are held during the months of July-August; this year, due to the pandemic, the session was delayed and Parliament could reconvene only in September. The budget session that precedes the monsoon session also had to be cut short in March when the Covid-19 outbreak occurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajyasabha-adjourns-sine-die-second-shortest-monsoon-session-so-far/story-UcRD8Ir14o4F3t32KJgoGK.html
23-09-2020||India||Claim pro-farmer reforms, but no data on their suicides: TMC attacks Centre||Firing fresh salvo at the Centre, the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal attacked the Narendra Modi-led government for claiming to champion pro-farmer reforms through the agricultural bills passed in the Rajya Sabha, but drawing a blank when questioned about the farmer suicides. “@narendramodi ji’s regime is making a mockery of our nation! They fail to record the no. of farmer suicides in their reign and then claim to implement Pro-Farmer laws, while thwarting every rule in Parliament. We’ll not stay quiet & take this battle head-on! #WeStandForDemocracy,” tweeted Abhishek Banerjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Trinamool MP. This comes two days after G Kishan Reddy, union minister of state for home affairs, had informed the Rajya Sabha that national data on causes of suicide in farming sector was untenable and not published separately, as many states and union territories had reported ‘Nil’ data to the National Crime Records Bureau. In a counter offensive, a delegation of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to apprise him of the TMC’s alleged double standards on the issues related to the contentious farm bills that were passed in the Rajya Sabha. “The price of potato in West Bengal has shot up because of the middlemen backed by the TMC. While farmers are selling potatoes at Rs 8–Rs 10 per kilo, in the markets each kilo of potato is being sold at Rs 30–Rs 40 per kilo. The TMC will never act against these middlemen as the money is going to the party’s coffers. While farmers are being cheated, the chief minister is spreading lies against the farm bills,” said Jai Prakash Majumdar, state vice president of BJP, who led the delegation to Raj Bhavan. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had condemned the farm bills passed in the Upper House of Parliament on Sunday and had said that these bills would trigger a food pandemic in the country and wipe off small and marginal farmers.The TMC has already started staging protests since Tuesday in Kolkata against the farm bills. While on Tuesday, the party’s women wing led by Chadrima Bhattacharya, minister of state for health in West Bengal, staged a protest in central Kolkata, on Wednesday the youth wing took out a rally. On September 9, Banerjee had written to the Centre that she was open to implementation of the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme for farmers if the funds were transferred directly to her government for disbursement. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, however, criticised the state government, saying that funds for Central welfare schemes go directly to the beneficiaries and not routed through the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/claim-pro-farmer-reforms-but-no-data-on-their-suicides-tmc-attacks-centre/story-Rfxs9vjDVMuSrg7Z7ZITwK.html

23-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha passes Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday through a voice vote passed the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020. The bill amends the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010, which regulates the use and acceptance of foreign contribution by individuals and organizations. The Act prohibits foreign contribution for any activities that pose a danger to national interest. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on Monday and will now be sent to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent. Minister of state (MoS), home affairs, Nityanand Rai moved the bill for passage in the Upper House. During the discussion on the bill, Rai said that the FCRA is a law for national and internal security, aimed to ensure that foreign funds do not dominate the political and social discourse in India. The minister also said that it has been proposed to make Aadhaar for Indian citizens and passports or OCI for foreigners mandatory to verify identity. The home ministry consulted UIDAI and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) before proposing the move, he added.“Experience says that many organisations attempted to hide their identity and were successful in doing that. The reason behind this is that they had no fear because their identity was not established completely. So Aadhaar card has been brought in to establish their identity,” Rai said.The minister pointed out that the bill provides for reduction in administrative expenses of any NGO receiving foreign funding, from 50 per cent to 20 per cent of annual funds.The bill also proposes to enable the Centre to allow an NGO or association to surrender its FCRA certificate.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-passes-foreign-contribution-regulation-amendment-bill-2020/story-Hy9oJkRsFJ7e8A06JeZetN.html

In this context, it is stated that the Election Commission of India has not issued any such direction to CBDT to issue notice to Shri Pawar.”Pawar on Tuesday told reporters the income tax department has issued him a notice in connection with poll affidavits submitted to the EC over the last decade. He added he has heard his daughter, Supriya Sule, was likely to get a similar notice soon and that such notices were also sent to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son, Aaditya Thackeray.Pawar said the income tax department has sought his “clarification and explanation” over some affidavits.“I received a notice from the income tax department. It was sent on the directives of the Election Commission of India. They have sought information and clarification related to the details on assets shared by me in election affidavits filed in 2020, 2014, and 2009-10. I heard that Supriya is also likely to get a similar notice soon. I will have to immediately respond to the notice as it also warned of things such as raids,” Pawar said.Pawar’s remarks came days after CBDT took up complaints lodged with the EC alleging discrepancies and omissions in poll affidavits of Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-denies-asking-cbdt-for-it-notice-to-pawar/story-QQyA1kSUaGQQv665zzlXHN.html
23-09-2020||India||Bharat Biotech inks licencing deal with Washington University School of Medicine for Covid intranasal vaccine||Bharat Biotech, a leading vaccine and bio-therapeutics manufacturer, has inked a licencing agreement with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, the US, for a single dose intranasal vaccine for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Bharat Biotech owns the rights to distribute the vaccine in all markets except for the US, Japan and Europe, the company announced on Wednesday.The phase-I trials, which will check the safety profile of the vaccine candidate in humans, will take place in the US university’s vaccine and treatment evaluation unit in St. Louis. Also read: For 5th consecutive day, recoveries surpass fresh Covid-19 cases in IndiaUpon obtaining the required regulatory approval, Bharat Biotech will pursue further stages of clinical trials in the country and undertake large scale manufacture of the vaccine at its GMP facility located in Genome Valley, Hyderabad. “We are proud to collaborate on this innovative vaccine. We envision that we will scale this vaccine to one billion doses. Individuals can be vaccinated by a single dose regimen. An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but also reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc, significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director (MD), Bharat Biotech. “Our experience in viral vaccines, manufacturing capabilities, and distribution continue to be our strong suit in ensuring safe, efficacious, and affordable vaccines. It is prudent for Bharat Biotech to be involved in diverse but tenable projects to provide a much-needed vaccine against Covid-19 that reaches all citizens of the world,” he added. According to the company’s statement, this intranasal vaccine candidate has shown unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies; for which the technology and data have been recently published in the scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature, a British weekly scientific journal. Dr David T Curiel, director, Biologic Therapeutics Center, and professor of radiation oncology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Precision Virologics’ interim chief executive officer (CEO) said in a statement, “The ability to accomplish effective immunisation with a single nasal dose is a major advantage, offering broader reach and easier administration. An effective nasal dose not only protects against Covid-19, but it also prevents the spread of the disease by offering another kind of immunity that occurs primarily in the cells that line the nose and throat. Most other vaccine candidates currently under development can’t do that.” The latest move expands Bharat Biotech’s portfolio of vaccines that are being developed and are in various stages of clinical development, including Covaxin, which is in phase-II human clinical trials stage in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-inks-licensing-deal-with-washington-university-school-of-medicine-for-covid-intranasal-vaccine/story-2neT4U43G4piTdMgOwtiMN.html

While both sides have agreed in principle not to send more troops to the border, there is no means for both sides to verify this on ground as neither would like to share information collected through communication intercepts and spatial intelligence,” said a senior official.As of now, there is no change of situation on ground with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops still on finger four mountainous spur on north Pangong Tso lake and Indian Army dominating the Rezang La Rechin La ridgeline on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). There has been no change in situation in Gogra-Hot Springs sector as the PLA have linked the withdrawal there to Pangong Tso disengagement.ALSO WATCH | DRDO’s plan to help feed Indian forces amid Ladakh long haul against China China watchers believe that the Ladakh situation will require a series of dialogues before understanding between the two sides builds up on how to keep the LAC quiet post May intrusions by the PLA in western sector. Given the continuous infra upgrade across the occupied Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh by China, the PLA capacity to rapidly deploy on the LAC is better than Indian Army. This means that till such time a larger political understanding is reached, the Indian Army will have to be on alert all along the LAC as PLA cannot be allowed to take advantage again.Apart from Ladakh, there has been PLA build-up in depth areas of Arunachal with focus around Nyingchi as the latter is going to connected soon with Lhasa by rail road. The Chinese are also building a rail road from Shigatse or Xigaze to Yatong or Yadong in Chumbi Valley, which will put pressure on Indian Siliguri corridor. The upgrade in Tibet and Xinjiang is not only designed to put pressure on India but largely to consolidate the hold of Han Chinese on these sensitive areas as part of the Communist party’s Sinicization programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-prepared-for-a-long-haul-over-disengagement-but-not-yield-an-inch-in-ladakh/story-SR8ZRTGLoOpEbFdercn6GO.html

23-09-2020||India||India says Turkish President’s remarks on Kashmir amount to ‘gross interference’ in internal matters||India on Wednesday rejected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s comments that the Kashmir dispute is a “burning issue” for the stability of South Asia, saying they were tantamount to “gross interference” in the country’s internal affairs. This was not the first time that India and Turkey have engaged in a terse exchange on the Kashmir issue—Erdoğan has repeatedly raised the matter after the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year, and India has pushed back on each occasion. Also Read: World powers take the stage, virtually, at UN debateIn a video message for a special session marking the 75th anniversary of the UN, Erdoğan said: “The Kashmir conflict, which is also key to the stability and peace of South Asia, is still a burning issue. Steps taken following the abolition of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir further complicated the problem. “We are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of the UN resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.” Soon after, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, tweeted that Erdoğan’s remarks were “totally unacceptable”. “We have seen remarks by President of Turkey on Indian [union territory] of Jammu & Kashmir. They constitute gross interference in India’s internal affairs and are completely unacceptable. Turkey should learn to respect sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply,” Tirumurti said. Erdoğan’s remarks were welcomed by his ally, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who said in a tweet: “Deeply appreciate President Erdoğan once again raising his voice in support of the rights of the Kashmiri people during his address to UNGA. Turkey’s unwavering support remains a source of strength for the Kashmiris in their legitimate struggle for self determination.” Deeply appreciate President Erdogan once again raising his voice in support of the rights of the Kashmiri people during his address to UNGA. Turkey’s unwavering support remains a source of strength for the Kashmiris in their legitimate struggle for self determination. pic.twitter.com/RIBJAIUptyErdoğan was among the few leaders who had raised the Kashmir issue at last year’s UN General Assembly session and he subsequently also raised it during a visit to Pakistan in February. He raised the matter despite India’s external affairs ministry saying such remarks would affect bilateral ties. In February, India made a strong demarche with the Turkish government on Erdoğan’s remarks on Jammu and Kashmir during his visit to Islamabad. “These remarks reflect neither an understanding of history nor of the conduct of diplomacy. They distort events of the past to advance a narrow-minded view of the present,” the external affairs ministry spokesperson had said at the time. The remarks in February were also described as “one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries”, and India also rejected the “repeated attempts by Turkey to justify the cross-border terrorism practised so blatantly by Pakistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-turkish-president-s-remarks-on-kashmir-amount-to-gross-interference-in-internal-matters/story-aNCWlZVqsQ269GSdufb3JJ.html

23-09-2020||India||Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh breaks his one-day fast||Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh on Wednesday broke his one-day fast, he has started on Tuesday to protest the unruly behaviour towards him by some Opposition members during the passage of agriculture Bills in the Upper House on September 20.Janata Dal (U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh offered juice to Harivansh to help him break the fast.“Harivansh ji was on fast for 36 hours. He had not eaten anything since Monday night. He was following his duty as Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha. There is a fixed procedure of everything in democracy and everyone has the right to raise his/her concerns under rules. If the Opposition or anyone else thinks that they can do whatever they want to do, it is not possible. If that happens that it will be anarchy,” Singh told ANI.Singh further said that the MPs who were suspended from the Rajya Sabha should think about the conduct of the Deputy Chairman, whose decision to go on a fast displayed sign of greatness.“In which rulebook is it written that you can threaten the Deputy Chairman and throw papers on him. The suspended MPs need to introspect about this. The gesture by the Deputy Chairman to visit and bring tea to the MPs while they were protesting, reflects his greatness,” he added.Harivansh on Tuesday observed a 24 hour-long fast hoping that it will lead the MPs who had behaved in a unruly behaviour towards self correction.Harivansh had also written to President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu saying protests in the Upper House on September 20 by the Opposition leaders during the passage of the two bills on Sunday caused him pain, stress and mental tension.“The members of the Upper House indulged in violent activities in the name of democracy. They attempted to threaten the person on the Chair. Every rule, system of the Upper House was flouted. The members of the Parliament tore apart the rule book, threw it on me,” Harivansh’s letter read.The Deputy Chairman also mentioned that the sight of Opposition leaders getting up on the table of the officials of the House, raising unparliamentary and crude slogans and the violent behaviour has stayed with him.Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Rajya Sabha Chairman on Monday rejected the no-confidence motion moved by the Opposition against Harivansh saying that it is “not admissible under the rules”.The Opposition parties had submitted a no-confidence motion against the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman after he overruled opposition pleas for postponing Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply to the debate on the two farm Bills till Monday since the sitting time scheduled of the House was over.On Monday, Naidu announced a one-week suspension of Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen, Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Sanjay Singh, Congress’ Rajeev Satav, Ripun Bora and Syed Nasir Hussain, CPI (M)’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Karim for “unruly behaviour” with the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman on Sunday during the passage of the farm Bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-deputy-chairman-harivansh-breaks-his-one-day-fast/story-Iq1Ia9HziAV553oz3I1zHP.html
23-09-2020||India||India-China row: Five things you need to know today||In a joint statement after key military talks on September 21, India and China agreed to stop sending more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may complicate matters. Also read: Deadlock at talks, China wants India to exit key heightsWhile the development is being seen as an effort by both sides to not allow the border row to escalate further, the situation on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) remains tense and there has been no thinning of military buildup in the eastern Ladakh theatre. How things stand today 1. Both sides will soon hold a seventh round of commander-level talks with the aim of taking measures to solve problems on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity on the border. Expectations from the military dialogue are not very high as both armies have made their positions known to each other. 2. At the September 21 talks, Indian negotiators firmly demanded comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante as the only approach towards de-escalation. However, China asked India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction. 3. The scope of the military talks has changed vastly after recent developments on the southern and northern banks of Pangong Tso, where the Indian Army has taken control of advantageous heights. 4. Both sides are prepared for the long haul in the Ladakh theatre where they have made arrangements to provide logistics support to thousands of troops who are likely to remain deployed in the sector through the winter. 5. China has deployed sizeable military assets in the eastern Ladakh theatre including 50,000 troops, 150 aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems, with India matching every military move made by the neighbour. The combat ratio between the two forces is 1:1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-row-five-things-you-need-to-know-today/story-29FjnNp244RrXwaf81DYdL.html

India is now testing more than 12 lakh people for Covid-19 daily, the latest data released by the Union health ministry has revealed. More than 6.5 crore tests have so far been completed in the country. “The improvement in the testing rate is leading to early identification of positive cases which, in turn, will reduce the positivity rate in future,” the ministry said.

23-09-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine likely to have 50-100% efficacy: ICMR||The vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is likely to be anywhere between 50 to 100% effective, according to director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“All the vaccines for respiratory viruses are not 100% effective. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that there are three things key for a vaccine: safety (how safe it is for human use), immunogenicity (whether it is able to provoke body’s immune response) and its efficacy (how effective it is against the virus),” said director general, ICMR, Dr Balram Bhargava.“And WHO says even if we get 50% efficacy that is more than acceptable. So for respiratory viruses we will never get a vaccine with 100% efficacy. We are obviously aiming at 100% efficacy but we may get anywhere between 50 to 100%,” he added. Central Drugs and Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), has also issued a draft guidance note on vaccine development in the country, with special focus on Covid-19 vaccine, especially safety profile.Initiation of phase III trials should be preceded by adequate characterization of safety and immunogenicity for each vaccine candidate, dose level, and age group to be evaluated to support general safety, potential for vaccine efficacy, and low risk of vaccine associated respiratory distress, according to the note. “...subjects with history or laboratory evidence of prior COVID-19 infection should not be excluded from COVID-19 vaccine trial. However, subjects with acute COVID-19 or other acute infectious illness should be excluded from such trials. Consideration should be given for inclusion of diverse populations in all phases of vaccine clinical development to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective for everyone in the indicated populations. Evaluation of vaccine safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trial in adults should include adequate representation of elderly individuals and individuals with comorbidities,” the note reads.Normally, permission to carry out clinical trials is given in stages, considering the data emerging from earlier phases. However, on case by case basis, clinical development programs may be allowed to proceed through a seamless approach to expedite the development of a vaccine for which, there is an unmet medical need in the country, like in case of Covid-19.“In case, a vaccine has been developed and has undergone clinical trial development outside India and marketing authorization application for the same have been submitted to CDSCO, the clinical data generated will be considered for evaluation of overall safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. However, additional clinical trial may be required in local population to confirm the safety and effectiveness in Indian population. The extent of local clinical trial requirements will be decided on case by case basis considering the urgency, unmet need of the vaccine in the country,” it said.Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Union health ministry, however, said, “This is just a draft guidance note that has been put in public domain as part of the transparency policy of the government to invite stakeholders comments. It is not a finalIndia’s two indigenous vaccine candidates against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have completed phase 1 human trials, and recruitment of subjects for the next level, phase 2, has also completed.“Among the three Covid-19 vaccine candidates- Zydus Cadila’s has completed phase 1 human trials, and phase 2 recruitments have been completed. For this three doses are to be given 28 days apart. For Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate also the phase 1 trial is done, and so is recruitment of trial participants for phase 2. For this trial two doses are to be given. Results are being analysed,” informed Dr Bhargava, during one of the press briefings on Covid-19.Phase 2,3 human trials for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate conducted by the Serum Institute of India is also currently underway in the country.Another Covid-19 vaccine candidate, for which talks are on for trials in India is the one developed by Russia called Sputnik V.“Indian government was approached by the Russian government through appropriate channels for assistance and collaboration in terms of establishing a manufacturing base through our companies here for their vaccine; basically connecting the Russian teams with Indian manufacturing companies that in normal course also happens but that connect was facilitated and they are in talks with various companies,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, who chairs the Covid-19 empowered group for vaccines in India.“Another dimension was to look into regulatory pathways for phase 3 trials or any other clinical trials to be facilitated here. Indian government has conveyed to them to apply with appropriate documents; they have to identify the entity that will approach the regulator on their behalf. We hope they will soon approach the central regulator systematically while adhering to the norms and regulations of India. It is a work in progress,” Dr Paul added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-likely-to-have-50-100-efficacy-icmr/story-QAMr8HTxJNBOya5JzwKXHJ.html

The assistance from the state will be given in two equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each.Speaking at a function organised for farmers in Bhopal, Chouhan said, “Mukhyamantri Kisan Kalyan Yojna (chief minister farmers’ welfare scheme) is being introduced in Madhya Pradesh. Under the scheme, the beneficiaries of PM Samman Nidhi—farmers’ families--will get Rs 4,000 in two equal instalments.” He said, “We have decided that all the schemes meant for farmers like relief under revenue circular book (RCB), PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, loans at zero percent interest rate, Prime Minister crop insurance scheme etc will be implemented in a package for the sake of holistic development of farmers.” He enumerated his government’s efforts to ensure the benefit of various welfare programmes reached the farmers while promising to work towards doubling their income by 2022.Also Read: 2 more ministers of Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet test Covid-19 positive“We implemented again the government’s scheme to provide loans to farmers at zero percent interest rate. The farmers were given benefits of Pradhan Mantri Samman Nidhi and crop insurance scheme. Farmers were given more than Rs 27,000 crore against procurement of food grains. We will not spare any effort to double the income of farmers till 2022,” Chouhan said. However, Congress downplayed the announcement and said it was likely to be like previous announcements which “failed” to provide any relief to farmers in reality.

Further, since it’s a policy decision of the government, would the CM tell people as to when this decision was taken by his cabinet? So far, we have no knowledge that it was decided in any cabinet meeting. This is all to mislead people for votes in the ensuing by-election,” said Bhupendra Gupta, state Congress spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-announces-rs-4-000-for-pm-samman-nidhi-beneficiary-farmers/story-RruFkyLvxNcPbk2MiYCf9L.html

The Congress, Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Left parties had declared on Tuesday they will boycott the rest of the session in the Upper House over farm bills.Representatives of the Opposition will meet the President of India at 5pm Wednesday to urge him not to give his assent to the farm bills to turn them into laws.The Opposition had decided to oppose the three labour codes inside the House, but the quick passage of the farm bills coupled with the suspension of the eight MPs changed their plans.Also Read: Rajya Sabha holds crucial meeting as Opposition boycotts Parliament proceedingsThe monsoon session of Parliament is expected to end on Wednesday after another round of bills is cleared.

In September, the southern peninsula has recorded 80% excess rainfall. Rainfall recorded in the 19% excess and 19% deficiency is considered in the normal range for a monsoon.Rainfall in UP in the next two days is expected to reduce the rain deficiency over north-west India. Western UP has reported a 37% rain deficiency during this monsoon season.The low-pressure area, which had developed over the north-west Bay of Bengal on September 20, is lying over northern Chhattisgarh with an associated cyclonic circulation. It is likely to move west-north-westwards during the next two days and later north-eastwards towards UP, IMD had said in its bulletin on Monday night.The monsoon trough, which is an area of low-pressure, is lying south of its normal position. A trough is running from southern Maharashtra to sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim.Under the influence of these systems, the IMD is expecting widespread and heavy rainfall over Konkan, Goa and western UP on Wednesday. A similar forecast has been made for eastern UP on Wednesday and Thursday and over Bihar from Wednesday to Friday.Extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), is likely to occur over eastern UP on Wednesday following which it is likely to shift to the north-eastern region.Widespread rainfall with isolated cases of extremely heavy rainfall is likely to occur over sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Meghalaya until Thursday due to the convergence of strong moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal at a lower troposphere, the IMD has predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-warning-for-uttar-pradesh-northeastern-states/story-WrsPpaAg9JfKaR45EdYzTJ.html
23-09-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Lack of facilities and other challenges for India||Even as worldwide hunt for a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine continues, leading vaccine scientist Gagandeep Kang has said rolling out an eventual vaccine safely across India’s 1.3 billion population will be the country’s biggest challenge in fighting the disease.A vaccine for the raging pandemic is likely to be ready by early 2021.Kang, a member of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, said India--which is host to some of the front-runner vaccine clinical trials--has no local infrastructure to go beyond immunising babies and pregnant women. “With senior citizens being most vulnerable, we need to quickly come up with infrastructure to immunise them,” she further said.Here are some challenges India faces in its vaccination program:(1.) Storage and distribution: Storage and distribution of vaccine will be a major issue as vaccines are needed across the country, and not just in a particular region. A large number of trained people will be needed for this.(2.) Lack of infrastructure: Kang further said India does not have the experience of vaccination of people of all age groups. Lack of proper facilities for this will also present a major challenge.(3.) Low temperature: According to a Forbes report, any coronavirus vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of -70 degree Celsius. However, in India, most cold chains operate at temperatures up to -30 degree Celsius.(4.) Questionable testing: Around 50% antigen tests being conducted in India might be false. In such a scenario, wrong data will create a lot of obstacles. (5.) Rate of infection: The country currently has a positivity rate of 8%. Also, the rate of spread of infection has not slowed down. Due to this, the number of patients is set to increase.With a tally of more than 5.5 million, India currently has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, after the United States. However, it also has the most recovered cases, contributing 19.5% of total global recoveries, as per the Union health ministry.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccination-lack-of-facilities-and-other-challenges-for-india/story-lb6qKOUogrhtOLrz7HpfYN.html

Here’s why||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday is scheduled to meet the chief ministers of seven states, which are majorly contributing to the country’s Covid-19 caseload. The meeting comes just ahead of the completion of Unlock 4 — the last phase of the unlocking, which will end on September 30. After the country went under a nationwide lockdown on March 25, PM Modi held several virtual meetings with the CMs to discuss the Covid-19 situation. Here is all you need to know about today’s meeting* The chief ministers of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Punjab will attend the meeting.* These seven states account for 63 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases in the country.* Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi are reporting a case fatality rate of at least 2 per cent.* These states have recently reported a daily uptick in the number of cases as well.* Centre is sending its team to states to help state governments in containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management. Recently, a team was sent to J&K. The Covid-19 situation of Delhi is also being monitored by a Centre-delhi government joint team. It will be assessed whether these seven states need central guidance at this point of time.On Tuesday, India crossed the 5.5 million-mark in terms of number of coronavirus disease cases.

Ramchandran Yellappa, was arrested for allegedly raping the British national at Canacona in South Goa in 2018 and is currently on trial in the case. Jail authorities said that an examination of CCTV footage showed that Yellappa didn’t exit through the main gate, which is the only way in and out of the complex either through jumping over it or going right through it for an ‘errand’ that are sometimes given to prisoners lodged as part of their daily chores. Instead, it is being considered that he could be hiding within the complex or could have somehow scaled the high walls that surround the jail complex. “We are on the lookout for him, the search is on. He hasn’t left through the main gate, so we believe that he could be within the complex itself,” an official at the jail, said.Also Read: Goa to approach SC to modify Tarun Tejpal trial timelines in view of Covid-19If true, this would not be the first time when Yellappa has escaped from custody while under trial. In June last year, while being produced before a court, he removed the glass panels covering the ventilator in the toilet inside the court complex and escaped. He was later arrested. In December 2018, a 42-year old British woman was allegedly raped and robbed on her way back from the railway station at Goa’s southernmost tehsil of Canacona.

Additionally, the pharma companies developing the vaccines must provide adequate data informing the potential risk of vaccine-associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (ERD).Also Read | 30 Covid-19 vaccine candidates under development, Govt informs Lok SabhaDCGI has also asked the pharma companies to keep pregnant women and women of childbearing potential in mind as they are developing the vaccines. Safety assessments throughout clinical development and all pregnancies in study participants for which the date of conception is prior to vaccination or within 30 days after vaccination should be followed for pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies, it said.Fifty per cent efficacy is a global standard as WHO, in its guidelines, mentioned 50 per cent efficacy fro a vaccine to be accepted and pharma giants like Astrazeneca, too, in its trial blueprint asserted that the company is working towards a vaccine with 50 per cent efficacy. “For respiratory viruses, we never get 100 per cent efficacy. We are aiming for 100 per cent efficacy but may get 50-100 per cent,” Dr Balram Bhargava, ICMR, Director-General said.The DCGI has also asked pharma companies to present a final analysis plan before closing the trail database. “This should include any planned interim analyses, which should be adequately addressed in terms of purpose, timing, and any statistical adjustments required,” the guideline said. “If a trial fails to meet the predefined criteria for superiority and/or non-inferiority with respect to any of the antigenic components, the possible reasons for the result and the clinical implications of it should be carefully considered before proceeding with clinical development or licensure,” DCGI said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-at-least-50-per-cent-efficacy-dgci-issues-new-guidelines/story-tff80MhcJNB8ANmRiaB3ZN.html
23-09-2020||India||Facebook India moves supreme court against Delhi assembly panel summons||Facebook India and its vice president and managing director Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday, challenging the September 10 and September 18 notices issued by the Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee that sought Mohan’s presence before the panel that is probing the Delhi riots and the role of the social media firm in alleged hate speech.The petition said that the subject matter under investigation by the Delhi assembly fell within the exclusive domain of the Union government and a state legislative assembly could not compel witnesses to appear and provide evidence on such subjects.“The Committee seeks to compel petitioner No. 1 (Ajit Mohan) to provide testimony on subjects within the exclusive domain of the Union of India. Specifically, the Committee is seeking to make a ‘determination of the veracity of allegations levelled against Facebook’ in the Delhi riots, which intrudes into subjects exclusively allocated to the Union of India,” the petition said.The plea also contended that the summons violates the right of the petitioner to remain silent and his right to privacy, which are fundamental rights. “By targeting Facebook – a platform that allows users to express themselves – the summons create a chilling effect on the free speech rights of users of the Facebook service,” the plea added.The case will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Wednesday.Mohan was first summoned by the committee for its meeting ofSeptember 15 in connection with complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by the social media company in removing hateful content and posts. The committee earlier said that in its meeting of August 31, it prima facie found Facebook India was allegedly complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead.Notice was issued to Facebook officials on September 10 based on that finding, asking them to appear before the panel on September 15, but Facebook officials failed to appear for the meeting. A second notice was issued on September 18.In its summons issued on September 18, the committee said that it was empowered to make suggestions to the central government and it was in line with cooperative federalism which “encompasses a large number of areas including making recommendations to the union government when the same is required”.The committee is investigating the matter based on several complaints received from the public after an article was published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14.The WSJ report titled “Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics” alluded to the role allegedly played by top Facebook officials, particularly its public policy head Ankhi Das, by citing business imperatives to refrain from applying hate-speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though the groups and individuals had been internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.In a letter to the social media company recently, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Facebook’s India team was dominated by people who “belong to a particular political belief” and have acted against users “supportive of the right-of-centre” ideology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-india-moves-supreme-court-against-delhi-assembly-panel-summons/story-exrgUJRGksKVLeDlUsoMWL.html
23-09-2020||India||Govt pushes flurry of bills as Oppn boycotts||At least seven Opposition parties boycotted proceedings in both Houses, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said they would go on a fast, and the government hurriedly pushed through key bills on an action-packed Tuesday — with the possibility of the monsoon session being cut short and ending on Wednesday. The eight members of Parliament (MPs) suspended for the commotion during the controversial passage of farm reform bills in the Rajya Sabha, spent Monday night protesting outside Parliament, rebuffed a conciliatory gesture by Harivansh (who went to meet them with tea in the morning), but ended their vigil after Opposition parties decided to boycott the Lok Sabha for the remainder of the session. The Rajya Sabha, where the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) does not have a majority, passed at least seven bills in just three-and-a-half hours in the absence of Opposition voices, making Tuesday’s session one of the most productive in its history. The Lok Sabha, where the NDA has a clear majority, took up three important labour reform bills, and cleared them, with the Congress and some other opposition parties boycotting the day’s proceedings to protest the happenings in the Upper House.  The Lok Sabha will meet around 6pm on Wednesday and is likely to cut short the session, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The Rajya Sabha’s business advisory committee met without the Opposition’s participation on Tuesday evening. The Upper House, which will convene at 9am, is set to adjourn sine die after taking up remaining bills on Wednesday, the people added. The monsoon session of Parliament, which began on September 14, was supposed to end on October 1. HT reported on Sunday that the session may end as early as on September 23 after many parties agreed to cut it short amid a rising number of Covid-19 cases linked to the Parliament House complex; 32 Parliamentarians, including two ministers, and more than 100 officials have tested positive for Covid-19 in a testing drive in Parliament ever since the session began. The Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Trinamool Congress, CPI (M), Aam Aadmi Party, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, and Samajwadi Party all boycotted the session citing the suspension of the MPs, and the way the farm bills were pushed through, without a division or voting. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) too walked out of the two Houses with its members saying they were not part of the Opposition but have done so on their own, alleging that the government was only trying to “bluff” the farmers. “We will not end our boycott till the government brings another bill making it illegal for private players to buy food grains from farmers below the MSP, all state agencies comply by the MSP and the procurement price is fixed as per the Swaminathan panel’s recommendations,” Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters outside the Parliament building. He also said the revocation of suspension of the Opposition members was not a demand but a request. Azad said the House should run in coordination between the government and the Opposition. “But there should not be coordination between chair and government,” he said, referring to Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh pushing through the two contentious farm bills on Sunday while allegedly ignoring Opposition voices. “President Ram Nath Kovind should not give assent to the bills as proper procedure was not followed in their passage in the Rajya Sabha,” he added. In its reply, the government said it was not keeping the suspended MPs away from the House but they should express regret over their behaviour. “Let them apologise, we will consider withdrawing the suspension,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters. On Monday, Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and his colleague Dola Sen; Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh; Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) were suspended for seven days each for “disorderly conduct”. Vice-president and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday rejected a notice for a no-confidence motion against Harivansh as it was not in proper format and did not give a 14-day notice period. Among the seven bills passed by the Upper House were The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, approved by the Lower House on September 15, seeks to remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities, replacing an ordinance promulgated in June. It is the third bill in the government’s farm liberalisation plan. The Lok Sabha, too, witnessed uproarious scenes with the Opposition demanding that the government should roll back the farms bills and withdraw the suspension of the eight Rajya Sabha members. “Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha are like twin brothers...if one is in pain, the other has to be concerned. Our issue is related to the farm bills; we want them be taken back,” Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, the Congress’s leader of the House, said. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said it is unfortunate that the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were discussed in the Lok Sabha. “Whatever happens in one House, it has never been discussed in another House. It is unfortunate that this thing is being discussed now.” Harivansh, meanwhile, wrote a letter — addressed to the President and Vice-President — invoking his humble origins in Bihar and went on a day-long fast on Tuesday to protest “humiliating” conduct towards him by some MPs.“In the name of democracy, members of the House indulged in violent behaviour. There was an effort to intimidate the person in the chair. All norms of the Upper House were disregarded. The rule book was torn and thrown over me...,” he wrote.Congress member Satav, one of those suspended members, said: “We are equally pained and hurt over the way the deputy chairman conducted the proceedings in the House on Sunday. Seeking a division or amendments are our Parliamentary rights that were denied to us by him...”NCP chief Pawar, too, said he was observing a day-long fast to protest the suspension of the eight members of the Upper House. Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, Pawar, a Rajya Sabha member, also bemoaned the conduct of Harivansh and the government’s decision of “bulldozing” the Opposition in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-pushes-flurry-of-bills-as-oppn-boycotts/story-MoFJc6C3b6VCw2ORTrGGcL.html
23-09-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that 64 rich countries have joined its Covax facility for fair distribution and allocation of a Covid-19 vaccine. This writer has previously referred to Covax, a partnership of vaccine developers and countries set up by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), and WHO, that aims to source and distribute two billion doses of the vaccine by the end of 2021. Another 38 countries are expected to join Covax in the next few days, WHO said. Currently (including the 64), 156 countries are part of the facility under which they will receive the vaccines – with 92 eligible for free or subsidised vaccines. The rich countries will pay for the vaccine, though – their participation is, in effect, a hedge to ensure they have access to a successful vaccine (although many of them have already signed deals with vaccine-makers for hundreds of millions of doses). WHO said on Monday that its alliance now covers 64% of the world’s population. Interestingly, neither China nor the US (the world’s most populous and third most populous nations) are part of the facility. India is part of the facility by virtue of being a lower-middle income economy.Covax is a work-in-progress, and is yet to raise the money it needs to pay for or subsidise the vaccines for lower-income countries. There have also been questions about whether the richer countries that are part of the facility will pay because of the deals they have already struck with vaccine-makers (the argument for is that they will do so as a way to build a vaccine stockpile in the best-case scenario and as a sort of insurance for the worst-case one). A previous instalment of this column cited an article from Nature magazine that showed that many rich countries have already struck deals with vaccine-makers to cover their entire population. The UK, for instance, has firm agreements that ensure a little more than five doses per capita; the US, two; the EU, close to two; Japan, 1.5; and Australia, one. This data is as of late August, so it is likely the numbers have increased.WHO’s vaccine allocation plan, which has been public for some time, envisages distributing vaccine doses to cover 3% of the population of each of the participating countries and then scaling this up to 20%. Its assessment is that this will cover frontline workers in the fight against Covid, as well as the most vulnerable groups. In the second phase of distribution, WHO plans to use a risk assessment technique to understand “the potential impact of Covid-19” on a country and “the vulnerability of a country based on health systems and population factors”. The agency actually has a detailed methodology for risk assessment. There has been some criticism of WHO’s allocation protocol – the countries that need the vaccine the most should be prioritised even in Phase 1, some say. But that would have perhaps made Covax a non-starter.Interestingly, the US National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (Nasem) put out, in early September, a document detailing a possible protocol for what it termed “equitable allocation of vaccine for the novel coronavirus”. The organisation suggests four criteria to determine the allocation: infection risk, mortality risk, “risk of negative societal impact”, and transmission risk. Based on these, Nasem came up with a four-phase plan for the allocation of the vaccine. In the first part of Phase 1, it suggests vaccinating frontline workers in the fight against Covid-19; in the second part of the first phase, it extends this to people with comorbidities as well as old people living in crowded areas. Its recommendation for the second phase includes workers in “essential” industries with high exposure risk, teachers, old people not covered in the first phase, and the homeless. In Phase 3, Nasem recommends the coverage of “young adults” and children, and also workers in “essential industries” with “increased” risk. And Phase 4 covers everyone not already covered.India’s expert group on vaccines is working on the country’s own vaccine prioritisation protocol, and it could do worse than to look closely at the Covax allocation methodology of WHO or Nasem’s allocation framework. We need a plan for when the vaccine will be available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-0aOchR7Rge8OhxlsleFY2J.html

23-09-2020||India||India corners Pak on terrorism at UN||India on Tuesday rejected Pakistan’s contention that the Kashmir issue is one of the most longstanding disputes at the United Nations, saying Islamabad should instead focus on the unfinished task of tackling terrorism. In a video message on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi lauded the world body’s achievements but also referred to “failings and deficiencies”. “The organisation is only as good as its member states wish it to be. The Jammu & Kashmir and Palestine disputes are the organisation’s most glaring and long-standing disputes. The people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir still await fulfilment of the commitment made to them by the UN to grant them their right to self-determination,” he said. “Today, the UN is derided as a talk shop. Its resolutions and decisions are flouted. International cooperation, especially in the Security Council, is at its lowest,” he added. Exercising its “right of reply”, the Indian delegation at the UN responded soon after, with first secretary Vidisha Maitra saying India had hoped the General Assembly “would be spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods that have now become a trademark of Pakistan’s interventions of such platforms” during the commemoration of a shared global milestone. “However, for a nation that is bereft of milestones, one can only expect a stonewalled and stymied approach to reason, diplomacy and dialogue,” she said. Turning to the specific reference to the Kashmir issue, Maitra said Pakistan was interfering in India’s internal matters. “What we heard today is the never-ending fabricated narrative presented by the Pakistani representative about the internal affairs of India. We reject the malicious reference made to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, which is an integral part of India,” she said. “If there is an item that is unfinished on the agenda of the UN it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism. Pakistan is a country which is globally recognised as the epicentre of terrorism, which by its own admission harbours and trains terrorists and hails them as martyrs and consistently persecutes its ethnic and religious minorities,” she added. Maitra said Pakistan “would do well to turn its attention inwards to immediately addressing these pressing concerns instead of diverting attention from them by misusing the UN platform”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-corners-pak-on-terrorism-at-un/story-MItnBowDVPhS4L7slekwrI.html

The government is claiming that the deregulation -- the new ECA removes restrictions over movement and storage of food items such as onions by private players -- will incentivise creation of better infrastructure and lead to an increase in farm incomes. Critics maintain that this could actually legalise hoarding. Farmers, starved of capital, often sell their crops when prices are low. Onions present an interesting study. While they are not an essential commodity, last week, the Union government banned onion exports. HT reported that the government also planned to release its buffer stocks in the market to bring down prices. Inflation has emerged as a serious problem in the past few months. Headline inflation has been above 6%, the upper band of the Reserve Bank of India’s comfort level, for the fifth consecutive month. Food inflation is above 9%.The government’s move to ban onion exports and release buffer stocks, in this context, is a pre-emptive strike on inflation .Onion farmers, however, are likely to end up in tears. The recent rally in prices came after a long phase of lower prices . This is not the first time this is happening. Unlike their grain producing brethren, vegetable farmers face a far greater volatility in prices and incomes. This is because there are no Minimum Support Price (MSP) driven price floors and costs do not come down when prices crash. Also, while the government is pro-active in limiting windfall gains for farmers during times of high prices in the name of fighting inflation, it does not shy away from pursuing inflationary policies for its own gains. For instance, it continues to impose high duties on petrol and diesel, while attacking onion farmers’ incomes to control inflation. Vegetable prices more volatile than cereals National Account Statistics (NAS) data gives value of production of major crops in both current and constant prices. While the prices of two major cereals, rice and wheat, have been rising continuously, those of important vegetables, tend to fluctuate a lot. This volatility is not seen in the cost of production. An examination of A2+FL measure of cost – this includes cost of hired and own labour, rent of leased in land and other inputs – for rice, wheat, potatoes and onions proves this. Wildly fluctuating prices, with continuously rising costs, mean that vegetable farmers are vulnerable to a large volatility in incomes. This also means that unless they are allowed to make windfall gains, they cannot compensate for the windfall losses they suffer when prices crash.  An article by Ila Patnaik and Radhika Pandey, economists at the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy, says that the government has changed export rules for onions at least 17 times between 2104 and 2019. The frequent export bans may suggest that most of India’s onion output is exported. An analysis of trade data shows that this is not the case. Onion exports are usually less than 10% of domestic production, and here too, farmers face a very volatile market. High prices don’t always lead to higher incomes Farmers value revenue over prices. Many instances of a spike in onion prices -- this holds true for most horticultural products -- are driven by a shortfall in supply due to weather-related crop destruction. This means that even though prices are high, farm-incomes might not rise commensurately, and, in fact, even fall, as the quantity of crops sold goes down. The fact that farmers lack the financial wherewithal to store crops, means that they are far less likely to have accumulated inventories to gain from these sudden spikes. Data on daily turnover of onions at the Lasalgaon market in Nashik district, among the most important onion producing regions in the country, proves this (to be sure, this data is only a proxy for farmer incomes). The data highlights two things. One, there is large scale volatility in monthly turnover of onions, which implies a volatility in incomes of onion farmers. Two, periods of high inflation need not coincide with periods of high income for onion farmers. For example, in 2019, wholesale price inflation for onions grew at a slower pace in July (7.6%) and August (33%) than in October (119.8%) and November (172.3%). Yet, the turnover in July and August was much higher than in October and November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-onion-farmers-often-end-up-in-tears/story-mfqp4ChBFV1vFHBnWTQYuI.html
23-09-2020||India||‘Bihari pride’ in focus amid uproar in House||The uproar in Parliament over the controversial passage of farm bills resonated in poll-bound Bihar with senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the Opposition’s protests against Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh hurt ‘Bihari pride’. Harivansh, a member of the Janata Dal (United) who was a journalist and writer, hails from Bihar and the government has sought to corner the Opposition for the “heckling”, “abuse” and “disrespect” shown to the senior Bihar politician. The controversy began on Sunday when the government rushed through two contentious farm bills amid fierce protests from the Opposition. Senior Opposition leaders charged towards Harivansh, jumped onto tables; and alleged that their demand for a division of votes was denied. The next day, eight Opposition members were suspended, triggering even more unrest and protests by the Opposition. Hours later, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who represents the Patna Sahib Constituency in the Lok Sabha, linked the issue to Bihari pride. “An eminent Indian who hails from Bihar was humiliated; the people of Bihar will give a response. Harivansh ji remained dignified… We will not make it a political issue but people are hurt,” the minister said. He also trained his guns at the Opposition and said, “The way Congress and RJD [Rashtriya Janata Dal] were silent and even encouraged the protesting MPs in the Rajya Sabha, this will be told to the people of the state. Both Congress and RJD will have to answer.” The Congress and the RJD are part of the Opposition alliance in the Bihar assembly elections, scheduled for later this year. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put out two tweets to appreciate the deputy chairperson’s gesture of serving tea to the suspended MPs who spent the night in protest inside the Parliament complex. “To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on Dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart. It shows his greatness. I join the people of India in congratulating Harivansh Ji,” the PM said. In a second tweet, he referred to Harivansh’s Bihari roots. “For centuries, the great land of Bihar has been teaching us the values of democracy. In line with that wonderful ethos, MP from Bihar and Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Shri Harivansh Ji’s inspiring and statesman like conduct this morning will make every democracy lover proud,” the PM said. This is the second time in this session that the PM has invoked the deputy chairperson’s connection with Bihar. On September 14, when Harivansh was re-elected as deputy Rajya Sabha chair for the second term, the PM mentioned how he belonged to “the land of democracy.” “When anyone who is a seeker of democracy, from the land of democracy, Bihar, from JP’s (Jayprakash Narayan) and Karpuri Thakur’s land, from Bapu’s (Mahatma Gandhi) Champaran, steps forward to take responsibility, this is what happens…what Harivansh has accomplished,” the PM said while complimenting his conduct of the House. Harivansh wrote a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu, invoking his humble origins in Bihar.Harivansh noted that he was born in the same village at Saran in Bihar as anti-Emergency icon Jayaprakash Narayan and spoke about the influence of Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Karpoori Thakur and Chandra Shekhar on him. “I am a man of village and built by literature, sensibilities and values,” he said.In Bihar, where the BJP is part of the ruling alliance with the JD(U), deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said the incident “hurt the pride of Bihar”. Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP, Jairam Ramesh, alleged that the BJP was politicising the issue. He tweeted, “The shadow of the forthcoming Bihar elections has fallen over Parliament now. It is all very well for Constitutional authorities to demand respect. They must, in fact, command respect by their non-partisan actions.”RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav agreed with him. “They (BJP) will keep talking of Bihar now, and the moment elections end they will forget Bihar. The PM still has not sent a central team to assess the flood situation here. As far as farm Bills are concerned, we’ll hold a protest against it,” he said. Shankar Dutt, a professor at Patna University, said the assembly polls is likely to be dominated by issues of health care, employment and education, and not the Rajya Sabha ruckus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihari-pride-in-focus-amid-uproar-in-house/story-Y8YFFV2uwamDW8wN44tIIM.html
23-09-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi return from US amid House standoff||Congress president Sonia Gandhi accompanied by her son Rahul Gandhi returned to India on Tuesday after undergoing a routine health check-up in the US, people familiar with the development said. The two left on September 12. Both of them have missed a major part of the monsoon session that began on September 14. The session is likely to be curtailed in view of the rising number of Covid cases in the country with several Members of Parliament (MPs) and the Parliament staff testing positive. Confirming their return, an aide of Rahul Gandhi said the two leaders reached Delhi around 7 am on Tuesday. Later, Rahul Gandhi posted a series of tweets accusing the Modi government of working for the development of crony capitalists at the cost of farmers. “2014- Modi ji’s election promise of Swaminathan commission MSP (minimum support price) for farmers. 2015- Modi government said in court that this will not be possible. 2020- Black agriculture laws,” he tweeted in Hindi. Then, in a four-line verse in Hindi, he sarcastically said, “Modi ji’s intention is clear” with new “anti-agriculture” attempt.Before leaving for abroad, Sonia Gandhi carried out major organisational changes in the Congress Working Committee and her team of office bearers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-return-amid-house-standoff/story-IgIeJUswib1KpFVd5vRj2I.html
23-09-2020||India||‘Sleepless night’: Harivansh on fast||Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh, who has been accused of not paying heed to the Opposition’s demand for a division of votes on two contentious agricultural reform bills and for overlooking the views of Upper House members sitting in the Lok Sabha chamber at the time, invoked his humble origins in Bihar and went on a day-long fast on Tuesday to protest “humiliating” conduct towards him by some MPs.Harivansh wrote a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Rajya Sabha chairperson, saying protests in the Upper House during the passage of the two bills on Sunday caused him pain, stress and mental tension. “I was not able to sleep the whole night,” he wrote.Harivansh, who was elected deputy chairperson for the second time on September 14, was in the Chair when the bills were passed in the midst of pandemonium. Opposition parties, who say he denied them their parliamentary rights by ignoring their demands, later drafted a no-confidence motion against Harivansh. It was rejected by Naidu as it was not in proper format and did not give a 14-day notice period.Footage from the House showed that fierce protests from the Opposition, including senior leaders charging towards the Chair, jumping onto tables; and shooting videos of the ruckus. “Ugly and unparliamentary slogans were raised. Scenes that can disturb the heart and mind, scenes that bring shame on democracy... I am an introvert, belong to a village and rooted in literature, sensitivity and values,” Harivansh, a leader of Bihar’s ruling Janata Dal (United), said in his letter.“In the name of democracy, members of the House indulged in violent behaviour. There was an effort to intimidate the person in the chair. All norms of the Upper House were disregarded. The rule book was torn and thrown over me. The historic table on which officials carry on the work of the Upper House was climbed upon and papers torn. Some were thrown at the chair,” he said. Harivansh said like lighthouses in the dark, institutions determine the future course for societies and countries. “That is why the Rajya Sabha and the position of the Rajya Sabha chairman are more important and glorious, not me,” he wrote.Harivansh said he was going on fast hoping it would lead to a feeling of “atma-shuddhi (self correction)” in the MPs who had behaved in an unruly manner.Trinamool Congress floor leader Derek O’Brien and his colleague Dola Sen; Aam Aadmi Party’s Sanjay Singh; Congress’s Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah; and KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of the CPI(M) were suspended for seven days each on Monday for their conduct inside the House amid protests that their version of events were not heard. Since their suspension, the eight MPs were holding a protest on the Parliament premises. They called off the protest around Tuesday noon. The members said what happened inside the Rajya Sabha over the farm bills was “undemocratic” and “against the idea of India”.“We are equally pained and hurt... He was under pressure from the government, which, in turn, was under pressure from the corporate to get the farm bills passed on that very day. Also, why did he bring media along when he came with tea in the morning?” said Satav.His reference was to a gesture by Harivansh to bring tea and snacks for the protesting MPs in the morning. “The farmers want justice, not tea. Is this a child’s play? First you murder democracy and then you offer tea? If it was a personal visit, then why did he have two cameras with him?” asked O’Brien, another of those suspended. The government claims that the division of votes could not take place because members did not go to their seats despite repeated pleas by the deputy chairperson.PM Narendra Modi, meanwhile, said Harivansh’s gesture was proof of his greatness. “To personally serve tea to those who attacked and insulted him a few days ago as well as those sitting on Dharna shows that Shri Harivansh Ji has been blessed with a humble mind and a big heart. It shows his greatness...,” he tweeted.Naidu, too, backed Harivansh and said he had acted with utmost restraint. “He handled the situation in a very deft manner,” Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sleepless-night-harivansh-on-fast/story-M6Oh6J5uAT0XBw6ZVBRsZL.html

Apart from telephonic communication, the hospitals should use social media applications like WhatsApp to communicate the voice and pictures of the patient to the attendants of the patient. A dedicated conference room may be set up outside the Covid-19 facility with provision of TV and Cameras which can be connected with CCTVs installed inside the facilities so that the attendant can see the patient and talk with him/her,” the department notification said.The state government’s notification came two days after BJP Lok Sabha MP from Bargarh, Suresh Pujari urged the Centre to take charge of Covid-19 management in Odisha citing that the state government has utterly failed in testing, tracing and treatment of patients. Participating in a debate on the Covid-19 situation in the country in the Lok Sabha on Sunday, Pujari who recovered from Covid-19 infection recently, alleged that a large number of infected people are dying due to lack of treatment as the health system has collapsed. Pujari had urged the health ministry to make arrangements for providing information about the health condition of Covid-19 patients under treatment to their family members on a daily basis as they have no access to hospitals.The health department said steps should be taken to collect and record the contact numbers of the patient at the time of admission and even if not inquired by the attendant of the patient, a general information of the condition of the patient needed to be communicated as a SMS or WhatsApp message to the attendant of the patient every day at least once.It warned that non-functioning of the helpdesk would attract action against the erring hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-all-covid-19-hospitals-to-set-up-helpdesks-to-convey-health-status-to-kin/story-ZJp8E4KHw92dtbNHAEXhTP.html

Petitioners shall appear before the court below on October 8 and furnish a personal bond and two sureties,” the single-judge bench of justice Dinesh Mehta said.On September 16, the special CBI court ordered the registration of criminal cases against former Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, Baijal, Suri, Guha and Karamsey Vikamsey, then head of valuation firm Kanti Karamsey & Co. The CBI court’s order came despite the agency filing a closure report. The court will hear a petition by Shourie on Wednesday. The case centres on the sale of the Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur, earlier run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation, to Bharat Hotels Limited in 2002. The CBI filed an FIR in 2014, alleging that government lost Rs 244 crore in the sale.Justice Mehta said that attaching the property of a running hotel business for a transaction that took place in 2002,that too, without notice to the petitioner or her hotel, is beyond comprehension; particularly when a decision about the petitioner’s involvement or guilt was yet to be taken by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-arrest-warrants-for-3-petitioners-in-rajasthan-hotel-sale-case/story-29p538fPM1vGjLfofGMkjP.html
23-09-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee wants Ayushman Bharat, Kisan Samman Nidhi schemes in Bengal but with riders||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had written to the Centre on September 9 that she was open to implementation of the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme for farmers as well as the Ayushman Bharat Yojana healthcare scheme if the funds were transferred directly to her government for disbursement. Banerjee also said the Centre would have to bear 100 per cent cost of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. This was the first time the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief expressed her willingness to start these schemes although she had been at the receiving end of attacks by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2014 for not implementing the Centre’s social welfare projects. The letters Banerjee wrote to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar were released on social media by the state government on Tuesday afternoon while the BJP was heightening its campaign, accusing her of depriving millions of farmers of the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme against the backdrop of her opposition to the farmers’ bills passed by Parliament on Sunday. The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme is funded entirely by the Centre but in case of Ayushman Bharat, states have to bear 40 per cent of the contribution towards premium. Only the states in the North-East and three Himalayan states have to bear 10 per cent of this cost. “On different occasions, it is heard that the state government in Bengal is not implementing the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi launched by the Central government. It may please be appreciated that the state government has already introduced way before the Krishak Bandhu scheme to provide financial assistance to farmers including sharecroppers,” Banerjee wrote to Tomar on September 9. “Under this scheme, every farmer/sharecropper receives Rs 5000 from the government. The scheme also envisages death benefit of Rs 2 lakh in case of unfortunate death of any farmer in the age group of 18 to 60. More than 70 lakh farmers are being covered under the Krishak Bandhu scheme in Bengal,” she wrote, adding that the scheme also offers crop insurance and the premium is borne entirely by the government. Saying that the state’s scheme leads to a huge expenditure, Banerjee wrote, “We will be happy to provide benefits to the farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme and in that case the Central government may transfer the requisite fund direct to the state government for further disbursement with full responsibility to the beneficiaries through the state government machinery.” In a similar letter to Dr Harsh Vardhan, Banerjee said the state government provides 100 per cent free treatment, medicines and diagnostic tests for all in government hospitals and also provides an annual cover of Rs 5 lakh under the Swasthya Sathi scheme for treatment of critical diseases such as cancer, heart disease etc. at private hospitals. “More than 7.5 crore people in Bengal are covered under Swasthya Sathi,” she wrote. “Ayushman Bharat scheme may be extended by the Government of India with entire 100 per cent expenditure for the scheme. In such a case the entire funding for the scheme may be routed through the state government,“ wrote Banerjee. Reacting to the letters, the Bengal BJP alleged that Banerjee was trying to find a way to raise funds for the crucial assembly polls to be held next year. “The chief minister has asked for direct transfer of funds so that the money can go her party’s election fund. We have seen now Central funds meant for providing relief to people affected by cyclone Amphan in May was misappropriated. The cut-money (bribe or commission) culture is an integral part of the ruling party,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. Even governor Jagdeep Dhankhar wrote a letter to the chief minister on Monday, saying if timely steps had been taken by the state government over 70 lakh farmers would have received Rs 8,400 crore under the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. “Each of the over 70 lakh farmers would have so far got Rs 12,000 directly in the bank accounts without any intermediary,” wrote the governor on Monday. The letter was released to the media by the Raj Bhawan on Tuesday when Banerjee’s party hit the streets of Kolkata in protest against the farmers’ bills. After Banerjee’s letters to the two Union ministers were released to the media Dhankhar called a press conference at Raj Bhawan on Tuesday evening where he criticized the state government. Funds for Central welfare schemes go directly to the beneficiaries and not routed through the state, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-wants-ayushman-bharat-kisan-samman-nidhi-schemes-in-bengal-but-with-riders/story-FPvlPL0x5ZisbjU10tBgIK.html

September 22 was the last working day for the 1987-batch IPS officer. The Bihar Governor late on Tuesday evening approved the request of Pandey seeking VRS from services. A notification in this regard was also issued by the home department. Pandey in all probability will contest assembly polls. He was due to retire in February next year. Following the VRS of DGP, Director general of Homeguard and Fire services, Sanjiv Kumar Singhal has been given additional charge of the DGP .Gupteshwar Pandey has been in the news recently. He has made it to the headlines and is a talking point on social media in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput case.Pandey had earlier taken premature retirement to contest Lok Sabha elections in 2009. Gupteshwar Pandey, a 1987 batch IPS officer of Bihar cadre, reportedly wished to contest from the Buxar Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in 2009.With the intention of contesting the Lok Sabha polls, the now Bihar DGP opted for voluntary retirement scheme in March, 2009. His dream to plunge into electoral politics, however, did not materialize.Nine months after his VRS, Pandey requested the Bihar government to allow him to withdraw his resignation. The Nitish Kumar-led government approved Pandey’s plea and the high-profile cop reported back to work. He went on to become the DGP of Bihar Police before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He was born in 1961 in Geruabandh village in Buxar district of Bihar. Pandey graduated from Patna University in Sanskrit and even took his UPSC exam in Sanskrit.

23-09-2020||India||LS burns midnight oil to clear pending bills||It wasn’t a dark and stormy night , but it was an unprecedented one in the history of Indian Parliament. On the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, the Lok Sabha worked till 12.24 am (Tuesday), clocking a new record of sitting beyond midnight for two consecutive nights after it did so on Sunday-Monday as well. And while the Lok Sabha was still buzzing even as the clock announced the beginning of Tuesday, just outside the parliament building, near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, a group of eight members of parliament (MPs) suspended from the Rajya Sabha by chairman Venkaiah Naidu for “gross disorderly conduct”, organized the first overnight protest seen in Indian Parliament. It was a new addition to the many new normals of the monsoon session against the looming shadow of a rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The night, as alive and richly coloured as the day, presented the two faces of India’s parliamentarians -- their commitment to work beyond the stipulated hours of the House and their right to democratically protest. In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Om Birla, 57, sat through the proceedings till the House was adjourned early on Tuesday to meet again in the afternoon. The Lok Sabha, scheduled to meet for four hours from 3 PM to 7 PM, cleared The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020 at 8.23 PM and at 11.38 PM approved The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill, 2020. It didn’t stop there. At 12. 22 AM, the Lower House of Parliament cleared The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 .  Parliament is no stranger to marathon proceedings. In the 70’s and 80’s, budget discussions often spilled over into the next day, but long time parliamentarians and also watchers of parliamentary proceedings claimed that this is perhaps the first time that bills were passed after midnight . The eight suspended MPs, Trinamool’s Derek O’Brien and Dola Sen, AAP’s Sanjay Singh, Congress leaders Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Borah, and CPIM’s KK Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem stayed overnight in Parliament, slept under the open sky and ate whatever snacks and packed thalis were made available to them. Kareem, 67, is the eldest of the eight and Rajeev Satav, 46, is the youngest. They eventually called off their protest late on Tuesday morning, after their parties decided to boycott the Rajya sabha for the reminder of the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-burns-midnight-oil-to-clear-pending-bills/story-F9p3PcuLDEIddXMq59z0fK.html
23-09-2020||India||Decoding the impact of ECA amendments||Parliament on Tuesday passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020, the third legislation linked to the Narendra Modi government’s plan to liberalise agricultural trade and usher in broader farm reforms. What does it do: The Essential Commodities Act 1955, which the bill amends, is mainly used to curb inflation by allowing the Centre to enable control by state governments of trade in a wide variety of commodities. The bill removes virtually most primary food items, such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions and potatoes, from the list of “essential commodities”. How did ECA work: States can dictate quantities traders can store and also restrict the movement of any commodity deemed “essential”. Under the law, the government generally imposes stock limits to discourage hoarding of items, including food commodities, such as pulses, edible oils and vegetables. Was ECA effective: Several experts have argued the law was handy in the 1960s and 1970s when India was still a net importer of food. The Economic Survey 2019-20, which devoted a full chapter to the issue, states that government intervention under the ECA 1955 often distorted agricultural trade while being totally ineffective in curbing inflation. “First, frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) neither brings down prices nor reduces price volatility. However, such intervention does enable opportunities for rent-seeking and harassment,” the Economic Survey had said. Rent-seeking is a term used by economists to describe unproductive income, including from corruption. For instance, the survey notes that stock limits on dal (lentils) in 2006, sugar in 2009 and onions in September 2019 spiked “the volatility of the wholesale and retail prices instead of smoothening them”. Since large stocks held by traders can be outlawed under the ECA 1955 anytime, they tend to buy far less than their usual capacity and farmers often suffer huge losses during surplus harvests of perishables. Such laws have kept poor farmers poor by restricting opportunities to export when global crop prices go up, according to a 2018 study by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of 36 countries, and the New Delhi-based research firm ICRIER. What’s the rationale for the bill: “While India has become surplus in most agricultural commodities, farmers have been unable to get better prices due to lack of investment in cold storage, warehouses, processing and export as entrepreneurs get discouraged by the regulatory mechanisms in the Essential Commodities Act, 1955,” according to the statement of objects and reasons laid out in the bill. How does the new bill work: The bill now requires that imposition of any stock limit on agricultural produce must be linked to prevailing inflation, war or famines or a grave situation. “A stock limit may be imposed only if there is a 100% increase in retail price of horticultural produce and 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable agricultural food items,” it says. The increase will be calculated over the price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or the average retail price of the last five years, whichever is lower. And the stocks of agribusinesses equivalent to their export order will not be subject to any limits. “This is such a wide range for a price trigger to invoke the ECA. Many things are left vague. Price triggers or price levels should have a reference to a locality. Suppose that a big food exporter says it has an export order from Ethiopia of, say, 1 lakh tonne? How will the government verify if that is a fake indent or a genuine one?” asked Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), critiquing the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-the-impact-of-eca-amendments/story-zytnowEInD30QSyIE8oPbK.html

Officials at the Disaster Management Authority said the earthquake was recorded at 9.40 pm, with its epicentre in Srinagar at a depth of five kilometres. There were no reports of any damage or casualties so far. The tremors were not felt in most parts of the Kashmir Valley. Deputy Commissioner Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary tweeted about the “scary” tremors experienced in the city. “This was scary. Hope everyone is safe. #EARTHQUAKE,” he posted on the social network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-6-magnitude-earthquake-in-srinagar/story-8GmC71ZtxrfMci4pIN8OIL.html
23-09-2020||India||Deadlock at talks, China wants India to exit key heights||Key talks over the dispute at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China remained inconclusive, with Indian negotiators firmly demanding comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante as the only approach towards de-escalation, and China asking India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction, officials familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.The two sides, however, made some headway. According to a joint statement, released in New Delhi and Beijing, they agreed to stop sending more troops to the front line, and to hold a seventh round of commander-level talks “as soon as possible, take practical measures to properly solve problems on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border area”. During the talks between corps commander-ranked officers from the two armies at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC in the Chushul sector that went on for 13 hours on Monday, both sides made their positions known to each other, and were unable to reach a consensus on easing military tensions in the Ladakh theatre, the officials cited above said. “The military talks are deadlocked but both sides have agreed to meet again and find common ground to reduce tensions in the Ladakh theatre. It appears the road to border peace will be long,” an official said on condition of anonymity.The joint statement after the conclusion of the talks said: “They (the two sides) agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strengthen communication on the ground, avoid misunderstandings and misjudgments, stop sending more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground, and avoid taking any actions that may complicate the situation.” In Beijing, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the two sides exchanged in-depth views on easing the current situation in the border areas during the talks between the commanders. “The two sides agreed to continue maintaining dialogue and consultation on this front,” said spokesperson Wang Wenbin. Naveen Srivastava, a joint secretary from the Indian external affairs ministry, was part of the military dialogue for the first time, with the structure of the talks being slightly changed by India in the hope of a possible breakthrough. Two Indian lieutenant generals were among the officers who took part in the talks — Harinder Singh, who heads the Leh-based 14 Corps and his soon-to-be successor PGK Menon.India and China agreed on five points to guide their approach to the situation on the LAC, including the disengagement of troops and easing of tensions, during talks between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow on September 10.The lack of a breakthrough in the talks despite the consensus in the foreign ministers’ meeting shows that there are still serious differences on the ground about how the disengagement should proceed, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“Perhaps a rethink is required on how we should approach the whole process of negotiations,” Hooda added.The scope of the military talks has changed vastly after recent developments on the southern and northern banks of Pangong Tso, where the Indian Army has taken control of advantageous heights.“While earlier only we were seeking restoration of status quo ante of mid-April at friction areas on the LAC, now the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is asking us to withdraw from vantage positions. The new thing is an element of a quid pro quo,” the officials said.Monday’s meeting between senior military commanders was their first after the Indian Army speedily moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing chunks of Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the lake’s southern bank that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridge-line on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other, as reported by Hindustan Times on September 10.According to latest inputs, China began building at least 13 new military positions, including airbases and air defence units, near the LAC with India after the 2017 standoff at Doklam, with work on four heliports beginning after the current tensions in Ladakh. Details of these military positions were outlined in a report released on Tuesday by Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy. The new positions include three airbases, five permanent air defence positions and five heliports. “Construction on four of those new heliports started only after the onset of the current Ladakh crisis in May,” said the report authored by Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security and military analyst with Stratfor. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh told lawmakers in Parliament that no force in the world can stop the Indian Army from patrolling the country’s borders in the Ladakh sector, signalling a strong resolve to regain access to several areas that are now difficult to reach due to actions by the Chinese army along the LAC.In tensions that began in early May, Indian and Chinese troops have come face-to-face at multiple points along the LAC. In some of these areas, particularly the Finger Area and Depsang, Indian forces have been cut off from points they could previously patrol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadlock-at-talks-china-wants-india-to-exit-key-heights/story-keQaXmopVPj9XsEMGDJBXJ.html
23-09-2020||India||Air India may soon start ‘scenic joy flights’ to bank on wanderlust||Want to travel but have nowhere to go? The lack of a destination may soon not be problem. Taking a cue from some international airlines, notably Australia’s Qantas Airways, India’s national carrier Air India is planning to start its own version of “flights to nowhere” that will take-off from and land at the same airport, taking flyers on a picturesque journey in a bid to scratch the travel itch.Airline officials familiar with the developments told HT that these “scenic joy flights” will be low-flying expeditions that give passengers an aerial tour of famous spots in India. What these spots will be is still being discussed, as is pricing and other modalities, the officials added.“Yes, we are exploring the possibility of starting a scenic flight service. Other details are to be decided,” an Air India spokesperson said, adding that wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 747 will be used for the service. A second official, who asked not to be named, said that the idea was discussed earlier this month after Qantas announced seven-hour-long flights during which the passenger will be able to spot attractions such as the Great Barrier Reef and the Sydney Harbour. Qantas announced that the flights -- priced between $575 and $2,765 (between ₹42,000 and ₹2 lakh) depending on the cabin class -- were sold out in 10 minutes. Apart from Qantas, other airlines, including Royal Brunei, are operating similar flights.Health experts, however, warned that these flights may be an avoidable risk at a time when cases in India are still rising, and that only essential travel is recommended.Doctor RK Singhal, director, department of medicine, at Delhi’s BLK Super Speciality Hospital, said Covid-19 cases in the country are going over 90,000 a day and at least 4000 daily in Delhi. “This is the tip of the iceberg. The numbers are on a continuous rise... When cases are still to peak in the country, such unnecessary movements need to be restricted,” Singhal said.Aviation expert Mark Martin said low-level flying usually means flying aircraft at 1,000 feet above the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA), which varies from place to place depending on obstacles and visibility. “Usually this depends on the region in which an aircraft is flying. For example, for Mumbai, the MOCA is about 3,000 feet. In such cases the air traffic control takes the call and allows an aircraft the level it can fly lowest at,” Martin said.He said a Boeing 747 can fly as low as 500 to 1,000 feet for display flights, but in what regions it can be allowed to fly that low depends on the region and on the Air Traffic Control’s safety approval. Cruising speed of a normal Boeing 747 during a low-altitude flight would be around 250 knots i.e. roughly 400 km per hour.After a two-month suspension of airspace in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, India resumed flight operations on May 25. International flights are going only to select destinations under an “air bubble” arrangement under the Vande Bharat Mission. Domestic flights in India are operating to all routes, but with strict safety measures in place.“Of late, many flyers have taken to social media to narrate how they feel about not being able to go on vacations or fly out of their cities because of Covid outbreak. Many also spoke about how they miss flyings but cannot go to tourist destinations as tourism is also affected due to existing restrictions in the country. The ‘joy flights’ will get experience of flying back, and will also be something never experienced before. It is expected to be welcomed by the Indian flyers also,” said a third official aware of the development who asked not to be named.But experts warned that Covid safety measures will have to be considered.At least three studies have analysed in-flight transmission of Covid-19. They found that the air circulation inside the airplane cabin may have reduced the rate of transmission and that wearing masks could further reduce the risk of spread, while seat proximity increased this risk. In one of the instances, a 10-hour flight from London to Hanoi resulted in 15 people getting infected from one index patient. The second detailed in-flight transmission in two people on a 4 hour, 40 minute Tel Aviv-Frankfurt flight and the third studied transmission in two passengers and two crew members on a 15-hour flight from Boston to Hong Kong.Doctor T Jacob John, a retired professor of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore said it is crucial that airlines take all necessary precautions. “This will get people out of monotony and airlines will earn revenue at the same time. Everyone must wear a mask. Transmission inside an aircraft does occur, but at a slow pace because the air is sucked away regularly and is recycled. There’s some risk but if people will be properly screened it’s a good initiative. Im sure airline will be considering all safety precautions,” John said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scenic-joy-flights-to-bank-on-wanderlust/story-RXwp9ZuWpMVbt8DcAqQ9tN.html
23-09-2020||India||NIA may join actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death probe||The National Investigating Agency has now been cleared by the Central Government to investigate drug related cases, and senior officers in the government confirmed that this may be a precursor to the agency, originally created to deal with terror-related crimes, being asked to look at the case surrounding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, which has since snowballed into a major probe into drug use in the film industry. If that happens, NIA will become the fourth federal agency to get involved in the case, after the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate and the Narcotics Control Bureau. Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB summons producer Madhu Mantena to join drug-related probe with Jaya Saha, Shruti ModiThe Ministry of Finance’s Revenue Department on Tuesday, issued a notification that said that the Centre after consulting with states ``invests the officers of and above the rank of inspectors in the NIA to exercise the powers and perform duties ‘’ according to section 53 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.This section allows the government to give any officer ``the powers of a police station for the investigation of the offences under this Act’’. NIA was established a year after the 2008 Mumbai serial blasts to specifically focus on terror related activities across the country. In an amendment to the NIA act last year, the agency was also given the jurisdiction to probe cases related to human trafficking, counterfeit notes and cyber terrorism but narcotics cases were still not in its purview -- till Tuesday’s order that’s been signed by under secretary Biswajit Sarkar.Sushant Singh Rajput death: NCB summons Bollywood talent agency KWAN’s CEOA government official familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity that the order could “expand the ambit of the ongoing probes in the SSR case, where drugs, money laundering and national security issues have emerged.”A second government official who asked not to be named said that the importance of the notification was that even cases which were previously only the domain of the NCB could now be handled by the NIA.While Tuesday’s notification said that states had been consulted, a minister in the Maharashtra government said that he wasn’t aware of any communication to the effect.Sushant Singh Rajput case: Actor Rhea Chakraborty’s judicial custody extended till October 6 by special NDPS courtThe death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14 has become a political issue with the Bihar Government playing a significant role in the transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation, one that the Maharashtra government criticised. While the circumstances surrounding the death are being investigated by CBI, the role of drugs in the case is being handled by the Narcotics Control Bureau . Actress and Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty is in custody for her role in an alleged ”drug syndicate’’ and for allegedly procuring drugs for the actor. ED is looking into money laundering aspects of the probe. The second officer added that the need to issue this notification was because of a possible ``national interest’’ lead that the NIA needed to probe.“It’s a good step especially in light of growing linkages between terror modules and drug dealers. NIA officers can effectively investigate narco-terrorism crimes. It would not have any impact on the powers of State Police since the powers of State Police Officers to investigate the NDPS Crimes hasn’t been diluted,’’ said former NIA and presently ADG (law and order) Assam, GP Singh.Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said he is not aware about the Centre consulting the state government on this. “Even during my tenure as the additional chief secretary of the home department, I do not remember any such proposal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-may-join-sushant-case-investigation/story-NLXzlutkrnrDcL2gZtaIWI.html
23-09-2020||India||Should we cheer the fall in India’s Covid-19 cases?||The simple answer, at a time when good news is at a premium, is yes, but there is more to the fall than meets the eye.First, the facts. In the past week, the curve of new cases across the country has seen a rare dip, with the seven-day average of daily cases actually dropping for the five consecutive days to Monday — something that has never happened since the coronavirus outbreak started in the country in March. The numbers may suggest that cases in the country have started to plateau. Have they? Have cases across India hit a plateau?On September 10, there were 99,181 new cases of Covid-19 reported across the country, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. Till that day, the trailing seven-day average of daily cases ( commonly referred to as the daily case trajectory or the case curve) had been rising consecutively since August 16.The August 16 drop in the trajectory was a single day aberration, largely be explained by the decreased testing and reporting of cases due to the August 15 weekend. Before August 16, the trajectory had been rising for 81 straight days. All signs till a week ago pointed to the daily case number crossing the 100,000 mark in coming days. But this mark was never breached.The seven-day case average touched a peak (so far) on September 16, at 93,617, and dropped for five consecutive days after that. By Monday night, this number had dropped to 90,472. This is an unprecedented drop for a country, which has seen a near-steady increase of the case trajectory throughout the course of the pandemic. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();But testing follows a similar drop in trajectoryIndia set a new record for the daily tests for Covid-19 on Saturday when 1.2 million samples were tested, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex body on biomedical research. However, notwithstanding Saturday’s record, daily testing has been seeing a long plateau since the first week of September. For the week ending Monday, on average 1,001,929 tests were conducted every day. This number was 1,098,274 for the week ending September 13 (the highest it has ever touched so far).In fact, the seven-day average line for daily tests (or the daily test trajectory) has largely followed the same path as the daily cases – a week--long plateau around September 10, and a drop over the past five-six days.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Meanwhile, positivity rate is rising, againThe seven-day average of positivity rate – the proportion of tests that come back positive for Covid-19 – has started rising again. In the past week, 9.2% of all tests conducted across the country have come back positive, the highest this number has touched in 40 days, or since August 12. Over the past month, the average of positivity rate has increased 1.5 percentage points — from 7.7% for week ending August 21 to 9.2% for week ending September 21.A rising positivity rate means that more people are testing positive for Sars-Cov2 and thus, if this number is rising, it indicates a higher prevalence of virus within the community. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();So what does this mean?While cases do appear to have hit a plateau, two crucial metrics – daily testing and positivity rate – don’t present a good picture. India is conducting fewer cases today (on average) than it was a week ago, and a larger proportion of those tests are coming back positive. This would mean that there’s a good chance of the case trajectory rising again — if testing levels do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-we-cheer-the-fall-in-india-s-covid-19-cases/story-dLWpp4R5ol2cXVIR04LCrK.html
23-09-2020||India||Billionaire Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry’s daughter loses money in cyber fraud||A cyber fraudster stole Rs 90,000 between June and July from the bank account of 62-year-old Laila Rustom Jehangir, one of the two daughters of billionaire Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, who owns one of the biggest business conglomerates Shapoorji Pallonji group. An FIR has been registered at Colaba police station. According to Colaba police station, Laila, who resides in Dubai, had authorised her father Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry to manage the account on her behalf.In 2018, Mistry authorised his company director Firoz Bhatena to look after all financial activities of Laila’s account. Bhatena, in turn, had entrusted the account to company’s deputy general manager (accounts) 60-year-old Jayesh Merchant.Merchant’s mobile number was registered with the bank for SMS alerts on every transaction of Laila’s account, said Colaba police officials. ALSO WATCH | After Chinese app ban, NSA Ajit Doval on new Cyber Security Strategy soon Since the account was quite old, transactions were done only through cheques, and no debit or credit card was issued by the bank for Laila’s bank account in question, added Colaba police official.A police officer from Colaba police station said, “Jayesh Merchant, who registered the complaint, said that on July 1 and 2 he received SMS alerts of withdrawal of money from the account of Laila. When he checked with the bank he was informed that around Rs 90,000 were spent or withdrawn in multiple transactions using a debit card in June/July months.” A copy of Merchant’s complaint is with Hindustan Times. “Merchant, who told the bank manager that there was no debit card issued on this account, was in for a shock when he was informed that a debit card was issued in the name of company director Bhatena in 2018, and the card was couriered to the company’s Colaba office. The same debit card was used to withdraw money. Merchant told Bhatena about the development who told him that he was not aware of any debit card being issued, following which a complaint was given,” added the officer. The police in its preliminary investigation have found that the card was used multiple times, once at one Lucky Restaurant, and once at a cake shop New Arife Lamoulde. Police would be checking the CCTV at these places and also make inquiries to trace the card user, said the police officer.An FIR has been registered under section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and 66C (identity theft) and 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of Information Technology Act against an unidentified suspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/billionaire-pallonji-shapoorji-mistry-s-daughter-loses-money-in-cyber-fraud/story-aNeoliM781omyTs43lYHLJ.html
23-09-2020||India||How H-1B visa helped nurture a generation of execs from India||Sundar Pichai started out on H-1B and went on to head Google, the giant of most things internet.Satya Nadella used the visa programme also, but for an entirely different reason. Not to further his career, but his personal life. He gave up his Green Card — yes, he did — and went on to a H-1B so that his wife could join in in the United States. Immigration rules then, as now, made it very difficult for foreigners to join Green Card spouses, without going through a long and uncertain process.So Nadella gave up his permanent residency and switched to H-1B in 1994, a year after he got married and four years after the new visa programme was introduced for skilled workers in 1990.“What I didn’t expect was the instant notoriety around campus,” Nadella wrote in his 2017 memoir “Hit Refresh, “‘’Hey, there goes the guy who gave up his Green card’.” H-1B can do that too, help married couples unite.But for most people like Pichai and Nooyi, H-1Bs have been a gateway to work, live and prosper in the United States.Pichai came to the US on a student visa -- from IIT Kharagpur to Stanford University, California. He went on a H-1B visa when he started at McKinsey, and then went on to Google, which he has headed since 2015. Former PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi, who was raised in Chennai and went to the Madras Christian College, went on H-1B visa when she joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980, according to Business Insider. It was not immediately clear if she was on H-1 at the time, instead. H-1B would be born 10 years later by the Immigration Act of 1990 by splitting H-1 into two — H-1A for nurses and H-1B for “speciality occupation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-h-1b-visa-helped-nurture-a-generation-of-execs-from-india/story-3lJUZ6m29T8eeCa46hjNaI.html
23-09-2020||Editorials||The UN must reform to stay relevant | HT Editorial||The United Nations (UN) has always struggled when its most powerful members are disunited. On the 75th anniversary of the UN’s foundation, not only is great power rivalry rising to Cold War levels, but the world is under enormous forces of change, whether technological or environmental. The organisation recognises it needs to make major adjustments, but it can only reform if there is a sufficient consensus among its members to that effect. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at the supplementary high-level meeting, stressed the need for reformed multilateralism to ensure UN’s continued relevance. India has long called for the Security Council to be expanded to provide permanent seats for emerging powers like itself. That a draft text for such reforms has made it to the UN General Assembly is an accomplishment. While New Delhi must continue to iterate this requirement, it should be recognised this is an aspiration and comes with a long and unpredictable timeline. It is not merely China which will be a barrier, neither the United States or Russia is eager to see their positions diluted. There are three obvious multilateral issues in which the UN needs to become much more active. The most obvious is the pandemics. No government can claim there is not a case for much more transparent and intrusive global preventive health system. Then there is climate. The UN hosts the world’s primary climate change conference, but this role needs to be institutionalised. In addition, climate policy now affects other areas such as trade and immigration and urgent multi-disciplinary discussions are needed at the highest level. Finally, terrorism remains a global threat. The collapse of the Islamic State has taken the wind out of the terrorists’ sail, but no one believes this is not a temporary situation. Cynics will say the UN will be hampered by a de-globalising world, superpowers at daggers drawn and rising protectionism. The debate over a reformed multilateralism and more relevant UN needs to begin sooner rather than later. The speeches have now been made, but India and other governments now need to find ways to convert these into action on the ground. The UN is imperfect because the cohesion of its member-states is imperfect. But no one can deny, as Mr Modi said, “Our world today is a better place because of the United Nations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-un-must-reform-to-stay-relevant/story-PAxRyvJFx1wLExxe0DOUxH.html
23-09-2020||Editorials||Dealing with Covid-19 in rural areas | HT Editorial||On Tuesday, the tally of Covid-19 cases in India crossed 5.6 million. Maharashtra’s tally rose to 1.24 million with a third of the infections reported among rural populations. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have also reported an uptick in cases in rural areas. The states represent a nationwide trend of the pandemic shifting to the rural areas where health systems are weak and human resources are stretched or missing altogether. This leaves the sick with no option but to seek treatment in cities, where the strain on the health care system is beginning to show. Testing is still concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas. Testing in rural areas remains below the national average of 46,440 tests per million, which may lead to undetected and asymptomatic spread in the young, mobile rural demographic, and, in turn, bring the infection back to cities. Meeting the challenge of containing the spread in rural areas is a monumental task. Of the little over 1.2 million allopathic doctors registered with the Medical Council of India (June 30), around a million are available for active service. This puts the doctor-population ratio at 1:1,343 for a population of 1.35 billion, against the World Health Organization-recommended 1:1,000. With most tertiary care hospitals situated in cities, at least 90% doctors live and work urban areas, home to 40% of the population. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s review of the Covid-19 situation with the chief ministers of seven states that account for 63% of the country’s cases focused on scaling up testing and containment in rural India ahead of the last phase of unlocking on September 30. To win the war against the pandemic, battles have to be fought and won on every front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/dealing-with-covid-19-in-rural-areas/story-6PnAjdGTUTr3jwSzGxpTYN.html
