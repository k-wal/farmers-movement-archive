Of the 195 Covid-related fatalities, the south Malwa districts have reported 82 deaths in last six days as 113 were reported till August 31. The worst-hit is Ferozepur district, where Covid-related deaths have more than doubled in six days from 24 on August 31 to 51 on September 6. With 21 more deaths, Bathinda’s tally has jumped to 45. Faridkot and Moga districts reported 12 deaths each in last five days taking the toll to 24 and 32, respectively. Fazilka, Muktsar and Mansa have reported a total of 11 deaths during the same period.

Besides, the districts have seen a rise 650% in Covid-related deaths in last one month, from 26 on August 6 to 195 on September 6, as compared to a cumulative increase of 270% in the state during the same period. The case fatality rate (CFR) in south Malwa districts is continuously showing an upward trend as it has jumped to 1.7% from 0.9% in a month. However, the state’s CFR is much higher at 2.9%. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said after a sudden rise in cases, the south Malwa districts have seen a jump in virus-related deaths in the last few days. “The major reason behind this is that the people are resisting getting themselves tested, which delay the detection. Many Covid patients who had died, were admitted to hospitals after their condition deteriorated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/south-malwa-districts-report-sharp-rise-in-covid-deaths-in-last-six-days/story-qJbzOB2lsXtGwLiDrVEdnI.html

Interdistrict travel is open, e-pass is not required, hotels have opened up, attendance of employees in offices have increased, all this results in infections in a large amount. There has been a spike in cases and we are prepared to tackle it. Self-discipline is a key factor in this fight. With self-discipline the spread will stop,” Tope said. Tope outlined that contact-tracing is not happening as required. “We have asked all at the district level to trace 15 to 20 contacts. Our survey shows that it is still around 10-12.

However, I have told Prakash Javadekar it won’t right to completely stop the support to the state as we are still battling. I requested him that the support should continue in the quantity provided so far and he has assured he would convey it to the union health minister. We will write to the centre regarding the same,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-maharashtra-state-past-900k-cases-with-record-24-hour-rise/story-oSnrWiWbfKZzC6QkLw00KJ.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai to receive first six Metro coaches in December from Bengaluru||Even as the Covid-19 pandemic has derailed two Metro corridor projects by six months, the city may soon get the first set of the rolling stock in December. Officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is executing the Metro master plan, confirmed that a set of six coaches will be in the city on December 11. The first set of trains will be housed at the Charkop depot. MMRDA had awarded the contract of rolling stock to Bengaluru-based Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML). Last week, BEML had issued tenders for transportation of metro coaches from its Bengaluru unit to Mumbai via hydraulic trailers. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “We will be receiving 378 coaches in different batches. The first train set of six coaches is likely to be delivered on December 11. By April 2021, we will be having 10 train sets in Mumbai.’’ The commissioner had recently visited the production unit to inspect the progress of the coaches. According to the tentative schedule released by BEML on its website, set of six coaches will be dispatched in November and December, followed by 12 cars in January 2021. Following this, 18 cars will be delivered each month. While Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) had to be made operational by December, MMRDA has revised the deadline by six months owing to delays caused by the lockdown. The two projects are now likely to be operational by May 2021. The coaches will be light-weight, energy-efficient and fully air-conditioned. The features will also enable driverless options. The trains will also have seats for the specially-abled, space for a cycle and charging points for mobile and laptops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-receive-first-six-metro-coaches-in-december-from-bengaluru/story-ASyJzrFcGGbLigN5YOD03N.html
06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Basmati exporters uncertain, seek clarity over imposition of market fee, RDF||Basmati exporters based in Punjab are uncertain over the purchase of the aromatic rice variety from the state as the Centre’s new ordinance for agriculture marketing, allowing farmers to directly sell their produce to exporters, has created a parallel system even as the Punjab government has opposed it. The Punjab rice millers and exporters association have raised the contentious issue with the state government through representations to clarify its stand on the new ordinance as the neighbouring states, particularly Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have accepted the central ordinance. The Association feels that since the new paddy crop of 1509 variety will start arriving in the mandis by September 15, the issue of the 2% market fees and 2% rural development fund (RDF) levied by the state Mandi board remained unresolved as the new ordinance gives exemption of these two levies, provided the crop is purchased directly from the farmers or is procured from a private market area as envisaged in the new act. This year, basmati was grown over 17.5 lakh acres and arrival of the aromatic produce has started in some parts. Demanding rationalisation of the mandi fee and RDF, the exporters said they will like to purchase levy-free basmati as per the ordinance and buy paddy either directly from the farmers or from other states which offer exemptions. “It is important to add that the basmati growing states of Haryana, UP, Uttrakhand and Jammu and Kashmir have notified that they will be levying only 1% user charges on the produce brought to their mandi yards while adhering to the new norms under the ordinance which would definitely make the Punjab paddy costly, with 4% fees and fund being levied by the state,” said association director Ashok Sethi. He led a delegation of rice exporters from state to meet cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Sunday for clarity over the matter. Sethi said Bajwa assured the exporters that the state government would come to the rescue of the rice millers by bringing parity in taxes, allowing the industry to grow further while giving better rates to the farmers. According to Bajwa, agro processing ventures are an important segment and he will apprise the Punjab CM for a possible way out. Top officers in the mandi board revealed that the matter was under consideration of the top brass in the state and a statement will be issued shortly. According to rice exporters, the taxes imposed by Punjab government will leave their trade uneconomical and render their rice export unviable as they can’t compete with the exporters based in Haryana, UP and Delhi as the disparity of taxes would lead to financial crisis. The rice exports had a phenomenal growth during last three years with exports from state touching Rs 14,000 crore, out of the total country’s export of Rs 34,000 crore as per the latest figures released by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA). The association claimed that it remained at the forefront in educating basmati growers to use minimal pesticides and other agro-chemicals so that the produce is accepted worldwide. In 2017, the basmati consignments faced rejection from European countries and Saudi Arabia due to presence of fungicide higher than permissible limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/basmati-exporters-uncertain-seek-clarity-over-imposition-of-market-fee-rdf/story-cIyp8zUSluAT931jJXDLoJ.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Security beefed up at Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray’s home Matoshree at Bandra after ‘threat’ calls||Security has been beefed up at Matoshree, the private residence of Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray in Bandra, after an unknown person from Dubai called twice on Saturday night, claiming that the fugitive underworld gangster Dawood Ibrahim wanted to speak with the CM.State transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said the caller dialled the landline of Matoshree and asked to speak to the CM. The minister, however, denied that the caller threatened to blow up the Sena chief’s home in Bandra (East). He added that they have alerted the police and the issue is being investigated.According to a statement from the CM’s office (CMO), state home minister Anil Deshmukh informed the state cabinet on Sunday that the Mumbai Police’s crime branch is investigating the matter.Speaking to reporters before the cabinet meeting, Parab said, “There was an anonymous caller to Matoshree who said that he is from the Dawood gang and that he wanted to speak to the chief minister. There was no threat to blow up Matoshree. We reported the call to the police and they are investigating all aspects, including who called, why, if the person was really from the Dawood gang, etc. So far, nobody has dared to give such threats and the government will not let the person go scot-free,” Parab said.There were unconfirmed reports that four calls were made to Matoshree. A senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of the Mumbai Police confirmed the same. “The operator at the CM’s residence picked up the call around 10pm, and the caller said that he was calling from Dubai and Dawood Ibrahim wanted to speak with ‘CM saheb’,” said the officer.The operator refused to transfer the call following which the caller disconnected. The same person then called up again a few minutes later and repeated the same words, but again, the operator informed him that the call could not be transferred to the CM, added the officer.Call records reportedly show that two missed calls were made from the same number within a span of a few minutes. “It appears that they could be threat calls and given the seriousness of the issue, security has been increased at Matoshree. Mumbai Police has not registered any complaint but the Mumbai crime branch has been trying to trace the number,” added the IPS officer.The state cabinet expressed concern over the anonymous call threatening to blow up Thackeray’s residence, and also condemned it strongly. Terming it as a “very serious matter”, the cabinet said that the Union government should take immediate note of it and find the people behind it. Strict punishment should be given to them, said a statement from the CMO.“The police department has taken appropriate action [about security] after these calls. A review of the CM’s security is taken from time to time. The CM has had adequate security before and will continue to have it,” Parab said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/security-beefed-up-at-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-s-home-matoshree-at-bandra-after-threat-calls/story-AQ81CZrwkkTOQe4nmc0a8I.html

After the lockdown was imposed in March, around 12 police personnel have reported being assaulted while on duty. Only two cases of assault on officials were reported this year before lockdown was imposed. Mostly lower-rung police officials, ranging from assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) to constables, are on the receiving end as they spend the most time in the field. “Many entitled people get away with misbehaving with cops due to political interference,” said an official, who did not wish to be named, adding, “On being stopped for checking, most people make it a prestige issue and start hurling abuses at the cops.” Such people can be booked under Sections 353 (use of assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “Attacks on men in uniform will not be tolerated. Police are taking the matter seriously and FIRs have been lodged against the accused.”City-based psychiatrist Dr Rajiv Sharma said, “The restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus have affected some people mentally as well as physically. As the police take action against violators, some people view cops as villains for deterring them, which is one of the reasons behind increased assault on police personnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khaki-under-attack-police-personnel-assaulted-times-since-lockdown/story-uVdoJ5OLzMJckFCmStTcVP.html

According to MC officials, the solid waste management bylaws have been notified, which entail fine for not segregating waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The fines range between Rs 250 for households and Rs 5,000 for bulk generators (see box). MC joint commissioner Swati Tiwana said, “A system is being put in place for collection and dumping of segregated waste at the main dump from September 15 onwards. The secondary collection points have been divided in two parts, and the A2Z company has been directed to collect wet and dry waste separately. Letters have also been issued to senior government officials living in government accommodations in the Civil Lines area that non-segregated waste will not be collected by MC.”“As the local bodies department has notified the Solid Waste Management and Sanitation Bylaws 2020, a drive will be initiated for challaning property owners not handing over waste in a segregated manner,” she added.NGT’s monitoring committee in August had directed the civic body to submit Rs 15 lakh as bank guarantee to the Punjab Pollution and Control Board for its failure in dealing with the solid waste in the city.INFRASTRUCTURE MISSING, SAY COUNCILLORS MC’s decision has invited strong resentment from city councillors, who have highlighted the absence of infrastructure to deal with segregated wet and dry waste. BJP councillor Manju Aggarwal said, “Firstly, MC does not have proper garbage carts for door-to-door collection of waste. Further, there is no system for shifting the segregated waste from the secondary collection spots to the main dumping site on Tajpur Road.” Leader of opposition in MC’s General House, SAD councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “We have received no information about the fines from September 15. Besides, MC is not equipped with the infrastructure required to support this system. An awareness campaign is also needed before the corporation starts issuing fines to residents.”Notably, there are around 3.5 lakh properties in Ludhiana’s 95 wards. With MC yet to start door-to door collection of waste from at least 20% properties, complete waste segregation has remained a distant dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-not-segregating-waste-to-shell-out-up-to-5-000-from-september-15/story-PjmxyFCy6ELrf47M2iAiBN.html

While the state government has imposed restrictions on large gatherings, LIP president Simarjeet Singh Bains urged residents to reach Patiala in large numbers to raise their voices against the alleged corrupt practices of the government. Addressing a press conference at his Dugri road office on Sunday, Bains said, “We are forced to gheroa Moti Mahal in large numbers as the CM has failed to act against the minister. I had also written to interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Union government, but no action has been taken till now. Dharamsot has been named in the inquiry conducted by additional chief secretary of his own department and no further proof is required to take action against the minister. Funds worth Rs 64 crore, meant for the welfare of SC students, have been embezzled.”“SC students and LIP members from different districts will participate in the protest on Monday. If the government still fails to act against the minister, we will move to the roads,” he added.Speaking on restrictions on gathering, Bains said that they have been forced to protest as the CM has failed to act against the minister.

Raikot senior medical officer Dr Alka Mittal has lodged a complaint with the police. Mittal said, “We have the number that was used to spread the rumour. It has been shared with the police. We need to stop such rumours as the situation is turning hostile for health workers collecting samples in the field.” Relatives of the victim who had died of the infection at Government Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, had cried foul and claimed that the victim was killed by doctors for organ harvesting. They also said they had received messages on social media about the prevalence of organ harvesting. Doctors had to conduct the cremation amid protests.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said he was disappointed over the rumour mongering. He blamed the family for levelling baseless allegations on the health department and the team that had performed the cremation. “Organ transplant in not like buying vegetables from the market. It is shocking how people are falling prey to such absurdity. Firstly, no transplant has been performed here since the Covid outbreak in March. Transplants can only be conducted after receiving the government’s approval.” “Unfortunately, people are believing the rumours and are refusing to have their Covid tests conducted. They only reach the hospital at a critical stage,” said Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/organ-harvesting-allegations-officials-seeks-police-action-as-protest-video-does-rounds/story-o4qd7SGXuRhajBCO8mtmIO.html

The entire process will be monitored online,” the official said.The system will monitor, the pH value, BOD and COD of water. “The station will be installed at the choe near the Mohali border because when water enters there from Chandigarh, it will ensure that water does not get contaminated,” the official said.The N-choe passes through several gardens in the city and is flooded during the rainy season.

06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid effect in Ludhiana: Increased screen time causing spike in eye problems||Online classes and increased screen time amid the Covid pandemic is leading to increased number of eye problems among children and older generations alike.Many teachers are also approaching ophthalmologists with complaints of weakened eyesight.Dr Priyanka Arora, associate professor at department of ophthalmology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H), said that after schools closed down amid the pandemic, many students have to take online classes for hours on end, resulting in excess strain on their eyes, causing dryness, irritation, redness, watering and even headaches.She said that rather than giving children phones/tablets to note down their work, they should be given printouts or the work must be dictated to them.“Interestingly, there has been significant rise in the number of myopia cases among younger and middle-aged people due to increased time spent on mobile gaming, watching movies and other online content,” Dr Arora said.Arora advised the use a high-quality screens with relatively large display, located directly in front of line of vision. She said the screen should be atleast 20 to 24 inches away from the eyes.She added that as per American Academy of Ophthalmologists, children below the age of two should not be exposed to screens, while more than two hours of screen time is not advisable for any age group. She recommended scheduling and taking frequent breaks.”Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something atleast 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This relaxes your eye muscles,” she said.For teachers like Manbir Kaur and Anupam Baghria life has turned upside down.“Earlier, we used to stop students from spending time on mobiles and other gadgets, but now, it is totally the opposite. The entire curriculum is being done online, which is not only strenuous for students, but it is also taking a toll on eyesight of teachers,” said Kaur, an English and science teachers at a government school. “A teacher’s job is no less than winning a war in these unforeseen circumstances. From morning to late in the evening, we remain hooked to smart phones to explain every possible detail of the topic to our students. It is a challenge to create an atmosphere where students remain attentive. Of course, this puts strain on the eyes. After two months of online teaching, I too faced repercussions of myopia and my number increased from one to two. Online checking of tests, copies and answer sheets also results in back problems. But, being teacher, it gives me immense satisfaction as my students always actively participate in class,” said Bhagria, an English teacher at Shri Nankana Sahib Public School for higher and senior secondary classes .Naina, a student of Class 8, is also going through a similar ordeal. “After four hours of online classes, we have to do homework that is also sent to us on phone. Then, it is time for tuitions. If I include gaming and using other OTT platforms, I spend roughly 10 hours a day on the phone,” said Naina.BOX:Concerns and solutionsDr Priyanka Arora, ophthalmologist at DMCH, recommends the following tips to avoid eye problems. Cut down on screen time Shift to bigger screens and maintain distance: Take frequent breaks: Maintain proper posture||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-effect-in-ludhiana-increased-screen-time-causing-spike-in-eye-problems/story-RmZYxTsqYJI0RGSrbMF6tJ.html

The police officer suffered one gunshot wound and was rushed to a private hospital in Sector 38, where his condition is stable, the police said. A family dispute is suspected to be the reason behind the shooting, they said.

06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Covid curbs killing business, say Ludhiana liquor vend owners||Liquor vendors, whose businesses have taken a hit due to the pandemic, have demanded that the state government either order a proportional reduction in ‘quota fee’ or allow their vends to function till 11pm. They may move the Punjab and Haryana high court if their grievances are not resolved. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the vends would run from 9am to 11pm. Now, they have to shut shop at 6.30pm as curfew is imposed after 7pm. The vendors said they were struggling to stay afloat and may have to pull down shutters permanently in the near future unless the decision to close liquor shops at 6.30pm was reconsidered. The businessmen said the 98 circles in the city had been suffering a combined loss of around ₹1 crore per day due to the curbs. According to the district excise department, each circle has up to four vends. As a condition of their allotment, vendors have to pay the government a ‘quota fee’ per month. Though the vendors’ earnings have shrunk, they have to pay the entire fee. Earlier this week, a delegation of vendors had also met deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma and apprised him of their concerns. A wine contractor, Kirat Singh, said, “The peak time for sales is from 7pm to 10pm but the vends remain closed at the time. We have sought relief from the government. A quota fee is charged for operating vends till 11pm. Since the vends are being shut at 6.30pm, there should be a proportional reduction in fee.”They said they will also challenge the imposition of Covid cess on liquor as it was not part of the excise policy.Association leader Varinder Sharma said, “Liquor vendors in Haryana have already challenged the imposition of Covid cess on liquor and we will also do the same as imposition of cess is not the part of the excise policy, on the basis of which the vends were allotted.We will be forced to move the court if the government fails to provide relief in the coming days.” Deputy excise and taxation commissioner Rajpal Khaira said, “A final decision is yet to be taken . The memorandum of demands will be forwarded to the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-curbs-hampering-business-may-move-court-liquor-vendors/story-EeMeOeRcUlC050R0EvIMIJ.html

06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Bansal urges MP Kher to ask Centre for more funds for Chandigarh||Former Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has asked Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher to urge the Union government, UT administrator and the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership to ensure that Chandigarh residents do not suffer due to the “Centre’s apathy in allocation of resources to the city,” including the municipal corporation.Bansal recalled that the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission had recommended an allocation of 30% of the receipts of UT to the MC. And though the civic body had sought Rs1,073 crore for the current year, it was just allocated Rs 425 crore. “While it was already reeling under severe financial crisis, a further cut of 20% was slapped, bringing the allocation down to Rs 340 crore. This amount is lower than the grant-in-aid to the corporation seven years back in the year 2013-14, when it stood at Rs 359 crore. The direct impact of this is on condition of roads and all other civic services in the city,” Bansal said.Criticising what he termed as the unfair treatment of the UT administration and MC by the Centre, Bansal said, “Instead of a minimum annual enhancement of 10%, plan head allocation of Rs 813 crore to Chandigarh in the last UPA interim budget in 2014-15 has been brought down to Rs 494.14 crore (Capital) in the budget for the year 2020-21, that is, a dismal 60% of what it should have been in 2014-15. Chandigarh deserves better treatment and not this abject neglect”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bansal-urges-mp-kher-to-urge-centre-to-allocate-more-funds-for-city/story-G7CcTErqSZpEA1kubh9zvO.html

06-09-2020||Pune||11% of Pune city’s population living in containment zones, but not many follow Covid-19 rules||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is facing a massive challenge of maintaining discipline in micro-containment zones to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. According to PMC’s latest map released on September 3, as many as 74 areas covering 5.25 lakh or 11.21 per cent of the city’s population lives in containment zones. However, at most places, no social distancing norms are observed with people seemingly oblivious to the pandemic threat as they are seen mingling with each other, including senior citizens and children. Small kids in the arms of womenfolk were also seen without masks openly moving in the area. When HT visited the spot at 3.30pm on Sunday at Phadke Haud, an area under Covid-19 containment zone, residents could be seen buying vegetables some 500 metres away from the thoroughfare in the inside lane.PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar also admitted that there is an immediate need to tighten restrictions and act against people who are flouting norms. “There are 5.25 lakh people, which is 11 per cent of the city’s population, under the containment zones. However, implementation of rules in these zones are not as strict as needed. Residents of such areas say it’s been six months since the lockdown and they can’t be permanently under restrictions. So, this is one area where we are not getting as much success as needed,” Kumar said during a meeting on Saturday. In Ramoshi gate neighbourhood, the tenements are so close to each other that residents were openly moving in the area without any fear of the virus. Youngsters were seen taking their mortorbikes out for joyrides around 4pm without masks. No health department official could be seen there for enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines. A report by the state government officials assigned for spot visit in Pune reveals that despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Pune, the containment zones have seen movement of residents with violation of social distancing norms at market places and grocery shops while youths are seen moving on bikes in large containment zones. Azim Gudakuwala, a social worker from Bhavani peth, said, “Though Bhavani peth is not in the containment zone any more, we have seen the worst here and yet people are not exercising caution before stepping out. Wearing masks is mandatory and maintaining social distance is the need of the hour. In the borderline areas of micro containment zones attached to our area, we see that residents are not adhering to safety guidelines.”“I think that the virus infection is increasing because of people to people transmission. Now is the time for the residents to take a call and exercise self-discipline to protect their health and fellow residents,” said Gudakuwala.Akash Sable, a resident of Sinhgad road, said, “Earlier strict lockdown was implemented and residents were serious too. At that time too, people in slums were not following the norms. As of today, they are moving freely and not following the restriction norms. We need a strong health system to tackle the Covid-19 menace.”“Also Covid-19 literacy among citizens is the need of the hour and presently, citizens don’t have any idea of how deadly the disease is,” he added.Of the 15 wards, maximum containment areas are in Hadapsar-Mundhwa, Kothrud-Bavdhan, Aundh-Baner, Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar and Ahmednagar road-Wadgaonsheri wards. These areas are on the periphery of Pune city, which indicate the spread of Covid, first concentrated in “old Pune areas” like Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road and now in the outskirts.Sunita Gaikwad, a resident of Upper Indiranagar, who works in a private firm, said, “We follow the norms, but many are not aware of the virus and have a casual approach towards the infection. Neither the PMC nor the policemen visit our area to implement the law, so citizens have become fearless about the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/11-of-pune-city-s-population-living-in-containment-zones-but-not-many-follow-covid-19-rules/story-wkH5hfQXPwbe9coVeJvVzM.html

They fled when they were spotted by men working for a contractor.“We have received complaints regarding illegal mining in Ghaggar and I have asked the team to check and lodge a police complaint. Last month too we lodged an FIR against some persons on the same site,” said Gurpreet Pal Singh Sandhu, district mining officer.In the past three years 50 FIRs have been lodged to cope with the problem, but no one has been convicted as yet. About 17 cases were registered in 2018; 21 in 2019 and 12 in 2020, police records state. Around 50% cases in the past three years were registered in Mubarakpur, Dera Bassi. On July 6, Majri Police had booked former director general of police (DGP) Paramdeep Singh Gill and 44 farmers of Saini Majra under Section 21 of the Mine and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act for allowing illegal mining on their land. A fine of Rs 11 crore was imposed on them by the mining department. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said he had directed officials to take strict action against offenders and also owners of sites where illegal mining was carried out. In July last year, the mining department had imposed a penalty of Rs 52 crore on 193 landowners in three villages of Mohali — Mianpur Changar, Kubaheri and Abhipur— for allowing illegal mining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-monsoon-ban-sand-mined-illegally-in-dera-bassi-s-kakrali-village/story-keQuZDW6m39P1zZawDNZjN.html

SDM Jagdeep Sehgal has said if not removed by the deadline the hoardings will be taken down by the authorities concerned and action taken against vendors. The Punjab and Haryana high court in 1995 had issued directions to all deputy commissioners to remove hoardings on national as well as state highways as these were not just eyesores but a traffic hazard which could divert motorists’ attention.Despite several directions from the court later too, no action was taken by the authorities concerned.A large number of display boards can still be seen on national highway-21 in Kharar area. In March this year, MC was forced to cancel a drive to remove them on the intervention of director local bodies, Punjab, following which the Covid-19 lockdown was announced.Every year, the Kharar municipal council allots tenders for 40 ‘legal’ sites in the city and this year too a tender was allotted at the cost of Rs 3.25 crore per hoarding for nine years. Due to the illegal sites, however, the civic body is facing losses of around Rs 1 crore every year.Harpreet Singh, member, district road safety committee in Mohali, called for the removal of hoardings as these could lead to accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/remove-hoardings-in-7-days-or-face-action-nh-21-building-owners-warned/story-ulR8M3czKdZ6KNnkTRroBP.html

Singh had tested positive for Covid-19 on August 28 and was in home isolation before he was taken to Rajindra Hospital on Friday. On Saturday, the district administration released a video of the minister heaping praises on the hospital’s facilities and staff. However, by evening, the MLA’s family shifted him to a private hospital. “I was already getting some treatment from a private hospital, therefore I preferred to get myself shifted from Rajindra hospital,” said the MLA.When asked about his family raising questions over the cleanliness at Rajindra Hospital, Nirmal Singh said he did not face any inconvenience as he was provided a special room with an attached-bathroom facility. Surbhi Malik, in-charge of the Covid-19 facility at Rajindra hospital, said, “The MLA shifted to a private hospital due to some personal reasons which cannot be disclosed. Cleanliness is not an issue at all as the best of facilities are provided to every patient here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hours-after-praising-rajindra-hospital-shutrana-mla-shifts-to-private-facility/story-eZQOjkjveUVwFOpUBSrRuK.html

06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Ad hoardings removed from 3 Mohali foot overbridges||The municipal corporation has removed advertisement hoardings from three foot overbridges (FOBs) in the city in line with the Punjab government’s new advertisement policy banning any such displays on any structure within a 100-metre radius of a traffic signal.All the three FOBs are situated in close proximity of the traffic signals at Phase 7-3B1 crossing, Chawla Hospital crossing and Phase 3B1-5 crossing.“We have to follow the government policy as human safety is more important,” said MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.Locals, however, question the move, saying the advertisements helped the MC garner revenues of Rs 90 lakh annually and that the FOBs, built nine years ago, were being used for drinking and gambling activities and not by pedestrians.Most of the FOBs were littered with empty liquor bottles and used paper plates with stale food , with people gathering at some spots to drink and play cards.“So much money was wasted on the FOBs, but now drug addicts and alcoholics are the only ones using them,” said CL Garg, president of the Confederation of Greater Mohali Residents’ Welfare Associations, the apex body of 65 RWAs.From 2011 the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) spent more than Rs 2 crore on building four FOBs for managing pedestrian traffic, most of them in disuse now.In May 2016, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed GMADA not to invest in installation of escalators/elevators at FOBs. “We could have asked you to dismantle it (the FOBs). But you have spent so much of money. But let’s not invest more as it is of no use,” the high court bench observed .The decision to build the FOBs was taken at a meeting chaired by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, for better development and upgrading basic amenities in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ad-hoardings-removed-from-3-mohali-foot-overbridges/story-Yyb9n8RWNj2e4CgWvMvQ8K.html

Not less than an angel in khaki, assistant sub-inspector Rajesh Kumar from Panchkula’s Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) has helped send 573 missing persons back home in the last five years.Over half of the cases were solved by Kumar alone while his team pitched in for the rest.Joining AHTU in 2015, Kumar recalls one of his first cases, a five-year-old girl named Kaveri, who wore a gold nose pin. As she didn’t know any language except Bangla, he had to take her to the Chandimandir Command Hospital to get help from an acquaintance to translate what she had written. It was the name of her school, and within 15 days Kaveri was back home.All details in a diaryHis diary comes in handy in which every minute detail is noted down neatly. “It’s not easy to get cues from children, who are often scared. I don’t introduce myself as a policeman and try to be friendly to build a rapport with them,” says Kumar.From their dialect, to what they eat, he has to factor in everything in his investigations.Giving credit to Kumar’s entire unit for tracking missing persons, additional director general of police, Haryana, Navdeep Virk, calls Kumar “the prime motivator.”He has gone the extra mile. “In five years, he has taken the initiative to solve 294 cases wherein children from child care institutions were reunited with parents,” Virk adds.In 2017, Kumar managed to contact 16-year-old Pooja at the Tuti Kundi Children’s Home in Shimla. She had left home 11 years earlier and didn’t remember a thing, except for a “dhaage ka dher (pile of threads)” and that her father’s name was Somdat Sharma .“I could think of two places with textile factories – Ludhiana and Panipat. With no success in Ludhiana, I left for Panipat and looked through over 250 FIRs of 2007. One listed Pooja, daughter of Somdat Sharma from Sudana village as missing,” says Kumar.She was reunited with her family on July 23, 2018.Tracing the family of Kajal, another girl at the Shimla home, Kumar found she had been sent from Mumbai five years ago. “Her name too was Pooja who had mentioned Chandpur in 2007, when she had been found.”After an intensive search (there are 18 cities named Chandpur in India) he finally traced Pooja’s family to Chandpur in UP. “She had run away from home because she had lost the key to the house and was afraid of being beaten up,” he says.She was back with her family after 11 years on August 1, 2018.This year in January, an Aadhaar card came in handy to trace the Muzaffarful (UP) based family of a 10-year-old hearing and speech impaired boy.Purpose in lifeHis work, Kumar says, has given him a purpose in life. “Lost children find their families, what more can I ask for?” He has been unstoppable, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, solving 63 cases this year.One of them involved six-year-old Suraj, who said he was from Bindki in Uttar Pradesh when he was found, but the sarpanch there could not identify him. After asking the reserved child more questions, another clue, of a pond near his home, was revealed and the sarpanch contacted again and the home located. The boy who was missing from home since January 5, went home on August 5. It also took Kumar just a few days to help a missing child from Delhi return home with just two references to a “murge ki dukaan (chicken shop)” and “ganjey (bald) uncle.”On Sunday, he was able to connect two sisters from Bal Sadan in Panchkula with their father after six years.“At times my wife complains that I remain too busy, but she has never stopped me from working. When I ask my four-year-old daughter about what she would say if she was lost, she says, ‘my father reunites children with their parents’,” laughs Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-children-s-guiding-light-this-policeman-helps-reunite-them-with-their-families/story-YSr1BfPrk40N9IQZnPHDHN.html

06-09-2020||City||Jalandhar MC orders inquiry into sign forgery||Jalandhar Municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Karnesh Sharma has ordered a probe into signatures of deputy controller of finance and accounts (DFCA), Pankaj Kapoor, being forged on a file. The forgery was detected on a file that was to clear bills of Rs 90 lakh of a road construction firm. A three-member panel comprising a joint commissioner, MC, superintendent engineer and the DCFA himself has been asked to look into the matter and submit its report in a week.An MC official said the file of contractor, Rakesh Bansal, came to the DCFA, for clearance of Rs 80 lakh bill for road construction. Kapoor, however, found that after the accountant’s signature, his forged signature were already there. Kapoor scrutinised the file and found his forged signatures on one more bill worth of Rs 10 lakh, belonging to the same contractor. Kapoor issued show-cause notice to the accountant, Rajiv Sobti, asking him about the forged signature. Sobti’s reply was found unsatisfactory and had been brought to the notice of the MC commissioner and mayor Jagdish Raja. Municipal councillor Gurvinder Singh Bunty Neelkanth, who had raised this matter in a financial committee meeting said this was not the first case of its kind. “Probe should be conducted into previously passed bills to stop corruption in the MC. It is a serious issue,” he added. Mayor Jagdish Raja has also said the sensitive issue needed a deeper probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-mc-orders-inquiry-into-sign-forgery/story-qLRqExG7PVJvp55QwsdiXP.html

Hit hard by the pandemic outbreak, manufacturers and traders say the order book has shrunk to a quarter of the usual. They add that Unlock 4.0 phase is also expected to continue with restrictions on organising religious and marriages functions in Punjab to stay. Industry sources added harmonium, tabla and dholak are manufactured in the state, whereas stringed instruments are supplied from other states.Harmonium manufacturing business is much more prevalent in the state, with workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh the mainstay of the labour force. Umesh Kumar, who has a harmonium manufacturing unit in Mohali, said he had been supplying at least 5,000 units a year to dealers in Ludhiana, Jalandhar and cities of other adjoining states. “Since March this year, there has hardly been any work. When travel restrictions were relaxed for migrant workers, more than 100 working for me at my unit left for their native places. Now, I have insufficient manpower even if I get orders in the next two months of the festive season,” he said.Gurmeet Singh, of Yamuna Musical Store in Ludhiana, said restrictions on international travel had also hit business.“Besides local demand, I had an average monthly orders of 100-150 sets of harmoniums and tablas. Ragis travelling to the US, Canada, Germany and Australia for religious events at gurdwaras placed these orders. Suspension of overseas travel had directly hit sales,” said Gurmeet.Arun Kumar, another manufacturer from Jalandhar, said this year educational institutes were not demanding musical instruments.“We are struggling for survival. As schools and colleges continue to be closed, I do not see normalcy returning over the next few months as well. Even as the market demand has dipped, the government has also failed to support artistes,” he said.Premjit Singh of Panipat in Haryana had a flourishing small-scale business of manufacturing reeds for harmonium sets. His year has been dismal. “I used to supply reeds made of pure brass to Punjab, Delhi and other states. This year, peak season like Ganesh Visarjan and Jagannath Yatras in cities have passed by without any major order,” he added.A third-generation entrepreneur in trading of musical instruments Tejwinder Singh said demand from orchestra parties and groups performing at ‘jagrans’ has vanished. “The pandemic has disrupted the entire chain in the business. The traditional peak season of marriages and religious functions is scheduled to begin next month, it is highly unlikely that we will get new orders for this year,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-hits-the-wrong-note-for-music-instrument-makers/story-y16PnUyiSwja0qX4v8VkRP.html

Using the jaggery and a makeshift apparatus for distillation, he had made seven bottles of countrymade liquor, which he had been consuming for the last 10 days. He had given the same liquor to Gora and Seetal,” the investigating official revealed. A sample of the liquor has been recovered and sent for forensic examination.Superintendent of police (SP-investigation) Jagjit Singh Walia said the viscera of the deceased would be sent to a forensic lab to ascertain the exact cause of his death. Though he maintained it was not a case of spurious liquor death, he appealed to the people to purchase liquor only from approved liquor vends. Last month, 123 people had died after allegedly consuming spurious liquor in three districts of Punjab--Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-dies-after-consuming-home-made-liquor-in-tarn-taran-village/story-ORUOYvd4KZBtlNdEhwcI7H.html

The AAP leaders said that the failure of the government could not be concealed by making baseless allegations against AAP. “Our party has nothing to do with rumour-mongers, however, Amarinder Singh and the Congress are making efforts to tarnish the image of AAP by linking the persons to us,” said the AAP MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-should-desist-from-making-false-allegations-to-cover-up-his-govt-s-failures-aap/story-Qe4RW5Kp896tmfj0QgOGPI.html

In a statement here, the SAD president said that the state had secured the 19th rank in the Business Reform Action Plan 2019 rankings while last year, it was at the 20th position in this category. “This is in stark contrast to the number one ranking achieved by the state in ease of setting up of business in 2015 and number one position secured for single window reforms in 2016 during the SAD-BJP tenure,” said Sukhbir. Stating that the latest rankings were a cause for concern for all Punjabis as the state had witnessed a fall in the rankings even after the introduction of a New Industrial Policy in 2013, Sukhbir said even Punjab’s neighbours had outstripped the state. “Himachal Pradesh has jumped from the 16th rank last year to the 17th rank while Haryana has been ranked 16th.” The SAD chief said that earlier in December 2019, Punjab had finished 13th out of 18 big states on the Good Governance Index (GGI). Asserting that CM Amarinder Singh was responsible for this state of affairs, Sukhbir said the CM had downgraded the Invest Punjab department, which had created a one-stop clearance system and boosted investment to the tune of Rs 45,000 crore during the SAD-BJP tenure. Asking the CM to perform or quit, the SAD president said, “You (Capt Amarinder Singh) are presiding over the downfall of the state in each and every sphere. Your fake claims of bringing in investment and holding a sham investment meet have been exposed. Investors have lost confidence to invest in Punjab under your leadership. The situation has become such that Punjab is now being ranked below the erstwhile ‘bimaru’ states which has hurt Punjabi pride and prestige also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-has-become-a-laggard-under-amarinder-sukhbir/story-sOf2z16TshJydrNXIGvPSJ.html

However, some Shiv Sena leaders were issuing threats to Kangana over some comments.“Kangana’s family and the entire Himachal is concerned over her safety. As the CM, Thackeray should provide full security to the actress and also stop his party leaders from harming her,” he wrote.He said Shiv Sena leader and former Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi is his old friend, and “I have written to him to provide security to Kangana.”Meanwhile, Shanta also talked to the actress’s family and advised them that Kangana should not get involved in the controversy anymore.He has also urged Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to immediately speak to his Maharashtra counterpart on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-veteran-bjp-leader-shanta-kumar-shoots-off-letter-to-maha-cm-seeks-security-for-kangana/story-ssGUqKB8jJdUzUpK3mHryI.html

Till now, the organisation has set up more than 60 libraries in government schools which are located in far-flung areas of Spiti, benefiting around 600 students.These libraries include knowledge enhancing books in Hindi, English and Tibetan languages.Apart from this, the organisation is also providing videos of stories in regional as well as other languages through their teachers and parents so that they can show these videos to children through smartphones and laptops.One of the volunteers, Chemi Lhamo said there is an old tradition of story-telling in Spiti valley and due to the pandemic, there are not many resources available for the same, so she has been telling stories to children in the regional language.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jeevan Singh Negi said the organisation has been very helpful in establishing libraries in Spiti valley and students are benefiting in a big way from these libraries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/storybooks-keep-spiti-children-s-interest-piqued-amid-pandemic/story-sYKNZbcMtztsxe7SXC7dyM.html

The association’s general secretary, Ajay Pal Singh Atwal, said the expert committee’s recommendations disregard the performance of PSPCL/PSTCL.

Atwal said the overall distribution losses in PSPCL are 11.7%, which is among the lowest in India.

06-09-2020||Pune||Lockdown was lifted due to pressure from traders: Ajit Pawar on Raut’s remarks||After Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was against “hastily” lifting the Covid-19 lockdown in Pune city, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the decision was taken in July given the pressure from traders and other stakeholders. He was in the city on Saturday for various meetings to discuss the Covid-19 crisis here.Raut’s remarks, made earlier this week, was seen as indirectly blaming Pawar and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after Pune becoming one of the worst-affected districts in the country with over 1.89 lakh cases and 8,333 deaths till Friday. Responding to the remarks, Pawar said while the chief minister has been of the view that things should open up step by step, several people were of the view that the economy should not suffer for this long. “Many even said that we have to learn to live with the virus while the traders’ community was insisting on lifting the lockdown. They said attention should be given to livelihood of people dependent on the industry. When a decision is being taken about a big city such as Pune, various people have various views,” said Pawar.The ten-day lockdown from July 14 to 23 was to break the chain of transmission after the region saw an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases. However, it came under heavy criticism from various quarters including Pune Traders’ Association. Pawar’s response came against the backdrop of rising complaints about unavailability of beds, an issue that has been consistently raised in the city. To effectively deal with the situation in Pune and western Maharashtra, the chief minister has now appointed former Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar as his advisor, a move seen as another attempt by Shiv Sena to corner Pawar. Mhaisekar, who retired on July 31, will work from Pune under CM’s principal advisor Ajoy Mehta. Through Mhaisekar, CM will be able to keep direct watch on the situation here, which is currently being monitored by Ajit Pawar. Lifting of lockdown in July fourth week was at the behest of Ajit Pawar, who holds sway in the Pune region. Despite repeated attempts, Mhaisekar did not respond for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lockdown-was-lifted-due-to-pressure-from-traders-ajit-pawar-on-raut-s-remarks/story-m51sIgwofBjHrgNajIQNcP.html

Taking cognisance of the situation, the state government has urged the Centre to take a same decision at the national level and change norms by allowing industries to supply 50 per cent of overall oxygen for health purposes while remaining 50 per cent to industries,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “As many complaints of oxygen shortage are reported in the state, the health minister Rajesh Tope and I discussed this issue with state chief secretary and industrial secretary on Saturday morning. We have now instructed industries to increase oxygen supply to 50 per cent of the total for health sector from the existing 15 per cent,” said Pawar. The deputy chief minister during the meeting on Saturday in the city urged Union minister Prakash Javadekar to put forth this demand at the central level. “Once the Centre takes a decision, it will be implemented nationally,” said Pawar. As Pune’s Covid situation is worsening, with the district reporting the highest number of cases across the country, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar, Union minister Prakash Javadekar, Ajit Pawar and state health minister Rajesh Tope took marathon meetings on Saturday. As on Friday, Pune district’s Covid tally crossed 1.89 lakh with 4,333 deaths. Taking into account complaints about bed shortage and ambulance unavailability, the administration was directed to start a separate dashboard for ambulances. “The dashboard will be updated in realtime so people will know about the availability of ambulances,” said Javadekar. “We decided to have better coordination in all the agencies in Pune. The central government will help Pune more and I am going to meet the ministers concerned on Monday for various issues. Centre will provide more ventilators for Pune city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-state-govt-decides-to-allot-more-oxygen-supply-to-health-sector/story-ccn9t40BIYDbm45XfqpPEO.html

06-09-2020||Dehradun||In a first, quarantine facility for imported horticulture crops to come up in Uttarakhand||The Uttarakhand government has started working on making a quarantine facility --- spread over 20 acres -- for imported high-value horticulture crops. The objective of the facility is to prevent the spread of any diseases from these imported crops to other native plants. Subodh Uniyal, minister for agriculture and horticulture in the hill state, said that the Central government has asked the state government to find a suitable plot of land, where the facility can be built. “This is a first for the state. We have written to the district magistrates (DMs) of Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to look for a plot of land, where the post-entry quarantine facility can be built. A Central government team will conduct an inspection within two weeks to survey the chosen land,” said Uniyal. The minister said not only imported crops and agriculture produce for Uttarakhand, but for other states would also be kept at the soon-to-be-built facility before they were distributed among farmers. “Imported high-value horticulture crops will be kept in the facility for a year, as researchers will study these plants for any diseases following which they will be distributed among farmers. The researchers will study various factors such as how a plant reacts to climatic conditions, soil, temperature etc,” added Uniyal. Rajbir Singh, joint secretary, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, wrote to the principal secretary, horticulture, Uttarakhand, on September 4 about a suitable plot of land for the facility. He stated that the National Seeds Corporation (NSC) had informed that the University of Horticulture and Forestry at Bharsar in Pauri Garhwal had agreed to allot 20 hectares (ha) to build the facility. “NSC’s proposal involves an unproductive cost due to the undulating and hilly terrain…” the letter said.“A four-member Central team will visit Dehradun soon to explore the possibilities of an alternate site and discuss the facility’s cost implications that will be borne by the state government,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-a-first-quarantine-facility-for-imported-horticulture-crops-to-come-up-in-uttarakhand/story-puj4cgP0Ad5b20jZyI7LlN.html

The court said, “It is of the opinion that there is sufficient material on record to take cognizance of the offences alleged to have been committed by accused persons”.The court while taking cognizance on the chargesheet also added that “However, it is not inclined to take cognizance for the offence under Section 153-A IPC as for taking cognizance for the said offence, the previous sanction as provided under section 196 CrPC is mandatory to be filed by the agency but same has not been filed till today. Investigation officer has informed that in the present case a letter dated 13.07.2020 has been sent to the competent authority but it is not clear as to how much time, it will take for obtaining sanction. In this scenario when there is no timeframe for obtaining sanction and that any delay in proceeding further in the matter will unnecessarily defeat the purpose for which the special courts for trial of riot cases have been created. It deems it fit to take cognizance of all the offences as discussed.”Court had also issued a production warrant against all the accused and directed the Tihar Jail authority to produce them through video conferencing on September 10.Delhi Police chargesheet stated that Head Constable Rattan Lal was killed and several other police officials and public persons were injured when the mob without provocation attacked the police party. The post mortam report of Rattan Lal revealed that he sustained gunshot injuries apart from 21 injuries and had succumbed to these injuries.According to the chargesheet, the public witnesses and the local beat staff have categorically stated in their statements about the specific role of accused persons that they were the main organisers of the protest and were fully involved in inciting people for rioting.“Further, the eyewitnesses who have witnessed the incident have stated in their statements that on February 24, the police party deployed at Chand Bagh protest site was suddenly attacked by the mob led by accused persons. The mob was armed with lathis, rods and killed HC Rattan Lal, caused injuries to DCP Amit Sharma, ACP Anuj Kumar and also to several other police officials and public persons. Besides the statement of witnesses, there is also CCTV footage which showed the presence of accused persons,” said the Delhi Police chargesheet.According to the chargesheet, protests were being held against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Chand Bagh area without any official permission and in blatant violation of rules and regulations.“Speakers addressing gathering were spreading false information about CAA and NRC and were deliberately conveyed to the Muslim population that they would lose their citizenship and later when NRC would be introduced then on non-production of the documents they would be sent to the detention camps,” Delhi Police said in the chargesheet.In February, violence took place in the northeast area of Delhi between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which led to the deaths of at least 53 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-declares-2-accused-as-proclaimed-offenders-in-cop-s-murder/story-9sLhRsWFIUq3Rvhm8ErE1M.html

Raut, in his weekly column Rokh Thok in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, took on the BJP and said blaming god for the failure of the government is an “insult to Hindutva”.In end-August, during the 41st Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, Sitharaman had referred to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as “an act of God” that disrupted economic activities. Raut, in the column, wrote, “The country’s collapsed economy is due to an Act of God, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said so. What kind of Hindutva is this to cover the failure of the government by blaming God? If God is being accused, in which court will he be tried? ... Blaming God for the failure of the government is an insult to Hindutva.” He also took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Our PM Modi speaks on all issues under the sun, but does not speak on the battered economy, or even touches upon the question that has cropped up because of the economic woes. On the road from demonetisation to lockdown, our economy has died,” he wrote. He gave examples of several countries, including Brazil, which are helping their nationals with financial aid to tide over the pandemic and its resultant economic impact. “During the pandemic, several countries such as Brazil are helping their people.

The leopard was declared a man-eater after it had killed a man in Devprayag on August 29.”The forest department had been trying to capture the leopard for the past week after the animal killed a man and attacked a few other people in the area.“We had installed cages to capture the leopard and set up camera traps to track its movement. The pictures helped identify the leopard and it was shot dead in the early morning on Sunday. The animal had become old and was looking for easy prey,” Meena added.Earlier on July 11, a man-eater leopard, which had killed a girl (12) in Chamoli district, was shot dead in Badrinath forest division.Ashutosh Singh, the DFO of Badrinath division, had said that the leopard was declared a man-eater on June 30, a day after its second kill.A chief wildlife warden of a state can declare any wild animal a threat to human life and fit to be killed by invoking Clause 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-man-eater-leopard-that-killed-25-year-old-man-shot-dead/story-Z6BgjwzVUzEr8yaU2TcJKN.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackery revokes decision of institutional quarantine for Covid-19 patients over 50||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s decision to mandate institutional quarantine for Covid-19 patients above the age of 50 drew criticism, the decision has now been revoked. Patients in the age group of 50-60 can be permitted home quarantine. However, the earlier decision to institutionally quarantine patients over the age of 60 will still prevail. The decision was made in a state review meeting headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday.A circular issued by BMC’s health department on August 20 said that Covid-19 patients over 50 or anyone with co-morbidities, irrespective of their age, will now have to go to Covid Care Centre 2 facilities (institutional quarantine) for treatment and isolation. Till then, the earlier guidelines allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients below 60 with no co-morbidities and those having separate toilet facilities in their homes. However, the amendment to the earlier guideline led to criticism as patients above 50 who showed no symptoms and could have been home quarantined still had to be admitted to institutional quarantine. This issue was brought up in the state review meeting wherein directions to revoke the quarantine rules were given.Even though the decision has been revoked, BMC has now decided to consult the family physicians of patients above 50 who test positive. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Our ward war rooms will now collect additional details from these patients about their family physicians who will be consulted with on a daily basis. Patients over 50 will be institutionally quarantined after their family doctors opine or if their condition worsens.”Kakani added that this is to ensure that the patients over 50 get immediate medical attention when needed.The current average Covid-19 mortality rate of Mumbai is stagnant at 5.0%; it is way above than the national mortality rate at 1.8% and state average mortality rate at 2.97%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackery-revokes-decision-of-institutional-quarantine-for-covid-19-patients-over-50/story-vzkmn2AasEPMwAhGHv6gPK.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||CM Arvind Kejriwal launches Delhi’s campaign against dengue||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched the second edition of its “10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute” (10 weeks, 10 o’ clock, 10 minutes) campaign against dengue and other vector-borne diseases such as malaria and chikungunya on Sunday.“Last year, two crore people of Delhi had joined hands to win a fight against dengue. In the next 10 weeks, we will do it again. I inspected my home on Sunday for places where stagnant water could accumulate. I urge you to do the same. Let’s join hands to fight against dengue once again,” the CM said.The people have been urged to inspect their homes for any possible sources of stagnant clean water that can lead to the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, which spread vector-borne diseases. In 2015, Delhi had recorded 15,867 cases of dengue and 60 deaths. The national capital had reported 2,036 cases of dengue and two deaths last year, the data shared by the Delhi government showed.On Sunday, all Delhi government’s ministers, Rajya Sabha (RS) members of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), lawmakers and other party leaders joined the drive. They posted photographs and short video clips on social media. Several volunteers and party supporters also joined the campaign and took to social media in a similar manner.“One should not be complacent assuming that there is no place in a person’s house, where clean water can accumulate. If you invest 10 minutes, you are most likely to come across some place that went unnoticed. I urge more people to participate in the campaign,” tweeted Manish Sisodia, said deputy CM, Delhi.The participants, including CM Kejriwal, pledged that they would devote 10 minutes at 10 pm every Sunday for 10 weeks to inspect their house for stagnant clean water and clean it to avoid breeding of Aedes mosquitoes and prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases.In the coming weeks, doctors would be requested to endorse the campaign and more children would be encouraged to participate through homework assigned by schools. Government offices would also be asked to promote it, Satyendar Jain, minister for health, Delhi, told media persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-launches-second-edition-of-10-hafte-10-baje-10-minute-campaign-against-dengue/story-RKx3JgSIgJivJCC1PbdJ5M.html

The man, who had not got himself registered as a pilgrim and did not have Covid certificate, was initially not allowed to visit the cave shrine nestled in the Trikuta hills.The devotee, Gore Lal, of Mainpuri in UP, had embarked on the pilgrimage on August 5 and reached Katra on September 2. In the wake of the pandemic, the shrine board has capped the number of pilgrims allowed to undertake the journey per day and has also made online registration and a recent Covid-19 negative report a requisite for undertaking the journey. Lal sought help from a local shopkeeper, who informed the deputy commissioner of his plight. Reasi district commissioner (DC) Indu Kanwal Chib said, “This man, a staunch devotee of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, walked all the way from UP to reach Katra. He had to be quarantined for a few days, after which a Covid-19 test was conducted. Once he tested negative, he was allowed to proceed for the darshan.” Lal has reached Ardhkuwari. The DC clarified that concessions were only made in this case because the man had undertaken a 29-day journey. She said, “We cannot allow unregistered people to visit the shrine. Though, I am a stickler for rules, I relented in this case because the man walked for almost a month to reach here,” she said.Now, 500 pilgrims from outside J&K can visit shrine each dayWith the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi yatra picking up pace, the administration has now increased the number of pilgrims from outside J&K allowed to visit the shrine to 500 per day. A total of 2,000 pilgrims can visit the cave shrine per day. The shrine re-opened on august 16 after a gap of five months. Shrine board CEO Ramesh Kumar said bookings for the Shradha Suman Vishesh Pooja (SSVP) have also commenced online. Accommodations at Bhawan, Adhkuwari, Katra and Jammu have also been opened for the pilgrims. The pilgrims can also avail facilities such as battery-operated vehicles, passenger ropeways and helicopter services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/arduous-pilgrimage-44-yr-old-devout-walks-for-29-days-to-reach-vaishno-devi-from-up/story-tiAuEHP1FjzBmSCTvAiviP.html
06-09-2020||Lucknow||UP jumps to 2nd position in ease of doing business rankings||Uttar Pradesh (UP) has jumped to the second position in the ease of doing business (EoDB) annual rankings that Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal released in New Delhi on Saturday. “UP has jumped from the 12th position in Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2017-18 to the second position in BRAP 19. UP has left behind several leading states such as Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra etc in the EoDB annual rankings,” said a spokesman of the state government. UP is second only to Andhra Pradesh (AP).UP has implemented 186 of the 187 reforms suggested by the Union government’s department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) under BRAP 19. “This year’s exercise was completely based on user feedback. Attaining the second rank indicates that entrepreneurs have been receiving the benefits of these reforms implemented by the UP government under the dynamic leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” the spokesman said. “From May onwards, the state had also started to rank all its 75 districts in the EoDB exercise,” he added.Under state BRAP 20-21, UP implemented 170 out of 301 suggested reforms, he added. The reforms covered several aspects such as labour regulation, online single-window facility, access to information and transparency, land administration, construction permit, commercial disputes etc. Over 20 departments such as Invest UP (Udyog Bandhu), labour, commercial tax, power, stamp and registration, excise, food safety and drug administration, UP Pollution Control Board etc have been an integral part of the reforms, according to the spokesman. UP’s feat is being attributed to the successful implementation of the Nivesh Mitra portal. In two years, Nivesh Mitra received 2,29,936 applications for No-Objection Certificates (NoCs) and 94% were disposed of, the spokesman said. Nivesh Mitra is a dedicated single-window system of the UP government. State industrial development minister Satish Mahana, UP chief secretary (CS) RK Tiwari, infrastructure, industrial development commissioner (IIDC) Alok Tandon and additional chief secretary (ACS) (infrastructure and industrial development) Alok Kumar have lauded the achievement. “The CM has been emphasising on transparency and best practices in business-to-government (B2G) interactive procedures through the use of technology. Our government has been successful in improving EoDB by introducing various IT-driven modules and Nivesh Mitra is one such successful tool,” said Mahana. Tandon said: “EoDB shows that the Nivesh Mitra portal has become an integral part in bridging the gap between industrial demands and expectations from the state government.” Kumar said, “A maximum approval of BRAP 19 reforms and higher user feedback satisfaction record on Nivesh Mitra portal have played a critical role in achieving this milestone. Initiatives such as a monthly ranking of all 75 districts on EoDB parametres shall further help in creating a conducive business environment in UP.” Neena Sharma, chief executive officer (CEO) of Invest UP, said the feat reflected Nivesh Mitra’s acceptance in the industry. The portal has received 18,120 grievances from entrepreneurs to date, of which 17,752, or 98%, have been resolved. Yogi hails state’s achievementHT Correspondentletters@hindustantimes.comLucknow: CM Yogi Adityanath has congratulated investors, entrepreneurs and the public for Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) second position in the ease of doing business (EoDB) annual rankings.In a press statement, the CM said UP has been playing a key role in making Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign a success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-jumps-to-2nd-position-in-ease-of-doing-business-rankings/story-dAJ3hAkA1hgphJZ1er5LzL.html

06-09-2020||Kolkata||Bengal police review security in former Maoist stronghold after stray incidents||Virendra, the director-general of police (DGP) in West Bengal, on Saturday reviewed security arrangements in parts of the state’s western districts that used to be a hotbed for subversive activities carried out by the members of the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) until 2011. These districts are located along Bengal’s border with neighbouring Jharkhand and Odisha. Last week, the Centre withdrew the Central security forces deployed in the region to counter the Left-wing extremists (LW) since there has been no insurgent activity in the past 10 years. DGP Virendra visited Jhargram and West Midnapore districts and held a meeting with Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to review some stray incidents that had come to light of late. On August 15, around a dozen hand-written posters were recovered from a couple of villages located around the Bhulabheda forest. The posters had urged the public to observe Independence Day as ‘kala divas’, or black day. On August 27, a cooking gas dealer had lodged a police complaint, saying a shot was fired outside his house at Belpahari in Jhargram district. Some posters, issuing threats to a local contractor, had surfaced at Banspahari in West Midnapore district around the same time. “No Maoist connection was found in any of the incidents. Police also did not find any evidence of a shot being fired outside the house of the cooking gas dealer. It could be crackers. But we have activated our intelligence network,” said a Jhargram district police officer who did not want to be quoted. “We reviewed the incidents at the meeting. Police will intensify vigil in villages,” DGP Virendra told media persons after holding talks with IPS officers. West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar recently hinted that Maoists could be regrouping in the state. “The dangerous head of Maoism is getting visible with support of state actors,” Dhankhar had said at a function organised at the Raj Bhawan to mark the second death anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. Parts of West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram districts comprise the region where the Maoists had carried out subversive activities between 2009 and 2011. Over 350 civilians, including Maoist leaders and cadres, and more than 50 security personnel were killed in Bengal during that period. Security forces had killed around 80 Maoist leaders and activists. The Maoists were wiped out from Bengal after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011. Maoist leader Koteswar Rao alias Kishanji was killed in a police encounter the same year. The TMC has recently inducted Chhatradhar Mahato, who was the convener of the Maoist-backed People’s Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA) during the Left Front regime, into the party’s state committee. He was in prison for 10 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-police-reviews-security-in-erstwhile-maoist-zone-after-stray-incidents/story-zLVPgHFX7ufOtkXPSVMReK.html

Singh, 75, who stayed in Chandigarh, complained of chest pain in the morning and was rushed to a hospital where he died, said family sources. A former vice-chairman of Punjab and Sindh Bank, he served as chief secretary of the apex gurdwara body from August 2015 to July 2017. His hefty salary of Rs 3 lakh per month had sparked a row following which he voluntarily reduced it to Rs 1 lakh. On August 27, while announcing legal action against Singh, the SGPC executive panel stated that he failed to discharge his responsibilities properly. He did not take any action despite knowing about the tampering of the record, said the SGPC, adding that it pointed towards his involvement. Seeking a probe into Harcharan Singh’s death, SAD (Taksali) spokesperson Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad said he was upset over being targeted by the SGPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-saroops-days-after-being-indicted-sgpc-ex-chief-secy-dies-of-heart-attack/story-RA4NRckBBPC2MYLLZbG1DM.html

The state has been placed at number 19 in the ranks announced by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) for 36 states and union territories at a virtual event chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Andhra tops, UP no. 2 Andhra Pradesh for the third time in a row has topped in the ease of doing annual business ranking. Registering a jump of 10 places, Uttar Pradesh occupied the second position in 2019 as against 12th in 2018. Telangana slipped to the third position from second in 2018. Though the state officials were expecting a big improvement from the 20th rank the state got in 2017-18, the 19th position has left them disappointed. “The detailed report is still awaited. We will look at areas where improvement is needed,” a senior government official said. The states were ranked on the basis of implementation of business reform action plan in business regulatory areas such as single window system, access to information, labour, environment, etc. Himachal among top 10, Haryana slips to 16th rank In the region, Himachal Pradesh bagged seventh slot in the annual ranking that is aimed at promoting competition among states with a view to improving the business climate to attract domestic as well as foreign investments. Haryana slipped from number three to 16th rank in the latest reportPunjab had implemented 178 of the 187 reforms suggested by DPIIT. The rankings, which were launched by the Centre five years ago to encourage competition among states for improvement in business environment to attract investments, have also given full weightage to the feedback about the effectiveness of the reforms, according to a government release.

But we have found that many attendants have also spread the infection in a few areas.”He added that since it wasn’t possible for them to test all attendants, they will now ask for their Covid-19 reports for them to accompany positive patients. Dr Ram said that this will help them contain the infection in the hospital.Recently, the son of a patient from Himachal Pradesh developed symptoms and later, tested positive. Subsequently, two patients admitted in the same ward also tested positive who had come in contact with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-attendants-of-patients-admitted-at-pgimer-need-to-produce-own-covid-reports/story-YEGAWReIyBafClxwAadE3L.html

The highest package on offer to the 2017-18 batch was ₹37 LPA.The average package offered was recorded at ₹10.2 LPA, an increase from last year’s 9.4 LPA. Pre-placement offers, too, increased from 83 to 89.PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi said, “Earlier, only those students with above 6 CGPA were allowed to sit for placements. This year, all those who completed their academic credits regardless of CGPA could sit for placements as everyone with a degree from PEC deserves to be considered for placements.”Students from the electronics and communication engineering (ECE) and computer science engineering branches got the highest package offers. ECE was able to clinch the ₹42-LPA package, a significant upgrade from last year’s ₹19.96 LPA.The highest package offered to the students of civil engineering was ₹17.5 LPA, an improvement from last year’s ₹10.8 LPA. Meanwhile, the highest package offered to both mechanical and production engineering branches was ₹17.5 LPA and ₹14.0 LPA respectively, a drop from last year’s ₹21 LPA.Coding jobs most in-demandPEC placement in-charge Dr JD Sharma said, “44% of all jobs were related to coding. Core jobs formed 25% of all offers while 13% of the jobs were from the analytics sector.” Consulting, operations and finance were relatively less popular with just 10%, 6% and 2% of all jobs on offers, respectively.Only 14 students excused themselves from placements this year to pursue higher education. In the two previous batches of 2018-2019 and 2017-2018, 36 and 43 students, respectively, had opted to pursue higher studies after graduation.32% jobs went to girlsOnly 32% of the total job offers went to girl students. Mechanical engineering, a branch not very popular among girls, saw just 6% placement among girls. In the electrical engineering branch, on the other hand, 40% jobs were offered to girls. Certain recruiters—RBS, NXP, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs—specially hired more females for better gender ratio.Virtual placements also heldKeeping the pandemic in mind, 22 companies conducted virtual placements, most of them from the pharma, healthcare, investment banking and insurance sectors. Companies like United Airlines and CollegeDunia, which had earlier revoked their offers due to Covid, also took students on board in separate job profiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-witnesses-28-more-campus-placements-this-year/story-oOjaYx9i8vAneVHgku47bN.html
06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh least business-friendly in India||Chandigarh may boast of being the first planned city of Independent India and educational and political hub of the region, but when it comes to ease of doing business, the Union Territory has shared the bottom rank with seven other states in 2019. The capital of two states has achieved 29th rank, same as last year (2017-18), in the fourth edition of ‘Business Reform Action Plan’ rankings for 2019, released by the Union finance minister in New Delhi on Saturday. Haryana is ranked 16th and Punjab 19th.Chandigarh is tied with Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim and Tripura at the 29th position.Andhra Pradesh has topped the rankings, with Uttar Pradesh at second and Telangana at third positions. Business Reform Action Plan rankings began in 2015 with an objective to introduce healthy competition among states and UTs and thereby attract investments and increase the ease of doing business. Chandigarh achieved 24th rank in the inaugural report, but was placed last in 2016 .Reform parametersThe Business Reform Action Plan 2018-19 contained a list of 80 reforms (187 reform action points) including access to information and transparency enablers, availability of land, environmental registration enablers, obtaining electricity connection, labour regulation enablers, single-window system, environmental registration enablers, land administration and transfer of property and sector-wise enablers.Of the 187 reform points, Chandigarh only implemented nine, and there was no action on the remaining 178. As per the ranking report, the reforms were implemented in some points falling under access to information, obtaining electricity connection, and environment, but the performance was “not good”.Calling the rankings extremely disappointing, Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh, said: “The administration needs to take concrete steps in consultation with all stakeholder to reverse this situation.”Naveen Manglani, president, Chamber of Chandigarh Industries, said: “The main reason of low ranking was non-implementation of Chandigarh Industrial Policy 2015. Major issues are non-conversion of leasehold industrial plots to freehold and no increase in floor area ratio. The rigidity of rules is leaving no scope for growth and ease of doing in business. Chandigarh’s loss is Punjab and Haryana’s gain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-least-business-friendly-in-india/story-GjSwScM0u8yTvG1dSscLPN.html

06-09-2020||Chandigarh||No on-demand Covid testing at government-run facilities in Chandigarh||The government-run labs in Chandigarh will not allow on-demand testing of Covid-19.In a fresh advisory released by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Friday, it has been recommended that any individual who wants to get tested should be allowed to do so.On any such decision regarding on-demand testing in government-run labs, UT health secretary Arun Gupta, “It will not be available in government labs, however, private labs can test anyone.” Currently, three private labs are operational in the city.At present, those reporting with Covid-19 symptoms and contacts of confirmed cases are being tested in the three government-run labs through various sampling centres.UT adviser Manoj Parida said in addition to tests being conducted as per requirement, a few random tests were also conducted in city markets, but no one was found infected.“On-demand testing is available in private facilities, while government-run facilities are exclusively for persons with symptoms and exposure to infected persons,” said Parida.UT had earlier allowed private labs to RT-PCR tests for detecting Covid-19 without any prescriptions for a fixed fee of ₹2,000. So far, 34,369 tests have been conducted, out of which more than 5500 have returned positive suggesting a positivity ratio of more than 15%. Experts have called for more aggressive testing along with extensive contact tracing to bring the pandemic under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-on-demand-covid-testing-at-government-run-facilities-in-chandigarh/story-WJ3DwDfBF9pT8TJveHLu4J.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Concerns over aviation ministry move to permit international fliers take Covid-19 tests after arrival to India||Three days after the central government issued guidelines on Wednesday allowing international passengers arriving in the country to get tested for Covid-19 at the entry airport, experts have raised concerns and said that this step would pose a risk of spreading the virus to other passengers who were tested negative before their departure. The central government has said the latest guideline will be implemented on a pilot basis without specifying the time period. Responding to the concerns, Rajeev Jain, additional director general and spokesman, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), said, “Our order just talks of facilities available at entry airport and the guidelines followed for transit passengers. Ministries of civil aviation, home affairs or health and family welfare have not discriminated asymptomatic passengers to be treated differently . Experts need to advise if their demand is that the passengers need to be Covid-19 negative before boarding flight or they should be treated separately. Even after testing negative, a passenger may get infected during transit before boarding his/her next flight. Even the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (IHR) has not mandated any such requirement for passengers to be made to sit separately from the ones who have got themselves tested before take off. However, further discussions are proposed with health officials and other relevant departments, “ On Friday evening, an aviation safety expert had written to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, suggesting that tests after arrival should only be allowed in extraordinary situations. The letter written by Vipul Saxena, a former defence pilot and an aviation expert, read, “The order virtually sends message of exemption from RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test 96 hours before boarding at last foreign departure point as the order doesn’t specify under which circumstance a passenger is exempted from the test; this would encourage passengers to deliberately avoid RT-PCR and increase risk of boarding of infected passengers, putting other healthy passengers at risk of getting infection from one who boarded and supposedly positive. The order is also silent about separating such passengers from others and being made to sit separately from other passengers.” Saxena also pointed out that passengers who board the flight without getting tested should be handled separately for in-flight services. “It is requested that the order may please be reviewed and specify a list of exempted instances under which a passenger who could not do RT-PCR may be allowed to board, and also that such passengers are to be allotted seats away from other passengers...passengers without RT-PCR be allowed only under extraneous circumstances and be treated on board as deemed to be infected for the seating arrangements and in flight services etc (sic),” the letter concluded. Allowing international passengers to take onward flights after landing at the entry airport (and thereby avoiding the seven-day institutional quarantine), the aviation ministry on September 2, had issued guidelines for entry airports to conduct the RT-PCR tests for passengers without the negative RT-PCR results of tests they are supposed to take 96 hours within the take off. The aviation ministry had stated that a passenger will be allowed to take the onward domestic flight only if he tests negative and that the result will be given within seven hours. It also directed airport operators to ensure that such passengers are made to wait at one location – where basic facilities such as Wi-Fi, food and washrooms are available – until the test results are declared. However, the guidelines failed to state protocols for the other passengers who booked for onward journey but travelled with an infected co-passenger in their previous flight. Mohan Ranganathan, former instructor pilot for Boeing 737, said, “Going by the recent guidelines, all the other passengers are at a greater risk of getting exposed to the virus. The ministry seems to have thought of the guidelines only after considering the commercial angle to help the airlines and did not think about the risk factors which are a larger issue. Passengers who plan to get themselves tested after landing in India could be carriers and in case any other passenger catches the virus from them, they will transmit it to other passengers on their subsequent flights.” Aviation safety expert Captain Amit Singh said changes in the guidelines should have been issued by the health ministry. “MoHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) issued the revised guidelines on September 2, which clearly stated that the test be carried out prior to boarding. Any change in the guideline must be issued by the competent authority ie. MoHFW itself. Notifications have to be communicated by issuing the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) or a supplement thereof, but the MoCA (Ministry of Civil Aviation) did not do so. International regulations (ICAO Annex-9) mandate that a national facilitation committee coordinate all such issues. I am not sure if this committee is in place yet,” he said. Singh further said, “If a passenger tests positive post arrival, there is no standard operating procedure (SOP) for it. Will all 200-300 passengers on the aircraft be quarantined? An established protocol needs to be followed. Passenger safety is compromised the moment a passenger is permitted on board without a confirmation [of test results] as one could easily be spreading the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-days-after-centre-permits-international-passengers-to-undergo-covid-19-test-at-indian-airports-experts-raise-concerns-request-reviewing-the-move/story-o4pELihMvjuexwDXgzegEM.html

The accused worked in the metal market at Mumbai and started facing difficulties since the lockdown was imposed in March. “The accused were looking for ways to earn easy money. Solanki came up with the idea to steal materials from godowns. He was aware about copper and bronze sheets stored at the Bhiwandi godown.

06-09-2020||Mumbai||Don’t let IT cell of a political party use your Twitter handle: Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut tells actor Kangana Ranaut||The spat between actor Kangana Ranaut and Shiv Sena continued on Saturday with party MP Sanjay Raut telling her to use her own Twitter handle and not tweet through the IT cell of a political party. “One needs to use their Twitter handle themselves, instead of allowing the IT cell of a political party to do so,” said Raut. The Shiv Sena and Congress have alleged that the BJP IT cell is behind Ranaut’s Twitter account. BJP, however, has distanced itself from the actor’s remarks, saying it “does not subscribe to anti-Mumbai or anti-Maharashtra sentiments”. The controversy erupted after Ranaut on Thursday tweeted that Raut had issued an “open threat” to her to not return to the city if she had no faith in the Mumbai Police. “Sanjay Raut Shiv Sena leader has given me an open threat and asked me not to come back to Mumbai, after Aazadi graffitis in Mumbai streets and now open threats, why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir?” she had tweeted. The comment sparked a political row, with Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday saying “she has no right to stay in Mumbai”. The minister had said, “Mumbai Police is compared to Scotland Yard. Some people are trying to target Mumbai Police. After her uncalled-for remarks over Mumbai Police, she has no right to live in Maharashtra or Mumbai.”On Saturday however, he refused to comment on the spat. “I don’t want to say anything on the issue,” he said.Deshmukh also evaded a question on Raut’s demand that the home ministry should act against Ranaut for casting aspersions over the credibility of Mumbai Police. Meanwhile, Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik reiterated on Saturday that Sena women workers will slap Ranaut when she arrives in Mumbai and he was willing to go to jail for this act. The National Commission for Woman (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma on Friday had demanded the arrest of Sarnaik. Sarnaik said that Ranaut had insulted Maharashtra with her PoK remarks. “This issue concerns the pride of Maharashtra and there will be no compromise on this front. Ranaut needs to apologise for her PoK remarks or else she will face the music from our women’s wing,” said Sarnaik. Sena workers held demonstrations across the state and key leaders continued their tirade against Ranaut. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), which had on Friday threatened to file a case against Ranaut for “anti-national activity”, on Saturday called the whole controversy as diversionary tactics adopted by the Sena for covering its government’s failure to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. “She [Kangana] is just hungry for publicity and I cannot understand why so much importance is given by the Sena to her. This seems to us a tactic to divert attention from its mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande.

06-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: NCB arrests late actor’s domestic help in Mumbai||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant on Saturday night as part of its investigation into allegations of drug abuse in the case of Rajput’s death. Earlier on Saturday, actor Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik and Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda were remanded in NCB custody till September 9. NCB’s remand application did not mention seized drugs or any other material evidence. Confirming Sawant’s arrest on Saturday, deputy director KPS Malhotra said, “At 8pm, Dipesh Sawant has been arrested. He joined the investigation yesterday at 10pm. He was subjected to interrogation and confrontation with Showik, Samuel Miranda, Zaid and Kaizan.” Zaid Vilatra and Kaizan Ebrahim are both under arrest for allegedly peddling drugs. Sawant was arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and will be produced in court today. Malhotra said NCB’s investigation was ongoing. On Saturday, NCB produced Showik, Miranda and Ebrahim before a magistrate court. They have all been charged under the NDPS Act. In its remand application, NCB said Showik had to be confronted “with other accused who are in its custody to uncover the linkages of network which indulged in selling and purchasing drugs”. The agency also said it needed Showik in custody to investigate the allegations against Rhea Chakraborty and Rajput’s manager Dipesh Sawant. NCB said Showik was also needed to verify the financial trail. According to NCB, during questioning, alleged drug peddler Abdel Basit Parihar, who is also under arrest, had said he procured drugs from Vilatra and Ebrahim, on Showik’s instructions. He also claimed Showik had told him to give drugs to Miranda. Sources in NCB said Showik’s phone messages include one in which he asked Miranda to pay Vilatra ₹10,000 for 5 gm of ‘bud’, a curated form of marijuana. A senior officer from NCB said, “We conducted searches at Miranda’s and Showik’s homes and collected some evidence. The investigation is at a preliminary stage and details of the evidence can’t be revealed at the moment.” Meanwhile, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) questioned Rajput’s sister Meetu Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-ncb-arrests-late-actor-s-domestic-help-in-mumbai/story-UI6g0O2wGKgftOeAiIxxMI.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Showik and Rhea have never consumed drugs, says their lawyer||Senior counsel Satish Maneshinde, who is defending both actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik in the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, spoke to HT about the allegations against his clients. Maneshinde described the multiple investigations as “a complete witch hunt” and said there was no truth in Rajput’s family’s allegation that Rajput’s mental health had deteriorated due to his relationship with Chakraborty. According to Maneshinde, the relationship between Rajput and Chakraborty collapsed because Chakraborty had insisted he follow the treatment suggested by five doctors in Mumbai whom Rajput had met and consulted, which Rajput had stopped arbitrarily. Here are selected excerpts from the interview with Maneshinde: “Showik Chakraborty’s sister Rhea Chakraborty first met Sushant Singh Rajput at Yash Raj Films in 2013. Thereafter, they became close friends sometime after April 13, 2019. She was living with him till June 8, 2020. She was asked by Rajput to leave the house with bag and baggage as there was disagreement on the line of treatment of Sushant’s mental health as he was insisting on taking the illegal and unwarranted prescription sent by his sister Priyanka.” “The doctor who had prescribed the medicines [for Rajput, to Priyanka] had not consulted Sushant ever and there was no online consultation or tele-medicine possible. It is not in conformity with pandemic rules. The WhatsApp messages between Sushant and Priyanka are clear on the point.” “He [Rajput] had stopped the line of treatment and was not taking prescribed medicines. He was, on the contrary, consuming psychotropic drugs regularly. Doctors had advised him to desist from drug consumption and instead take the prescribed medicines. Thereafter [after Chakraborty was asked to leave Rajput’s home], except one WhatsApp message each on Showik and Rhea’s phones from Sushant, there was no further contact. Rhea had blocked Sushant on her phone.” “As a matter of fact, five doctors who were consulted by Sushant have made statements to police that Sushant was under their treatment and that he had drug issues. These statements are in public domain. Five housemates and help have made statements to Mumbai Police that Sushant consumed drugs and that it was much before Rhea came in his life. All of them were already living with Sushant and were hired much before April 13, 2019.” “Both Showik and Rhea have never consumed narcotic / psychotropic drugs. They are both ready and willing to take a blood and drug test.” “Sushant, as a matter of fact, was consuming drugs much before Rhea came in his life. Rhea knew that he was consuming drugs even on the sets of [the film] Kedarnath when it was being shot in 2016-2017.” “Sushant was suffering from the age of 20, according to the doctors. It is not a minor incident as suggested by Sushant’s family lawyers. His sister gave medicines illegally. His mother also suffered from several mental health issues, which contributed to her early death. The arguments of Sushant’s family and lawyers that after Sushant met Rhea, his mental health deteriorated is utterly false.” “Mental health unlike Covid-19 can’t be afflicted by a person coming into contact with the other. It is primarily a genetic problem with which Sushant was suffering [from] for several years and there is evidence to the effect that he was being treated for the same since the year 2013 and that his family was well aware of it.” “It is a case of a person who consumed it [drugs] against medical advice and requests from Rhea. He enjoyed it [drugs] in his lifetime and died. Instead Showik and Samuel Miranda are being prosecuted after his death, which is unwarranted.” “The allegations [of abetting Rajput’s suicide and siphoning money] are false and make no case. Mumbai Police and Enforcement Directorate have conducted forensic audits into the financial affairs of Sushant and Rhea, and they have found no discrepancy in the accounts of Sushant or Rhea. The involvement of multiple agencies and parallel investigations is a complete witch hunt. There’s no flow of a single rupee from the account of Sushant to Rhea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-described-multiple-investigations-as-a-complete-witch-hunt-against-her/story-6HGlp235gf6qQKpF2r8n9J.html
06-09-2020||City||UP jumps to 2ndrank in ease ofdoing business||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh has jumped to the second position in the ease of doing business annual rankings that union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and union commerce minister Piyush Goyal released in New Delhi on Saturday. “Uttar Pradesh has jumped from the 12th position in Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 17-18 to the second position in BRAP 19, taking a remarkable leap of 10 positions. UP has left several leading states like Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra etc behind in this ease of doing business ranking,” an official spokesman said. Uttar Pradesh is behind only Andhra Pradesh now.Uttar Pradesh has implemented 186 of the 187 reforms suggested by the union government’s department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) under the Business Reform Action Plan 19. “This year’s exercise was completely based on ‘User feedback’. Therefore, attaining the second rank across the country indicates that entrepreneurs have been receiving the true benefits of these reforms implemented by the government of Uttar Pradesh under the dynamic leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” the spokesman said. From May 2020 onwards, the state had also started to rank all its 75 districts according to ‘district-wise ease of doing business,’ the spokesman said. Under State BRAP 20-21, UP has already implemented 170 out of 301 suggested reforms, the spokesman said. UP’s reforms covered several areas such as labour regulation, online single-window facility, access to information and transparency, land administration, construction permit, commercial disputes and inspection enablers. Over 20 departments such as Invest UP (Udyog Bandhu), labour department, commercial tax, power, stamp and registration, excise, food safety and drug administration, UP Pollution Control Board and many others have been part of the journey on the way to reforms, according to the spokesman. UP has been able to achieve this top position by successful implementation of the Nivesh Mitra portal. In a period of two years, Nivesh Mitra received around 2,29,936 applications for No-Objection Certificates (NoCs). Out of them, Nivesh Mitra had already disposed of 94% applications to grant NOC/licenses to entrepreneurs, the spokesman said. Nivesh Mitra is a dedicated single-window system of the UP government. Industrial development minister Satish Mahana, chief secretary RK Tiwari and infrastructure, industrial development commissioner (IIDC) Alok Tandon and additional chief secretary (infrastructure and industrial development) Alok Kumar have lauded the achievement. “The chief minister has been emphasising on transparency and best practices in business-to-government (B2G) interactive procedures through the use of technology. Our government has been successful in improving the ease of doing business by introducing various IT driven modules, Nivesh Mitra is one such successful tool,” said Mahana. Tandon said, “EoDB (ease of doing business) is testimony to the fact that the Nivesh Mitra portal has now become an integral and efficient part in bridging the gap between the industrial demands and expectations with the government machinery.” Kumar said, “Maximum approval of BRAP 19 reforms and higher user feedback satisfaction record on Nivesh Mitra portal have played a critical role in achieving this remarkable milestone for Uttar Pradesh. Initiatives like monthly ranking of all 75 districts on EoDB parameters shall further pave a path in attaining many more heights for UP towards creating a conducive business environment.” Neena Sharma, CEO of Invest UP, said the achievement reflected Nivesh Mitra’s acceptance in the industry. The Nivesh Mitra portal has received 18,120 grievances from entrepreneurs till now, of which 17,752 have been successfully resolved at an outstanding resolution rate of 98%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-jumps-to-2ndrank-in-ease-ofdoing-business/story-AyxNhnPVDtHaOBwdvTxMPO.html

However, he reportedly concealed details about his health complications from doctors at the time of his medical check-up following his arrest after the May 12 accident.City traffic police has already decided to revoke the accused’s driving license, as they believe he is not physically and mentally fit to drive safely. Police believe if Sayyed’s driving license is not revoked, he may drive dangerously in the future and may put the lives of citizens at risk.Sayyed, a scrap dealer by profession, was not drunk at the time of the accident. Police are awaiting a report from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) at Kalina to ascertain if he was under the influence of any drug.He has been booked under sections 304(B)(2) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 ( mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 183 (speeding) and 184 (driving dangerously) of Motor Vehicle Act.On Friday Sayyed was remanded in police custody till September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crawford-market-accident-accused-undergoes-psychological-testing-claims-epileptic-attack-ahead-of-crash/story-uTJ0ySv8EYsWdXgOv6udUL.html
06-09-2020||City||Veterans target Azad for silence on their expulsion||Lucknow: A group of ‘expelled’ veteran leaders of the Congress, including former ministers, ex-MPs and former youth wing chiefs, have now targeted senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and others for remaining mute spectators when action was taken against them in Uttar Pradesh. Azad is one of the 23 senior Congress leaders who asked for a full-time, effective, “active” and “visible” party president. In their letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, a group of about 10 ‘expelled’ party leaders from UP said, “It is strange that leaders, who have been occupying positions of responsibility and have been raising the issue of the freedom of expression and internal democracy in recent days, remained mute spectators (when action was taken against us).” They urged her to ‘re-establish’ communication with the party workers. While they did not name Azad directly in the letter, a member of the group spoke about him and the others. Former MP Santosh Singh, who has signed the letter on behalf of the 10 expelled leaders, said, “Senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad called me to know about the circumstances that led to action against us. Azad agreed the state party (unit) is not authorised to take any action against us as we are all elected members of the AICC (All India Congress Committee). Only AICC’s central disciplinary committee can act against AICC members on the recommendation of the state disciplinary committee.” Singh is also a former chief of the party’s youth wing. Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee’s (UPCC) disciplinary committee had expelled a group of about 10 senior leaders when they held a separate get-together to celebrate birth anniversary of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Lucknow on November 14, 2019. “The expulsion of former minister Ram Krishna Dwivedi was withdrawn a few days before his death,” said Vinod Chaudhary, a former youth wing chief and member of the state party’s disciplinary committee. In the letter, the group also said, “Under guidance of the Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and thereafter Mrs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have built the Congress and the nation, upholding democratic values and ideals. No one can deny the strength the Congress has gained under your leadership following the same values, ideology and principles….But this is ironical that a sense of confusion and non-communication prevails among the Congress workers in view of the manner the party is running or being run…” “History is witness to many defeats. But the Congress workers have never been so hopeless and disappointed as they are now. This is an issue of concern for the Congress for sure…..Those who are not even the primary members of the Congress have been working at the party’s headquarters (in states) on a financial package.…. These people now are reviewing the loyalties of such committed and dedicated (leaders) who fought for the Congress from 1977-1980 and have occupied important positions in the party representing it in the Lok Sabha and the state assembly,” they said. “It was under pressure of such leaders that 10 leaders were expelled overnight from the Congress, like daily wage workmen, in an undemocratic, unconstitutional and unjust manner,” they said. Urging Sonia Gandhi to re-establish’ communication with the party workers, the leaders said if she deviated from this responsibility, the “Congress will become history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/veterans-target-azad-for-silence-on-their-expulsion/story-AwK6F7geyayHALhI9iHAVJ.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Migrants not entitled to benefit of reservation in Maharashtra: Bombay HC||Migrants as contemplated under the Maharashtra Caste Certificate Act, 2012 are not entitled to the benefit of reservation in Maharashtra, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) held.The bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni said the 2012 enactment and the rules framed under it, provide a cut-off date and the persons who have entered Maharashtra on or after the cut-off dates, are treated as deemed migrants, who are not entitled to the benefit of reservation.These observations came while the bench dismissed the petition filed by Aruna Kudmulwar, president of Kundalwadi municipal council in Nanded district, seeking review of the order passed by the bench on June 16, 2020, by which her petition was dismissed by the bench.She had approached HC challenging October 22, 2018, the decision of the caste scrutiny committee at Nanded, refusing to verify her caste claim that she belonged to Manner Kapu caste, a nomadic tribe (NT-B) in Maharashtra.The caste scrutiny committee had refused to verify her claim on the ground that she was not entitled to the benefit of reservation in Maharashtra for being a ‘migrant’ in terms of the 2012 enactment - having migrated to Maharashtra after the cut-off date provided in the rules made under the Act.Kudmulwar, who was born and brought in Hyderabad, had shifted to Maharashtra after her marriage to a Kundalwadi resident in May 1987. She claimed that she belonged to Munnur Kapu caste, which was included in NT-B category (part of OBC) in Maharashtra only in January 2014, and since she had migrated to the state much before the date, she was entitled to the benefit of the reservation provided for the caste. Before January 2014, the caste was included in the special backward class.HC on June 16 dismissed her petition and confirmed the decision of the caste scrutiny committee. The bench said a perusal of the Caste Certificate Rules, 2012, demonstrates that the deemed date for Special Backward Classes is October 13, 1967, and that for Nomadic Tribe is November 21, 1961.The bench added that under the rules, a person who has migrated to Maharashtra on or after the deemed date is termed as ‘migrants’ and they are not entitled to the benefit of reservation in the state, and dismissed Kudmulwar’s petition, as she shifted to the stare much after the cut-off dates.She had sought review if the June 16 order contending that she cannot be termed a “migrant” since she has been residing in the state for over 30 years and since competent authorities are authorised to issue caste certificates to persons domiciled in Maharashtra - persons residing in the state for 15 years or more, she could not have been denied the benefit of reservation.The argument, however, failed to impress upon the bench which rejected the review petition noting that the petitioner, having migrated to Maharashtra after the cut-off date, was a migrant and this not entitled to claim the benefit of reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrants-not-entitled-to-benefit-of-reservation-in-maharashtra-bombay-hc/story-39tLYy8G6szVewBUMaCvPM.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||After rain reduces, Mumbai faces heat; pollution levels rise||Over the past two days, the city witnessed hot and sultry conditions in the absence of rain since the beginning of the month. On Saturday, a thin layer of smog across the city skyline indicated a rise in pollution with a sepia-coloured sky during sunset.The city and suburbs witnessed recurrent flashes of lightning and loud claps of thunder between 1.30am and 3am on early Saturday morning. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted the possibility of thunderstorms in the evening or late night for Saturday and Sunday.On Saturday, the maximum temperature in the suburbs was 33.6 degree Celsius, 2.5 degrees above normal, while it was 33.8 degree Celsius on Friday. In south Mumbai, the maximum temperature on Saturday was 33.2 degree Celsius, more than 2 degrees above normal. Humidity level was 90% during the day which dropped to 85% by the evening.The pollutant-measuring indicator — air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 pollutant or particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause ailments — was 78 which falls under ‘satisfactory’ category (51-100). This was the first time this monsoon that AQI was in that category as the levels had been below 50 throughout Covid-19 lockdown between March 21 and May 31 followed by monsoon onset on June 14. However, during the unlock phases there were isolated days when AQI was recorded in ‘satisfactory’ level. Saturday’s AQI was collated from all 10 locations where System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) monitors air quality.Bandra-Kurla Complex was the most polluted location with an AQI of 215, falling under ‘poor’ category, followed by Worli at 149 (moderate). Remaining eight locations in the city either recorded ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ levels. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 73 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Sunday.Researchers said drop in rain activity, increase in vehicular pollution and low wind speed led to higher pollution.Meanwhile, rumbling thunder on early Saturday morning sounded like mini explosions, citizens said on social media adding that they were awakened by the weather activity. However, there was hardly any overnight rain. Between 11.30pm and 8.30am, the suburbs recorded 6.9mm rain while 15mm was recorded in south Mumbai. No rain was recorded on Saturday. “On early Saturday morning, radar images showed very intense echoes over Alibag that slowly moved over Mumbai leading to thunder and lightning with light drizzling, but it faded soon. Similar weather is expected on Saturday and Sunday night or Monday early morning,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.After record-breaking rain in July and August, September began with a break in rain activity with less than 20mm rain over the first five days. “Hot and sultry conditions combined with land heating during the day are allowing tall cloud formation by evening or late night. Rain activity is likely to be subdued over the next week for Mumbai,” said Hosalikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-rain-reduces-mumbai-faces-heat-pollution-levels-rise/story-3Br7vH358MU5E2enpFqwpN.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||In a grim first, Maharashtra sees over 20,000 Covid-19 cases in a day||Another day, another unsettling coronavirus disease (Covid-19) record for Maharashtra as it reported more than 20,000 cases inside 24 hours for the first time. Saturday saw the state recording its highest single-day spike for a fourth day in a row as 20,489 fresh infections took the tally to 883,862. The surge has led to a rise in active cases at 220,661, accounting for 24.96% of the total infections.The state’s positivity rate (see graphic)— a crucial metric that reveals the fraction of tests that return positive — coupled with an increase in new cases,, paints a concerning picture of the virus’s spread. Maharashtra also breached the 26,000 mark for Covid-19 casualties after 312 more deaths were reported, of which, 190 were in the past 48 hours, another 90 were from last week, while the remaining 32 were from the period before that, health officials said. The toll is now 26,276.The high number of casualties continues to be a concern for state authorities as it is still the highest in the country. In the past five days, the state has recorded 1,693 deaths, which is an average of 338 a day. In August, the average was 309 deaths per day, while in July, June, May and April, it was 282, 187, 59 and 14 deaths per day, revealed statistics. State health minister Rajesh Tope said patients tended to wait till late before coming to hospitals for treatment, which has contributed a significant number of casualties. “Of the total deaths, 30% were within 24 to 48 hours after admission. This indicates they came too late for treatment. By that time their lungs were badly affected and doctors found it difficult to save their lives,” Tope said on Saturday.This is the reason why the state government said it is focusing more on IEC (information, education and communication) on the pandemic. With more awareness among people, a certain number of deaths can be avoided by means of early detection and treatment, the minister said. He said that the symptoms of Covid-19 can also be determined if pneumonia patches are found on the chest X-ray of a person. If the same person starts getting proper treatment immediately, then his or her life can be saved. “Considering this, all rural hospitals will now be connected to a centre based in Pune where experienced radiologists will examine chest X-rays on a real-time basis and advise patients as well. This will help in reducing Covid deaths,” the health minister said in Pune.To cope with the shortage of doctors, they are also assigning 2,000 medical post-graduate students on Covid duty as soon as their ongoing examination process is completed, he added.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 2.97% on Saturday. A comparison with Gujarat shows the difference between the neighbouring states is minimal. On Friday, Gujarat’s CFR was 3.03% with 3,076 deaths (101,533 cases), according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.Public health expert Sanjay Pattiwar said delays were the major reason for such a high toll. “We are noticing that people are either not testing after getting symptoms and don’t get admitted on time even if they tested positive,” said Pattiwar. He said apart from Mumbai, most areas lacked health infrastructure to cater to such type of serious patients which has resulted in high toll in the state. “Another major reason for high toll is those who tested positive are afraid to be admitted and hence delay happens,” he added.The surge in cases continues to be a challenge for the state. In the last five days of this month, it has recorded over 91,010 cases and its per day average number of cases came to 18,202. According to state health department, Maharashtra recorded 15,765, 17,433, 18,105 and 19,218 infections on September 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.The health officials are wary that the surge in cases is likely to increase further as a fresh round of relaxations has come in to effect from September 2. The state has allowed inter-district travel by removing a mandatory condition of e-pass required for travelling and allowed private passenger buses, mini buses to operate. It has allowed to increase the workforce in government and private offices to between 30% and 50%. It has further allowed hotel, lodges and guest houses to operate at their full strength.Mumbai has recorded 1,737 cases, which is much higher than the daily number of cases seen in August, which ranged between 900 and 1,400. Its tally reached 153,712. Of them, active cases are 22,978.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-grim-first-maharashtra-sees-over-20-000-covid-19-cases-in-a-day/story-xqhjvLPpy0YtNdXZzTT9DI.html

There will be a central move office as well as the government created a post of director by upgrading one post of joint director of the school education department.A government spokesman said that the SCERT will function on the lines of NCERT, the apex institution of educational research and training at the National level.Though the academic branches have been distributed equally between the two regional offices of SCERT, the academics in Kashmir say that the distribution is not fair as more important branches which help in framing the basics of the education have gone to Jammu division. “The formation of SCERT is a good step. It has centralized the process and will help in research but there is no fair distribution of academic wings. Most important branches have gone to Jammu putting Kashmir valley at a disadvantage,” said Mohammad Rafique Rather Jammu and Kashmir Teachers Forum chairperson .In Jammu division office, the academic branches which will be dealt are: 1) Curriculum development and studies; 2) Population education, girls education, early childhood care education and education for all; 3) Education in social science, humanities and commerce; 4) Teacher education.On the other hand, the Kashmir division office will handle: 1) Educational research, survey and assessment; 2) Education in science and mathematics; 3) Health & physical education and guidance & counseling; 4) Inclusive and special education. Five more branches have been assigned to both the divisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/educationists-allege-unfair-distribution-of-academic-branches-in-j-k-scert/story-XlLESTPIYKAoXjDTPyBheK.html

YAD state chief Parambans Singh Banti Romana claimed, “After the clear cut indictment of the Congress government by its own health advisor for mishandling the covid-19 crisis, the health minister should be dismissed. The CM should also come out of hiding and take urgent steps to restore the trust of the people in government health services,” he said. Addressing a digital press conference, Romana also announced that the party would launch a programme aimed at encouraging plasma donation by calling upon youth activists who had recovered from covid to donate their plasmas to pandemic patients. “The high fatality rate coupled with the Congress government’s failure to upgrade and maintain health services was reason enough to dismiss the health minister. However, the report of the state’s health advisor KK Talwar is an indictment of the chief minister also because the expert has also pointed out the state’ inability to manage containment zones, which was the job of the state police, which reports to the chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yad-seeks-punjab-health-minister-s-dismissal-for-mismanaging-covid-pandemic/story-AeO4Xqke57En8VdMeXYA8N.html

The aspiring teachers raised slogans against the state government and sought jobs.Sukhwinder Singh, state president of the union, said around 3 lakh new students had been enrolled in government schools during this academic session and 15,000 posts of master cadre are required in Punjab. “We demand that 10,000 posts of teachers should be filled immediately and the age limit of recruitment should be increased from 37 to 42,” said Randeep Sangatpura, press secretary of the union.Another body of teachers, the Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF), has opposed the Nation Education Policy 2020 and initiated a campaign ‘Teachers reject NEP’. Members of this organisaton held a protest across parts of the state. DTF members also termed the New Education Policy (NEP) as being pro-privatisation, centralisation, commercialisation and saffronisation. “The new education policy sidelines democratic, multicultural and scientific values and even represents mythology as history,” a joint statement from the teachers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aspiring-teachers-protest-seek-jobs-in-sangrur/story-Gt02AHTqCABXdym3cQ2SVI.html
06-09-2020||Pune||Sans human intervention, flowers of Kaas plateau bloom in the bosom of nature||Kaas Plateau Reserve Forest, locally known as “Kaas Pathar” (plateau of flowers), may have turned into a sea of blooming flowers in the absence of human intervention because of the Covid lockdown restrictions, according to botanists and environmentalists.Pune-based botanist Kanchanmala Gandhe said that the virus situation has had a positive impact on conservation of rarest of rare species in the region and would lead to revival of nature at the biodiversity hotspot. Kaas, located 140 km from Pune in Satara district in western Maharashtra region and home to varieties of flowers, is a world heritage site declared by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).The reserve forest is still out of bounds for visitors as the district administration and the forest department are yet to a take a decision on permitting tourists in the area. Tourists, nature lovers and students visit the plateau during the flower blooming season from August to October. Authorities imposed many measures to protect the nature spot after it became a part of a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site in 2012.Ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who headed the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel formed in 2010, said, “Commercial developments in the form of hotel constructions and ecotourism affected the rich biodiversity of Kaas plateau. There has been a huge rush of people to this sensitive area in the guise of ecotourism and it has triggered commercial activities in the Western Ghats, followed by construction activities like hotels and other infrastructure which has defeated the purpose of protecting the green cover and habitat protection of the plateau.” Gadgil said that there is a need to strengthen acts like Biological Diversity Act of 2002, which empowers local bodies like panchayats to take appropriate steps for conservation. The participation of locals comprising Adivasis and forest dwellers is of crucial importance in carrying out sustainable development in the area. “Currently, the government has taken control over the area and Adivasis and locals, the original stakeholders, have been left out in the sustainable development process,” he said. Gandhe said, “The colour of the plateau changes with season as many flowers, including rare wildflowers, bloom throughout the year. It is natural that the bloom will last for longer period this year because of the Covid restrictions and one can look forward to more varieties of flora in the coming season. Nature comes to its original state if there is no disturbance. The plants will flower with full bloom this time and next year too. Pink balsams, blue utricularies and yellow smithias are in full bloom during monsoons. Kumudini (lotus flower) blossom during October and November.”“As the number of Covid-19 cases in Satara and its surrounding villages is on the rise, giving permission to visitors to visit Kaas is not in public interest. The authorities have not taken any decision on allowing visitors to the plateau,” S Pardeshi, range forest officer, Kaas Pathar, Satara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sans-human-intervention-flowers-of-kaas-plateau-bloom-in-the-bosom-of-nature/story-Eofn9r4n0h5kiiSc06VOEP.html

06-09-2020||City||2 fire at businessman with airgun in Panvel; cops look for clues on CCTV||Two men opened fire with a pellet airgun at a businessman’s car in an attempt to rob him in Panvel, on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. According to the Panvel police, the incident took place at around 8pm in Pushpak Nagar area. The complainant Sunil Gadekar, 36, a Panvel resident, who owns a shipping and logistics firm in Kamothe, was heading to look at a plot. He stopped his car in the Pushpak Nagar area to attend a call from his friend. In the meantime, two men on a bike stopped next to his car. “The pillion-rider walked up to him and aimed a gun at him. The window on the driver’s side of the vehicle was partially down when the accused told him to hand over his money. When the man threatened to shoot him, Gadekar challenged him to fire,” said an officer from Panvel police station. The man then stepped back a few paces and shot at the backseat window. The windowpane was damaged in the firing, but Gadekar was unhurt. However, scared with the gunshot, Gadekar started his car in a bid to flee from the spot. The shooter then attempted to snatch the car key, during which, the remote control attached to the keys broke. Gadekar then tried running from there, said police. The bikers followed Gadekar for a few metres but abandoned the chase when he entered the service lane of the highway. Officer said the attempted robbery seemed to be random as the men may have been on the lookout for targets along the stretch. “Based on the preliminary investigation, it appears the accused had initially planned to scare him into paying by brandishing the airgun. We have found broken pellets of airgun from inside the car. We have made a sketch of the accused based on the complainant’s description and are also checking the CCTV footage for leads,” said Rahul Sonawane, assistant inspector at Panvel city police station. The accused who shot at Gadekar had worn a face mask and donned a cap. The Panvel police have registered a case of attempted armed robbery against the unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-fire-at-businessman-with-airgun-in-panvel-cops-look-for-clues-on-cctv/story-p8Os5IeGuMODplEmCkaw5J.html
06-09-2020||City||Central health institutes stay away from Punjab govt’s Covid care plan||Two Centre government-run healthcare institutes in Bathinda and Ferozepur continue to stay away from Punjab’s Covid management plan even as the south Malwa region has witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases in the last fortnight.Punjab is expecting a huge spike in coronavirus cases in September. Officials say central institutes should have voluntarily offered their infrastructure and manpower to fight against the pandemic as per their capabilities. But both institutes do not figure on district administration’s emergency plans.Till Saturday, seven districts of the south Malwa region crossed 11,000 confirmed cases that was one-sixth of total 60,000 cases from Punjab.Bathinda leads with over 3,000 cases, followed by 2,294 in Ferozepur. Mansa has the lowest number of positive cases at 779. There has been a surge in number of positive cases since the past 20 days. Bathinda reported 1,742 cases after August 15.After assuming office as the first executive director of the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Bathinda, Dr DK Singh had said on July 6 that coronavirus testing will commence within 10 days. The institute had reportedly secured all necessary approvals from the central government to work as a Covid-19 facility. Also, the institute had announced to start level-2 Covid care facility with 30 beds. But none of the two projects has started yet.Medical superintendent Dr Satish Gupta, who is in home quarantine, said he can comment on starting testing and Covid care facilities on Tuesday.Bathinda deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said AIIMS may start 20-bed care facility from next week, but there is still no clarity how much time it will take to roll out Covid testing.Ferozepur has an 85-bed hospital managed by the railway ministry. It is originally meant for the railway employees posted in Ferozepur division comprising of several districts of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.A district official said the railway hospital was informally approached for Covid management but they did not respond.Railway hospital officials said they have not been given a nod from the central railway authorities to chip in with Punjab health department for Covid management plan.“The railway hospital stopped admitting patients for the last several days and even the staff members falling sick for various ailments, including suspected Covid cases, are sent to the Ferozepur district hospital,” said a doctor requesting anonymity.Chief medical superintendent Dr Ranjana Sehgal, who is also in home quarantine, said the hospital is not attending Covid cases.Ferozepur civil surgeon Vinod Sareen said the railway hospital works independently and the health department has no input about the medical facilities they have.“District authorities are roping in the private hospitals whereas the central government’s institutes are not volunteering to handle Covid cases. Bathinda and Ferozepur parliamentary constituencies are represented by Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal, both Akali leaders, and they should push the case with the Centre to strengthen pandemic management mechanism,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-health-institutes-stay-away-from-punjab-govt-s-covid-care-plan/story-MUfJhym1c17Za1e41mbH8O.html
06-09-2020||Mumbai||Next 2-3 months crucial for Mumbai, says CM Uddhav Thackeray during Covid review meeting||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that the next two-three months are going to be crucial for Mumbai as daily cases have again gone up. Many festivals are also lined up, for which proper planning needs to be made till the year-end. The CM had called for two meetings to review the Covid-19 situation in the city with officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), including ward officers.Thackeray said that a maximum number of new cases are being reported from housing societies and high-rises – contrary to the previous situation when slums made up most of the hot spots. Indicating a rise in cases, he also said that the health infrastructure needs to be augmented in the city. “We have successfully controlled the situation in Dharavi and Worli; we were praised for the efforts, but now we have work with more vigour. The daily infections were in the range of 1,000-1,100 cases for quite some time, which led us to believe that the city had reached its peak in Covid cases. However, since the last two days, cases have increased to 1,900 daily, which means we have to face the challenge for another two-three months,” Thackeray said during his interaction with BMC officials.He said that the ‘chase the virus’ initiative helped control the spread. Daily infections have shifted base from slum areas, and now 80-85% of infections are from housing societies, high-rises and upscale areas. “We can provide 5,000-6,000 additional beds in the city, but for the future, health facilities need to be augmented,” Thackeray said.He also stressed the need for aggressive contact tracing, saying this has to be increased to 30 people against one Covid-19 positive person, from the current norm of 20 people. Also, all high-risk contacts must be tested within 48 hours. The state has reported a few cases in which recovered patients are again experiencing health issues. The CM has directed BMC to set up post-Covid treatment facilities. “We need to see if a recovered patient is experiencing health issues because of Covid-19 or because of the treatment,” he said.Thackeray informed that the state government is starting its door-to-door survey – ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ – from September 15. The survey aims to identify every citizen for influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), and citizens with comorbidities. The state will inspect a total of 2.25 crore families during the survey that will be conducted in two phases — September 15 to October 10 and October 12 to 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/next-2-3-months-crucial-for-mumbai-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray-during-covid-review-meeting/story-2JofEXWwLYqyYTAoo25d6O.html

06-09-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport to test international fliers if no Covid-19 negative result 96 hours before flight||The city’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport will soon begin testing international passengers for Covid-19 on arrival, if they have not tested negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours of travelling. The airport authority has floated a tender, inviting private laboratories to conduct these tests. On September 2, the ministry of civil aviation issued a notification to all states to undertake Covid-19 testing of international passengers at the entry airport. Passengers can choose between the regular real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which takes more than eight hours to deliver results; or GeneXpert, which gives results within 30 minutes. The cost of the tests will be borne by passengers. “Any international passenger who arrives at Mumbai airport without RT-PCR negative report and needs to take a connecting flight will have to undergo the test. Such passengers will be given the option of booking their test online,” said an officer from Airport Health Authority (AHO). If the passenger is found Covid-19 negative, the airport will stamp the passenger’s hand and they will have to self-quarantine till the given date. In case a passenger tests positive for Covid-19, they will be institutionally quarantined in the city. Last week, the airport floated a tender, seeking labs approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research to apply for the initiative. Approved labs may open Covid-19 testing kiosks in the airport. As per sources, three labs have applied so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-to-test-international-fliers-if-no-negative-result-96-hours-before-flight/story-jzXsgFNX7Eyz8lo7YhF9tM.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||Woman alleges harassment by cops, police call allegations false||The video of a woman,18, in which she accused at least four police personnel of misbehaving with her and harassing her inside a park in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar went viral on Instagram with over 15,000 users watching it. The Delhi Police on Saturday afternoon released a statement, describing the woman’s allegations as “false”. In the statement, the police said that woman and her friend, 19, had “assaulted” a shopkeeper, Nitin Jain,37, because he had brushed past the couple inside the park while walking on Thursday evening. Police also said the father of the 19-year-old man, who was with her in the park, admitted that his son had assaulted Jain and settled the matter that day. Initially, none of the two parties (Jain and the couple) filed a complaint but when the woman’s video was widely circulated on social media, Jain approached the police on Saturday and gave his complaint regarding Thursday’s incident, police said. “We are yet to receive any complaint from the couple or their families. Jain has given his complaint,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Amit Sharma. In the 14 minutes and 38 seconds video, the woman has alleged that she was walking in the park with her friend when an unidentified man overpowered them and held them hostage. She says that they both pushed the man to set themselves free. She alleged that a policeman, who was in plain clothes confronted them, made videos, and passed derogatory remarks. “..They became aggressive and assaulted my friend with sticks and belts. I was also hit while saving my friend... my friend’s parents arrived...they both started shouting at me saying why I was in the park so late in the night...,” the woman says in the video. The police in their statement, however, said that the accused constable was patrolling Lal Quarter market when Jain approached him and alleged that he was assaulted by a couple in the park. “...the constable rushed to the park where the couple started arguing and abusing him. They even pushed him on multiple occasions. The constable called his senior to the spot. The couple hurled abuses and also physically engaged with the policemen. The woman also threatened to lodge a false complaint against the police staff,” the police said in the statement. Police said the father of the woman’s friend reached the park, apologised for his son’s behaviour and had settled the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-alleges-harassment-by-cops-police-call-allegations-false/story-0ABOkJiXJXdjtcgmuq5rEN.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||Another Covid casualty: Students union elections in DU and JNU||Come September, and universities and colleges in the national capital would usually gear up for the high-stakes students’ union elections in Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University. Hoardings and pamphlets would appear on campuses and campaign slogans would be painted over walls. This year, however, the Covid-19 crisis has inevitably delayed the process.Last year, the Delhi University students’ union (DUSU) election was conducted on September 12 and the polls for Jawaharlal Nehru University students’ union (JNUSU) was held on September 7. Jamia Millia Islamia – another central university in the capital – does not have an elected students’ union since 2006 when it was disbanded. The matter is currently sub-judice.“It is further recommended that elections be held on a yearly basis and that the same should be held between six to eight weeks from the date of commencement of the academic session,” state the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations, which formulate the guidelines for conducting student elections in universities.Dean of Students’ Welfare at DU, Rajeev Gupta, who oversaw the election process last year, said, “Students’ union elections are not a time-specific thing and they are related to admissions. We used to follow a particular calendar. This time admissions are going to start sometime in October and so everything will start once they are complete.”The existing unions in both the central varsities will complete a year this month. In the absence of a newly-elected student body, the question remains over what happens to their tenure. “I think till the time the newly-elected union doesn’t join office, the existing union can continue,” Gupta said.Across universities, the new academic session generally begins in the July-August period. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown delayed the process of admission for first-year students in all courses in DU and JNU. Admissions are yet to be conducted in JNU, which conducts entrance tests for all its courses. In DU, the admission process is currently underway and is expected to be completed by October.Classes for other students, however, have already begun or are in the process of starting soon in these universities. While DU already started the semester for second and third-year students from August 10, JNU is in the process of conducting provisional registrations for the monsoon semester and is expected to start online classes soon.Asked about the gap between the commencement of the academic session for the two groups of students, Gupta said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented situation, the solution to this also has to be an unprecedented one. I doubt if anybody has a discreet or clear answer on these queries at this point.”JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar too said there has been no discussion on the subject so far. “The institute hasn’t even opened yet. We will carry out the necessary processes for the student’s union election only once things normalise in the university,” he said. “The current registration process for the next academic session is also provisional so that we can just start the online classes for students willing to attend.”DUSU president Akshit Dahiya said, “Since we are students’ representatives, it is our responsibility to look at various issues within the community during a pandemic. Our tenure usually continues till admissions and doesn’t end till the next session begins officially. Even once the admission process is completed and classes begin, the university will have to look at how it will conduct the elections.”JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said, “During a pandemic, students’ issues need to be represented, which is why an elected students’ body is required. As new semester has not begun, and the process of ongoing semester is still pending, the current union will continue till free and fair elections are held as per Supreme Court order on Student Union Elections & JNUSU Constitution once the new academic session begins and campus reopens properly.”Elections for JNUSU and DUSU have always been significant in university spaces. Several political leaders like Arun Jaitley, Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury and Kanhaiya Kumar were earlier members of the students’ bodies in these universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-covid-casualty-students-union-elections-in-du-and-jnu/story-QDNf3G9AWbxO1kNklF7yUK.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police map burglary-prone areas in capital||If you live in Civil Lines, Greater Kailash, Hauz Khas or Lutyens’ Delhi chances of burglars breaking into your house are less as compared to the rest of Delhi, suggests a police survey which has mapped different city zones based on the cases of burglaries reported from there. According to the survey, Nihal Vihar, Samaipur Badli, Nangloi and Bawana are the most burglary prone areas. The study was conducted by the crime branch unit of the Delhi Police last month. A team of investigators from the unit analysed 1,269 cases of burglary reported in Delhi till August 15 to divide the city into red, green, blue, and white zones, with red representing the most vulnerable areas and white the least. Senior police officers described it as one of a kind study to identify crime patterns, loopholes in security apparatus, and suggest area-specific solutions to bring down number of cases. According to crime data available on Delhi Police website, 3,026 cases of burglary were reported in Delhi last year. The report was discussed in a video-conference meeting at police headquarters last Saturday. According to a copy of the report, seen by HT, Nihal Vihar, Samaipur Badli, Nangloi and Bawana -- industrial belts in the city -- have reported more than 20 burglary cases each this year  Next is the green zone, which comprises Laxmi Nagar and Shakarpur in east Delhi, Tilak Nagar in the west and Shahdara in the north-east Delhi among others. These areas reported up to 19 cases each this year. Areas such as Paschim Vihar east in west Delhi and Neb Sarai in south were classified in the blue zone where 11-15 cases each were reported. Localities in white zone, three cases each, included Civil Lines in north Delhi, New Friends Colony in south-east Delhi and Hauz Khas in south Delhi, besides most police station areas in the Lutyens’ Delhi. An officer, who was part of Saturday’s meeting, said, “We have identified the problem areas. This was the first step. It was an extensive study of each case. We are speaking to market associations and residents groups to join hands with us and fix this problem. We will ask them to install CCTV cameras or get more security guards in the factory/industrial areas.” “At our end, we will set up police posts in some areas and increase patrolling in others. In some of the colonies such as Laxmi Nagar or Rohini, the residents can also come together and install CCTV cameras, which will act as a deterrent. The aim is to bring the cases to zero. We will also rework the deployment of police control room vans, accordingly,” the officer said, requesting anonymity.Bhanu Pratap Mehta, president of Rohini Joint RWA Forum, said thefts and burglaries were a major problem in the area and they fear it would increase in the backdrop of “people losing their jobs/businesses in the pandemic”. “We have been holding meetings with police. It has been a few months since CCTV cameras have been installed in some of the colonies and for the remaining the work is going on now. The residents are worried that with the coronavirus pandemic taking a toll on people’s livelihoods, incidents of crime may go up but hopefully with the cooperation of the police, we will be able to sail through this,” Mehta said. The study has also identified the type of place within the zones where the burglars struck. The report shows that in 694 burglars struck in houses, followed by shops (273 cases), 71 offices and 66 factories, among other places categorised for the purpose of the study. The officer added that the police stations in red and green zones will microscopically analyse the pattern in their area. The focus would be on checking the lanes, where there are no street lights, CCTV cameras. The timing and patrolling pattern of police vans will also be analysed. A second police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the study suggests that besides other factors the nature of area (whether residential or industrial) and population also play a part in determining the level of safety. “For example, Hauz Khas is relatively smaller and has less population than say Bawana. Also, in places such as Civil Lines and Greater Kailash, the residents welfare associations employ security and individual houses too have private security guard. This helps in overall policing,” he said. “Industrial areas and markets are relatively isolated and have fewer people on the streets after sundown. Plus, there is a problem of streetlighting,” he explained. Former Delhi police’s deputy commissioner of police, LN Rao, who has worked in the police force for three decades said the study is a step in the right direction. “It is good that police are analysing the problems and patterns of crime. Studies like this have multiple benefits. Based on the patterns, the police can intelligence (and crack down on the criminals). This is what most corporate houses do while dealing with a problem. I am optimistic that it will lead to good results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-map-burglary-prone-areas-in-capital/story-aJOE7vTlJorhQiAYktFySL.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||At least 10 Covid-19 cases reported from Delhi lower courts and high court||At least 10 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the last week from different court complexes and the Delhi high court. Five of them were reported from Saket courts, one each from Rouse Avenue courts and the Karkardooma courts and three from the Delhi high court. HT could not independently verify if the cases were a result of the courts starting in-person hearings last week. Five benches of the high court and one-fourth of the courts in each of the seven district courts had started physical hearings from September 1 on a rotational basis. Until then, the courts were working virtually through video conferencing. Advocate Dhir Singh Kasana, secretary, Saket Bar Association, said three typists, an additional public prosecutor and a staffer at the photocopy department at the Saket courts tested Covid-19 positive. “We have been maintaining all norms and have also reduced the number of typists. But five reported positive at the Saket Courts Complex. We are taking all further precautions so that the number of cases does not increase,” Kasana said. A circular issued by district and sessions judge Sujata Kohli, Rouse Avenue District Courts, on Friday said the judge who tested positive, and those who came in contact with the judge, was advised to take the necessary precautions.At the high court, HT has learnt that three court officials working in the courts of three different judges, tested positive this week. HT has reliably learnt that some of them have mild symptoms and have quarantined themselves. Before opening the courts for in-person hearings, detailed standard operating procedures and rules were put in place for lawyers and litigants, with entry into the premises restricted to just one advocate from each side per case. Advocate Manish Bhadouria, member, Shahdara Bar Association, said the footfall has increased at the Karkardooma Courts Complex since in-person hearings began. He said even though the rules do not allow the entry of litigants, except when necessary or on specific orders, clients are coming to meet lawyers and they are being allowed in for the convenience of all parties concerned. “We have to allow litigants or clients entry on many occasions as per the need of the case. Also, clients want to personally meet and discuss their case with lawyers.This is also a matter of our income, which has been severely hit during the lockdown period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-least-10-covid-19-cases-reported-from-delhi-lower-courts-and-high-court/story-GDwtLp10uBXfU7t0wfWKQL.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||UV light disinfection, foot pedals for lifts: Delhi Metro to bank on tech push for safe ride||A lot has been happening behind the closed doors of the Delhi Metro for the past five-and-a-half months -- the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was utilising the time to experiment with new technology that would make travel safer and operations more efficient once services resume on September 7 (Monday). DMRC managing director Mangu Singh said the Delhi Metro was trying out “tech friendly” ways to ease the commute and ensure safety of passengers. The Metro has remained since March 22, three days before the nationwide lockdown, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, was imposed on March 25.In the first few days, the Metro will operate in two shifts of four hours each -- from 7am to 11am and 4pm to 8pm. It will start full-fledged operations, through the day and on all routes, from September 12.From ultraviolet (UV) lights for disinfecting surfaces to using CCTV cameras to monitor work in construction sites and installing touch-free foot pedals in elevators, the Delhi Metro has chalked out a detailed plan for its reopening. The DMRC also was holding regular video meetings with transportation experts from across the globe to discuss best practices of running a mass transit system during a pandemic. Singh said the Delhi Metro is in talks with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to develop the use of UV disinfection technology to sanitise surfaces that frequently come in contact with commuters, especially on the station premises and on trains, he said. “Some of the measures that we have taken in view of the pandemic is that instead of using chemical disinfectants, we are in talks with the DRDO to develop a UV disinfection technology, which can be used to thoroughly sanitise common area touchpoints. Till the time the Covid-19 pandemic lasts, maintaining a hygienic system for passengers will be our ultimate aim,” Singh averred. Unlike chemical or water disinfection, UV disinfectants provide rapid and effective elimination of harmful bacteria and viruses that are present on any surface, making this method of cleaning the safest, especially for a mass transit system.Christian Zollner, University of California, United States, who has co-authored a study that was released in April on the large-scale efficacy of the use of UV disinfection said the light can be used on protective equipment (PPE) gear, surfaces, floors, and within the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) systems. “Many technological advances are needed for the UV LED to reach its potential for efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness,” said Zollner, whose work centres on advancing deep ultraviolet light LED technology for sanitisation and purification purposes. Apart from that, the Metro is also strengthening its internal functioning through the use of technology. Singh said at all its Phase-4 construction sites, they will install CCTV cameras to monitor work progress. The corporation had already installed these cameras at some of the sites, before construction activities were allowed to be resumed on May 3. “The idea is to reduce physical contact between persons as much as possible. The cameras will also improve monitoring and increase efficiency at construction sites,” the DMRC chief said. To sail through the Covid-19 pandemic, many government agencies are also resorting to technology to reduce physical contact between persons, while ensuring that the work does not suffer. When the DMRC resumes its operations on Monday, commuters will be greeted by foot-operated systems inside elevators at several Metro stations. Senior officials said at present, such systems will be available on 50 elevators across 16 Metro stations and they will be installed across the network in the coming months. In the initial phase, this system will be available in stations such as Kashmere Gate, New Delhi, Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Hauz Khas, Dwarka Sector-21, Janakpuri West, Rajouri Garden, IGI Airport and Nehru Enclave. “These foot-operated switches will reduce surface contact and, hence, a safer way to use lifts. When we restart our operations, we will only allow three people to board the lift at a time to ensure social distancing,” a DMRC spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/uv-light-disinfection-foot-pedals-for-lifts-dmrc-will-use-tech-to-sanitise-metro-premises-make-travel-safer/story-4UwTBxFXQMgoke2knbyysK.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||220k aspirants, 24 cities: Delhi University’s entrance exams begin Sunday||Entrance tests to Delhi University’s undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil and PhD courses will be begin on Sunday at exam centres in 24 cities for over 220,000 aspirants, who are in the race for 133 courses. Usually conducted in July, the tests were delayed by nearly two months due to Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent lockdown imposed in the country in March. Since last year, the National Testing Agency (NTA) has been conducting these examinations for nine UG courses and all PG and Mphil/PhD courses. The entrance tests this year will be conducted from September 6 to 11.The NTA has issued detailed security protocols for the exams but aspirants and their parents are not convinced. Ashish Singh, a native of Bihar who will be appearing in two entrance tests, said while the premises might be sanitised, conveyance becomes tricky. His centre is in Noida.“My test will begin at 8 am and we have to report at 6.30 am at the centre, limiting our travel options. Earlier phones and bags were allowed, but the admit card mentions we cannot carry personal belongings. I am not sure how to book a cab if phones are not allowed. Friends who have sick parents and cannot risk their safety, are choosing to opt out,” he said.University officials said around 140,000 students had applied for the entrance to various postgraduate courses while approximately 70,000 students had applied for the nine entrance-based undergraduate courses at DU. Around 14,000 students have applied for MPhil and PhD courses.Sreejith K, who is slated to write his PG entrance test on Sunday, said, “Several areas in Kerala have been declared as containment zones and my friends there won’t be able to appear for the test. I came to Delhi a couple of days ago in a train where very few people were wearing masks. I am worried about putting my family at risk, so I will quarantine myself for a couple of weeks after I reach home.”The mandatory quarantine has become a concern for many. Sreedharan Nair, whose daughter is aiming for a PG seat, said, “The centre in our state is 400 kms away from our home and with a lack of conveyance options, it will be difficult to reach it. Travelling so far to a centre where other students will also appear puts her safety at risk. If she comes back and quarantines herself for 14 days, she will lose out on the opportunity for other entrance tests.” Nair said unless another centre is added in Kerala – accessible to students from other states as well – his daughter will not appear for the Delhi University Entrance Test (DUET).DU entrance tests will be conducted at across 24 cities, including in Delhi-NCR, Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, Kolkata, Jaipur, Patna, Chennai, and Mumbai. There are multiple centres in Delhi-NCR.DU Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said, “The number of cities where DUET exams will be conducted has already been increased from 18 to 24 keeping the Covid-19 crisis in mind and the number of applications received from states. If a handful of students are appearing from certain cities, it becomes a logistical challenge to set up centres there and have enough manpower.”Speaking about the safety protocols put in place by NTA, Bagai said, “The agency has already conducted the Joint Entrance Examination, where they are maintaining protocols and we have faith in those measures.”The safety protocols include contactless frisking and reducing seating capacity at these centres, which will be sanitised at regular intervals. Masks and gloves will be provided to students who are without them. An isolation room will be set up for students whose body temperature might be higher that the permissible limit. Entry and exits will be staggered to avoid rush.The two-hour computer-based entrance test for UG courses consists of multiple-choice questions on topics relevant to each subject. “There will be 100 questions. Each correct answer will get a score of plus 4 marks, each wrong answer will get a score of minus 1 mark and a question not answered will get a score of zero marks,” reads the information bulletin.For PG courses, it can either be 50 or 100 questions. For M.Phil/PhD aspirants, there will be 50 questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/220k-aspirants-24-cities-delhi-university-s-entrance-exams-begin-sunday/story-mlpLyLDaXe1Ex71cN3r7gJ.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||AAP to join MCD workers’ protest demanding salaries, BJP hits back||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said its councillors would join a protest staged by employees of the three municipal corporations (MCDs) at the Civic Centre on Monday to demand payment of their pending salaries. Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, said AAP would like to “give some suggestions” to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including training their leaders on how to reduce corruption and increase the budget of the municipal corporations. The three civic bodies in Delhi -- north, south and the east -- are run by the BJP.“If the BJP wants, AAP can train their officials and councillors on how civic work can be carried out honestly and developmental works can be improved. We want to help the BJP in making the MCDs self-reliant,” Pathak said. Pathak said when the Arvind Kejriwal government was formed in 2015, Delhi’s budget was around Rs 28,000 crore. “The Delhi government’s budget has doubled and is now Rs 60,000 crore. This happened without putting any extra tax burden on citizens. In MCD, the budget was Rs 10,000 crore in 2015 and now it is just Rs 11,340 crore. Which means in the last five years, the BJP has increased its budget by just Rs 1,340 crore,” he said.The BJP denied AAP’s allegations and said the Kejriwal-led party was making these baseless claims to garner support from the people of Delhi ahead of the municipal elections, scheduled sometime in April, 2022. In the last elections on April 23, 2017, the BJP won a majority in all the three civic bodies -- north, south and east. “The AAP should know that worldwide, no municipal body is financially self-sufficient. The AAP leaders should know that in a combined meagre budget of Rs 18,000 crore, the MCDs employ around one lakh staff, providing Delhi basic sanitation, health and school services, while their Delhi government, which boasts of a Rs 60,000 crore budget, employs hardly 25,000 staff,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-to-join-mcd-workers-protest-demanding-salaries-bjp-hits-back/story-4WXwSfVudqTzaGJ1kEfVGJ.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||Man posed as British citizen, duped women of over Rs 4.5 lakh; arrested||Police on Saturday said they had arrested a 33-year-old man who pretended to be a British national and cheated several women of their money on the pretext of marriage. The man, Mohit Tokas alias Vikas, an Indian, was arrested on Thursday in a cheating case registered at south Delhi’s Kotla Mubarakpur police station on a complaint filed by a 38-year-old medical counsellor at a skin care clinic in outer Delhi last month. Police said Tokas targeted divorced women and conned them by promising marriage Apart from cheating the counsellor of near R1.22 lakh, the man, using the same method, cheated two more women in two different cities in Karnataka. Two separate cases are registered against Tokas in Karnataka. He was also arrested in a similar cheating case in Gujarat, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said. “We traced four separate bank accounts in which around R4.5 lakh were deposited by the women he had cheated in the name of marriage. The accounts have been frozen and their past transactions are being analysed to find if he cheated more women,” the DCP said. In the Kotla Mubarakpur case, the medical counsellor in her complaint said while scrolling a matrimonial website for a suitable match, she came in contact with a man who said he was a British citizen. He showed his passport and other documents, which were actually fake, to convince her, a police officer probing the case said, requesting anonymity. “The two exchanged their phone numbers and the man started calling and texting her through a mobile application. After convincing the woman that he would marry her, the man tricked her into depositing R121,900 in his account in the name of starting a hotel business. Later, he started avoiding her calls. The woman became suspicious and filed a case,” the officer said. During the probe, DCP Thakur said, the investigating team collected details of the suspect’s phone numbers that were issued on forged identity papers. Through technical surveillance and scrutiny of the money trail, the team identified and caught Tokas, who is a resident of Munirka in Delhi. “Tokas admitted to his involvement in similar cheatings. He was earlier involved in a kidnapping and robbery case registered at Vasant Vihar. Three similar cheating cases are registered against him in Gujarat and Karnataka. He was arrested in the Gujarat case,” the DCP said. The fake passport and other documents are yet to be recovered, said DCP Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-held-for-cheating-women-in-name-of-marriage/story-46Lbp4lbbi4DLXRov7GDzL.html
06-09-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt’s anti-dengue campaign kicks off on Sunday||The Delhi government will kick-start the second edition of its #10Hafte10Baje10Minute (10 weeks, 10 ’o’ clock, 10 minutes) campaign against dengue and other vector-borne diseases from Sunday. The 10-week mass awareness programme will be launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at 10am, during which he and his family will devote 10 minutes to inspect his own residence for stagnant clean water and clean it to avoid breeding of mosquitoes and prevent the spread of diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya. “Last year, when we launched the 10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute campaign, we were successfully able to defeat dengue by the collective efforts of the people of Delhi and the government. The fatality rate due to dengue was negligible. This year also, the Delhi government will fight dengue by making the people of Delhi partners in its campaign against mosquito breeding,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said. Under the campaign, citizens must inspect their homes for any possible sources of stagnant clean water, which can lead to the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes that spread vector-borne diseases. After the first week of the launch of the Delhi government’s flagship campaign, doctors will be asked to share advice on dos and don’ts to prevent dengue in the second week. “The campaign seeks to engage residents to pick up the phone and call 10 of their friends/relatives and advise them on the good practices of preventing dengue. Resident welfare associations (RWAs) will be asked to come together and help in the fight against dengue and promote the campaign. Many celebrities and social media influencers will take part in the campaign by recording themselves following the good practices advised during the campaign and subsequently share their videos through various social media channels,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement. Children will be encouraged to take part in the campaign by assigning them homework on behalf of schools and asking them to call their friends to encourage them to take part in it, the government said. It said neighbourhoods will be encouraged to follow good practices of preventing dengue and promote them in their neighbourhood and surrounding areas. Offices will be encouraged to follow the drive and promote it. Last year, when the campaign was first launched by the Delhi government, a number of celebrities such as former India cricketer Kapil Dev had joined the drive. “It is because of the campaign that in 2019, there were only 2,036 dengue cases in Delhi and two deaths, as compared to 2015, when 15,867 dengue cases were registered and as many as 60 people had died,” the chief minister’s office said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-s-anti-dengue-campaign-kicks-off-on-sunday/story-E4Z8ftmoVguuXfNrQdgHwK.html
06-09-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: When the Billi Patrol took on the Chinese at the border||The year 2020 has been a year that most of us would like to erase from our memory. It started off well enough but March onwards things started going downhill, soon turning into an uncontrollable roll down the hill. The Covid-19 pandemic has virtually brought the world down to its knees both socially and economically. In India there was virtually nothing else on the local news channels. But, the month of May brought in another element -- the surprise aggression of China in Ladakh. Covid-19 was no longer the primary news. The unsettling news from Ladakh hogged the limelight. Then, in mid June, there was a surprise clash with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army troops where, in medieval type of fighting, the Indian Army lost 20 personnel and the Chinese had an unknown number of casualties in the Galwan valley of Ladakh. Covid-19 was put on the back burner as the news channels vied with each other to cover these events. Memories of the 1962 Indo-Chinese war came back to haunt the people who feared a redux of that ignominious event. The fear of the powerful Chinese soldier seemed to be getting into the mindset of the people of India. My thoughts went back to the year 1967. I was a young officer in a Gunner regiment and we were deployed in the high altitude region of Sikkim. In September that year an armed clash started in Nathu La with the Chinese Army. The word La means a pass through which old trade routes operated. The clash at Nathu La lasted just a few days but the Indian Army inflicted heavy fatal casualties on the Chinese mainly through deadly artillery fire. While this was going on, my CO sent me up as artillery observation post officer ( OP Officer) to Jelep La, which was located towards the east and adjacent to Nathu La . The post had been strengthened with a battalion level force and we were all ready for an escalation. However, the Chinese, having suffered high casualties, asked for a ceasefire at Nathu La and the guns went silent. But now we were daggers drawn all along the border expecting a riposte from the Chinese. My interesting stay at Jelep La started.All the features consisting of hills, spurs and saddles had a name, mostly of animals. Earlier there was a Sikh unit there and they named the main position as Saragarhi. My OP was located on a hill feature called Lal Quila. Over to the West towards Nathu La, there was a dominating feature called Camel’s Back. Other than that, there were a number of other hillocks with names like Sher (tiger), Cheetah, Khargosh (rabbit) and Cub. The most interesting one was the name Billi (Cat). Billi was the name given to a platoon level post which was just 100 metres from the border. The Chinese had made bunkers along the border which covered the complete pass of the old trade route. Clearly the Billi Post was tactically unsuitable, which had been established as a show of bravado by the Sikh battalion. Better sense prevailed and the post was abandoned by the relieving unit. But all the bunkers etc remained intact and that was the reason for the weekly Billi Patrol. Once a week a party of about 20 men and a young officer in command went on patrol to the post and after inspecting the bunkers walked to the border to offer cigarettes to the Chinese soldiers. As an artillery officer, I was not expected to go on this patrol but I did go a couple of times. It was interesting to see that the PLA soldiers located there were big built men, very different from the average Chinese. Apparently they had been recruited from the region close to Mongolia and brought here to put fear into the Indian soldier. As we started walking from Saragarhi, the Chinese PA system, consisting of a cluster of powerful loudspeakers, would start warning us in Hindi to desist coming towards the border. This PA system used to come alive around midnight on some days telling the Indian soldiers to go back home to their families. Anyway, we used to continue our walk to Billi Post. After a cursory inspection of the post we would walk up to the border. That is when the fun started. The Chinese soldiers would point their rifles at us and threaten us in their language. All the while the PA system would carry on its diatribe in Hindi. We used to go and put up our foot on our part of the low rock wall. We had briefed our troops not to show any anger. Instead smile, abuse them in Punjabi if they felt like it and offer the cheap ration cigarettes to them. The Dogra boys could all speak Punjabi and they would smile and let go some powerful expletives concerning mothers and sisters, smiling all the while. The political commissar, who was part and parcel of the Chinese system, could understand rudimentary Hindi and English. So, he would come up to me and ask me as to what our troops were saying to their soldiers. I told him that they were sending good wishes to them, and to their mothers and sisters. He would look a bit sceptical but that was it. Soon we would bid them goodbye with their guns still pointing towards us. So, did we see any supermen on the Chinese side? Not at all! Instead they were just poorly clad unwilling soldiers of the PLA who had no choice but to toe the line. Not like our volunteer disciplined soldiers who would follow their officers anywhere. We had given them a bloody nose at Nathu La and have the capability to do the same now. Needless to say, the Armed Forces have to be given the wherewithal in terms of weapon systems and equipment. The nation has to back the soldier, give him due respect and protection to those he leaves behind should that happen. The nation is represented by the government of the day.

06-09-2020||Pune||50 contacts to be traced for every Covid-19 positive person: Pune collector||In an order dated September 4, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh ordered that the rural administration and both the civic bodies in Pune district must ensure that at least 50 contacts of a Covid-19 positive person are traced. These will include the high-risk and low-risk contacts of the person. The order also specifies the quarantine guidelines for the contacts till the report comes out. The district contact tracing is currently about 15 contacts on an average for the district which the administration aims to increase to 50 which would be effective to break the chain of the virus spread.The Pune district administration’s contact tracing efforts have been slammed not just by the relatives of the patients in some cases, but also by the state health department which said that the Pune’s contact tracing is lower than the state’s. Deshmukh said, “Currently, we are tracing about 15 contacts on an average in the district for every Covid-19 positive person which in some cases has also gone up to 25 to 30. However, now we have set the target of at least 50. Reaching as many contacts as possible will help us break the chain by containing the spread.”The order states that civic bodies and rural administration has to trace at least 50 contacts for every single Covid-19 patient, which includes at least 20 high-risk contacts and 30 low-risk contacts. These 50 people must be tested either through Rapid Antigen Detection tests or RT-PCR depending on their symptoms and ICMR guidelines. The high-risk contacts will be institutionally quarantined at a Covid centre till results are awaited while low-risk contacts will be quarantined at home.Dr Sanjay Dabhade, member of Jan Aarogya Manch, a public health vigilant group, said, “It is true that the contact tracing in the city is poor, I have had this experience personally and also many relatives have complained about the same. Contact tracing is not only important to contain the spread, but also for early detection which will go a long way to prevent high-mortality as early detection means early treatment.”District collector issues guidelines regarding management of Covid-19 deceased bodiesThe same order which gives a holistic guideline for various Covid-19 issues including how to resolve bill disputes, drugs management, also mentions how to handle dead bodies of Covid-19 patients. The order states that the respective authorities in rural areas and in civic body areas must provide free PPE kits to the relatives and the employees during cremation or burial. Around 200 metres of area around the cremation centre must be declared a containment zone.There must be a gap of at least two hours between the cremations of two Covid-19 positive dead bodies. Once the cremation is over the entire premises must be sanitized twice. All the expenses must be borne by the authorities said the order. Deskhukh also said that up to five PPE kits can be provided for the cremation to the relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/50-contacts-to-be-traced-for-every-covid-19-positive-person-pune-collector/story-toPav56WF4IKxsFfuRfYvO.html
06-09-2020||Pune||Unlock Pune: Tennis resumes in the city under safety net on secure courts||The tennis academies, courts and clubs in the city are back in action since the state government allowed it to resume as part of “outdoor non-team” sporting facilities from August 5 under the coronavirus lockdown easing of restrictions. Professional players have started practice, following all the social distancing norms, while beginners are yet to hit the courts. There are 40 tennis coaching centres in the city. “Competitive players are back in action, while I think beginners will take some time. Covid fears might still be on their mind,” said Hemant Bendrey, coach of top Pune and India players like Ankita Raina, Rutuja Bhosale and Arjun Kadhe at the PYC Gymkhana. Not only has practice started at clubs like Deccan Gymkhana, PYC Gymkhana and Poona Club, but also at other centres as well. “The PYC Gymkhana courts are sanitised thrice – before the start of the play, at 3pm and at night after training concludes,” said Bendrey. Sachin Rathi, tennis secretary and committee member, Poona Club, said, “As we are one of the oldest clubs so have opened our tennis courts only for members. We are strictly following all the state government and Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA) guidelines for the safety of our members.” Solaris Club, which has multi-sports facilities, has also begun tennis. “Senior/junior players have begun their training at the club and the number of players is increasing every day. Special care regarding sanitisation of players and playing equipment is taken. All of the players are behaving responsibly and although it is a new normal, players are starting to adjust,” said Ravindra Pandey, who runs the Ravindra Pandey tennis academy (RPTA) at Solaris Club, Kothrud. Parents are allowed to accompany wards, but they have to follow strict rules. “Parents are allowed to sit in the arena, but not near the courts. Once practice is over they are told to leave immediately.

06-09-2020||Arts||Local, vocal and always ambling||Gopal MS (@MumbaiPaused on Instagram) likes to take the long way to anywhere. If he has to step out for a meeting, he’ll leave the office early. That way, he reaches his destination in time to amble around, check out a new neighbourhood, and look twice at areas that many of us don’t look at even once. He photographs what he sees: everyday folk, hilarious graffiti, patterns in unlikely places, ruins, signs of new money and old habits. Collectively his work is a unique record of a Mumbai from the ground up, ever changing and never changing. “Mumbai may seem like one city, but when you start to look closely, you realise it’s multiple cities in one, a complexity that is the mark of any great city,” says Gopal, 47, an advertising executive. In Delhi, HT’s own Mayank Austen Soofi (@TheDelhiwalla on Instagram) captures everyday life, culture, change and people in books, on social media and in a column in the Delhi edition of this newspaper. About a dozen others in both Mumbai and Delhi focus on their respective city’s heritage structures, shrines, trees, markets and street foods. In cities all over India, enthusiasts like Gopal and Soofi are cropping up and taking note of the same kinds of complexity and change. They’re on Instagram fighting to save old neighbourhoods, organising urban-heritage tours to re-introduce towns to their residents and consulting with local administrators on how to best preserve each area’s character. KOLKATA Walk through Kolkata with photographer Manjit Singh Hoonjan (@The.Manjit on Instagram) and you’ll end up making plenty of unscheduled stops. On the back of a bus shelter he’ll point to pasted rows of local papers, so citizens can stay updated for free. He greets tea sellers by name. He knows that a bad storm knocked over the rooster on the weathervane of the Scottish St Andrew’s Church in August. “I draw happiness from walking through my city and documenting the ordinary,” he says. “A first trip is just a glance; keep going back and the layers of familiarity build up. You lose the outsider-in-awe perspective. Objects and areas become touchstones for your memories and connections.” Over the last decade, his company Calcutta Photo Tours, has helped locals take the same delight in their neighbourhoods as they do when they visit exotic destinations. He says he’s thrilled by the new wave of young people, design firms, architects and filmmakers tapping in to the city’s character. “It’s quite fashionable to romanticise Calcutta now,” Hoonjan says. “For me, it’s like having a steady date for 10 years, who’s now getting checked out by other people.” He’s happy to share. “But I saw her first.” In Pune, Shantanu Paranjape and Anurag Vaidya’s (@anny_bunny_v on Instagram) walks around the old and new city have given them a first-hand look at how much the past influences everyday life. “As with all history, the food, architecture, people, traditions and stories are connected,” Vaidya says. “You can only make those connections if you’ve walked through an area over and over yourself.” In 2017, the connections culminated in a book documenting local heritage spots. Now, their company, Firasti Maharashtrachi (Flaneurs of Maharashtra), lead participants through their offbeat trails - spots where certain Peshwas lived, lesser-known Ganpati mandals, and historic markets. “We consult historians and libraries, but there’s more to a city than dates, wars and monuments,” Vaidya says. “You have to walk through a place to get a feel of how it operates, and appreciate its unique character.” BHOPAL Architect Huzoor Choudhry (@TheHuzoor on Twitter) remembers looking at the city’s neighbourhoods with a fresh eye as part of a team that set up the first local heritage tours 15 years ago. His familiarity with the city – the lane with the most pre-Independence homes, where the oldest zardozi craftsmen work, which are its oldest trees – has become a powerful asset. Choudhry now creates signage for local monuments, has worked on interpretation panels in museums and proposed projects to restore the Moti Masjid area down to its cobbled streets. The best research still comes from walking the streets and taking it all in he says. “Bhopal slowly grows on you,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/local-vocal-and-always-ambling/story-5Nr0yKJtTf5U9DCiVhHlfO.html
06-09-2020||World||Trump may be down in the polls, but he’s tops for bettors||For the time being, all the polls seem to be going Joe Biden’s way ahead of the November 3 presidential election. But gamblers see a different reality and are putting their money on Donald Trump.The Republican incumbent, who is seeking a second term, has slowly climbed back since late July to nearly even with the Democratic former vice president.For some Australian and British bookmakers, Trump is the odds-on favorite.Betting on national or local elections is illegal in the United States. All the action is happening on foreign gambling sites -- which Americans can sometimes access.Also read: Trump faces storm over alleged comments on war dead, calls for Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin to be firedA $100 wager on a Trump win today could bring the punter a return of $190 if he notches the victory. “There is no doubt that the momentum appears to have swung back into President Trump’s favor,” said Rupert Adams, a spokesman for British bookmaker William Hill, which has already accepted more than $1.3 million in election bets.Lee Price, a spokesman for Irish gambling brand Paddy Power, explains that after a slowdown in betting activity due to the coronavirus crisis, interest has “started to pick up again in recent weeks.”“We think the Trump factor is sure to keep punters interested,” Price told AFP.Many who have placed their bets on Trump now are hoping for a repeat of 2016, when the Manhattan real estate mogul staged a stunning comeback against Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton to win the White House.‘Just plain scary’British bookmaker Betfair has taken in 10 million pounds ($13.3 million) in bets on the White House race since August 23, on the eve of the Republican nominating convention. That brings their total so far to 72 million pounds, as compared with 33 million pounds at the same point in the campaign in 2016.Betfair is hoping to top the record of 199 million pounds wagered in 2016, half of which came after polling stations closed, explained spokesman Darren Hughes.Beyond the main event, Paddy Power is taking bets on some quirky issues: will Trump paint the White House gold (500-1)? Will he have an airport in Mexico named after him (66-1)? But Price says the interest in those types of bets has waned a bit. “Trump is less wacky, quirky, and funny,” Price says, calling the president’s current behavior “just plain scary.”Matthew Collins, a 29-year-old Australian sales consultant, placed 21 separate bets before the Republican convention -- nearly all of them on Trump.He picked the president to win again in November, but also as the winner of several specific states. In all, he put down about AUS$20,000 (US$14,570) -- a sum he won on a bet that Biden would choose Kamala Harris as his running mate.Collins, who describes himself as politically left-leaning, says he thinks Trump has gained momentum since his party’s convention in late August, which came on the heels of the Democrats’ event.“The Republicans seem to like America. They don’t hate their own country. I didn’t get that from the DNC so I think that their message on its face isn’t persuasive,” Collins said.‘Watch where the money goes’Nick Freiling, the CEO of a market research firm, who bet $300 on a Trump victory in traditionally Democratic Minnesota, says it’s normal for the gap between the candidates to narrow as November approaches.The coronavirus crisis is another major factor, he said -- Trump faced sharp criticism for his handling of the pandemic, but the issue “is steadily falling out of our public consciousness, and people are less angry about things, generally.”Collins said he didn’t believe the polls were “representative of reality” and said the margin of error “must be so high.”For Freiling, “the polls may be of ‘likely voters’ and show Biden winning. But what about voters’ enthusiasm for their candidate (which correlates with turnout)? Trump is winning that battle by huge margins.”“Watch where the money goes,” Collins said, predicting that Trump will dominate his three debates with Biden. “That’s what people really care about.”He noted that voters can lie to pollsters about who they are supporting, which could skew results.Those with skin in the betting game are also keeping an eye on the likely massive proportion of votes cast by mail this year, due to coronavirus concerns -- a potential game changer.“That feels like a situation that could get very messy,” Collins said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-may-be-down-in-the-polls-but-he-s-tops-for-bettors/story-YwOjJqbWRGOZuogtfO5VoI.html
06-09-2020||World||Inside Pak Army’s deradicalisation programme for surrendered militants||A deradicalisation programme launched by the Pakistan Army for surrendered militants in the restive Balochistan province has an Islamist overhang, with leaders of hardline groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami being part of the training courses, according to documents accessed by Hindustan Times.The deradicalisation and rehabilitation programme, started in 2018 by Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa, also appeared to be aimed more at replacing the ethnic Baloch identity of the militants with one that emphasises “religio-patriotism”, the confidential documents show.Bajwa, who was recently at the centre of a controversy after a Pakistani news website reported that his family had created a business empire of 99 companies in four countries - including a pizza franchise worth nearly $40 million - appears to have been the guiding force behind the programme that was launched while he was heading the Pakistan Army’s southern command.Also read: India calls China’s bluff in ChushulAn existing deradicalisation centre in Quetta named Umeed-e-Nau was expanded and renamed ‘Darepsh’, a Balochi word meaning “ujala” (light), to implement the programme. The documents show that the programme has so far handled at least two batches of surrendered militants – 50 fighters who were part of a course from December 2018 to March 2019, and 128 fighters who underwent a course during April-July 2019.While the programme does make an effort to rope in both army and civilian psychologists to deal with the psychological and social training of the surrendered Baloch fighters, almost 20 percent or a fifth of training modules are devoted to a “religio-patriotism programme”, and guest speakers for this included Abdul Haq Hashmi, the provincial president of Jamaat-e-Islami.The Jamaat-e-Islami established deep links with jihadi groups during the war against Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s and was also active in the early years of the militant movement in Jammu and Kashmir, having close ties with the Hizbul Mujahideen. The Jamaat also has close ties with the Pakistani military.Also read: To China, a military and diplomatic messageThe documents show that while the surrendered fighters are taught “rejection of extremism” during the religio-patriotism programme, they are also trained in “jihad, morality, patriotism”.The documents also highlight the mismatch between the overall number of surrendered fighters and the number of those who have completed the deradicalisation programme. According to a brief history of the programme included in the documents, more than 2,500 fighters surrendered in 2018 as a result of “effect-based selected operations in Balochistan along with efforts in non-kinetic domain” that isolated “terrorists/Baloch sub-nationalists”.However, only 178 surrendered fighters were part of the two deradicalisation and rehabilitation courses conducted so far. Most of these fighters were drawn from Dera Bugti, Sibi and Kohlu regions of Balochistan.People familiar with developments also pointed to the similarity between the deradicalisation camps being run in Balochistan and the so-called re-education camps run by Chinese authorities for Uyghurs in Xinjiang. “The objectives, layout and vocational training module closely align with those of the camps in Xinjiang. One of the key aims seems to be to remove all traces of ethnic identity and nationalism,” said one of the people cited above.Significantly, a slide that is part of the documents contains a reference to one of the key issues raised by civil society and human rights groups regarding the activities of Pakistani security and intelligence agencies in Balochistan – the issue of “missing persons” or the victims of enforced disappearances.The slide on some nine points raised by the surrendered Baloch fighters during the deradicalisation programme includes in the first place, “Missing Pers whereabouts be pursued”. The surrendered fighters also called for financial assistance to be paid to some fighters who hadn’t received the aid when they laid down arms.In recent years, the bodies of scores of victims of enforced disappearances have been found dumped on roadsides, many of them with marks of torture.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it was strange that the Jamaat-e-Islami, described by some as the “mother organisation for most jihadis”, was part of such a deradicalisation programme. “This programme also shows the misplaced priorities of the Pakistan Army – such a programme should focus on Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa or Punjab, where deadly groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba are based. But then the groups that don’t indulge in activities against the Pakistani state have always received preferential treatment,” he said. “The Pakistan Army appears to be using its own version of Islam to crush groups with an identity and form of Islam that doesn’t suit them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-pak-army-s-deradicalisation-programme-for-surrendered-militants/story-BoklIk0RosjNmTgZrBJkBN.html
06-09-2020||World||Jill Biden drawing on classroom time for case against Donald Trump||When Jill Biden introduced herself to millions of Americans during last month’s Democratic National Convention, she did so from a high school where she once taught English near her Delaware home.Since then, she’s visited a classroom that would otherwise be filled with elementary school children, participated in a health briefing on how to safely resume in-person learning and met with teachers in a Wisconsin backyard.The emphasis on education is a natural fit for someone who was a public school teacher for more than 20 years, earned two master’s degrees and then a doctorate in education and continued teaching at a community college when her husband, Joe Biden, was vice president.But in an election year where reopening schools shuttered by the coronavirus is emerging as a flashpoint, Jill Biden is increasingly drawing on her classroom experience to empathize with parents struggling to cope with the shift to virtual learning. She’s taking a mostly virtual 10-city tour of schools disrupted by the pandemic and is trying to make the case that President Donald Trump doesn’t deserve re-election because of his handling of the coronavirus.“I feel if Joe had been president at this time we would not be in the midst of this chaos,” Jill Biden told a mother and two teachers during a discussion that lasted more than half an hour on the patio of a private home last week in Wauwatosa, outside Milwaukee.Trump has also tried to seize on schools as an election-year issue, pressuring state and local leaders to resume classroom instruction and threatening to withhold federal dollars for those who don’t. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent mixed signals, saying students should return to the classroom but also noting that virtual classes present the lowest risk of Covid-19 spread.The public appears more skeptical of reopening than the White House.Only about 1 in 10 Americans thinks day care centers, preschools or K-12 schools should open this fall without restrictions, according to a poll released in late July from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. Roughly 3 in 10 say that teaching kids in classrooms shouldn’t happen at all.If Biden wins the election, his wife has pledged that his administration will make listening to teachers’ concerns a priority. She also could play a role in shaping school reopenings. Both Bidens listened and took notes during a virtual briefing last week with public health and education experts about how to approach a reopening without exacerbating the pandemic.“How many times have we had someone who’s wanted to be the education president and is very good on rhetoric but has very little or no idea how to translate that rhetoric into reality,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has endorsed Biden. “She sends a message throughout America, not only of the importance of education, but also the importance of sweating the small stuff.”Sometimes her message is the contrast between Trump and a Biden administration. On the same day that the president traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, last week to blame protests that sometimes turned violent on “domestic terror,” Jill Biden was touring Evan G. Shortlidge Academy, a kindergarten through second grade school in Wilmington, Delaware, where she and her husband live.When Joe Biden made his own visit to Kenosha two days after Trump, both Bidens also made time for the Wauwatosa meeting a short time later. “Joe can talk about his education plan. I probably know it better than he does,” Jill Biden said with a laugh.As part of her multi-city tour, Jill Biden held a virtual North Carolina back-to-school roundtable and has upcoming online events in Florida and Nevada. She will also travel to Minnesota for an in-person meeting with parents and teachers.At Shortlidge, the school year will begin Tuesday, but in the short term, all instruction will be online, which some parents worry is not as effective as traditional instruction. More than 330 of the school’s 369 students are Black or Latino, and 77% receive federally subsidized lunches.After walking through several empty classrooms and across freshly polished floors stenciled with paw prints in honor of the school’s Wild Cats mascot, Jill Biden spoke to a small, socially distanced and masked group of teachers and administrators outside — near a playground closed during the pandemic and roped off with yellow caution tape.The thrill of back-to-school has “turned from excitement into anxiety and the playgrounds are still. Some classrooms are dark as the bright young faces that used to fill them; now we just see them on screens,” Jill Biden said, noting that parents and teachers are “losing sleep” over what’s in store for youngsters this fall.“Americans of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back, and they’re fighting for each other. We haven’t given up,” she said. “We just need leadership worthy of our nation, and worthy of all of you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-drawing-on-classroom-time-for-case-against-donald-trump/story-ylnbQIutx4UxdnesH6obfN.html
06-09-2020||World||‘Black Lives Matter’: UK museum revises perspectives on colonial India||A lesser-known example of unethical practice during the British rule has come to light as part of initiatives to decolonise public spaces and perspectives sparked by the ‘Black Lives Matter’ campaign when a major museum in Scotland revised texts related to colonial India.According to the new Victoria & Albert Museum in Dundee, Scotland, ‘Turkey red’ – a colour used to dye cotton and export huge volumes of fabric to India to be used for saris and shawls – was produced using a substance that was against the religious beliefs of consumers, but the fact was not disclosed.The revelation, as part of decolonising Scotland’s design history, provides another dimension to the economic impact on colonial India of British rule which included crippling India’s textile industry and flooding the Indian market with British cloth.Examples of the ‘Turkey red’ dye and other colonial items, with revised textual descriptions to reflect the exploitation of enslaved and colonised people around the world, are now on display at V&A Dundee, 90 kilometres from Edinburgh, which is part of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.Also read: 1 killed, 7 injured in stabbings in UK’s BirminghamScotland became a centre of cloth dyeing from the 17th century onwards after the Europeans discovered the secret of long-lasting colour of fabrics imported from India and the east. The museum showcases several examples of fabric dyed in ‘Turkey red’ with Indian motifs, with revised description agreed in consultation with experts.Another item with a revised description is the Scottish Glengarry cap with Indian embroidery.Original version‘This cap was probably modelled on a Glengarry bonnet, traditional Scottish headgear that became associated with the dress of Scottish regiments of the British army from the 1850s. Scottish regiments were deployed across India, and in 1848 the Ludhiana Sikh Regiment adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap. It features Kashmir shawl motifs that are now better known as Paisley patterns’.Revised version‘The Indian embroidery and buta patterns on this cap, as well as its form resembling a Scottish Glengarry bonnet, suggest it might have been made by a Punjabi craftsperson to sell to Scottish soldiers. At this time Scottish regiments were deployed across India to maintain British rule. Following British victory in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the newly formed Regiment of Ludhiana, which included colonised Indian soldiers, adopted the Glengarry as its uniform cap. Is this a sign of cultural exchange or subjugation?’Kashmiri shawls with the droplet-shaped motif, which became popular in Britain when they were imported from India during the early 19th century, led to a major imitation industry springing up in the Scottish town of Paisley. The museum presents sketches of the ‘Paisely shawl’ with a revised text.Also read: ‘We won’t blink first’ - UK warns EU on BrexitOriginal version‘The 19th-century demand for imported soft woollen Kashmir shawls led Paisley weavers and manufacturers to develop British imitations. These shawls have complex designs that could only be produced on mechanical Jacquard looms controlled by a sequence of punched cards dictating the pattern. Designing and weaving became two separate professions, the design process encompassing several stages from a sketch to a point paper before being woven on the loom’.Revised version‘This sketch and point paper show how a pattern design was developed before being woven on the loom. The design process had several stages, each managed by a different person with different skills. Once the design was complete, preparatory work for weaving was carried out by winders, warpers, dyers and beamers. Draw-boys or draw-girls worked with the weaver to operate the loom. Finishing was done by clippers, sewers, fringers, washers, pickers and dressers, many of whom were women. By the mid-19th century, French Jacquard looms were introduced, and the Paisley shawl industry became so highly organised that it overtook competitors in Edinburgh and Norwich’.“As a new design museum, we have no excuse for omitting and misrepresenting this history in our galleries…The first step we’ve taken in this process is to re-write a number of object labels in our galleries so that they reflect a decolonial and transnational approach to Scotland’s design history,” says Meredith More, curator at V&A Dundee.“Some of these original labels omitted important details about the colonial context for the objects’ creation, while others unwittingly misrepresented the facts. To re-write them we worked with a group of experts from the Transnational Scotland Network”, she adds.The decolonisation project is the latest initiative of the £80 million museum housed in a unique design inspired by the eastern cliff edges of Scotland and created by the prominent Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, drawing a large number of visitors this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-museum-revises-perspectives-on-colonial-india/story-jhw1gJ8XslgLY8Yawo1bmK.html
06-09-2020||World||Beirut search effort sparked by dog stops, no survivor found||A search operation of a building that collapsed during last month’s deadly blast in Beirut stopped on Sunday after rescue workers said they did not find any survivors.The operation in the historic Mar Mikhail district had gripped Lebanon since Thursday, sparking hope that a survivor might be found under the rubble a month after the blast on August 4 that killed 191 people and wounded nearly 6,500. Seven people remain missing.The devastating explosion of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port of Beirut caused widespread damage to several neighborhoods. The Lebanese capital is still reeling from the blast, with a quarter of a million people made homeless by the impact of the explosion on apartment buildings.The latest rescue operation began Thursday when a dog used by a Chilean search-and-rescue team signaled the detection of a possible human pulse under the rubble of a collapsed building during a tour of streets in the area. Rescue workers used cranes, shovels and their bare hands in a meticulous search after a pulsing signal was then detected by a device.The black-and-white 5-year-old dog named Flash inspected the building several times a day as aid workers removed debris. Photos of Flash, in red shoes to protect its paws, circulated on social media and the dog became a hero to many Lebanese.The head of the Chilean team, Francisco Lermanda, told journalists at the scene late Saturday they had not found any bodies amid the rubble. Lermanda said the pulsing signals heard might have come from of a member of the rescue team.In past days, the Chilean team had urged people on the streets, including journalists, to turn off their mobile phones and remain quiet for several minutes at a time to avoid interfering with their instruments.Lermanda said they will search a sidewalk after which they will declare the operation over. It was not clear if a search for bodies would continue.Two days after the explosion, a French rescue team and Lebanese civil defense volunteers had searched the same building, which had a bar on the ground floor. At the time, they had no reason to believe anyone was still at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-search-effort-sparked-by-dog-stops-no-survivor-found/story-cAouOmqaUtFO8vOY80UyqO.html

The local police have launched a murder investigation.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Sunday television that there was no indication that the incidents were related to terrorism. The incidents between 12.30 am and 2.20 am were linked, the police said, with no apparent motive of hate-crime. One suspect is being hunted.The police declared it a ‘major incident’, triggering relevant responses from ambulances and other services. A large number of young people were in the city centre area that has several pubs and restaurants.Witness Cara Curran told the BBC, “I found multiple people having fist fights... people from inside pubs and clubs came out and started to see what was going on. There were females, males, old people, young people, such a mix of people, it didn’t seem real at the time”.“Working on the club scene for over two years, I’ve always seen quite a lot of fights but it was nothing like tonight. The body language and demeanour was quite different. The number of things that I’ve heard happened tonight in the space of three hours, with the stabbings that have happened, the car crashes and multiple other things, it’s such a huge shock to me”.Chief superintendent Steve Graham of the West Midlands police said, “The events during the early hours of this morning are tragic, shocking and understandably frightening. Please be assured that we are doing absolutely everything we can to find whoever was responsible and trying to understand what exactly happened”.“We have well-rehearsed plans for dealing with major incidents. Your safety is always our priority and that’s why you’ll see an increase in officers on the streets,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-killed-several-hurt-in-weekend-birmingham-brawl-foreign-secy-rules-out-terrorism-link/story-tEbTMliOyf5Ec8bW5kjTYI.html

06-09-2020||World||Covid-19: Speaker wants daily testing for UK parliamentarians||The Speaker of the House of Commons on Sunday called for daily Covid-19 tests on lawmakers in order for Parliament to resume its sessions with a full House.Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he and the Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had ruled out the use of face masks during sessions to further cut down on the social distancing requirements within the Commons but he was keen to see daily tests as a means of encouraging greater participation in person by members of Parliament (MPs).Under current social distancing rules in place, the number of people allowed in both the House of Commons and Lords is strictly limited to control the spread of coronavirus, with some members joining in sessions remotely via video conference.“To be quite honest with you, I’d like to do it daily, not weekly. The problem is weekly testing doesn’t tell you anything,” Hoyle told ‘Times Radio’ in an interview.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“I’ll be quite honest with you, I’ve made approaches to the NHS (National Health Service) and government to say, look, why can’t we have a testing system? What we would need is a quick turnaround of tests in order that we can get MPs in. We’re looking at it. I personally would have had the heat screening equipment in to test temperatures,” he said.The Speaker said it had been agreed that asking MPs to wear a mask while on the benches “really wouldn’t work” as it would make recognition more difficult and be an obstacle to making speeches. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to be keen for Parliament to return to its pre-Covid packed Houses by the end of the year. In reference to that timeline, Hoyle said: “We are a Covid-secure workplace – if we were to lose that status, the game is over. It’s about working in an efficient way. If people don’t need to be here, why would we have them here.” The pandemic has prompted some of the biggest changes to British parliamentary procedure in centuries and many feel the subdued atmosphere with so many of them working remotely. At the end of the summer recess, the autumn session of the Parliament resumed this week within a mixed physical and remote setting in place to ensure parliamentarians can keep two metres apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-speaker-wants-daily-testing-for-uk-parliamentarians/story-7n1hamfZ16G3GMWmCvqDsI.html

Here’s a look at numbers||Pakistan has claimed to have flattened its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) curve despite conducting the lowest number of tests, a point made by several experts within the country and across the world, and opening up sooner than others.As of Sunday, the neighbouring country’s infection tally stood at 298,509 while the death toll from the viral disease has gone up to 6,342, according to worldometer. Pakistan had reported its first case of Covid-19 infection in January.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here According to data, Pakistan reported the highest spike of 6,825 cases on June 14, and since then infections have been on the decline, barring a few days with relatively minor spikes, indicating the flattening of the country’s Covid-19 curve. It recorded its lowest one-day jump of only 300 cases on September 3 and just one death on August 29, according to worldometer. However, Pakistan, with a population of 221,709,593 (according to worldometer), has so far conducted only 2,757,709 tests or less than 1.25% of its total populace has been tested for the coronavirus disease.The maximum number of tests were performed on June 20, around the same time when the infections in the country were at peak, according to the Pakistan government’s website. Post that, the country reported a drop in the number of people being tested for the virus every day, signalling the possibility of a direct relationship between dropping cases and tests.“150 countries have done more Covid tests/million than Pakistan, Mexico, India, Indonesia, or Bangladesh. These 5 nations are now in a DATA FOG. They won’t know the REAL number of cases, hotspots, deaths or time to herd immunity. Drive carefully/humbly through this fog,” Dr Faheem Younus, the chief of infectious diseases at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, had tweeted on 4 August. India currently has 4,113,811 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and of them 3,180,865 people ave recovered from the infection. However, the disease has so far claimed 70,626 lives. As many as 48,831,145 tests have been conducted till September 5. Data for Covid-19 cases available on the Pakistan government’s website varied from those on worldometer, however, the overall trend did not show much variation. It still stands true that the caseload declined as the testing reduced.Critics of the government have said that the death rates have been low because of the demographics as the country has a far younger population.However, the government has pointed out “smart lockdowns” and herd immunity among other factors contributing to the low Covid-19 infections in the country.“Today our ‘smart lockdown’ strategy has proved to be successful and numerous nations are following the vision outlined by Prime Minister Imran Khan,” foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI in late July.Pakistan, which suffered economic losses due to the pandemic, had begun reopening some factories in early April and has since been gradually easing curbs with even educational institutions most likely to open later this month.According to a study “Sero-Epidemiological Survey for COVID-19” conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH), around 300,000 people were infected, showing that the capital city was going towards “herd immunity,” Dawn newspaper reported. The study was conducted between June 1 and June 25 in Islamabad.Major General Prof Dr Aamer Ikram, NIH executive director, had said a preliminary analysis showed a prevalence of 14.5 per 100 population for Covid-19. And yet the caseload came down.The Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Society Pakistan (MMIDSP) also in a statement, and quoted by the Dawn, credited the strategy of “smart lockdowns”, based on input from leading infectious diseases experts in the public and private sector, as a practical way of handling Covid-19 infection in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/has-pakistan-flattened-covid-19-curve-here-s-a-look-at-numbers/story-8S1866WNJ5flkL2v2lOV8N.html
06-09-2020||World||China tries to flip the pandemic script, starring a ‘reborn’ Wuhan||China is recasting Wuhan as a heroic coronavirus victim and trying to throw doubt on the pandemic’s origin story as it aims to seize the narrative at a time of growing global distrust of Beijing.The PR blitz plays out daily in comments by Chinese officials and lavish state media coverage of a “reborn” Wuhan that trumpets China’s epidemic-control efforts and economic recovery while the United States struggles.The drive peaked in the past week as Chinese primary schools welcomed back students with considerable fanfare and Wuhan hosted executives from dozens of multinationals, from Panasonic to Dow and Nokia, on a highly choreographed tour of the central Chinese city.Also read: 50,000 people taking part in phase 3 trial of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine“There are few places in the world today where you don’t need a mask and can gather,” a Chinese official, Lin Songtian, told the executives, implying that Wuhan was one of those places.“This testifies to Wuhan’s triumph over the virus and that (the city) is back in business.”Lost in this retelling, however, is that a wet market in Wuhan is widely believed to be ground zero for the pandemic.China’s foreign minister suggested on August 28 during a European outreach trip that the virus might not have emerged in China.The drive indicates China recognises Covid-19’s damage to its brand and wants to leverage its relatively successful recovery to counter growing international challenges, analysts said.China faces foreign bitterness over the virus and an initial cover-up attempt by Wuhan officials, plus criticism of Beijing’s tightening grip on Hong Kong and generally more aggressive international posture.“Beijing wants the narrative to be: we handled it, we can help you handle it and (hopefully) we’re the first to have a vaccine that works,” said Kelsey Broderick, Asia analyst with Eurasia Group.“That’s really the only way China can come out ahead of the idea that a wet market in Wuhan started this crisis.”‘Absolutely safe’ The fumbling US pandemic response provides a clear opening, said Yun Jiang, director of Australian National University’s China Policy Centre.“The fact that the US is not only not doing enough, but actually doing things that go against American interests, is a big help to China,” she said.The three-day Wuhan tour also included foreign media outlets and ended Saturday.It featured primary-school students performing traditional Chinese opera and ballet, a renovated food market presented as a model of sanitation, and a Yangtze riverfront cruise underneath a skyline ablaze with towering light displays referencing the virus recovery.Also read: CNBG, Sinovac find takers in Pakistan and Bangladesh: The latest on coronavirus vaccineThe city of 11 million -- which suffered more than 80 percent of China’s 4,634 Covid-19 deaths -- has come a long way since the pandemic’s grim early days, when a suffocating weeks-long lockdown rendered it a ghost town.No new local transmissions have been reported in months, traffic jams are back, shoppers cram malls, and al fresco diners gobble up the city’s signature spicy crayfish dish.Face masks sag from the neck or are abandoned altogether.The growing confidence was displayed at a Wuhan pool party attended by thousands of mask-less people last month that prompted overseas accusations of recklessness after images of the event went viral.China countered that the party indicated the nation’s success in taming the coronavirus.“What risks can there be?” asked Wuhan factory worker Xie Ailiang while speaking to AFP.“I think now Wuhan should be absolutely safe.”‘Winter is coming’ But not everyone is taking a victory lap.Many Wuhan citizens express persistent concern over an uneven recovery and fear of new outbreaks.“The economy has really declined. The benefit of even coming to work is questionable,” said Yi Xinhua, 51, who sells tofu from her stall at a Wuhan wet market.Blocks of tofu were neatly arranged by shape and size, but there few buyers -- Yi says her sales are only half of the pre-pandemic level.It’s a common complaint in Wuhan, blamed by many business owners on lingering fear of going out in public and the widely expressed belief that millions who fled the city early in the pandemic have still not returned.Wuhan employers complain online that the exodus has also reduced the local labour pool.And memories of a subsequent virus cluster in May, which triggered a citywide effort to test millions, remain fresh.“Everyone is afraid the epidemic will return, you know? The summer is over, and winter is coming,” said Yi.“We’ve recovered a bit. But if the virus comes back, we’ll be hit again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tries-to-flip-the-pandemic-script-starring-a-reborn-wuhan/story-SxMBDzEowU19ioKLvtAdzK.html

That was soon followed by reports of other stabbings across the city center over a period of about two hours.Police said they believed the stabbings were linked and had launched a murder investigation.Graham said two of the seven injured people, a man and a woman, were in critical condition in hospitals. Five others received “relatively minor” injuries.The site of one attack is in the city’s Gay Village, but Graham said there was no suggestion the crime was “motivated by hate.”Police cordoned off an area in the center of the city full of bars and nightclubs. Witnesses said they were busy on Saturday night, with many people eating and drinking at outdoor tables. More cordons and blue forensic tents were set up about half a mile away, near the city’s Snow Hill train station.Cara Curran, a club promoter, said she saw multiple people fighting in the street.“It was one group of boys against another group of boys,” she told the BBC, adding that “racial slurs” were being thrown.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was “a very serious incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.”West Midlands Mayor Andy Street urged people “to not speculate about the incident” and to “remain calm but vigilant.”Official statistics show knife crime is on the rise in the U.K., where most guns are outlawed, though the number of homicides with blades fell in 2019 from the year before.Britain has seen several recent knife attacks, including a stabbing rampage in a city park in Reading, near London, in June that killed three people. A Libyan man has been charged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-killed-7-injured-in-stabbings-in-uk-s-birmingham/story-AAaapc7TUtQxhGTKzdMNjO.html

Also read: Britain will not be EU ‘client state’: UK Brexit envoyBritain says the EU is dragging its feet in talks and has failed to fully accept that it is now an independent country.“We are not going to be a client state. We are not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws,” Frost told the Mail. “We are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things.” “That’s what being an independent country is about, that’s what the British people voted for and that’s what will happen at the end of the year, come what may,” Frost said.At heart, Britain is pressing one of the EU’s most sensitive buttons – the fear that a post-Brexit Britain could become a much more agile, deregulated free-market competitor on its border by using selective state aid.“More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,” said one EU diplomat.“If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff edge for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this,” the diplomat said. “If, on the other hand, the UK’s approach became more pragmatic and realistic, there would probably be a good chance to save the negotiations and agree on a deal.”Frost said a lot of preparation had been done for a possible exit without a trade deal.“I don’t think that we are scared of this at all,” Frost said. “If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-won-t-blink-first-uk-warns-eu-on-brexit/story-IUGKg6w1NGiJsdfHqFAaMP.html
06-09-2020||World||CNBG, Sinovac find takers in Pakistan and Bangladesh: The latest on coronavirus vaccine||The race to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues on a war footing across the globe. Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union are amongst the frontrunners who are trying to release a shot against the viral disease.Clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer, Oxford University and AstraZeneca, Russian Direct Investment Fund-sponsored Sputnik V and Cansino Biologics have all conducted the phase 1 and phase 2 trials.The coronavirus disease has killed 878,237 people and more than 26 million cases have been recorded across the globe with the United States, Brazil and India contributing the most.Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccines:• Several countries are participating in the late-stage trials of China National Biotec Group and Sinovac Biotech Ltd’s Covid-19 vaccine. Serbia and Pakistan have come to an agreement to participate in the phase 3 trials of CNBG’s vaccine candidate. Turkey and Bangladesh will be Sinovac’s testing grounds for its vaccine candidate.• Olivier Bogillot, Sanofi’s chief in France, has said the vaccine being developed by Sanofi and the United Kingdom’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc is likely to be priced below 10 euros. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline are developing a protein-based vaccine and will start their final stage trials in December.• Vaccine makers will only send their vaccines for Covid-19 to the US’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only after extensively reviewing safety and accuracy data in a bid to thwart the political pressure exerted on the FDA to roll out a vaccine as soon as possible. Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi and other vaccine manufacturers are likely to take the pledge.• Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed - Trump administration’s vaccine programme - told NPR that it is highly unlikely that data on a vaccine’s safety and efficacy will be available before October. He was speaking in reference to US health officials telling states to be ready to ‘distribute vaccine shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cnbg-sinovac-find-takers-in-pakistan-and-bangladesh-the-latest-on-coronavirus-vaccine/story-yxy0D0KDaaPPonfc0h2yvJ.html

Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.Also read| Typhoon Haishen: Japan deploys 22,000 soldiers on full alertThe Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-haishen-unleashes-fierce-winds-rain-in-southern-japan/story-7jxyJfIyKkUkXRIrrSezQJ.html
06-09-2020||World||Australia Covid-19 epicenter to start easing lockdown measures||Australia’s second most populous state will soon begin easing a strict lockdown put in place to contain the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreak, although most measures will remain in place for at least two more weeks.The lockdown is hurting the Australian economy, which is gripped by its first recession in almost 30 years. Victoria contributes about one-quarter of Australia’s gross domestic product, but is isolated from the rest of the country after other states closed their borders against a spike in community transmission.Also read: Kamala Harris says she would not trust Trump alone on coronavirus vaccine“If we open up too fast then we have a very high likelihood that we’re not really opening up at all, we’re just beginning a third wave,” Victoria’s Premier Daniel Andrews said at a media briefing. “We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown.” The first changes, which take effect from Sept. 14, include a lengthening of permitted outdoor exercise time to two hours, and an allowance for two people or a household to meet outside.Across the state, people have been ordered to stay at home except for essential work, medical care, provisions, or exercise. The state capital Melbourne, home to five million residents, has been under even tighter restrictions since early August, with a nighttime curfew and large parts of its retail and manufacturing sectors shuttered.A further easing of restrictions, including a phased re-opening of schools and childcare centers, is planned for Sept. 27. Opening up beyond that will depend on the state meeting targets for reducing the rate of new infections. The Melbourne curfew will be fully lifted on Oct. 26, as long as the daily average is lower than five new cases and fewer than five infections have been reported from unknown sources in the previous 14 days.Victoria reported 63 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from a daily peak of 687 on Aug. 4, the state’s health department reported Sunday via Twitter.Also read: Israelis protest against PM Benjamin Netanyahu as coronavirus infections spikePrime Minister Scott Morrison, who is pushing for states to lift border restrictions to help kick-start an economic revival, said the move to extend lockdown measures was “hard and crushing news,” for the people of Victoria.“The proposed roadmap will come at a further economic cost,” Morrison said in a media statement. “While this needs to be weighed up against mitigating the risk of further community outbreak, it is also true that the continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting on mental health.”Australia’s business lobby has also called on Andrews to move quicker to re-open businesses and get the state economy moving again. “Where businesses can operate safely with strict protocols in place, they should be allowed to open, and people should be allowed to work,” Jennifer Westacott, chief executive officer at the Business Council of Australia, said in a statement.Morrison said Friday that most state and territory leaders have recommitted to opening up the economy by December, although he failed to secure an immediate agreement to lift border restrictions that are hampering the recovery.Australia’s first lockdown, which lasted roughly from March to May, was one of the most successful in the world, bringing down the number of cases to just a handful a day nationwide. But security failures at quarantine hotels for returning travelers and poor communication of critical information to migrant communities allowed the virus to roar back in Victoria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-covid-19-epicenter-to-start-easing-lockdown-measures/story-A6zApmt4LtoJwg8MF3Mb6K.html
06-09-2020||World||Germany to discuss possible sanctions against Russia over Navalny’s poisoning||Germany, the current head of the European Union, will discuss possible sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, its foreign minister said Sunday.Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin.Germany said last week there was “unequivocal evidence” that President Vladimir Putin’s top foe had been poisoned using Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.“We have high expectations of the Russian government to solve this serious crime,” Heiko Maas told German daily Bild. “If the government has nothing to do with the attack, then it is in its own interest to back this up with facts.”If Russia does not help clarify what happened “in the coming days”, Germany will be compelled to “discuss a response with our allies,” Maas said.The crime against Navalny was a violation of the international Chemical Weapons Convention and there must be an appropriate response, he said. “When we think about sanctions, they should be as targeted as possible.”Western leaders and many Russians have expressed horror at what Navalny’s allies say is the first known use of chemical weapons against a high-profile opposition leader on Russian soil.The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Germany is yet to share any findings with Moscow’s prosecutors.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe the Navalny case.“Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it’s calling. On purpose?” she said on Facebook.‘Several indications’Maas said there were “several indications” that Russia was behind the poisoning, in the strongest accusations yet from Germany.“The deadly substance with which Navalny was poisoned has in the past been found in the hands of Russian authorities.“Only a small number of people have access to Novichok and this poison was used by Russian secret services in the attack against former agent Sergei Skripal,” he said, referring to a 2018 attack on the former double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury.The Skripals spent days in a coma before recovering but local resident Dawn Sturgess died after picking up a discarded perfume bottle allegedly used to carry the poison.The Navalny case is only the latest in what Berlin has seen as a series of provocations by Putin that have damaged ties and called future cooperation into question.The poisoning comes a year after the murder in broad daylight of a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park, which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia.Nord Stream 2 German Chancellor Angela Merkel also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the “outrageous” spying attempts.On the subject of which sanctions could be discussed by the EU, Maas did not rule out action relating to Nord Stream 2, a multi-billion-euro Russian-German gas pipeline nearing completion that has drawn the ire of US and European partners alike.“I hope... that the Russians do not force us to change our position on Nord Stream,” Maas said, adding that the consequences of any potential cancellation of the project would also need to be weighed, and that the debate on sanctions should not be “reduced” to one point.The controversial pipeline is meant to deliver Russian gas to Europe, but the German government has faced growing calls to abandon it as tensions with Russia escalate.Bild slammed Merkel last week for comments that Nord Stream 2 should be judged independently from Moscow’s actions.“Vladimir Putin views the gas pipeline as an important strategic weapon against Europe and as a vital source of funding for his war against his own people,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-discuss-possible-sanctions-against-russia-over-navalny-s-poisoning/story-7paJBCyKOISCSlbUaSep0K.html

Trump is facing storm for his alleged disparaging remarks against the American war dead.The allegations, sourced anonymously, describe multiple offensive comments by the president toward fallen and captured US service members, including calling World War I dead at an American military cemetery in France “losers” and “suckers” in 2018.The Atlantic carried a report on the alleged comments of the president, which was dismissed by the White House.But a new twist came in the story when a correspondent at pro-Trump Fox News confirmed that Trump indeed made those remarks. Jennifer Griffins, Fox News’ national security correspondent, posted a long thread on Twitter in which she said that the president had not wanted to honour the American war dead at the Aisne-Marne cemetery in France.“This former official heard the President say about American veterans: “What’s in it for them? They don’t make any money.” Source: “It was a character flaw of the President. He could not understand why someone would die for their country, not worth it”,” Griffins said in one of her tweets. This former official heard the President say about American veterans: "What's in it for them?

It is a disgrace,” he added in his remarks on Friday.Biden said that “the president should humbly apologise to every Gold Star mother and father, to every Blue Star family that he’s denigrated. ...Who the heck does he think he is?”Trump, meanwhile, said no apology was necessary, because it was a “fake story”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-faces-storm-over-alleged-comments-on-war-dead-calls-for-fox-news-reported-to-be-fired/story-GFv6YYZQcp9XodX9pkeN1H.html
06-09-2020||World||Chinese chipmaker denies military ties as US steps up feud||China’s leading maker of semiconductors has denied it has any links to the military following reports Washington is considering stepping up its feud with Beijing over technology and security by imposing export controls that could disrupt manufacturing for a national industrial champion. US regulators are considering adding Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to a list of foreign buyers that need government permission to acquire technology or components, according to The Wall Street Journal and other outlets. They said officials are looking at whether SMIC plays a role in Chinese military development. “We have no relationship with the Chinese military,” the company said in a statement. It said SMIC products are “solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses.” The company said it is “open to sincere and transparent communication” with Washington to resolve “potential misunderstandings.” SMIC is a leader in a semiconductor industry built up by the ruling Communist Party in an effort to reduce China’s reliance on foreign technology. The Trump administration is trying block Chinese access to US technology it worries might be used to make weapons or develop competitors to American industry. The US-Chinese tariff war that erupted in 2018 was sparked in part by Washington’s complaints about Beijing’s technology ambitions. The United States and other governments complain Chinese development plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Washington also worries about China’s development of long-range missiles, supercomputers that can be used in nuclear warhead development and other high-tech weapons. That comes amid tension over control of the South China Sea and other territorial disputes. Washington has imposed similar curbs on access to US process chips and other components for China’s first global tech competitor, Huawei Technologies Ltd., one of the biggest makers of smartphones and network equipment. That threatens to cripple Huawei’s business. Chinese companies including Huawei are developing their own processor chips and other technology. But factories that produce them require American manufacturing technology for which there are few alternatives. SMIC said it previously was granted “validated end-user status” by the agency that would impose the export controls. Such status allows a Chinese company to export US technology without applying for a license for each shipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-chipmaker-denies-military-ties-as-us-steps-up-feud/story-qPEKEHIUKh2eBfVkdorhFK.html
06-09-2020||World||Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen says president disparaged Black leaders and voters: Report||Michael Cohen, US President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, is alleging in a new book that Trump made disparaging remarks about Black world leaders including former South African President Nelson Mandela, as well as about US minorities in general, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.Cohen worked closely with Trump for years before turning against him, most publicly in testimony to Congress last year prior to Trump’s impeachment.Now Cohen is serving a three-year sentence for, among other things, making false statements to Congress. In a book due to be published next week, Cohen alleges that Trump described Mandela as a poor leader, according to the Washington Post which reported it obtained a copy of the book.According to the newspaper, Cohen wrote that following Mandela’s death in 2013, Trump said: “Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it’s a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader.”Cohen also alleged that Trump said: “Tell me one country run by a black person that isn’t a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.”White House Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany responded by attacking Cohen’s credibility.“Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies,” McEnany said in a statement.Trump has called Cohen “a rat,” and a liar, and Cohen has said he faced repeated death threats from Trump supporters.Trump, a Republican, is seeking re-election and will face Democrat Joe Biden at the polls on November 3. At the Republican convention in August where Trump was formally nominated to appear on the ballot, speakers defended Trump against past accusations of racism.Cohen alleged that Trump was dismissive of minorities, and that Trump said during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would not win the Hispanic vote, the Washington Post reported. According to Cohen, Trump said: “Like the blacks, they’re too stupid to vote for Trump.”Cohen is serving time for tax evasion, false statements and campaign finance violations, the last related to payments to silence women who alleged affairs with Trump before the 2016 presidential election.He was released to home confinement in May given the risks of catching Covid-19 in prison, but then was briefly imprisoned again in July. A federal judge then ruled Cohen had been subjected to retaliation for planning to publish his book, and ordered him released again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-says-president-disparaged-black-leaders-and-voters-report/story-YWE0VspUluCkSN3JwiCxFK.html

He also held bilateral talks with his counterparts from Russia, China and the Central Asian countries. “Had a very fruitful meeting with Iranian defence minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami in Tehran.

The meeting between the two ministers took place in a “cordial and warm atmosphere,” it said, adding that the leaders emphasised upon the age-old cultural, linguistic and civilisational ties between India and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-discusses-bilateral-ties-regional-security-with-iranian-counterpart/story-qx0qqS230bhWmEdSjkGV5M.html

West Midlands Police said officials are at the crime scene in the Arcadian and Snowhill areas of Birmingham from where reports of stabbing are coming in. Emergency services are working together to provide medical care to the injured, they said.According to the police, they were informed about the stabbing incidents in Birmingham city centre around 12:30am and a number of other stabbings were repored in the area shortly after.“We are aware of a number of injured people, but at the moment we are not in a position to say how many or how serious. However, all emergency services are working together at the scene, and making sure that those who are injured receive medical care,” the department tweeted.People have been asked to stay away from the area, they said without divulging more details. “Our officers are on the scene and we’re asking people to stay away from the area until further notice. More info as we get it,” it added in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-people-stabbed-in-uk-s-birmingham-say-police/story-cE4BencSzdDNCgqJwJ7wVP.html
06-09-2020||World||Images suggest North Korea may be preparing launch of submarine missile: Report||Satellite imagery of a North Korean shipyard shows activity suggestive of preparations for a test of a medium-range submarine-launched ballistic missile, a US think tank reported on Friday.The Center for Strategic and International Studies said the images it published on its website of North Korea’s Sinpo shipyard showed several vessels within a secure boat basin, one of which resembled vessels previously used to tow a submersible test stand barge out to sea.It said the activity was “suggestive, but not conclusive, of preparations for an upcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine launched ballistic missile from the submersible test stand barge.” North Korea said last October it had successfully test-fired a Pukguksong-3, a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), from the sea as part of efforts to contain external threats and bolster self-defense.That launch was seen by analysts as the most provocative by North Korea since it entered dialogue with the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs in 2018. North Korea has suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests since 2017, but efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade it to give up its nuclear and missile programs have achieved little.Trump is seeking reelection in November and a North Korean missile test before that would highlight the lack of progress despite Trump’s unprecedented meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.There was no immediate comment from the State Department or the Pentagon on the CSIS report.At news conference earlier on Friday, Trump hailed his relationship with North Korea, saying that when he was elected people had predicted he would be at war with the country within a week.“In the meantime, we’ve gotten along with them. We didn’t get to war,” he said.Trump has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea since 2017 as a success from his diplomacy and has sought to play down numerous shorter-range tests in the period.“North Korea already tested a PKS-3 SLBM last October. And it didn’t cross Trump’s redline then, and is unlikely to this time. Trump won’t care,” Vipin Narang, a non-proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter.South Korea’s military said the Pukguksong-3 tested last year flew 450 km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 910 km (565 miles) and would have had a range of about 1,300 km (800 miles) on a standard trajectory.News of the activity at Sinpo comes amid signs that North Korea may be preparing for a major military parade in October, which some analysts believe could be used to show off new missiles as the country has done at such events in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/images-suggest-north-korea-may-be-preparing-launch-of-submarine-missile-report/story-KFq8IvFCLnrZ8bZLcboShP.html
06-09-2020||World||Pakistani woman journalist allegedly shot dead by husband||A woman journalist was shot dead at her home in Turbat area of Balochistan’s Kech district on Saturday evening allegedly by her husband, police said.This is the latest incident in a series of gruesome examples of domestic violence in Pakistan.The victim - Shaheena Shaheen, was a local anchorperson at PTV and editor of a local magazine. She was also a student of fine arts at the University Of Balochistan. It is believed her husband killed Shaheen because she was becoming famous in her area, a conservative part of Balochistan.In a report compiled in 2018, it was estimated that 50 people, including 30 women, had been killed in the name of honour in Balochistan.The report was compiled by The Aurat Foundation — a non-governmental organisation — working for protection of the rights of women and shared with the public at a press conference in Quetta, the provincial capital.According to programme officer Muhammad Ashfaq Mengal, the victims were mostly killed by close relatives, including husbands, brothers and other relatives in the name of so-called honour and small family feuds.This seems to be the case behind the death of Shaheen as well. “The killing was the result of domestic violence,” Kech superintendent of police Najeebullah Pandrani said, adding that police were investigating the murder.He said no arrests had been made so far. However, Shaheen’s family lodged a first information report (FIR) against her husband, whom she married five months ago. Her body was shifted to her residence for burial, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-woman-journalist-in-balochistan-allegedly-shot-dead-by-husband/story-QgUF1ddyrdRs9CSfDJRGgN.html

Dozens of injured worshipers are still receiving medical treatment, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.The explosion occurred on the evening of Friday as people gathered in the mosque for the evening prayer.According to preliminary data from Narayanganj Fire Service’s deputy assistant director Abdullah Al Arefin, as quoted in the report, gas leaked out from underground pipes and accumulated inside the mosque and then detonated “due to sparks when someone tried to switch [one of the six] air conditioners or fans on or off.”There was a 7-year-old child among the deceased, according to the report.More than 15 people are reportedly still being treated from burns and other injuries at the Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. All of them are in critical condition, Partha Shangkar Paul, a resident doctor at the institute, was cited in the report as saying.The local fire department and police have launched an investigation into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-gas-explosion-in-bangladesh-mosque-rises-to-21/story-AMX1fzjqMeTja5vlKWSajP.html
06-09-2020||World||‘Hands off the children’: masked men arrest protesting Belarusian students||Masked security agents dragged students off the streets and bundled them into vans as new protests broke out against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday on the fourth weekend since his disputed re-election. Up to 30 people were detained for taking part in unsanctioned protests, Russian news agency TASS quoted the Minsk police as saying. Draped in red-and-white opposition flags, students staged protests in several places in the capital, including outside the Minsk State Linguistic Institute where police had arrested five people on Friday, local media footage showed. Elsewhere masked men dragged away students who had gathered at an eatery in Karl Marx Street in the centre of Minsk, while some of the protesters shouted “tribunal!”, according to footage shown by news outlet TUT.BY.Thousands of women later held a separate march through Minsk in the afternoon, shouting “hands off the children” as one of their slogans. One woman went up to masked security forces standing in a line, showing them pictures of protesters with bruises on their bodies. The government has previously denied abusing detainees after many come out of prison following the election complaining of punishment beatings.Protesters later converged on a Catholic church in Independence Square, with hundreds crammed inside for a service, in solidarity with Minsk’s archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz who was barred from re-entering Belarus on Monday.After the service finished, priests and protesters marched in a procession around the building known as the Red Church and said prayers on the square, with hundreds of people shining their phones as flashlights.A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko has struggled to contain a wave of mass protests and strikes since he won a sixth term at an election last month that opponents say was rigged. He denies electoral fraud. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, his main challenger who fled into exile two days after the election, will travel to Warsaw to meet the Polish prime minister next week. A member of her campaign team and a senior member of the opposition Coordination Council, Olga Kovalkova, on Saturday also arrived in the Polish capital fearing she would be arrested again if she remained in Belarus.Lukashenko has previously dismissed the coronavirus pandemic as a “psychosis” that could be tackled by drinking vodka and taking saunas. But on Saturday he appeared to chide the protesters for spreading the disease. “We stagger through the streets, rubbing against each other,” he said at a televised government meeting.“Where’s the social distancing and so on in that? We’re doing everything we can to delay the moment when we say goodbye to this disease. That’s unacceptable.” Thousands took part in protests that coincided with the start of the school year on Tuesday. At the Minsk State Linguistic Institute, students sang “Do you hear the people sing”, a protest anthem from the musical “Les Miserables”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hands-off-the-children-masked-men-arrest-protesting-belarusian-students/story-6LGItvzjqbjyqD1d3jfKrM.html
06-09-2020||World||Britain will not be EU ‘client state’: UK Brexit envoy||Britain will not become “a client state” under the terms of any post-Brexit trade deal struck with the European Union, the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost insisted late on Saturday.Ahead of an eighth and final round of scheduled talks with the EU next week, Frost said Britain was “not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws”.“We are not going to be a client state,” he told the Mail on Sunday in a rare newspaper interview, as the stalled negotiations with the bloc near their conclusion.“We are not going to accept provisions that give them control over our money or the way we can organise things here in the UK and that should not be controversial,” Frost added. “That’s what being an independent country is about, that’s what the British people voted for and that’s what will happen at the end of the year, come what may.”Britain formally left the EU in January, nearly four years after a landmark referendum to end almost 50 years of European integration.But it remains bound by EU rules until the end of this year as both sides try to thrash out the terms of their future relationship.The talks have become gridlocked over several issues, including so-called level playing field provisions and state aid as well as fisheries. Time is running out for both sides to reach agreement, given the need for the deal and legal texts to be scrutinised by member states and ratified by the European parliament.The deadlock has heightened fears of a no-deal Brexit after December 31, when much of the trade between Britain and the bloc could revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and tariffs.However, Frost insisted Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his senior ministers are not “scared” of such a scenario.“If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada’s, great. If we can’t, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that,” he said.Referring to several years of prior negotiations, Frost said the previous UK government led by ex-premier Theresa May “had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments” during Brexit talks -- a mistake they would not be making.“A lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-will-not-be-eu-client-state-uk-brexit-envoy/story-WDK4n0ny8OWVKqldmlt6TP.html
06-09-2020||World||‘No signs of life’ in Beirut rubble after three-day search for blast survivors||Rescue workers digging through the rubble of a Beirut building for the third day on Saturday said there was no longer hope of finding someone alive more than a month after a massive port explosion shattered Lebanon’s capital.About 50 rescue workers and volunteers, including a specialist team from Chile, had worked for three days to locate anyone after sensors on Thursday detected signs of breathing and heat. “Technically speaking, there are no signs of life,” Francisco Lermanta, the head of volunteer rescue group Topos Chile, said in a news conference on Saturday evening, adding that rescuers had combed 95% of the building. The signs of life detected in the past two days, Lermanta said, were breaths of fellow rescuers already inside the building picked up by their sensitive equipment. He said efforts would now focus on clearing the rubble and finding remains.“We never stop with even one percent of hope,” Lermanta said, of finding a body. “We never stop until the job is done.”The Aug. 4 blast killed about 190 people, injured 6,000 more, and devastated whole neighbourhoods. The authorities held ceremonies on Friday to mark a month since the explosion tore into a city already reeling from a crippling economic crisis.Rescue efforts dominated local and social media, as the Lebanese were transfixed, desperate for a miracle. None came. The ruined building where the search was continuing lies between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, among the hardest hit areas by the blast and home to many old buildings that crumbled as the shockwave ripped through. Work was slow, rescue workers said earlier in the day, as the badly damaged building was at risk of complete collapse. “The building is really crumbling, it’s scary and there’s a lot of danger to the team,” Abou Moussa said. Workers used shovels and their hands to dig, while mechanical diggers and a crane lifted heavy debris. Scanning equipment was also used to create 3D images of the wrecked building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-signs-of-life-in-beirut-rubble-after-three-day-search-for-blast-survivors/story-ezpGWZxdnykDcNTuLLtGPP.html
06-09-2020||World||NY attorney general to form grand jury after Prude death||New York’s attorney general on Saturday moved to form a grand jury to investigate the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after being hooded and held down by Rochester police earlier this year.“The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish,” Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement about Prude’s death, which has sparked nightly protests and calls for reform. She said the grand jury would be part of an “exhaustive investigation.”Prude’s death after his brother called for help for his erratic behavior in March has roiled New York’s third-largest city since video of the encounter was made public earlier this week, with protesters demanding more accountability for how it happened and legislation to change how authorities respond to mental health emergencies.“This is just the beginning,” Ashley Gantt, a protest organizer, said by email after James’ announcement. “We will not be stopped in our quest for truth and justice.”Protesters gathered Saturday for a fourth night on the street where Prude, naked and handcuffed, was held face-down as snow fell. Policy body camera video shows officers covering Prude’s head with a “spit hood,” designed to protect police from bodily fluids, then pressing his face into the pavement for two minutes.Prude died March 30 after he was taken off life support.The Monroe County medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” Excited delirium and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or PCP, were contributing factors, the report said.A police internal affairs investigation cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing, concluding in April that their “actions and conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and consistent with their training.”James’ office opened its investigation the same month. Under New York law, deaths of unarmed people in police custody are often turned over to the attorney general’s office, rather than handled by local officials.Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier this week called on James to expedite the probe.“Today, I applaud Attorney General Tish James for taking swift, decisive action in empaneling a grand jury,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Justice delayed is justice denied and the people of New York deserve the truth.”Advocates say Prude’s death and the actions of the seven now-suspended Rochester police officers demonstrate how police are ill-equipped to deal with people suffering mental problems.Having police respond can be a “recipe for disaster,” The National Alliance on Mental Illness said in a statement Friday.Prude’s death “is yet another harrowing tragedy, but a story not unfamiliar to us,” the advocacy group said. “People in crisis deserve help, not handcuffs.”Stanley Martin, an organizer of Free the People Rochester, told reporters: “We do not need violent workers with guns to respond to mental health crises.”Activists have marched nightly in the city of 210,000 on Lake Ontario since the police body camera footage of the encounter with Prude were released by his family Wednesday.Friday night’s protest resulted in 11 arrests, police said. As they had the night before, officers doused activists at police headquarters with a chemical spray to drive them from barricades around the building.As the night wore on, demonstrators were pushed further back, as police fired what appeared to be pepper balls. Fireworks were shot off and a bus stop was set on fire.Prude’s family has said he appeared to be spiraling into crisis in the hours before his encounter with police.“You’re trying to kill me!” the 41-year-old man is heard saying.A police union has defended the officers involved in the encounter, saying they were strictly following department training and protocols, including using the mesh hood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-attorney-general-to-form-grand-jury-after-prude-death/story-Ywly9fLhpjXGxj9BDB6gSJ.html

06-09-2020||World||‘No sign of life’ in search for Beirut blast survivor||Rescue workers said Saturday there was no longer any sign of life in a collapsed Beirut building, dashing hopes raised by sensor readings showing a pulse beneath the rubble from last month’s blast.The cataclysmic August 4 explosion in the port of Beirut killed at least 191 people, making it Lebanon’s deadliest peacetime disaster. One month on, seven people are still listed as missingOn Wednesday night, a sniffer dog deployed by Chilean rescuers detected a scent beneath a collapsed building in the heavily damaged Gemmayzeh neighbourhood adjacent to the port.High-tech sensors confirmed an apparent heartbeat and rescue teams took up the search.But after three days’ work removing piles of masonry, Chilean rescue specialist Francesco Lermanda late Saturday said there was no longer any sign of life under the rubble.“Sadly today we can say that technically we have no sign of life inside the building,” he told the media.Two female rescue workers on Saturday slipped through a final tunnel to check for any victim in the last air pocket where there could possibly be but found nobody there, he said.Work would however continue to make the zone secure and ensure there was no possiblity of any victim being left inside, Lermanda said.In the afternoon, engineer Riyadh al-Assad had said the workers had cleared two layers of rubble and reached a stairway, where they found no-one.The civil defence agency’s operations director, George Abou Moussa, in the morning said the chances of finding someone alive were “very low”. But civil defence officer Qassem Khater said his team was determined not to give up.“We are not leaving the site until we’ve finished going through the rubble, even if a new building collapse threatens,” he said.Chilean specialist Walter Munoz in the morning had put the chances of finding a survivor at “two percent”.Lebanese officials had played down the chances of anyone surviving so long beneath the rubble.But even the faint hope of a miracle caught the imagination of a country already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.“I was not aware I needed a miracle that much. Please God, give Beirut this miracle it deserves,” said Selim Mourad, a 32-year-old film-maker.Lebanon lacks the tools and expertise to handle advanced search and rescue operations, so they have been supported by experts from Chile, France and the Unites States.The Chileans, in particular, have been praised as heroes by many Lebanese on social media, who have compared their expertise with the lacklustre performance of what they see as their own absent state.The country observed a minute’s silence for the dead on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-sign-of-life-in-search-for-beirut-blast-survivor/story-mxCYCYyICujZHzh86YUZwI.html

More than 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of ice cubes were needed to fill up the box, after Koeberl stepped inside wearing nothing but swim trunks.In order to fight the “wave of pain” caused by the freezing temperatures, Koeberl says he was trying to focus on positive emotions.“I’m fighting the pain by visualizing and drawing on positive emotions so I can dampen this wave of pain,” Koeberl told reporters. “That way I can endure.”A small crowd of people watched on as Koeberl beat his own record from 2019 by 30 minutes on the town square of Melk in Lower Austria.After being taken out of the ice box by helpers he said that the sun felt “really great” on his back.Koeberl is planning to beat his own record one more time — next year in Los Angeles. His team said that Koeberl’s personal record is also the current world record when it comes to exposing the body to ice for as long as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austrian-man-spends-2-5-hours-in-box-filled-with-ice-cubes-breaks-his-own-record/story-ufZhKuOrFZBhjMmtCCNwCJ.html
06-09-2020||World||Facebook blocks ailing man’s planned end-of-life broadcasts||Facebook on Saturday blocked live broadcasts from a chronically ill bed-ridden man who appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron for a medically-assisted death and who wanted to show what he expects will be a painful end to his life after he announced that he was stopping all food and drink.Prostrate on his bed, Alain Cocq posted video of himself Friday after taking what he said would be his last liquid meal.“I know the days ahead are going to be very difficult,” he said. “But I have taken my decision and I am serene.” In a letter this week, which Cocq also posted, Macron said that French law forbade him from granting his request for the “right to leave with dignity,” with a medically-assisted death.“With emotion, I respect your approach because it speaks to the very intimate relationship that each of us builds with the end of our life and our death,” Macron said in the letter dated Thursday, sent after one of his aides spoke at length with Cocq by telephone in August.But Macron added that “because I am not above the law, I am not in a position to grant your request.” In a handwritten addition at the end, Macron signed off the letter with the words, “With all of my personal support and my profound respect.” French media have reported that Cocq, a 57-year-old former plumber, suffers from a long-term and incurable degenerative illness. He says that he has lived in great pain for 34 years and that after multiple operations, he prefers to die. In his Facebook post on Friday evening, he said the alternative would be “the degradation of my body.” “I am going to stop hydrating myself when I turn off the lights,” he said. “Given my general condition, it’s likely to be quick, which is what I hope for, because I’m not a masochist.” He said he would keep taking painkillers.“The path to my deliverance is starting and, believe me, I am happy about it,” he said. “To those I won’t see again, I say goodbye. Such is life.” Cocq had planned to subsequently live-broadcast the end of his life that he expects will follow within days of his decision to stop all food, liquids and medicines. But a message Saturday on Cocq’s account said that Facebook has blocked him from posting videos until Tuesday.Facebook confirmed that it had blocked Cocq’s live broadcasts.“Our hearts go out to Alain Cocq and those who are affected by this sad situation,” it said in a statement. “While we respect his decision to draw attention to this complex and difficult issue, based on the guidance of experts, we have taken steps to keep Alain from broadcasting live, as we do not allow the depiction of suicide attempts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-blocks-ailing-man-s-planned-end-of-life-broadcasts/story-oYloGac78nhzhwmt9RGHPO.html
06-09-2020||World||Israelis protest against PM Benjamin Netanyahu as coronavirus infections spike||Thousands of Israelis gathered outside the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem on Saturday despite record levels of coronavirus infections, calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to resign because he is on trial for corruption charges.The protesters held banners reading “Revolution” and “Citizens Write the Constitution” as they marched toward Netanyahu’s residence. A sign aimed at the prime minister was projected on a building reading in Hebrew: “Enough with you.”The government’s missteps in handling the coronavirus crisis after relative success in its early stages have mostly fueled the summer-long weekend demonstrations. The death toll has surpassed 1,000 and the country is mulling a new lockdown to stop the rapid spike in daily infections. Israel currently has over 26,000 active Covid-19 patients.Police have clashed with protesters on several occasions and used water cannons to clear them off main streets and squares, though in recent weeks the gatherings have been calmer but larger.On Friday, a police spokesman said they had arrested a man who was “dressed up as a woman in a provocative way.” An Associated Press photographer saw police arresting at least five people.Netanyahu’s achievements on the external foreign policy do not seem to stand by his side at home.On Friday, Serbia and Kosovo gave Israel a diplomatic boost as Serbia announced it will move its embassy to Jerusalem and Kosovo said it will establish ties with Israel with an embassy in Jerusalem. On Saturday, Netanyahu praised the U.S.-brokered deal, noting that Serbia is the first European country and Kosovo is the first Muslim majority country to have embassies in contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians want the city’s eastern part for a future capital.The announcements by Serbia and Kosovo came about three weeks after the U.S. brokered a deal to establish and normalize ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office despite being charged last year with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations. He has denied the allegations, calling them a “witch hunt” and lashing out at the judiciary, law enforcement and media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-protest-against-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-as-coronavirus-infections-spike/story-MsSoh59UdwWkmaRlqhkKFP.html
06-09-2020||World||WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange to fight US extradition bid in UK court||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is set to fight for his freedom in a British court after a decade of legal drama, as he challenges American authorities’ attempt to extradite him on spying charges over the site’s publication of secret US military documents.Lawyers for Assange and the US government are scheduled to face off in London Monday at an extradition hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges adding up to a maximum sentence of 175 years. His lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists at risk.Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said the case “is fundamentally about basic human rights and freedom of speech.”“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes – such as the publications Julian has been charged for – should be protected from prosecution,” she said.American prosecutors say Assange is a criminal, not a free-speech hero.They allege that Assange conspired with US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They also say he conspired with members of hacking organizations and sought to recruit hackers to provide WikiLeaks with classified information.“By disseminating the materials in an unredacted form, he likely put people -- human rights activists, journalists, advocates, religious leaders, dissidents and their families -- at risk of serious harm, torture or even death,” James Lewis, a British lawyer acting for the US government, told a hearing in February.Assange argues he is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and says the leaked documents exposed U.S. military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.His lawyers argue the prosecution is an abuse of process by a Trump administration that wants to make an example of Assange. They say he would be held in inhuman conditions and would not get a fair trial in the United States.Journalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request. Amnesty International said Assange was “the target of a negative public campaign by U.S. officials at the highest levels.”“If Julian Assange is prosecuted it could have a chilling effect on media freedom, leading publishers and journalists to self-censor in fear of retaliation,” said Amnesty’s Europe Director, Nils Muižnieks.The four-week extradition hearing is part of a twisting saga rife with competing claims of hacking, spying and subterfuge. Assange’s lawyers claim the US intelligence services directed a private security firm to spy on him while he was living in Ecuador’s London embassy -- a case currently being heard in a Spanish court.Assange also alleges he was offered a pardon by the Trump administration if he agreed to say Russia wasn’t involved in leaking Democratic National Committee emails that were published by WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. The White House denies that claim.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of UK and Swedish authorities -- but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison as he awaits the extradition decision. Supporters say the ordeal has harmed Assange’s physical and mental health, leaving him with depression, dental problems and a serious shoulder ailment.Assange’s partner Stella Moris, who had two sons with him while he lived in the embassy, said he looked thinner and was in “a lot of pain” when she visited him in prison in late August for the first time since March.The extradition hearing opened in February but was put on hold when the UK went into lockdown in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is resuming with social distancing measures in court and video feeds so that journalists and observers can watch remotely.Assange is expected to be brought by prison van from Belmarsh to the Old Bailey criminal court for the hearing, which is due to run until early October. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is likely to take weeks or even months to consider her verdict, with the losing side likely to appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-to-fight-us-extradition-bid-in-uk-court/story-KbOY8HYw2XLYfIVaAnaAtL.html

The incident happened around 11.50 pm on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.Chatterjee, who was returning home with her husband in their car, heard a woman sitting beside the driver of a Honda City behind them crying for help. Chatterjee’s husband, Deep Satpathy, stopped his car to block the path of the Honda City.“My wife got down and rushed towards the car. Its driver pushed the woman out of the car and tried to speed away. The car hit my wife and the driver drove over her leg. Her shin bone broke,” Satpathy told the media.“I frantically dialled the police emergency number. The police acted very promptly. A police team arrived at the spot and an ambulance too was rushed to take my wife to the hospital. She will undergo a surgery,” Satpathy added.Till Sunday evening, officers of the Anandapur police station were trying to trace the driver of the Honda City who, according to the assaulted woman, had identified himself to her as Amitabha Basu. This was being verified as the police suspect that the accused might have concealed his real name. A man was initially detained on the basis of suspicion but he turned out to be innocent.Also read: Ratan Tata would have been this if he was not heading Tata GroupThe woman registered a complaint of molestation, said officers at the police station. Since the woman could not provide the registration number of the Honda City, the police were trying to identify the car from a security camera footage. “We are verifying the footage and the complainant’s statements. I cannot say anything more right now,” an officer of Anandapur police station said on condition of anonymity on Sunday night.The woman said in her complaint that she got acquainted with the accused less than a week ago and the two decided to go out on Saturday evening. The woman alleged that he attacked her and tore her clothes during an altercation. She alleged that she asked him to drop her home but he refused. The incident triggered a furore in Kolkata and many citizens spoke out on the issue, “While on one hand the incident exposes the risk women face, it also shows how bravery can teach us a lesson. I salute this act of bravery,” said noted thespian Debshankar Haldar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-woman-risks-life-saves-another-from-attack-inside-running-car/story-VItu1Au9ERUqOfklgL77YN.html
06-09-2020||India||LJP may take call on alliance for Bihar polls in key meet today||The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), is expected to decide whether to remain a part of the alliance for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections at its state parliamentary board meeting on Monday. The Bihar elections are set to be held in October and November.Despite being a part of the NDA at the Centre and in the state, the LJP has trained its guns at the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar; alleging that the government has failed to meet promises. On Sunday, LJP president Chirag Paswan, who has not shied away from criticizing the Janata Dal (United) leadership, shot off another letter to the chief minister reminding him that the promises made to people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have not been met. The criticism has sparked speculation that the LJP is negotiating for more seats and other post-election agreements, failing which it could exit the alliance. However, this would not be the first time that the LJP leaves coalition; in 2005 it was part of the UPA-I, but parted ways with the coalition ahead of the state assembly election, following which it faced an electoral setback. “There are some issues that will come up for discussion. Leaders will be given a chance to put forth their concerns,” said an LJP functionary. Paswan, who had earlier told HT in an interview that he was against the idea the elections in the midst of a pandemic, could not be reached for comment. He had also said that in a meeting with the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), JP Nadda, he had raised the issue of deferring polls till the pandemic is controlled. BJP’s national media co-incharge and member of legislative council (MLC) from Bihar, Sanjay Mayukh, said the NDA will “jointly” contest the 243-seat assembly poll and “win with a clear majority”. “The opposition has no vision and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development agenda is moving ahead with full steam,” he said. While the BJP has maintained a diplomatic stance on the issue, the JD(U) sees it as a ploy to wrangle more seats for the upcoming contest. “There is little doubt that the statements are posturing for more seats. However, the party should remember that seats will be decided on the merit of the candidate and also their performance in the last assembly election,” said a senior JDU leader. In the last assembly election, the LJP had won only two of the 42 seats it had contested. The party made up for the electoral loss in 2019 by winning six Lok Sabha seats and is hoping to contest for 36 seats in the upcoming election. The LJP is also trying to woo the voters by pitting a “younger face” against Nitish Kumar, who is battling anti-incumbency. There is also speculation that the LJP could emerge as a third front in the state with Paswan as the CM candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-may-take-call-on-alliance-for-bihar-polls-in-key-meet-today/story-yf9GZtK4OuTRKs1OaLbChN.html
06-09-2020||India||Threatened but will return: Kangana||Mumbai: Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut on Sunday said that she will definitely come to Mumbai on September 9, though she has been allegedly threatened.Separately, after Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut’s remark on Ranaut drew criticism on social media, he said that he will apologise only after the actress apologises to Mumbai and Maharashtra. On Sunday, Ranaut posted a video on Twitter stating, “In a country where women are being tortured and raped everyday, a parliamentarian using such language shows this society’s mentality... If I criticise Mumbai Police or if I criticise you, then you can’t say I am insulting Maharashtra. You are not Maharashtra. Your people are threatening me, still I will come to Mumbai on September 9.” Meanwhile, responding to criticism over his ‘haramkhor’ remark, the Shiv Sena leader “As someone who has used unparliamentary language, let her (Ranaut) apologise to Mumbai and Maharashtra first,” Raut told mediapersons on Sunday. Sena has been miffed with Ranaut after the latter said that Mumbai feels like Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). In a tweet, Ranaut on Friday asked, “Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?”. She had tagged a September 1 news report where Raut purportedly said she should not come back to Mumbai if she was afraid of the city police.State home minister Anil Deshmukh had also said that Ranaut does not have right to stay in Mumbai or Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/threatened-but-will-return-kangana/story-UKJnUK2Y0vL7da98F6duGI.html
06-09-2020||India||Bihar campaign faces virtual test||Patna/Delhi: In the first statewide election to be held after the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, with strict social distancing guidelines in place, Bihar’s political parties suddenly have a new, unusual worry — the state’s low teledensity, low internet penetration, and low mass media exposure. All three pose a challenge in reaching out to prospective voters in a campaign that will rely on indirect communication and digital tools. This is a far cry from the pre-Covid-19 era when, in the run-up to elections, political parties mostly had to worry about the size of their rallies, the scale of their advertising campaigns, the logistics of door-to-door campaigning, and the selection of candidates. The pandemic is changing the rules of the electoral game, with Bihar as a test case. Teledensity — the number of telephone connections per hundred people in a given area — is the lowest in Bihar , at 59 by the end of 2019, according to data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The national average is 89. Internet penetration in Bihar is 32 subscribers per 100 people by the end of 2019, according to TRAI data, compared to the national average of 54.  This is the lowest among the 22 telecom service areas in India. In Bihar’s rural areas, home to 89% of the state’s population, there were only 22 internet subscribers per 100 people.Mass media exposure, too, is poor.  According to the fourth National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, 61% women and 36% men in Bihar had no access to mass media. Among all states and union territories, Bihar has the highest share of women with no access to mass media while it is behind only Jharkhand in terms of the share of men with no access to mass media.This is already causing challenges for political parties across the spectrum. BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said the elections were taking place under a new normal, where social distancing was a must. “However, party has its chain of digitally enabled workers, who in turn arrange the digital output system through local cooperation to reach out to maximum people through virtual rallies,” said Anand.Anand said party workers attached with over 20,000 Mandal office and Shakti Kendra across the state act in tandem to take messages to the peopleRajiv Ranjan Prasad, a spokesperson for the BJP’s ally, the Janata Dal (United), said that the state was grappling with low teledensity for long. “There is limitations of each type of technology. But the pandemic will lead to higher number of mobile users in the state.” The lead opposition party in Bihar, RJD, which already opposed holding the elections during the pandemic, said it was reliant on its tried and tested mode of campaigning --direct contact with its electors-- to overcome technological limitations. “We had pointed out the issue to the Election commission of India and urged it to allow a level playing ground to all parties. Our party is not that resourceful and neither are its voters. RJD leaders have already started holding meetings in small groups at panchayat levels to interact with the people,” said RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari. State Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha said that the party’s digital drive to enrol fresh members could have been faster had the state been blessed with better telecom accessibility. “There is perceptible dearth of phone users in rural areas. Network problem is another factor that is affecting the membership drive,” said Jha. Former Patna University professor, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, said low teledensity, which is more pronounced among the poor, might not lead to an authentic mandate. “The resource-rich parties may have an upper hand to motivate their electorate for voting. For a proper mandate, the election should be put off till the pandemic is contained,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-campaign-faces-virtual-test/story-mbm4gVSXMbkTkCzWKkhGEO.html
06-09-2020||India||Inside Pak army’s deradicalisation plan||New Delhi A deradicalisation programme launched by the Pakistan Army for surrendered militants in the restive Balochistan province has an Islamist overhang, with leaders of hardline groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami being part of the training courses, according to documents accessed by Hindustan Times. The deradicalisation and rehabilitation programme, started in 2018 by Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa, also appeared to be aimed more at replacing the ethnic Baloch identity of the militants with one that emphasises “religio-patriotism”, the confidential documents show. Bajwa, who was recently at the centre of a controversy after a Pakistani news website reported that his family had created a business empire of 99 companies in four countries, including a pizza franchise worth nearly $40 million, appears to have been the guiding force behind the programme that was launched while he was head of the Pakistan Army’s southern command. An existing deradicalisation centre in Quetta named Umeed-e-Nau was expanded and renamed Darepsh, a Balochi word meaning “ujala” (light), to implement the programme. The documents show that the programme has so far handled at least two batches of surrendered militants – 50 fighters who were part of a course from December 2018 to March 2019, and 128 fighters who attended a course during April-July 2019. While the programme does make an effort to rope in both army and civilian psychologists to deal with the psychological and social training of the surrendered Baloch fighters, almost 20% or a fifth of training modules are devoted to a “religio-patriotism programme”, and guest speakers for this included Abdul Haq Hashmi, the provincial president of Jamaat-e-Islami. The Jamaat-e-Islami established deep links with jihadi groups during the war against Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s and was also active in the early years of the militant movement in Jammu and Kashmir, having close ties with the Hizbul Mujahideen. The Jamaat also has close ties with the Pakistani military. The documents show that while the surrendered fighters are taught “rejection of extremism” during the religio-patriotism programme, they are also trained in “jihad, morality,patriotism”. The documents also highlight the mismatch between the overall number of surrendered fighters and the number of those who have completed the deradicalisation programme. According to a brief history of the programme included in the documents, more than 2,500 fighters surrendered in 2018 as a result of “effect-based selected operations in Balochistan along with efforts in non-kinetic domain” that isolated “terrorists/Baloch sub-nationalists”. However, only 178 surrendered fighters were part of the two deradicalisation and rehabilitation courses conducted so far. Most of these fighters were drawn from the Dera Bugti, Sibi and Kohlu regions of Balochistan. People familiar with developments also pointed to the similarity between the deradicalisation camps being run in Balochistan and the so-called re-education camps run by Chinese authorities for Uyghurs in Xinjiang. “The objectives, layout and vocational training module closely align with those of the camps in Xinjiang. One of the key aims seems to be to remove of all traces of ethnic identity and nationalism,” said one of the people cited above. Significantly, a slide that is part of the documents contains a reference to one of the key issues raised by civil society and human rights groups regarding the activities of Pakistani security and intelligence agencies in Balochistan – the issue of “missing persons” or the victims of enforced disappearances. The slide on some nine points raised by the surrendered Baloch fighters during the deradicalisation programme includes in the first place “Missing Pers whereabouts be pursued”. The surrendered fighters also called for financial assistance to be paid to some fighters who hadn’t received the aid when they laid down arms. In recent years, the bodies of scores of victims of enforced disappearances have been found dumped on roadsides, many of them with marks of torture. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it was strange that the Jamaat-e-Islami, described by some as the “mother organisation for most jihadis”, was part of such a deradicalisation programme. “This programme also shows the misplaced priorities of the Pakistan Army – such a programme should focus on Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa or Punjab, where deadly groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba are based. But then the groups that don’t indulge in activities against the Pakistani state have always received preferential treatment,” he said. “The Pakistan Army appears to be using its own version of Islam to crush groups with an identity and form of Islam that doesn’t suit them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inside-pak-army-s-deradicalisation-plan/story-8mOOlX3pwUUXuMkOxDe9NM.html

In the first phase of the Covaxin trial, around 375 participants were studied across 12 sites.“This is to inform you that the subject proposal was examined in consultation with SEC (Covid-19) experts held through virtual meeting on September 3, wherein the committee recommended for the conduct of Phase II part of clinical trials with 380 participants subject to the condition that time for screening the participants should be revised in 4 days,” the Directorate General of Health Service said in a statement.In the first phase trial of the vaccine, the blood samples collected from the volunteers who received the vaccine were monitored for side effects. According to Dr E Venkata Rao, Principal Investigator of the trial at Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) and SUM Hospital, faculty of medical sciences, there were no side effects.IMS and SUM Hospital is one of the 12 medical centres in the country chosen by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting the human trial of the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.Covaxin is one of the frontrunners in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. It is an “inactivated” vaccine — it works by injecting doses of the virus that have been killed aiming to prompt the body to build antibodies against it without the virus posing a threat.Each stage of a vaccine’s clinical trial tests its safety and ability to develop an effective immune response. Phase 1 focuses on determining safety and dosage in a small group of healthy participants, while the second phase looks at the vaccine’s effectiveness. The third phase looks into these aspects in a much larger population that would represent a wider demographic.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-gets-nod-to-move-to-phase-2-trials-of-prospective-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin/story-c0HnPtqnozAtBf1sYmIjWO.html

06-09-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB questions Rhea Chakraborty for about 6 hours||Actress Rhea Chakraborty was on Sunday questioned for about six hours by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the drugs case linked to the death of her live-in partner and actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The 28-year-old arrived at the agency’s office in the Ballard Estate area at 12 noon and left shortly after 6 PM. She was escorted by police personnel. NCB Deputy Director General (south-west region) Mutha Ashok Jain told reporters outside the agency’s office later that Rhea will be called again on Monday for questioning and recording of her statement like today.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput case: NCB to question Rhea Chakraborty again on Monday He said the agency also conducted fresh raids in this case against a man identified as Anuj Keshvani after his name came to the fore during the interrogation of Kaizan Ebrahim who was arrested by the agency in this case earlier. “We have seized 590 gms of hashish, 0.64 gm of LSD sheets, 304 gms of marijuana including imported marijuana joints and capsules, Rs 1,85,200 in cash and 5,000 Indonesian Rupiah after the raids on Keshvani,”‘ Jain said. “The quantity of LSD that has been recovered is commercial quantity under the NDPS Act,” he said indicating it is an offence to keep such quantity of banned drugs. LSD or Lysergic acid diethylamide is a hallucinogenic drug. The DDG refused to share details of the ongoing investigation. “I cannot tell you specifics... because of your (media) cooperation we are getting a lot of information,” Jain said when asked by reporters about Rhea’s statement made to the agency. The day started with an NCB team visiting Rhea’s home in Santa Cruz (west) to serve summons to her for joining the probe.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput case latest developments: Rhea Chakraborty joins NCB probe, Showik arrested The agency has said that once Rhea deposes, it wants to confront her with her younger brother Showik Chakraborty (24), Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda (33) and his house staffer Dipesh Sawant to ascertain their roles in this alleged drug racket after it obtained mobile phone chat records and other electronic data that suggested some banned drugs were allegedly procured by these people. The NCB, over the last two days, has arrested these three men in this case. Officials said the actor was questioned on these lines on Sunday. She was earlier questioned by the ED and the CBI too. Rhea, in interviews given to multiple TV news channels, has said that she has never consumed drugs herself. She had, however, claimed that the late actor used to consume marijuana. It is claimed that Miranda told NCB investigators that he used to procure bud or curated marijuana for the late actor’s household. A total of eight people have been arrested till now by the NCB with six being directly linked to this probe while two were arrested by it when the investigation was launched under criminal sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. When the probe in the case began, the agency had arrested two men, Abbas Lakhani and Karan Arora, for alleged drug peddling and officials have claimed that through them they reached Zaid Vilatra and Abdel Basit Parihar who are allegedly linked to this drugs case as they were in touch with Miranda. Miranda, they had said, used to allegedly procure drugs from them on the purported instructions of Showik, agency officials said. Both Lakhani and Arora have been granted bail. The NCB had said it recovered 59 grams of cannabis from them. The NCB, while seeking remand of one of the accused in this case a few days back, had told a local court that it was looking into “the drug citadel in Mumbai, and especially Bollywood” in this probe. This case has given the NCB an “inkling” into the narcotics network and its penetration in Bollywood or Hindi movie industry, NCB Deputy Director General Mutha Ashok Jain told reporters on Saturday. Various angles surrounding the death of the 34-year-old actor are being probed by three federal agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The NCB initiated a drug angle probe in this case after the ED shared with it a report following the cloning of two mobile phones of Rhea. Rajput was found dead at his flat in the suburban Bandra area on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-ncb-questions-rhea-chakraborty-for-about-6-hours/story-tGeq7Poo0sA63dP97nIYrI.html

06-09-2020||India||Centre proposes full refund in 15 days on air tickets booked before lockdown||An attractive scheme awaits air passengers seeking a refund of their tickets booked before Covid-19 lockdown that came into force on March 25. In an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has proposed that all passengers will be entitled to a full refund of their tickets booked before March 25 within 15 days. The scheme formulated by the Centre states further that if any airline is not in a financial position to pay immediately, the fare amount shall be kept in a Credit Shell to be availed by the passenger for travel by the same airline on any route before March 31, 2021. This option is not available to foreign carriers, who must refund within 15 days. Also read: Concerns over aviation ministry move to permit international fliers take Covid-19 tests after arrival to IndiaIf a passenger does not wish to travel, the credit shell can be transferred to any person. If the amount is unused, interest will accrue every month on this amount and the same is to be refunded in full after March 31, 2021.The DGCA notification of April 16, 2020, catered to full refund of tickets booked during the lockdown (March 25 to April 14). Those who booked tickets before this date had approached the Supreme Court seeking a refund of their ticket amounts.On June 12, the Court directed the Centre to find a solution after consulting airline operators and travel agents. A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan will consider the Centre’s affidavit when it takes up the petitions on September 9.Pravasi Legal Cell, one of the petitioners before the top court, welcomed the decision of the Centre. Advocate Jose Abraham, representing Pravasi Legal Cell, told HT, “Almost 95 percent of petitioners before the Court had booked tickets before the lockdown. The April 16 notification of the DGCA was of no consequence to us. Even the Credit Shell proposed under it contained rigid terms. The present solution of the DGCA has balanced the interests of passengers by protecting their money and allowed flexible terms on Credit Shell.”Also read: ‘Soaring higher’: Aviation minister says domestic flight operations picking upMoCA and DGCA officials held two rounds of discussions with airline operators on July 2 and 8 before arriving at this solution. In its affidavit, it stated that non-refund of fares and creating of involuntary credit shell by airlines was a clear violation of the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) and passenger charter that could result in enforcement action under the Aircraft Rules, 1937. But the airlines claimed inability to pay refund immediately and sought a window period for making payments.The Centre in its affidavit said, “Any such enforcement action would further restrict/reduce their (airline) operations and thus any such enforcement action may further jeopardize the possibilities of generation of cash by the airline which can further adversely affect/delay the refund cycle.” This could affect the Indian aviation industry as a whole, the Centre added.To balance the two interests, the Centre introduced an incentive scheme by which 0.5 percent interest will accrue on the original fare lying in the credit shell from the date of cancellation of flight till June 30, 2020. Beyond this period, the passenger can avail 0.75 percent interest every month till March 31, 2021. This scheme will apply to Indian carriers who are liable for a refund on all domestic and international routes. Even for tickets booked through travel agents, the credit shell will be in the name of the passenger and refunds, if any, would be transferred by the travel agent to the passengers. The Centre, however, added a rider to its proposal by stating, “The above proposal is formulated by the respondent (Centre) as an exception keeping in view the precipitating problems during Covid-19 pandemic and is without prejudice to the regulatory framework as provided in the CARs referred to above.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-proposes-full-refund-in-15-days-on-air-tickets-booked-before-covid-19-lockdown/story-Zi3HicKhDpoQuDCwv5CDBJ.html

Rhea was allowed to leave the NCB office at around 6.15 pm. Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB said, “due to her late arrival, the investigation has not been completed. We will summon her again tomorrow and the investigation will continue.”On Sunday morning, Rhea’s advocate and senior counsel Satish Maneshinde said, “Rhea is ready for an arrest as this is a ‘witch hunt’ and if loving someone is a crime, she will face the consequences of her love. Being innocent, she has not approached any court for anticipatory bail in all the cases foisted by Bihar police now with CBI, ED and NCB.” Also read: Sushant’s house help Dipesh Sawant an ‘active member of drug syndicate’ - NCBEarlier in the day, the NCB produced Rajput’s domestic help Dipesh Sawant before a magistrate court. Sawant was remanded to the NCB custody till September 9. NCB officials informed the court that they wanted Sawant’s custody to investigate and confront him with other suspects including Rhea Chakraborty’s brother Showik Chakraborty, Sushant Singh Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, Zaid Vilatra. All are in custody to unearth the drug trail. According to NCB officials, on March 17, 2020, Sawant had gone with Samuel to get 5 grams of marijuana from Zaid Vilatra, who has been arrested and is in NCB’s custody, on Showik’s instructions. Later, on April 17, 2020, Rhea and Showik instructed Sawant to receive a delivery of 10 grams of hashish from Kaizan Ebrahim, who is also arrested in the case, near Mont Blanc building. On May 1, 2020, Showik had asked him to receive marijuana from a person named Dwayne and had received 50 grams of marijuana from Dwayne on May 2, 2020. NCB officials also claimed that in the first week of June, Sawant had received 100 grams of marijuana from a delivery boy of Rishikesh Pawar and claimed that this showed him to be a part of the drug syndicate. However, Sawant’s lawyer Rajendra Rathod argued in the court that the agency had not specified his exact role and that he was just an employee of Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-ncb-to-question-rhea-chakraborty-again-on-monday/story-XBXZ3u8CR6tjcRnUY5uWpL.html
06-09-2020||India||Music is the best medium to stay positive: Kanchhan||Lucknow lass, singer Kanchhan Srivas has come up with her first original single. Currently, based in Mumbai the singer has been part of reality shows and has given playback in films along with web-series. She waited for couple of months to release her very first club song. “The production of the ‘Kambakht Jawani’ was done before lockdown but we waited for the unlock phase to commence. Now, as things are opening we came up with the release. Life needs to go on and music is the best medium to keep us rejuvenated and positive. I’m thrilled with the overwhelming response my party song is garnering,” she said. The song has been composed and penned by Sundeep Gosswami, also a Lucknowite and has a rap segment by Hustle-fame RCP featuring TV actor Paras Babbar. Kanchhan has sung the title song ‘Meherbaan’ for OTT series Raktanchal and ‘Naina Matwale’ for series ‘You Me Aur Them.’ She has been singing for films as well. “I have been part of female chorus for the song ‘Rajwadi Odhani’ in the film ‘Kalank’ and ‘Laal Ghagra’ for ‘Good Newwz’. Last year, I sung for two Gujarati films including ‘Polam Pol’ and ‘Chashni’. The young singer has been into music since school days in Lucknow. “I was performing, giving audition in competitions besides learning. I have trained under Ustad Gulshan Bharti for around four years. Then, I learn from guruji Parth Praton Das. I have trained in classical vocals. During that period, I was also teaching music at GD Goenka School.” Thereafter, she left for Mumbai. “I knew no one in Mumbai but I had to relocate for my music. I lived on room-sharing basis and social media help me to make some contacts. I connected with performers and gave auditions. I started doing live shows with ‘Delhi-6’ fame singer Shriram Ayer. Thereafter, I got a lot of shows and did international gigs as well.” Kanchhan got selected for the reality show ‘The Voice’. “I qualified two rounds but could not make it to the final twelve. Thereafter, I lost confidence in reality shows. Before that I was also in the top six of UP region in ‘Sur Kshetra’ reality show. I was also part of Trishna Band and participated in ‘India’s Got Talent’. Thereafter, I decided to do original songs which I think will be a turning point in my career.” Terming this phase as a tough time for her, Kanchan said, “I’m able to survive but it’s really a tough time for all the artistes. Gigs and corporate shows are not happening which were the real bread and butter for singers.” But, it’s a good period for self-growth, she added. “I will be releasing more singles — both club songs and romantic numbers. I have also written and composed a song for which I will give a chance to another singer. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/music-is-the-best-medium-to-stay-positive-kanchhan/story-IQeRlExAJbKfENKhbNSZkK.html
06-09-2020||India||I see life on a bigger canvas, says Ratan Rajput||After being part of the industry for twelve years, actor Ratan Rajput finds the ongoing nepotism and outsider debate pointless.According to her, “Groupism is a general term and we all have seen it existing in joint families of our society for long. Favouritism again is part of our homes. So we all are well trained to handle them ourselves.” “Being a Bihari girl I always knew that whether I’m going out for higher studies or work, I’ll have to prove myself more than anyone else. Since, we have a point to prove so we are more focused and work really hard to set a benchmark. ‘Chana-chabena ka kar’ we go to new city, live on rent and slog hard which makes all outsiders stronger than insiders,” said the ‘Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Na Kijo,’ actor. The actor likes going slow in terms of work. “I see life on a bigger canvas and not only in terms of work. I enjoy my work but at the same time I also want to take up things which I want to do in life. I want to explore personal life too. The gap I had after ‘Santoshi Maa’ (2017) show was because my father passed away and I was under a lot of stress. So, I took time to explore life in my own way.” At present, the ‘Mahabharat’ actor is back to work. “I have been part of previous version of this show but now it’s in a new avatar. I am back doing ‘Santoshi Maa: Sunaiye Vrat Kathyein’ which has a new family and story line. So, everything is new for me as an artiste. Earlier, I was there as a ‘bhakt’ and now I am as the ‘ansh’ of the deity.” Ratan is busy in another project too. “There is something else I am working upon where I am very focused and everyone will come to know about it soon. All I can say that it’s related to me and the industry. It’s the same project for which I went to Bihar and got stuck in lockdown for almost three months,” she said. The period brought a lot of changes in her. Telling about it she said, “Due to my stay in a village, I changed as a person and that reflects in the artiste’s work as well. I have not worked much in my life in comparison to what I did in this period as I had no choice”. On being selective about her work, she said, “I have been very choosy and will remain so. I prefer doing one project at a time. I won’t be seen all over the place but, having said that I believe to change myself as per the situation. I will keep working and wait for projects I want to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-see-life-on-a-bigger-canvas-says-ratan-rajput/story-G7hX39aDi4zMNHCK1528EI.html

You aren’t Maharashtra,” Ranaut said in a video message.ALSO WATCH | ‘If that girl...’: Kangana Ranaut under fresh fire from Sanjay Raut on ‘PoK’ row “Mr Sanjay Raut, you called me ‘haramkhor ladki’. You know how many girls are raped every day in the country, how many of them are tortured and killed - sometimes by their own husbands. And you know who is responsible for all this? It is this mindset which you very shamelessly displayed in front of the entire country.

Their strenuous, back-breaking journey earned the couple air tickets for their return journey. A corporate group came forward and helped them get back home. It will be their first air journey when the couple board a flight on September 16. The residents of Godda city, Dhananjay Kumar, 26, works as a cook, while his wife, Soni Hembram, 24, is a second-year student enrolled in a diploma course in elementary education (D.El.Ed) with Madhya Pradesh board of secondary education. Soni took admission in the course in the year 2019 as the fee for the course in Madhya Pradesh is much lower than Jharkhand, the couple said. The couple had to drive down to the examination centre in Gwalior on their two-wheeler since most of the trains were cancelled and cabs were charging Rs 30,000 which they couldn’t afford. After borrowing Rs 10,000 by mortgaging his wife’s jewellery, Dhananjay left from Godda on August 28 and reached Gwalior via Muzaffarabad, Lucknow and Agra on August 30 evening. Also read: Will apologise only if she does - Sanjay Raut replies to Kangana RanautAs stories of the couple appeared in the media, Adani Foundation, a corporate social responsibility (CSR) wing of the Adani Group, sent air tickets to the couple. This was announced by the foundation chairperson Dr Priti G Adani on her Twitter account on Saturday. “Dhananjay and Soni’s marathon travel was a journey of survival, resilience and great optimism. Adani Foundation is humbled to arrange for their comfortable return journey to Godda,” said Dr Priti Adani in her tweet.“Since, there is no direct flight from Gwalior to Jharkhand the couple would fly to Hyderabad and then from Hyderabad to Ranchi on September 16. From Ranchi, they will travel by road in a cab to reach Godda. The Foundation has taken upon itself the responsibility of bearing health expenses of Soni,” said Subodh Singh, CSR head Jharkhand, Adani Foundation. Gwalior district administration has been taking care of the couple since the media coverage on the couple.Gwalior district collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh said, “Apart from giving money, the district administration has made arrangement for the transportation of the couple’s two-wheeler to their home. We arranged health check-ups of the woman and moved them to comfortable accommodation.” Expressing his joy on the unexpected support, Dhananjay said, “I never thought that people in such a large number will come forward to help us and we will ever board a flight. The only thought in my mind was how to take my wife back to Godda safely. A couple of days back, a madam from Mumbai Shreela Roy gave us money to repay the loan of Rs 10,000 that I had taken from a person in Jharkhand. And now this is another major help to us to get back home by a flight. The district administration has also helped us a lot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1100-km-long-journey-on-two-wheeler-earns-man-pregnant-wife-return-air-tickets/story-fXkvzJL0ehOsLQgPpYHQaK.html

Hats off to all the volunteers, we are proud to all of you,” Stanzin said.Tsering Stobdan, another local from Leh posted, “Volunteers of Chushul village carrying water and essential commodities to Indian Army at Black top. Salute to them. Jai Hind”. Spalchan, a local from Leh said that volunteers have been supplying water and other essential commodities to the Indian Army soldiers at Black Top. “Around 60 locals, including women from Chushul and Merak villages took the initiative to deliver water and other essential commodities on the heights of Black Top. They started around five days ago,” he said. “Earlier, the Army used to hire locals as porters, for which they were paid but in the wake of Indo-China stand-off locals volunteered themselves. They are ferried in army trucks to the nearest points from where they undertake an arduous trek to deliver the supplies at the heights of the Black Top,” he added. South of Pangong Tso lies India’s Chushul sector which has Chushul village, Spanggur Lake and Black Top and Helmet Top. Around 170 families live in Chushul village. Even before the Galwan Valley clash took place on June 15 when India lost 20 soldiers, Nyoma block development council (BDC) chairperson Urgain Chodon had flagged rising Chinese activity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the strategic region. On April 27, Chodon had first raised the issue of heightened Chinese activity in Demchok area on her Facebook page, but had withdrawn the post moments later. However, in a series of posts and pictures on June 11, the BDC chief once again exposed Chinese intrusions. In another post with pictures, she said her maternal uncle Rigzin lost his ancestral shed at Laegoknonboo because PLA pushed him 50 steps back. “So imagine how many square km we lost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chushul-s-forbidding-heights-locals-supply-water-other-essentials-to-indian-troops/story-C3TpLDdEgAFmCVKZLx3AlI.html
06-09-2020||India||Nirav Modi’s 5-day extradition trial in London to begin from Monday||The five-day extradition trial of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi to face charges of major financial offences in India is set to begin in the Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday until September 11, with objections, arguments and counter-arguments made so far resonating with those in the case of businessman Vijay Mallya.Modi, 49, is the subject of two extradition requests - one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Lodged in the Wandsworth jail since his arrest in March 2019, he has been refused bail five times.Under UK extradition rules, the court will need to determine whether there is a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering mentioned in the material supplied by the Indian government; reaching a judgement of guilt is not the purpose of the trial.More hearings are due later in the year and a ruling on the extradition is expected in December. The ruling will take the form of a recommendation to the home secretary whether any bars exist to Modi’s extradition or not.Charges against Modi involve a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.Also read: Rhea joins NCB probe, Showik arrested - Latest developments in Sushant caseThe second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case. It was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20 as required under the 1993 India-UK extradition treaty.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).India’s case is that Modi and his companies obtained loans without credit facilities in place; without providing the requisite cash margin; without proper documentation; without paying a proper commission and LOUs not being properly recorded in PNB’s systems; and the proceeds of which were wrongly diverted either to the repayment of earlier LOUs and/or to the benefit of a series of linked Modi-controlled companies.India’s case, represented in the court by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is that the fraudulent LOUs would not have been issued without the active involvement of the co-accused PNB officers.Documents submitted in the Modi case refer to several points of law, objections and rulings made in the Vijay Mallya case, as Modi’s defence raised similar objections to extradition - lack of a prima facie case, the alleged impossibility of a fair trial in India, and risk to human rights in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.The CPS refers to the Mallya case in its skeleton argument in the Modi case to refute or respond to arguments by Modi’s defence, pointing out that many of the objections put forth had been dismissed in judgments in the Mallya case.The CPS submitted that there is no evidence that “justifies a departure from the approach taken in Mallya” on the issue of lack of prima facie case, admissibility of evidence submitted by India, or on the sovereign assurance by the ministry of home affairs on there being no risk to human rights in the Mumbai jail.Despite offering to raise the bail security amount to 4 million pounds, UK courts have refused Modi bail on the ground that he posed a risk and had the means to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-5-day-extradition-trial-in-london-to-begin-from-monday/story-1iwhZZ2Vy5y53hc3g5voZM.html

A police team has been sent to verify the incident after reports emerged on social media about the missing men. But the team is yet to return from the remote border location. Authorities said there was no confirmation that the abductions had taken place.“The incident might have occurred, but we have not received any complaint about the disappearance of the men from any of their family members. We know about the incident only through local sources,” Taru Gussar, superintendent of police (SP), Upper Subansiri, told HT over the phone on Sunday. Also Read: India calls China’s bluff in Chushul | AnalysisThe reports of disappearance of the men, who used to work as porters for the Indian Army, surfaced on Friday after Prakash Ringling, a brother of one of the five missing persons, posted about it on social media. He mentioned that the alleged abduction took place at Sera-7, which is located on the border between India and China. The missing men have been identified as Tanu Bakar, Prasad Ringling, Ngaru Diri, Dongtu Ebiya and Toch Singkam. Two other men, who were also with the five missing, reportedly managed to escape. Reports of the incident was shared on social media by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Tapir Gao, who represents Arunachal East constituency in the Lok Sabha. He stated that the men belonged to the Tagin tribe and were abducted from the Indian side of the McMohan Line that bifurcates the north-east’s largest and the least populous state and the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China. Also Read: Donald Trump offers to help resolve LAC standoffCongress lawmaker Ninong Ering, who represents Pasighat West in the Arunachal legislative assembly, also tweeted about the incident. “A team from Nacho police station has gone to the border area on Saturday to carry out an investigation. But until Sunday afternoon, we have not got any report from them. The area is remote and the road condition has worsened because of heavy rains during monsoon,” said Gussar. “It is premature to say what had happened until the team files its report. If there are no blockades on the road due to landslides, the team is expected to return either late on Sunday or Monday,” said the SP. The border area, where the alleged incident took place, is around 14 days walking distance from Nacho, which is located around 60 kilometres (km) from Daporijo, the headquarters of Upper Subansiri district. The district authorities have also not been able to get in touch with Indian Army officials at the border due to a snag in the telecommunication link. “The men belong to my constituency. But there is no confirmation yet on whether any abduction took place. Since the area is inaccessible, there is not much detail available yet. Their family members have also not approached the police,” said Nakap Nalo, state tourism minister and a legislator from the Nacho constituency. Earlier on March 21, Togley Singkam (21) from Upper Subansiri district, who had crossed over to TAR while searching for herbs, was nabbed by Chinese security agencies. He had returned on April 7 following talks between the representatives of the Indian Army and the PLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-news-yet-of-five-arunachal-men-allegedly-abducted-by-chinese-pla/story-j7jmPdUx8V7xq7LZX4e7mI.html

They will then be able to use the coupon during their stay in a hotel or homestay in the tourist spots of the state,” said Maharaj.He said, “The tourist will have to provide his Aadhaar card details while registering to avail the coupon and have to stay for minimum three days in the hotel or homestay. The scheme will also apply for the Char-Dham pilgrims.”Maharaj said that under the scheme the tourists will be provided a discount of ₹1000 or 25% of the hotel charge per day, whichever is less. “The discounted amount will be reimbursed by the government to hotel and homestay owners within 15 days on producing necessary documents regarding the bill charged from the tourist,” he said.For now, it will be a pilot project.“The scheme will be launched as a pilot project for one month which will probably cost the government ₹2.70 cr.

06-09-2020||India||Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand lead in Broadband Readiness Index||The Broadband Readiness Index (BRI) being prepared by the Department of Telecommunications has thrown up a surprise with Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand faring better on the criteria set by the Central government, Hindustan Times has learnt. The BRI was launched in association with economic policy think-tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) last year to further expand the broadband network across the country and analyse the state’s readiness to adopt the fixed line network. The Index also becomes significant in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on August 15 that 6 lakh villages across the country will be connected by optical fibre within a thousand days. According to documents accessed by Hindustan Times, 24 states/UTs have already provided complete data for the Index, while partial data has been received from Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. No data has been received from Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal. For the states that have not submitted the data, DoT is sourcing material from secondary sources such as COAI, Telecom Service Providers and TAIPA. Several criteria were laid down by DoT to check where states ranked on Index. These include Right of Way (RoW) rules that were introduced last year to set up mobile towers and underground optical fibre, national building code of 2016, provisions for making government infrastructure available to setup telecom towers, smart city implementation and common duct policy. The earlier deadline to submit the information was March 2020 but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department has extended the deadline to September. In March, DoT secretary Anshu Prakash had written to chief secretaries of all states to expedite the submission of the documents. The report was supposed to be finalised by April 2020, but has been delayed due to the pandemic. The Department has also asked for granular details such as length of fibre in kms, number of mobile towers and number of mobile towers connected by fibre in the state. According to DoT officials, the department is working to establish 6 lakh connections, of which 1.5 lakh have already been completed. “The aim is that at least four institutions, say a school, the panchayat, the health care centre, the police station and/or ration shop are connected with the fibre to provide a fixed line connection,” said a senior DoT official. The official added that of 21 states analysed, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Puducherry, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh have emerged as the five best states on the BRI. “The ranking is also contingent on the size and population density of the state,” said the official. As of April 2020, according to data by TRAI, India 117 crore telecom connections, of which 115 crore are mobile connections. Of these, over 62 crore are urban mobile connections and over 52 crore are rural mobile connections. However, there are only two crore fixed line broadband connections. “India has 1.34 fixed broadband subscribers per hundred population, whereas the global average is 14,” said the above-mentioned official. But at the same time, data consumption is 10.4 gb per month per subscriber on mobile connections. “Fibre and fixed line connections will help provide easier access, especially considering the pandemic and need for quicker Internet as even teaching and learning move to an online platform,” said a second official. The official added that the Department was working round the clock to meet the thousand day deadline and had already established over a lakh Bharatnet fixed line connections in the last six months.According to former DoT secretary Shyamal Ghosh, connections will only make a difference if proper utilization is done. “A large number of villages have been connected, but what is needed is to set up services and have a development model otherwise the investment remains unutilised.”Ghosh added that BRI is a good investment, but it will have to engage with states to ensure further application, especially in local languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-uttarakhand-lead-in-broadband-readiness-index/story-6V6WkPcMVHg0wDBVHCphGI.html

06-09-2020||India||Two years after Section 377: Judgement that said it with poetry and words from literature||Two years ago, the Supreme Court decriminalised homosexuality, using the words of Goethe and Leonard Cohen, Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to deliver a historic judgment that signalled freedom for millions of people in the LGBTQ+ community.The 495-page path-breaking verdict, delivered by a five-judge constitutional bench headed by then chief justice Dipak Misra on September 6, 2018, took the help of philosophers and poets to read down parts of an 158-year-old colonial law under Section 377 of the IPC which criminalised consensual gay sex.So be it German writer-philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s famous words “I am what I am”, British poet Lord Alfred Douglas’ “The Love that dare not speak its name” or Canadian singer-poet Leonard Cohen’s “Democracy is Coming”, the document was full of evocative words from the greatest in the world of literature and thought.The bench – that also comprised Justices R F Nariman, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra – delivered its verdict in four separate but concurring judgements.Former CJI Misra set the ball rolling and started his and Justice Khaniwlkar’s judgement by quoting Goethe’s “I am what I am, so take me as I am” and German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s “No one can escape from their individuality”.In a recently launched book, “Sex and the Supreme Court”, a collection of essays on how the law is upholding the dignity of Indian citizen, editor of the book Saurabh Kirpal interprets the usage of famous quotes and phrases -- along with other passages -- given by the judges.“The thrust of the judgement of the Chief Justice was to recognize that a person of alternative sexuality had the right to choose their own partner,” Kirpal, who was one of the lawyers for the petitioners in the case, in his essay, ‘Pride versus Prejudice: The Struggle against Section 377”.The former CJI’s judgement was also peppered with other phrases and quotes of literary greats, including English philosopher-economist John Stuart Mill. William Shakespeare’s famous phrase “What’s in a name?” was quoted to convey that “what really matters is the essential qualities of the substance and the fundamental characteristics of an entity”.Taking a cue from Justice Misra, Justice Nariman started his judgement with “The love that dare not speak its name”, the famous words by Alfred Douglas, the lover of well-known 19th century Irish poet Oscar Wilde.The phrase, from the 1890s poem “Two Loves”, is believed to be mentioned in Wilde’s trial for ‘gross indecency’, a charge which criminalised homosexual people. “The Love that dare not speak its name” is usually interpreted as a euphemism for homosexuality -- something that Wilde denied. Wilde was put on trial in 1895 after the details of his affair with men were made public. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment.Homosexuality was a criminal offence in England in the 19th century. It was legalised in England and Wales in 1967, and in Scotland and Ireland in 1980 and 1981, respectively. According to Kirpal, the poem, even though disavowed by Wilde, “speaks of the ignominy of homosexuality that people dare not even mention its existence”.“The poem captures the essence of the judgement of Justice Nariman -- a judgement with rich historical context but at the same time the one that looks towards the future. It is a judgement that neatly wraps its value judgements in constitutional theory and practice,” he adds.Justice Chandrachud began his judgement with the moving words of the late Leila Seth, the first woman chief justice of a state high court and mother of poet and gay rights activist Vikram Seth, “What makes life meaningful is love. The right that makes us human is the right to love. To criminalize the expression of that right is profoundly cruel and inhumane. To acquiesce in such criminalization or, worse, to recriminalize it, is to display the very opposite of compassion...” He borrowed lines from Cohen’s 1990s hit-song “Democracy” to make his point -- “It’s coming through a hole in the air ... It’s coming from the feel that this ain’t exactly real, or it’s real, but it ain’t exactly there.. From the fires of the homeless From the ashes of the gay: Democracy is coming...” According to Kirpal, democracy is something that often comes through ‘a hole in the air’, that is, through the small acts of individuals whose life needs to be changed.The song, he says in the book, seems to capture the ideas of democracy as a participative concept rather than the majoritarian juggernaut that it is sometimes understood to be. Recalling his feelings on judgment day, hotelier Keshav Suri, one of the petitioners in the case, says in the book that he was so happy he could have kissed everyone in the court that day.“The verdict was delivered with such beauty and purity that it made all the struggle worth it. Even British philosopher John Stuart Mill was quoted: ‘But society has now fairly got the better of individuality..’ It made my heart swell with joy. No one could make us ashamed any more. We didn’t have to fear the law. The country’s highest court was standing with us,” Suri writes.Besides Suri, hotelier Aman Nath, dancer Navtej Jauhar, journalist Sunil Mehra, chef Ritu Dalmia and business executive Ayesha Kapur were among the main petitioners in the case. In 2016, they successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to reconsider its own ruling. In 2013, the apex court had cancelled a Delhi High Court order that decriminalised homosexuality by overturning the outdated law, enacted in 1860 at the behest of Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay. The court said it was up to parliament to take a call on scrapping laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-years-after-section-377-judgement-that-said-it-with-poetry-and-words-from-literature/story-8sk3dlUOf4AY3whktIAUeN.html
06-09-2020||India||India calls China’s bluff in Chushul | Analysis||After the Indian Army called the bluff of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on the Rezang La ridgeline on August 29-30, India is prepared for a long haul in Ladakh with clear cut directions to the front-line troops not to yield to any Chinese intimidation.While both the military and diplomatic channels are open between the two countries, the Indian Army riposte in the last week of August must have had a sobering effect on the adversary with the situation attaining criticality at the Rezang La ridgeline in Chushul sector.ALSO WATCH | Amid China face-off, ITBP soldiers honoured for bravery in LadakhAlthough psychological warfare through media is the key element of Chinese military strategy, the situation report to the PLA headquarters in Beijing on August 30 military moves must have made the Western Theatre Command realise the mood of Indian Army’s specialized troops and the armour. The new Indian military posture is aimed at repelling any PLA move to unilaterally change the alignment of Line of Actual Control (LAC) in pursuit of its 1960 claim green line.The Indian position on the Ladakh border was strongly conveyed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to his Chinese counterpart on the side lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in Moscow, the same shall be reiterated by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar when he meets his counterpart on the same platform on September 10. There is a strong possibility of the meeting between India-China Special Representatives on the boundary issue later if Beijing still is committed to the bilateral peace and tranquility agreements. The situation on ground is that China has increased the PLA strength by 60 per cent since Galwan flare-up on June 15 while its leaders talk about peace.According to China watchers, the PLA aggression will continue till the November US Presidential elections and the Ladakh push from Galwan to Pangong Tso was part of Chinese strategic positioning to punish India for its perceived close relationship with US. “ The climatic conditions in Ladakh in October will ensure that troops only fight for their survival rather than fight against the adversary with polar temperatures and killer winds. The Chinese posture will also depend on whether there is a change of regime in US and what will be its policy towards Beijing,” said a senior official.What is left unsaid is that the PLA aggression in Ladakh was part of the preparation for 100 years of Chinese Communist party next year, where the middle kingdom will be show-cased as a new global power with Xiaokang (moderately prosperous) society and a modern socialist country. It is clearly evident that the Chinese did not anticipate the Indian Army reaction in Ladakh as well as the political, military, diplomatic and economic cost of land between Finger 4 and Finger 8 relief features that PLA occupied by perfidy in May 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-china-s-bluff-in-chushul-analysis/story-sOzKq2cyeVbw1DBbpgSGBO.html

The number of nests too went to 21,185, an increase of 1,959 from last year.“The nests were found in Mathadiha inside the national park and Laxmiprasad Diha and Durga Prasad Diha which are located outside the park. This year the most identified species is Gendalia (open billed stork). Availability of ample food and good weather conditions are the reasons for the increase in the number of birds this year,” said Das.Birds like Kaparkhai, Anjana, Rani Baga, Panikua, Gendalia and Khaira are some of the species that throng Bhitarkanika during monsoon. These birds build nests in Guan, Bani and Kerua trees.Every monsoon, two teams with five forest staff each carry out the bird census as local birds as well as migratory birds from other states arrive here in thousands and return home by the end of October with their babies. Migratory birds from other countries would start arriving by November, said the DFO.Bhitarkanika national park is the second largest viable mangrove ecosystem in India. There are a total eight species of kingfishers in the park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-count-in-bhitarkanika-park-in-odisha-goes-up-by-over-9-000/story-YYoiRzzSaRDxqlyIbGeTTJ.html
06-09-2020||India||‘GST means economic apocalypse’: Rahul Gandhi’s latest jibe at govt over economy in new video||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday cornered the government over the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and blamed it for hurting the country’s economic growth.Gandhi was referring to the contraction in India’s gross domestic product (GDP) by a massive 23.9 per cent in the first April-June quarter this year compared to the same period last year.“Another major reason for the historic decline in GDP is the Gabbar Singh Tax (GST) of the Modi government. This wasted a lot like - Millions of small businesses. The future of millions of jobs and youth. The economic situation of states. GST means economic apocalypse,” Gandhi tweeted on Sunday morning.GDP में ऐतिहासिक गिरावट का एक और बड़ा कारण है- मोदी सरकार का गब्बर सिंह टैक्स (GST)।इससे बहुत कुछ बर्बाद हुआ जैसे-▪️लाखों छोटे व्यापार▪️करोड़ों नौकरियाँ और युवाओं का भविष्य▪️राज्यों की आर्थिक स्थिति।GST मतलब आर्थिक सर्वनाश।अधिक जानने के लिए मेरा वीडियो देखें। pic.twitter.com/QdD3HMEqByAlso read: Demonetisation an attack on India’s poor, farmers: Rahul Gandhi The former Congress president, in his third video of the four-part series, accused the government of allowing 15-20 businessmen of having the reach to manipulate the tax payment and farmers, labourers and small businesses of not having similar leverage.“Small and medium businesses cannot pay this tax. The big companies can easily pay it by putting 5-10-15 accountants to do the job. Why are there four different rates? This is because the government wants those who have the means to be able to easily change GST, and those who don’t have means, cannot do anything about GST,” he said.“Who has the means? India’s biggest 15-20 industrialists. So, whatever tax law they want to change can easily be done in this GST regime,” he added.Also read: Rahul Gandhi hits out over RBI report, says he had warned beforeIntroduced on July 1, 2017, the reform seeks tax collection in the country under five different rates on supply of goods and services - 0 per cent, 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. The tax reform has been widely criticised by opposition parties for its complexities under several brackets and shoddy implementation.Gandhi said GST was a complete failure and an attack on the Indian economy. “Today, the government of India is unable to provide GST compensation money to the states. The states are unable to give money to state employees, teachers,” he added.“Not only is it unsuccessful, but it is also an attack on the poor and on the small and medium businesses,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-means-economic-apocalypse-rahul-gandhi-s-latest-jibe-at-govt-over-economy-in-new-video/story-IiEJM5Xh1p53ZZ7o7N48LP.html

06-09-2020||India||Cong veterans in UP target Ghulam Nabi Azad for silence on their expulsion||A group of expelled Congress veterans in Uttar Pradesh, including former ministers, ex-MPs and former youth wing chiefs, have now targeted senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and others for remaining mute spectators when action was taken against them in the state.Azad is one of the 23 senior Congress leaders who recently asked for a full-time, effective, “active” and “visible” party president.In their letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, a group of about 10 expelled party leaders from UP said, “It is strange that leaders, who have been occupying positions of responsibility and have been raising the issue of the freedom of expression and internal democracy in recent days, remained mute spectators (when action was taken against us).” They urged her to “re-establish” communication with the party workers.Former MP Santosh Singh, who signed the letter on behalf of the 10 expelled leaders, said, “Senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad called me to know about the circumstances that led to action against us. Azad agreed the state party (unit) is not authorised to take any action against us as we are all elected members of the AICC (All India Congress Committee). Only AICC’s central disciplinary committee can act against AICC members on the recommendation of the state disciplinary committee.” Singh is also a former chief of the party’s youth wing.The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee’s (UPCC) disciplinary committee had expelled a group of aout 10 senior leaders when they held a separate get-together to celebrate birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Lucknow on November 14, 2019.“The expulsion of former minister Ram Krishna Dwivedi was withdrawn a few days before his death,” said Vinod Chaudhary, a former youth wing chief and member of the state party’s disciplinary committee.In the letter, the group also said, “Under guidance of the Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru and thereafter Mrs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have built the Congress and the nation, upholding democratic values and ideals. No one can deny the strength the Congress has gained under your leadership following the same values, ideology and principles….But this is ironical that a sense of confusion and non-communication prevails among the Congress workers in view of the manner the party is running or being run…” “History is witness to many defeats. But the Congress workers have never been so hopeless and disappointed as they are now. This is an issue of concern for the Congress for sure…..Those who are not even the primary members of the Congress have been working at the party’s headquarters (in states) on a financial package.…. These people now are reviewing the loyalties of such committed and dedicated (leaders) who fought for the Congress from 1977-1980 and have occupied important positions in the party representing it in the Lok Sabha and the state assembly,” they said.“It was under pressure of such leaders that 10 leaders were expelled overnight from the Congress, like daily wage workmen, in an undemocratic, unconstitutional and unjust manner,” they said.Urging Sonia Gandhi to re-establish’ communication with the party workers, the leaders said if she deviated from this responsibility, the “Congress will become history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-veterans-in-up-target-ghulam-nabi-azad-for-silence-on-their-expulsion/story-ihIP4n2W02iB68fckSmlPP.html

06-09-2020||India||HC junks PIL to revoke Kanhaiya Kumar’s citizenship, fines petitioner Rs 25K||The Allahabad high court has dismissed with cost a public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking revocation of citizenship of Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students’ union, in connection with the alleged anti-national slogans that he and others raised at a gathering on the central university campus in 2016. A bench comprising justice SK Gupta and justice Shamim Ahmed passed the order on a PIL petition filed by one Nageshwar Mishra of Varanasi.The court also imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on the petitioner for casually filing the plea to gain “cheap publicity” and for wasting precious time of the court which was working with “limited strength due to pandemic”.The court also said the petition was ‘devoid of merit’ and ‘wholly misconceived’ as the petitioner relied on Section 10 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, which is applicable in cases where citizenship is given by central government to a non-citizen and not to someone who was an Indian citizen by birth.While declining to pass any direction, the court observed, “Question of deprivation of citizenship cannot arise, merely because he (Kanhaiya Kumar) is facing trial before the court in Delhi on charges of allegedly raising the inflammatory slogans.”“It must be noted that deprivation of citizenship is a serious aspect as it would affect a person’s right to live in India and it may also result in making the person stateless,” the bench said.The petitioner had claimed that Kumar allegedly raised anti-national slogans on JNU campus on February 9, 2016 but the Centre had not taken any action against him till date.“Kumar and his associates are supporting the freedom struggle of terrorist groups who are working on the instigation of Pakistan to destabilise unity and disturb the peace and tranquility of our country,” the petitioner had alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-junks-pil-to-revoke-kanhaiya-kumar-s-citizenship-fines-petitioner-rs-25k/story-AQ682p7sWopgdO3yYOhgTL.html
06-09-2020||India||Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand take the lead on Broadband Readiness Index||According to the Broadband Readiness Index (BRI), Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand are faring better than other Indian states in all the criteria set by the Central government to analyse a state’s readiness to adopt the fixed line network, Hindustan Times has learnt. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is preparing the index. Economic policy think-tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) helped launch the BRI last year to further expand the broadband network across the country. The index also becomes significant in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on August 15 that optical fibre will connect 600,000 villages across the country in 1,000 days. Also Read: Rs40 lakh incentive for mobile towers in select Uttarakhand border villagesAccording to documents accessed by Hindustan Times, 24 states/UTs have already provided requisite data for the index, while Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have given partial data to date. Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal have not contributed any data yet. DoT is sourcing material from secondary sources such as COAI, Telecom Service Providers and TAIPA for states that have not submitted data. DoT checked where states ranked on the index based on several criteria, including Right of Way (RoW) rules that were introduced last year to set up mobile towers and underground optical fibre, the national building code of 2016, provisions to make government infrastructure available to set up telecom towers, smart city implementation and the common duct policy. The original deadline to submit the information was March 2020, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the department has extended the deadline to September. DoT secretary Anshu Prakash also wrote to the chief secretaries of all states in March to expedite the submission of documents. The report was supposed to be finalised by April 2020. According to DoT officials, the department is working to establish the 600,000 connections, of which 150,000 have already been completed. “The aim is that at least four institutions, say a school, the panchayat, the health care centre, the police station and/or ration shop are connected with the fibre to provide a fixed line connection,” said a senior DoT official. The official added that of 21 states analysed, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Puducherry, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh have emerged as the five best states on the BRI. “The ranking is also contingent on the size and population density of the state,” said the official. Also Read: Govt website for welfare funds logs out daily wagersAs of April 2020, according to data by TRAI, there are 1.17 billion telecom connections in India, of which 1.15 billion are mobile connections. Of these, over 620 million are urban mobile connections and over 520 million are rural. However, there are only 20 million fixed line broadband connections. “India has 1.34 fixed broadband subscribers per hundred population, whereas the global average is 14,” said the above-mentioned official. But at the same time, data consumption is 10.4 GB per month per subscriber on mobile connections. “Fibre and fixed line connections will help provide people with easier access, especially considering the pandemic and the need for quicker Internet, as even teaching and learning are taking place online,” said a second official. The official added that the Department was working round the clock to meet the thousand day deadline and had already established over a lakh Bharatnet fixed line connections in the last six months.According to former DoT secretary Shyamal Ghosh, connections will only make a difference if there is proper utilisation of resources. “A large number of villages have been connected, but there is a need to set up services and have a development model, otherwise the investment remains unutilised.”Ghosh added that BRI is a good investment, but it will have to engage with states to ensure further application, especially in local languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-uttarakhand-in-the-lead-on-broadband-readiness-index/story-FsxJrq2hzJeon0MbsvoyJI.html

06-09-2020||India||Kesavananda Bharati, whose Supreme Court case was genesis of ‘basic structure’, dies||Kesavananda Bharati, the seer who had initiated the constitutional case before the Supreme Court (SC) that had led to the birth of the legal doctrine of ‘basic structure’, passed away on Sunday morning in his ashram at Edneer in north Kerala’s Kasaragod district. He was 79 years old.Bharati had filed the case on March 21, 1970 challenging the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 and the three Constitutional amendments --- 24, 25 and 29 -- on the ground that they violated his fundamental right to practice and propagate religion (Article 25); freedom of religious denomination, including managing and administering its property, (Article 26); and right to property (Article 31).He had challenged the law after the legislation regarding land reforms had threatened to strip his mutt of its property which was the only source of income for the ashram. Acclaimed lawyer Nani Palkhivala had appeared for Bharati before a 13- judge SC bench.It was the only time a bench of 13 judges, which was the full strength of the apex court at that point of time, had sat to decide a case. It was the longest heard case before the apex court, as the hearing went on for 69 days from October 31, 1972 to March 23, 1973.The SC ruling on the 24th amendment was crucial as far as Constitution and Parliament’s powers were concerned.The 24th amendment empowered that Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution. The amendment, which was brought about in 1971, was done to overcome an earlier judgement of the SC in the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case. In the Golaknath case, the SC had held that Parliament cannot amend Constitution in a manner that it takes away or abridges the fundamental rights of the Constitution.That ruling was based on the interpretation of Articles 13 and 368 of the Constitution.Article 13 states that Parliament cannot make any law that violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. Article 368 empowers Parliament to make amendments to the constitution.The issue before the court was whether the word “law” under Article 13 would include a constitutional amendment under Article 368. In the Golaknath judgement, it was held that an amendment under Article 368 was “law” within the ambit of the definition of Article 13. It had ruled that Parliament does not have the power to amend Part III of the Constitution.The 24th amendment had provided that the bar under Article 13 would not apply to any constitutional amendment made under Article 368.As a result, Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including fundamental rights.The Bharati judgement by a majority of 7:6 had upheld this power. But it came with a powerful rider – that such amendments should not alter the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. However, the apex court did not give an exhaustive list of what would constitute ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution.The interpretation was left open ended and has been time and again used to strike down laws that the SC felt distorted the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kesavananda-bharati-seer-whose-supreme-court-case-was-genesis-of-basic-structure-passes-away/story-NcPfAUcgCpgqa4pXKiy5FM.html

Accusing the MP of being a drunkard and his family members humiliating her, she levelled allegations of being treated like “an insect”.Mohanty and Priyadarshini, both leading actors of Odia film industry got married in 2014. The duo had acted in several movies together.“He is a drunkard and womaniser. He uses vulgar language after getting drunk. After the last general election of 2019, the torture by Mohanty and his family members increased day by day which was beyond tolerance level,” she alleged.She further alleged that for two months during the lockdown, she was left alone at her in-law’s house in Cuttack and the MP did not take her to Delhi despite her pleading. “After coming back from Delhi, my husband became violent and shouted at me. On June 7, my husband and his father rebuked me in filthy language for 2 hours. On June 11, my husband asked me to agree for mutual divorce and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not agree,” Priyadarshini alleged in her petition.In her petition, she has demanded Rs 15 crore compensation from Mohanty for the loss of her income as actor as well as medical expenses and monthly alimony of Rs 70,000 towards house rent and maintenance.The case will come up for hearing in the court of SDJM on Monday. Priyadarshini has also filed a separate petition for restitution of conjugal rights under section 6 of Hindu Marriage Act in a family court of Cuttack.Mohanty, who was on a tour of his constituency Kendrapada today however, denied receiving any legal notice in the matter. “I am yet to get any legal notice in the matter.

06-09-2020||India||Cong demands CBI probe in MP rice scam, says con took place under BJP rule||The Congress in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday demanded a CBI inquiry into the rice scam in the state while alleging that the entire con took place during the earlier and current BJP regime as suggested by the central government’s letter on the swindle.Analysis of 32 samples of rice in a laboratory, collected from Balaghat and Mandla districts by Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution suggested ‘The stocks are found to be unfit for human consumption and in the categories of Feed-I which is meant to be suitable for livestock feed (such as goat, horse, sheep), Feed-II which is suitable for cattle feed and Feed-III which is suitable for poultry feed, as per the guidelines for the issuance/disposal of the stocks’, according to the ministry’s letter to the state government dated August 21, 2020.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a probe by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Thursday which was preceded by sealing of 32 rice mills and a warehouse and departmental action against nine employees of MP Warehouse Corporation and MP Civil Supply Corporation.On Saturday, state Congress president Kamal Nath said, “The scam in Madhya Pradesh is not limited to Balaghat and Mandla districts only. It is spread in many districts and it has a link to higher level. There should be a CBI inquiry into it and scope of probe should be widened to cover other districts also. By talking of just two districts the state government is trying to suppress the scam.” Earlier, state Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta released another part of Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution’s August 21 letter that reads, “...As per the records of the godown, the receipt of the stocks from where samples were drawn were procured in the month of July, 2020 while condition of the stock represent a different picture altogether. The stocks are 100% recycled old stocks and the gunnies used for storage are also at least 2-3 years old.” Bhupendra Gupta said the BJP leaders tried to mislead people by alleging that the rice was supplied during the Congress regime but the ministry of consumer affairs’ letter categorically suggested that the scam took place two to three years back. The BJP was then in power in Madhya Pradesh.He said, “Since the scam took place during the BJP government an impartial investigation is possible only by CBI.” Minister for Food and Civil Supplies Bisahulal Singh couldn’t be reached for his comments. However, state BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Everyone knows well in the state how corruption prevailed during 15 months of Congress regime. Congress is conveniently trying to divert attention of people from the fact that scam was exposed during BJP regime, not the Congress regime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-cbi-inquiry-in-mp-rice-scam-says-entire-con-took-place-during-bjp-regime/story-eDkYgmMkdnM3J5zz6sismK.html

He was 79.Bharati had filed a case challenging the Constitution (29th Amendment) Act, 1972, questioning the Kerala government move to take over the mutt property.It came at a time when the Indira Gandhi-led government had made changes to the the 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th amendments of the Constitution to get the court to rule in favour of the government in bank nationalisation and privy purses cases.Senior lawyer Nani Palkhivala fought the case for Bharati, an ardent follower of Advaita philosophy, in which the then chief justice of India Sarv Mitra Sikri formed a 12-judge panel to preside over the case. The Constitution bench ruled a wafer-thin 7-6 verdict that Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s case is known as a landmark case and many legal luminaries hailed him as the saviour of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seer-kesavananda-bharati-hailed-as-constitution-s-saviour-dies/story-aDbF37hbQpL9seINyAbDdN.html

The minister underlined the importance of Early Childhood Education as the main characteristic of NEP. He said, three to eight years of Age Group is to build Cognitive skills, curiosity and mental capacity. He also said that education with subject understanding is important rather than rote learning.While activity-based learning is emphasized at the early stages, 9th to 12th education would focus on detailed, relevant and new knowledge, which will induce scientific temper among children. Javadekar said research and innovation are key to enabling our education mould globally competitive citizens. He said 3,000 “Atal Tinkering Labs” are running successfully to encourage research-based innovation, which is essential for building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat.Speaking about the role of teachers in the society, the Minister said “A teacher does not simply teach through books or blackboards. The ideal teacher is the one who instils values in students through his/her conduct”. Four years integrated B.Ed degree is being introduced to provide a holistic training programme for teachers, which will include practical teaching skills. It will encourage teachers to become teachers by choice and not as a last resort, he added.“The National Education Policy has been formulated after extensive consultations. Recalling his days as the HRD Minister, he said 13-14 subject experts had worked with great sincerity and zeal under the leadership of Dr K Kasturirangan,” said Javadekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prakash-javadekar-terms-national-education-policy-2020-as-revolutionary-reform/story-SBf25GGXoJe1bccaKEictM.html
06-09-2020||India||‘Congress has to confront the question of secularism’, says Manish Tewari||The Congress party needs to confront the “central question of secularism” and “combat the immoral allure of majoritarianism”, Congress MP Manish Tewari told HT in his first interview since he and 22 other leaders signed a controversial letter seeking sweeping reforms in the party. In a letter addressed to the interim party president Sonia Gandhi a month ago, 23 signatories called for a “visible”, “effective” and “full-time” leader, and elections at all levels in the party; besides the establishing of an institutional leadership model to collectively guide the party. “… There is the central question of secularism. Is the Congress comfortable to interpret secularism as Sarv Dharm Sambhav or should it pursue the classical construct of the separation of church and state? How does the party combat the immoral allure of majoritarianism? With nationalism, the challenge is further accentuated. We are failing to articulate convincingly that our nationalism is infinitely superior to the chauvinistic and exclusionist muscularity espoused by the BJP,” Tewari said. According to Tewari, 54, the Congress faces “profound electoral, ideological and organisational challenges”. “The irony is the Congress led the freedom struggle, its leaders shaped the modern Indian nation while the rightwing collaborated with the coloniser. It is astonishing we are failing to appropriate our own legacy while they cynically vandalise our achievements and leaders, and pretend they belong to them. The truth is Gandhi, Patel, Ambedkar -- not one of them approved of the bigoted, hate politics of the right,” Tewari told HT. Asked if they had provided ammunition to the BJP by writing the letter, he underlined the need for the party to refine its position on various issues like Chinese aggression through debate and discussion.“...the Chinese have not grabbed BJP territory, they have grabbed Indian territory. Are we not all Indians first and Congressmen, Communists and BJP later?” He emphasised that “an overall electoral rejuvenation is vital for the Congress to be on a glide path to a majority in 2024. We are currently not on that trajectory”. Tewari, who was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019 from the Anandpur Sahib seat in Punjab, said, “The Congress has lost cadre vitality on the ground, where the real electoral battles are fought. These issues require deep thought and sustained action over the long term.” Asked specifically if the letter-writers had targeted Rahul Gandhi, Tewari said, “Nobody has a difficulty with him, least of all me. But whosoever assumes the mantle will need to embark on a path of serious introspection and action simultaneously or we shall collectively perish.” He also said that he respected Sonia Gandhi as “much as I do my late mother”. After a marathon meeting of the Congress Working Committee on August 24, in which the letter-writers came in for sharp criticism, Sonia Gandhi agreed to stay on as interim president and hold elections to the AICC in six months. The letter, he said, was about “processes, issues and not personalities”. Soon after the CWC session, the party announced its deputy leader of the Lok Sabha, ahead of the upcoming Parliament session. Both Tewari, a two-time parliamentarian, and Shashi Tharoor were overlooked for the posts. Gaurav Gogoi, 38, who too is a two-time MP, was picked for the post. Tewari said he had never asked the party for any post. He iterated that he would continue to raise the issues contained in the letter. “Some of my colleagues do have a problem being called traitors and dissenters. For me, the tag of being a conscientious dissenter works. Labels are irrelevant, issues are vital,” Tewari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-has-to-confront-the-question-of-secularism-says-manish-tewari/story-Y8VDBuhjBmiErsgldwFvQN.html
06-09-2020||India||‘The tag of a conscientious dissenter works for me’, says Manish Tewari||Former Union minister and Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari in an interview to Hindustan Times talks about the letter that created ripples within the Congress and the party’s future course of action. Edited excerpts:Why did you sign the letter?The Congress today faces profound electoral, ideological and organisational challenges. The electoral challenge is underscored by our two consecutive defeats in 2014 and 2019 and our diminished footprint across the country. An overall electoral rejuvenation is vital for the Congress to be on a glide path to a majority in 2024. We are currently not on that trajectory.What are the ideological challenges?Strangely, in this hyper-communicative age, there’s been a critical failure of messaging. There is the central question of secularism. Is the Congress comfortable to interpret secularism as Sarv Dharm Sambhav or should it pursue the classical construct of the separation of church and state? How does the party combat the immoral allure of majoritarianism. With nationalism, the challenge is further accentuated. We are failing to articulate convincingly that our nationalism is infinitely superior to the chauvinistic and exclusionist muscularity espoused by the BJP. The irony is the Congress led the freedom struggle, while the rightwing collaborated with the coloniser. It is astonishing we are failing to appropriate our own legacy while they cynically vandalise our achievements and leaders and pretend they belong to them. The truth is Gandhi, Patel, Ambedkar -- not one of them approved of the bigoted, hate politics of the right. Then we have serious organisational challenges. The Congress has lost cadre vitality on the ground, where real electoral battles are fought. These issues require deep thought.Have you lost faith in the Gandhis?Absolutely not. I respect Sonia Gandhi as much as my late mother. She led us with dignity, sensitivity and equanimity for 19 years and was responsible for creating and giving direction to two successive UPA governments. If we’d lost faith in her do you think we would have collectively written to her. I for one am deeply grateful to Mrs Gandhi for all the opportunities she has given me in the past 21 years.Who among the 23 is best suited to be an effective “full time leader”?None of the 23, to the best of my understanding, wrote that letter out of any personal aspiration to be Congress President or to seek any other position. Most of them already occupy senior positions in the party or have served in senior positions in government. In fact I told my colleagues, who signed the letter, send it only if you believe in the need for reform for there would be consequences and reprisals. The letter is not a negotiating tool. Some of my colleagues do have a problem being called traitors and dissenters. For me, the tag of being a conscientious dissenter works. Labels are irrelevant, issues are vital. Is Rahul Gandhi the target?That is an imbecilic thought. In December 2017 all of us unanimously elected him as the president of the party for five years. In May 2019, he stepped down taking moral responsibility for the defeat, despite everyone urging him to stay on. It was a rare step indicative of a fine moral compass. Rahul Gandhi is in the best position to outline his own way forward. Nobody has a difficulty with him, least of all me. But whosoever assumes the mantle will need to embark on a path of serious introspection and action simultaneously or we shall collectively perish.What do you expect Mrs Gandhi to do now?The letter is not a conspiracy to destabilise the existing order. It is in fact a cry for reform and rejuvenation. It was written with a clear conscience in the best interests of the party. As for the canard that the letter was written in cahoots with the BJP, one can only laugh. None of the letter-writers need a certificate -- their political lives testify to their credentials.What if your concerns are not addressed?We will continue to raise them internally, for they are germane to the party’s revival. The party must recognise that every time an issue is flagged it is not dissidence, much less a negotiating position. If you are not going to debate and discuss, how are you going to refine party positions on various issues? We are soon going to have a parliament session. China is in occupation of Indian territory. . The government has indeed botched up. However, the Chinese have not grabbed BJP territory, they have grabbed Indian territory. Are we not all Indians first? Should we not send a message to our armed forces that the nation is one behind them in this hour of national peril?Do you anticipate that a new Congress president outside the Gandhi family could be appointed and hence the letter?The letter is about processes, issues and not about personalities. All those who reduce it to that binary do so with mala fide intent.The party chose Gaurav Gogoi over you or Shashi Tharoor as its deputy leader in the Lok Sabha. Is it a fallout of the letter?I never asked for any position. The only thing I beseeched the leadership with folded hands was a chance to fight the Parliament elections of 2019. That too, because a perception had been created that I was scared of contesting elections and withdrew from the battlefield in 2014 for fear of losing. It is a decision I regretted every waking moment of my life from 2014 to 2019. I should have fought, even if from my hospital bed. I am grateful the leadership gave me a chance to vindicate my honour.You want elections for the president’s post but you have criticized the elections in the Youth Congress. Isn’t there a contradiction?A number of us who came from NSUI and Youth Congress felt elections were not a good idea when Rahul Gandhi kicked off the process in 2007. In fact, most of the signatories have been beneficiaries of the nomination paradigm and felt that there was no need to shake the tree. However, as the process unfolded, an impression gained ground that barrier to entry for less affluent people was getting higher and higher.Some of the letter writers seem to have bought peace? Is there a divide?The only peace you need to buy is with your inner self and your god. I signed the letter in good faith with the best interests of the party at heart. Not for any post, much less for publicity.You started the process a few months ago and were able to get only 23 signatories as many refused to sign the letter. Why so?I did not care to ask how many were approached. Even if I would have been in a minority of one, I still would have signed for the issues are critical. Could the letter have been more happily worded to obviate any presumptions and conclusions? Perhaps. Should it be seen as a selfless act in the larger party and country interest? Absolutely yes.Is there a danger of the party splitting?Why should there be a split? The issues that the letter raises have to be addressed if you want to be on the glide path to 272. Nobody even in their wildest imagination is contemplating such a move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-tag-of-a-conscientious-dissenter-works-for-me-says-manish-tewari/story-OnbWVjBjb3pMLG5pE1Uk4M.html

06-09-2020||India||Former health secy Preeti Sudan appointed WHO panellist||On Thursday, the World Health Organisation’s independent panel for pandemic preparedness and response appointed former health secretary Preeti Sudan as one of its 11 panellists from across the world. The decision by the panel’s two heads, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clarke and former Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, received a rather muted response in India. HT learns that India recommended former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale for this post.In a meeting of the Chairs earlier this week, Helen Clarke is believed to have conveyed that Sudan’s experience as the head of the government ministry that led India’s response to the pandemic makes her much more suited for the job. Member states such as India were invited to nominate their candidates but the chairs had the freedom to pick their own candidate as they did with Sudan. In its press release dated September 3, the panel said that while it reviewed more than 120 people, it “made the final appointments based on skills (including expertise in outbreak response, managing national health systems, leadership in youth and community engagement, socio-economic analytical capabilities), knowledge about the international system including WHO and experience from similar international processes.’’Significantly, the release added , “All panel members will serve in their individual capacity and will not represent either their government nor specific organisational interests.’’ The prestigious panel also has former UK foreign secretary David Milliband as a member. Their first meeting is on September 17 and in the report expected by May 2021, the panel is expected to address how the pandemic emerged and why countries were caught off guard.A senior government official says that Gokhale’s name was even cleared by the Prime Minister’s Office for several reasons. One of them is that Gokhale has served as ambassador to China, and, as foreign secretary, was an “expert on multi-lateral issues’’. India is among 62 nations that have asked for a probe into the origins of the Corona virus. US President Donald Trump has led the charge accusing China, where the outbreak started, of concealing information about the virus. “I don’t know anything about this,’’ said Preeti Sudan on Saturday, about the background of her appointment. “I didn’t apply for this position.’’ Sudan’s appointment was pushed by Clarke who worked with the Indian officer on the board of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. “I will be working from New Delhi in an endeavour that is for international good,” Sudan added. HT reached out to Gokhale, but there was no response till the time of going to press.The official cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed that Clark spoke with health minister Harsh Vardhan before making the appointment and explained the reason for vetoing India’s choice. Vardhan was appointed chairman of WHO Executive Board in May this year. HT reached out to the Prime Minister’s office and Harsh Vardhan but didn’t receive any response. A spokesperson for WHO said: “The selection of the members of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) was done by the co-chairs, former President of Liberia, Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Right Honourable Helen Clark. This decision was not taken by the World Health Organization. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-health-secy-preeti-sudan-appointed-who-panellist/story-aVLWeFwY2FLv0vaiDZKCHN.html
06-09-2020||India||Warmer Arabian Sea led to intense rain in August||An unusually warm Arabian Sea is likely to have contributed to intense bursts of monsoon rain in parts of India in August, which in particular led to flooding and landslides in many parts of the west coast, scientists said, citing sea surface temperature readings that strengthen concerns of global warming possibly leading to extreme rain events in the future. Coupled with the consecutive low pressure areas of Bay of Bengal that put the monsoon in its “active” to “vigorous” phase, the warmer waters in the Arabian Sea further compounded the climatology that triggered heavy rain in several parts of the country.In the vigorous phase, rain increase by 1.5-4 times the normal volumes.“Arabian Sea has been warming rapidly in recent decades. This makes the air above warmer, humid and unstable. As a result, the monsoon winds are exhibiting more fluctuations than earlier. So occasionally there are episodes where huge amount of moisture is dumped along the west coast of India in a few days’ time. This year again, the northern Arabian Sea was up to 2-3°C warmer than usual in August, and we saw several spurts of monsoon rains across the west coast,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.According to monitoring by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the average monthly SST (sea surface temperature) for August in parts of north Arabian Sea was 29 to 31 degree C and in southern parts was 29 to 30 degree C. The SST anomaly map showed temperatures to be 2 to 3 degree C and 0.5 to 1.5 degree C higher than expected in pockets of north Arabian Sea.With the formation of a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal on August 4, there were instances of extreme rain along the west coast. For example on August 3, Mumbai’s Dharavi got 38 cm rain; Santacruz and Colaba recorded 26 and 25 cm respectively; Hosanagar and Bhagamandala in Karnataka recorded 21 and 19 cm respectively. On August 4, Palghar recorded 46 cm; Talasari 39 cm; Dahanu 38 cm Mahabaleshwar 32 cm; Khanvel 39 cm; On August 6, Vaibhavwadi in Sindhudurg recorded 71 cm rain; Avalanchi in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris recorded 58 cm; Bhagamandala 49 cm, Mumbai’s Colaba 33 cm according to India Meteorological Department data.There are several scientific papers that have concluded that the Arabian Sea is becoming warmer as a result of climate change. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) report titled “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region” which has analyses and data from 1901-2018 and is modeled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s assessment reports, said increased variability of low-level monsoon westerlies and warming of north Arabian sea lead to increased moisture supply and thus enhance extremely heavy rain events.“Rapid warming in the Arabian Sea has resulted in a rise in widespread extreme rains over Western Ghats and central India, since warming induces increased fluctuations in the monsoon winds, with ensuing episodes of enhanced moisture transport from the Arabian Sea towards the Indian subcontinent. Indian Ocean warming is also found to reduce rainfall over India during the onset phase and increase it during the withdrawal phase,” the report states. Models also indicate that there will be higher SST warming over Arabian Sea compared to Bay of Bengal.“Monsoon was very active in August and the westerlies were very strong. Warm Arabian Sea could lead to more moisture incursion along the west coast. More moisture availability could lead to extreme rain episodes,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.“The SSTs are supposed to drop by 2-3 degrees in August compared to May. Higher SSTs means more evaporation and the moisture gets transported to the west coast with strong westerly winds when monsoon is active. There is more warming being recorded in the equatorial Indian Ocean,” explained R Krishnan, executive director, Centre for Climate Change Studies at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). Some scientists cautioned that SSTs may have been one of the factors. Low pressure areas formed over Bay of Bengal which strengthened the monsoon winds are an equally dominant factor, said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD.IMD in its two week forecast issued on Friday said below normal rains are likely in most parts of the country except over northeastern states, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala between September 10 and 16. Development of features for monsoon withdrawal from western parts Rajasthan is likely during the same week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warmer-arabian-sea-led-to-intense-rain-in-august/story-6F3mJu23c49NZ6Ay4KOZnI.html
06-09-2020||India||Govt: No restrictions on filling vacancies||The Union government clarified on Saturday that there is no restriction on recruitment of people for filling vacancies in government jobs, a day after the department of expenditure (DoE) issued an order asking all government departments and autonomous bodies to cut administrative expenses, including halting appointment of consultants and creating new posts.“Normal recruitments through government agencies like Staff Selection Commission, UPSC, Railway Recruitment Board, etc will continue as usual without any curbs,” the ministry of finance said in an official statement on Saturday.While referring to a circular released on Friday, the ministry said it only deals with “internal procedure for creation of posts”.“The Dept. of Expenditure circular dated 04 Sept 2020 deals with internal procedure for creation of posts and does NOT in anyway affect or curtail recruitment,” the ministry further said.Friday’s circular was seen as a move towards an austerity drive, with departments being urged to also curtail functions and ban use of imported paper for printing as part of measures to rationalise non-priority expenditure at a time when revenues have plummeted due to the pandemic and shutdowns.“In the context of the present fiscal situation and the consequent pressure on Government resources, there is a need for further economy and rationalisation of non-priority expenditure, while protecting and preserving priority expenditure,” the department said in an office memorandum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-no-restrictions-on-filling-vacancies/story-kijcQZ4MKwBENbc5ocnShP.html
06-09-2020||India||Targeted response to Covid-19 needed||As coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and deaths rise in India with businesses, transport and activities opening across states, the responsibility of stopping the spread of the infection lies with each one of us, besides the government.India’s test, track and treat strategy can be effective only if people with symptoms or with possible exposure to a Covid-19 case voluntarily get tested or stay in home isolation for two weeks after exposure or symptoms. Since the infection can be spread by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing in public places is non-negotiable, irrespective of symptoms, till a vaccine is widely available. Protection and vaccination are the only way to get a semblance of normalcy back. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday called national lockdowns “a blunt instrument” that could be avoided with the right mix of targeted and tailored measures, such as using a data-driven approach to drive a targeted response. For example, instead of waiting for test results that have a lag of five days to a week — after a person gets infected, develops symptoms, gets tested and, finally, receives the result — containment zones with mass testing should be set up the moment people in a neighbourhod report symptoms.Hopes for an early vaccine were bolstered on Friday with Russian researchers publishing results from two small, early-phase clinical trials that demonstrated that their Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, is safe, and produced antibodies and an immune response in all 76 volunteers. It stimulates both arms of the immune system – antibodies and T cell responses – attacking the virus in the body and also cells infected by Sars-CoV-2.Sputkin V has two formulations (frozen and freeze-dried). The frozen formulation is planned for large-scale use with the help of existing global supply chains for vaccines, while the more stable freeze-dried formulation was developed for hard-to-reach regions where it can be stored at 2-8 degrees centigrade. “I think they have a good vaccine, the early-phase results are promising. Like for all other vaccines, it needs to undergo larger and more safety and efficacy trials before it is approved for population use,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, agreed. “Sputnik V has elicited an immune response and caused no adverse side-effects. The results are encouraging, but it’s a very small sample size,” he said.All vaccines aim to expose the body to an antigen that won’t cause disease but will provoke an immune response that can block or kill the virus if a person becomes infected. Each type relies on different viruses or viral parts to trigger an immune response. Russia’s vaccine consists of two shots that use two adenoviruses (26 and 5) to carry the gene for the surface spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Adenoviruses, some of which cause the common cold, are efficient vectors for delivering genes or vaccine proteins to the target host tissue. It is a tried-and-tested method used in vaccines and gene therapy. Russia drew flak last month when it approved Sputnik V, which became the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for use on August 11, before publishing early trial results for scientific scrutiny. The experimental Sputnik V is now in Phase 3 trials that include 40,000 volunteers from different age and risk groups. Vaccines developed by Oxford-Astra Zeneca, Moderna and CanSino are the other candidates in large late-stage trials.There are 34 experimental vaccines in clinical trial phases and 142 vaccines in preclinical evaluation stages, according to the WHO landscape of Covid-19 candidate vaccines on September 3, which raises hope that one or more effective vaccines will be ready for use by early next year.Even so, the supply will be limited and priority will be given to vaccinating essential workers and those most at risk. The Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) partnership, which is the world’s largest and fastest-ever procurement and supply of vaccines effort supported by WHO, GAVI-The Vaccine Alliance, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Pan American Health Organization, World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners, aims to ensure no one gets left behind.Unicef is leading efforts to supply Covid-19 vaccines on behalf of the COVAX Facility to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries whose vaccine purchases will be supported by the mechanism through the Gavi and a buffer stockpile for emergencies. Unicef will use its existing supply chains as it is the world’s largest single vaccine buyer, procuring more than two billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries, including India.As the governments, both Centre and states, ramp up testing and streamline medical support and infrastructure, each one of us must do our bit to stay safe and break the chain of infection till the world gets a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/targeted-response-to-covid-needed/story-qL8N1GUqA6XFVbtfslUkXN.html
06-09-2020||India||ICMR paves the way for walk-in Covid-19 tests||A doctor’s prescription will no longer be required for people to get a Covid-19 test, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in its revised testing advisory to states on Saturday, paving the way for walk-in tests.The move comes after a prod by the Delhi high court that asked why people who show no symptoms of the disease – which can be a large proportion of Covid-19 patients – cannot get a test. The rule until now required people to either have flu-like symptoms or come in close contact with an infected person, following which a doctor could issue a prescription for a test.“The new guidelines will allow people to get tested for Covid-19 without any prescription. The guidelines also say that states can have their own “simplified modalities” for testing. What this means is that states cannot put in any restrictive requirements on testing. There were some states where people needed a chief medical officer or someone to certify that they needed the test; those restrictions will have to be removed,” said a senior official from the Union health ministry, asking not to be named. “ICMR’s advisory is generic in nature and may be modified as per the discretion of state health authorities,” said the advisory. In a Delhi HC hearing over improving testing in the Capital, the ICMR stated on September 3 it was just an advisory body and states were free to make changes as per their needs. “With the new strategy, the doctors will be a little freer in ordering testing. Influenza-like illnesses was too restrictive a category for testing, especially as many patients with Covid-19 are asymptomatic. Clinical testing or depending on a doctor’s judgement should have been allowed a long time ago. This is what is good for medical care,” said Dr Jacob John, former professor of virology at Christian Medical College in Vellore. He added that the government should now move to an approach where patients with Covid-19-like symptoms living in an area where the disease is in transmission should be considered a positive case and treated as such. The guidelines also suggest testing those with atypical presentation for Covid-19 such as stroke, encephalitis, blood mixed sputum, pulmonary embolism, acute heart conditions, and Guillain-Barre syndrome (a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves causing weakness in legs, multiple organ dysfunction, progressive gastrointestinal symptoms, and inflammatory disease ) in paediatric patients. “The new guidelines make testing more freely available and this decision has been taken after ramping up India’s testing capacity to over a million a day,” the ministry official quoted above said. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at Indian Council of Medical Research, said that the non-ambiguous guidelines will help resolve many systemic issues. “This will make testing more accessible. Although, this was even true earlier, but the clear-cut guidelines on who to test in a hospital or when to do an RT-PCR is helpful in addressing any ambiguities. Like in Delhi, we should increase RT-PCR testing (elsewhere),” he said. The guidelines also mentions places where molecular testing – such as RT-PCR, CBNAAT, and TrueNat – should be preferred over the cheaper and faster but less accurate rapid antigen tests (RAT). Within containment zones, a rapid antigen test is the preferred modality for screening. Those to be screened include all persons with influenza-like illnesses, all direct and high-risk contacts (family members, colleagues, above the age of 65, immunocompromised, or have conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart, kidney, and lung diseases). “Ideally, it is suggested that 100% people living in the containment zones should be tested by RAT particularly in cities where there has been widespread transmission of the infection,” the guidelines mention. In non-containment areas, however, the ICMR strategy suggests that preference should be given to molecular methods to test those with influenza-like symptoms, all symptomatic contacts, and all asymptomatic high-risk contacts. RT-PCR, CBNAAT, or TrueNat should also be used for routine surveillance of all symptomatic travellers within seven days of illness, and health care or frontline workers involved in Covid-19 management. Within hospitals, the ICMR strategy says molecular tests should be preferred for testing those with severe acute respiratory infections, influenza-like symptoms, high-risk contacts in need of hospitalisation, asymptomatic patients undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures, and all pregnant women in or near labour. The guidelines state that no emergency procedure should be delayed for the want of a test; a sample can be sent simultaneously. Hospitals have been instructed not to refuse admission to pregnant women citing lack of testing facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-paves-the-way-for-walk-in-tests/story-6tTIQSqhoO7Hn8ZrWUAe0I.html
06-09-2020||India||Don’t try to change status quo: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh has asked China to strictly respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC), not make attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, and work with India for complete disengagement from all friction areas in eastern Ladakh in the midst of military tensions between the two sides, a government statement said on Saturday.At a meeting in Moscow on Friday night, Singh also made it clear that India was fully determined to defend its frontiers. He told his Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, that the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) aggressive actions in the Ladakh sector to unilaterally change the status quo on the ground violated bilateral agreements and the understanding between the special representatives of the two sides, the defence ministry statement said. “Raksha Mantri conveyed that the two sides should continue their discussions, including through diplomatic and military channels, to ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC at the earliest,” it added.Singh said that while Indian troops showed a responsible approach towards border management, there should be no doubt about India’s determination to protect the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, according to the statement.It added that the Chinese defence minister said both sides should scrupulously implement the consensus reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping, continue to solve issues through dialogue and consultation, strictly follow the various bilateral agreements, strengthen the regulation of frontline troops and not undertake any provocative actions that might escalate the situation. Wei also suggested that both sides should maintain communication at all levels, including between the two ministers. In Beijing, a statement released by the Chinese defence ministry said Wei told Singh that the relations between the two countries and the two militaries were seriously affected by the border issue, and that it was very important for the two defence ministers to have a face-to-face and candid exchange of views.Wei said the latest stand-off “rests entirely with the Indian side”, and China will defend “every inch of territory”, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.“The Chinese military has the resolve, capability and confidence to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Wei added.The talks, requested by the Chinese side, took place on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting of defence ministers and marked the highest level of government contact between New Delhi and Beijing since the Chinese PLA unilaterally changed the status quo along the LAC in May. The two nuclear powers have been locked in the border row in eastern Ladakh for around four months. The latest round of tensions flared up in the Ladakh sector after the army occupied key heights on the southern bank of Pangong Lake to stop the PLA from grabbing Indian territory in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. China made another provocative move on August 31, targeting these positions but the Indian Army’s swift defensive action thwarted the Chinese attempt. Both sides have concentrated a significant number of soldiers, tanks and artillery pieces, and are within each other’s rifle range in the area. According to the defence ministry statement, Singh said the Chinese side should work with India for complete disengagement at the earliest from all friction areas, including the Pangong Lake, and also for de-escalation in border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements. Singh was expected to reach Delhi on Saturday night via Tehran after meeting his Iranian counterpart, Brigadier General Amir Hatami.“I think it will be a positive step if continuing dialogue can help ease the new tensions that have erupted on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. However, the talks must result in some visible actions on the ground and that is where the Chinese will have to rethink the obdurate stand that they have adopted till now,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). According to diplomats in New Delhi and Moscow, Singh and General Wei both stuck to their positions at the meeting even as they indicated that the two countries were willing to give peace a chance.While Wei wrote down all points raised by Singh at the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, the Chinese leader was critical of the Indian media. But Singh emphasised that in the Indian democracy, the media was free. Wei also pointed out that just like the Indian forces, the PLA, too, had advanced a lot since the 1962 war between the two neighbours.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Friday the situation along the LAC was “delicate and serious”, and soldiers were prepared for any contingency. Naravane said India would use existing mechanisms to reduce tensions and ensure that the status quo along the LAC was not unilaterally changed. The army chief said the Indian side was firmly committed to resolve the current situation through dialogue. The Indian Army has readjusted its deployments at multiple points along the LAC, including the northern bank of Pangong Lake, to prevent the PLA from making aggressive moves to unilaterally alter the status quo in contested areas.According to senior officials familiar with the developments, around 150 PLA troops were deployed at the Bump Feature (a hill feature) with an anti-aircraft gun being moved up the Black Top (also a hill feature) by the Chinese army on its side of the LAC. Moreover, the Indian and Chinese troops were within each other’s firing range at Rechin La. Also, the Chinese Air Force was continuing with its combat patrols in the area. Alongside the troop build-up in Ladakh, there were signs of force accretion on the Chinese border with Bhutan.Border tensions between India and China reached new heights in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 — the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the LAC in 45 years. The clash resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-try-to-change-status-quo-rajnath/story-aHqBAihdwyrOYhqok9C4DK.html
06-09-2020||India||Will reassess bullet train timeline: Rlys||New DelhiThe timeline of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor will need to be reassessed due to Covid-19 but the real timeframe for its completion can be provided only within the next three to six months, railway board chairman and CEO VK Yadav said on Saturday.Hindustan Times on Friday had reported that the work on land acquisition and tendering for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor may face delays due to Covid-19 and the Bullet Train may fail to meet its 2023 deadline.Yadav said that the bullet train project was “progressing well” but the project can only be assessed over the next few months when the status of land acquisition will be clearer.“In any linear project like the bullet train project, work can only begin when a certain amount of land is available. Within three months we are expecting to acquire 95-100% land in in Gujarat. In Maharashtra also we are expecting that in next three to six months the land acquisition will improve a lot and that is why I am mentioning that once the land acquisition is clear the tenders for the civil work and we will start the physical work. So that will be the appropriate time to reassess project implementation time,” Yadav said at a press conference on Saturday.“As of now I can just mention to you that we are fully geared up, as far as design are concerned, tender documents are concerned everything is fully ready and we will definitely start the work. But yes, as far as timeline is concerned, we have to make reassessment of all these components and work, and that can be done only when there is some sort of the clear picture about the land acquisition. We will come back within a period of three months and then we will share the timeline,” he added.So far 63 % land has been acquired for the project, according to the project implementing agency National High-Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL).The project connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad has a deadline of December 2023. The Railways had said last month that the high-speed rail corridor is expected to be completed on time despite the Covid-19 outbreak.Yadav said that 82 % of the land has been acquired in Gujarat while in Maharashtra land acquisition stood at only 23%.The project has had to contend with issues ranging from protests by landowners to rising costs because of a widening gap between the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen; 80 percent of the Rs 1 trillion needed to fund the project will come from a 20-year Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) loan. The estimated total cost of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad project is Rs 1.08 trillion, of which 81 percent cost is planned for funding through the loan from the JICA, may escalate, officials said.Centre has signed a loan agreement with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for providing Rs 15,000 crore, of the total loan amount of Rs 88,000 crore.“At this stage its impact is not known in certainty as the pandemic is still continuing,” NHRCL spokesperson said. One section of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor is likely to be tendered out within three months after nearly 90 percent of the land acquisition for the project is completed, according to railway board chairman VK Yadav, Hindustan Times had reported on August 4. Yadav had said there has been a “slowdown” in land acquisition due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-reassess-bullet-train-timeline-rlys/story-ly6SE6E0QO3lVKAGPE9QqI.html
06-09-2020||India||Maoists kill four in Bastar||Suspected Maoists have killed four villagers in Bastar region’s Bijapur district on the suspicion that they were police informers, the Chhattisgarh Police said on Saturday.The killing took place in a span of two days in the forest of Dumri-Palnar village in the Gangaloor area, according to Sunderaj P, inspector general of police, Bastar range.Sunderaj said Maoists were not happy with development work, including road construction work, underway in the area. “They called the villagers who were supporting the construction work and killed four of them. The other villagers were badly beaten by the Maoists in public. We are still finding the exact details of killings and on which date the killings took place,” he said. In past one week, Maoists killed a total of nine persons including two policemen in three districts of Bastar region.On Wednesday, a former sarpanch was killed in the Pakhanjur area. A pamphlet said the sarpanch was killed in a “janadalat (people’s court)”. Two policemen, who had been missing for a few days, were found dead on Monday and Tuesday in Bastar, a stronghold of the Maoists. “Such incidents (of killing villagers) have increased because the Maoists are frustrated and are under pressure. They are afraid of the entry of security forces in their core areas in Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur. They have been killing and beating innocent tribals out of frustration,” Sunderaj said. Another Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, posted in the Bastar region, detailed the reasons behind the killings.“Firstly, the lodging of FIRs against Maoists has increased and villagers are coming out to report them. Secondly, they want the villagers not to join police recruitment drive. Thirdly, there is no clarity among Maoists whether to proceed militarily or increase mass support in Bastar. And lastly, there is gradual deterioration in command and control of Maoists, thus resulting in indiscipline among the lower cadre,” said the officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-kill-four-in-bastar/story-sWLidef3LwXq2hr7W3N9EJ.html
06-09-2020||India||Dengue, malaria a new threat for Covid patients||Doctors in at least two Delhi hospitals have reported patients with twin infections of Covid-19 and dengue or malaria, a trend that could become worrying since the double disease may be deadlier, and the region is entering its most critical season for mosquito-transmitted diseases.The anecdotal reports tie in with latest findings that suggest a high prevalence of co-infections of diseases such as malaria, dengue and leptospirosis, which together have several symptoms that overlap with a symptomatic Covid-19 illness.One such case was that of a 30-year-old patient with malaria who also tested positive for dengue and Covid-19 at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi recently, before he eventually succumbed. “We know of dengue and malaria occurring simultaneously in places where there is mosquito breeding. However, because of current protocols, when we tested him for Covid-19, he tested positive. This resulted in complications and he died despite his young age and no comorbidities,” said Dr Rajesh Chawala, senior consulting pulmonologist at the hospital.At Lok Nayak hospital, a similar case was detected when doctors noticed a drop in the platelet count for a 14-year-old Covid-19 patient. “When we tested him for dengue, he tested positive. This allowed us to manage him for dengue as well. He did not get very severe disease and was discharged about ten days ago,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. “This is the only case of dengue co-infection that we have recorded, so we do not know whether it will result in complications. Doctors should be on the lookout for other infections as well, even though most of the patients are currently coming in with Covid-19,” said Kumar.Dengue cases usually begin in July, spike in October before tapering off in November and December. According to civic records, in 2015, as many as 15,867 dengue cases were reported and 60 people died. The number of dengue cases in 2019 was brought down to 2,036 and only two deaths were reported. The challenge this year is compounded as large portions of the civic staff who normally fan out across the city to detect mosquito breeding spots are now on Covid-19 duty, which includes widespread testing, sanitisation and containment efforts. A study by researchers at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi demonstrated a high prevalence or co-infection of malaria with dengue and leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that causes fever, headache, muscle pain and bleeding.Around 44% of the patients with malaria had dengue, found the study, which was recently published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.“We started doing this study after we found a few cases where the patient had both malaria and dengue. We had not known there was such high prevalence of co-infections,” said study co-author Dr Pragyan Acharya, associate professor in the department of biochemistry, AIIMS Delhi. “The other interesting finding of the study was malaria infection from plasmodium knowlesi, which was thought of to be prevalent in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia,” she said. P knowlesi was detected in 12 of the 66 patients included in the study. “Doctors should not forget that Covid-19 has not replaced the other infections and these diseases should also be considered,” said Acharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dengue-malaria-a-new-threat-for-covid-patients/story-kSVHPPXR4OyRIaim7GrVaO.html
06-09-2020||India||JP Nadda praises Modi govt for taking care of economy amid Covid-19 fight||India not only took the bold and timely step of imposing a lockdown to save the lives of 1.3 billion people from Covid-19 but also took care of the economic issues faced by the people in this difficult time, said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda.Nadda also said that the government had tried to turn tragedy into opportunity through the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative.Addressing a meeting of the party’s Odisha executive committee, Nadda said that while powerful western nations were helpless in combating the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decisive action of imposing a lockdown to save the lives of the people.“PM Modi made it clear that the lives of 1.3 billion people must be saved. He said ‘Jaan hai to Jahan Hai’ as public health was at the top of his mind,” the BJP chief said.Besides taking care of the health-related matters, the Modi government also addressed the economic issues through several programmes such as the ‘Garib Kalyan Yojana’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, Nadda said.“Don’t count how many cases have emerged; also see how many cases are happening per million. You will see India has under Modi fought Covid from the front,” he said. He said that up to 800 million people were provided wheat, rice, cooking oil, etc, indicating that the PM was worried about the people. He said all sections of the society, including women, elderly, farmers and differently abled, were provided support during this period. The tragedy and challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic were effectively turned into an opportunity by the BJP-led government at the Centre, which announced a ₹20 lakh crore package to revive economic activities amid the crisis, he said.Nadda’s comments came amid the criticism of the government’s handling of the economy by the opposition over the sharp decline in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The country’s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with a 23.9% decline in the GDP.Nadda also claimed that the Odisha government was trying to take credit for the Centre’s efforts. He alleged that there was corruption in certain areas of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-praises-modi-govt-for-taking-care-of-economy-amid-covid-19-fight/story-Am05rCbfQwKc677FN5FShP.html

06-09-2020||India||Courts can’t perform role of govts: SC judge||The role assigned to the judiciary by the Constitution is to provide checks and balances within the system and it cannot perform the role of elected governments, Supreme Court judge justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said on Saturday, underscoring the importance of courts and the executive remaining within their spheres of functioning.The judge said that courts are increasingly being asked to decide on political matters that are brought before it under the guise of public interest litigations and they often face criticism due to the handling of such cases.“But I do believe that we have adopted a Constitution where we have an elected government in power. Segregation of powers requires judiciary to perform its role and executive to perform its role. Courts cannot be unelected governments. They provide check and balance,” justice Kaul, who was delivering the keynote address at a webinar organised by non-governmental organisation CAN Foundation on the topic “Dissents that made a difference: India & Abroad” said.The courts, he maintained, have their limitations and have not been tasked with the responsibility of running the system.“They (courts’ views) are inherently minoritarianism because the majority view is reflected by government in power. There are limitations to the judiciary. Judiciary has not been assigned the role of running the system but (a role) to put check and balance on the system,” justice Kaul added.The judge pointed out that there is a “shrill discourse” today surrounding political cases and the courts bear the brunt of the attack.“It (courts) honestly face criticism today on how far it should go. Some say courts go too far while others say it is not going far enough. But I think the separation of powers must be kept in the mind on this issue,” he said.Justice Kaul said that the system offers space for dissent – for the political system it is in Parliament and on the streets, while for the judiciary it is through dissenting judgments.However, he highlighted the importance of examining courts’ judgments in the backdrop of the period in which they are delivered and called for a constructive approach while examining or criticising the judgments. “Dissent will continue to have importance in every field including the judiciary. While judging the role of the judiciary, and dissent among judges, there must be a constructive approach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courts-can-t-perform-role-of-govts-sc-judge/story-6LUjp0nOrAcNElNCjZDIaP.html
06-09-2020||India||Govt plans 80 new trains from Sept 12||The Indian Railways will deploy 80 special trains from September 12, in addition to the 230 special trains currently operating, the railway ministry announced on Saturday. The reservation for the special trains will begin from September 10, the ministry said. “We will notify 80 new special trains or 40 pair pairs of trains that will start operations from September 12. The reservations will begin from September 10. This will run in addition to the 230 trains already in operation,” Railway board chairman and CEO VK Yadav said.The government will also deploy ‘clone trains’ on routes where the occupancy is more depending on the waitlist for the trains. “Wherever there is demand for a particular train, wherever the waiting list is long, we will run a clone train ahead of the actual train, so that passengers can travel,” he added.Yadav said the stoppages of the clone trains will be less than the special trains. “The idea is to have stoppages at major stations for clone trains to meet demands of people,” he said.In July, the overall occupancy of the special trains stood at 75%. According to railway ministry data, only a fourth of these trains had an occupancy rate of 100%. Yadav said the occupancy of the trains has gone up to 80-85% now and about a dozen trains are low occupancy.There are many stations from where the migrant workers are returning to their places of work, Yadav said, adding that this was a key factor in starting the 80 new trains. Railways is also coordinating with the state governments, he said.“Many of these trains are running in reverse direction of the Shramik Special trains. So, they are leaving their homes and going towards their workplaces. The occupancy of 12 trains is very less among the 230 trains, so we are running them, but will reduce the number of coaches. We are monitoring the occupancy of trains and will run more trains as per demand,” Yadav said.He said that the Railways will also run trains if there is a demand from states for students appearing for exams. The railway ministry had earlier said that it will run special trains for students appearing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), being conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). NEET is scheduled for September 13 and JEE from September 1 to September 6.The decision comes in the backdrop of the ministry of home affairs announcing the guidelines for “Unlock 4” on August 29. The latest plan, the Centre had said, was aimed at reopening more economic activities outside Covid-19 containment zones.Under the plan, metro services across India , except in Maharashtra, will resume operations in phases beginning September 7, with all becoming operational by September 12, according to the ministry for housing and urban affairs.The Railways had suspended all regular passenger trains indefinitely on March 22. Earlier in June, the ministry had said passenger trains, including express and suburban services that were earlier suspended till June 30, will not operate till August 12. The 15 pairs of premium Rajdhani trains connecting Delhi with different parts of the country, which began on May 12, and 100 pairs of long-distance trains, which began on June 1, will continue to function.On August 11, the ministry had clarified that all regular trains will continue to remain suspended but additional special trains will be operated based on the requirement.“This is to bring to the notice of all concerned that, as decided and informed earlier on as well, regular passenger and suburban train services will continue to remain suspended till further notice. It may be noted that 230 Special Trains, which are running at present, will continue to operate…The occupancy of special trains is being monitored on regular basis. Additional special trains may be run based on the requirement. However all other regular trains and suburban trains run before lockdown , will remain suspended for the time being,” the ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-80-new-trains-from-sept-12/story-ujHtxW5OqsSnEuQgCzZvnM.html
06-09-2020||India||Donald Trump offers to help resolve LAC standoff||US President Donald Trump has again expressed his readiness to “help” India and China resolve their border standoff, which he described as “very nasty”, repeating an offer that has previously been rejected by New Delhi.In May, the external affairs ministry tacitly turned down Trump’s offer to mediate on the issue, made through a tweet, by saying India was directly engaged with China to peacefully resolve the standoff.“While we’re at it, we’re talking about China and India are going at it pretty good on the border, as you know. It’s been very nasty,” Trump told reporters on Friday at a White House briefing.“We stand ready to help with respect to China and India if we can do anything we would love to get involved and help. And we are talking to both countries about that,” the US President said.Trump had in May extended an offer to mediate the standoff. “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute,” he tweeted then, prompting both sides to turn down the offer.On another previous occasion, New Delhi rejected Trump’s remarks regarding mediation between India and another country. In July 2019, India dismissed his remarks, at a joint news briefing along with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that Modi had asked him to help resolve the Kashmir issue.At that time, Trump contended he had spoken directly with Modi about Kashmir. “And he actually said, ‘Would you like to be a mediator, or arbitrator? I said ‘Where?’, and he said ‘Kashmir, because this has been going on for many, many years’,” Trump had said at the time.On Friday, Trump also expressed confidence that Indian-Americans will vote for him in the November 3 presidential elections as he cited the “incredible” turnout at the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston last September.Responding to a question about his expectations from Indian-American voters, the President said: “We have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi and I would think that Indian people would be voting for Trump.”“We had an event in Houston, as you know, and it was a fantastic event. I was invited by Prime Minister Modi… it was incredible. It was actually incredible and the Prime Minister could not have been more generous.”The Trump campaign recently released a collection of clips from the Houston event and the “Namaskar Trump” rally that the US President attended in Ahmedabad this February, seeking to project his support among India-Americans. The video, based on a slogan chanted at his re-election rallies, is called “4 More Years”.The US President has claimed he has the support of more Indian-Americans than Kamala Harris, the Indian-descent Democratic nominee for vice-president. Though there are no numbers or polls to back that up, others in his campaign have also made the claim.There are an estimated 1.8 million Indian-American voters in the US – they have historically favoured Democrats. But only 50% of the registered voters among them identified as Democrat in a survey of Asian-American voters in the run-up to the 2018 mid-term elections; 18% identified themselves as Republicans; and the rest 32% were “non-identifiers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-offers-to-help-resolve-lac-standoff/story-SPcRNQiQBL7f5E6smZAcEJ.html
06-09-2020||India||Doctor alleges parents missing after newborn girl tests Covid-19 positive||The parents of a 14-day-old girl, who is to undergo a surgery, are reportedly missing after they were told that the infant has tested positive for coronavirus, said doctors at a government hospital in Ranchi. Their contact number, said the doctors, is unreachable and the police have been asked to find them.This has left the doctors in a quandary as the newborn is suffering from a devastating disease - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) - and they need consent of the parents before they can perform the operation. The disease has caused ruptures in the infant’s intestine.Her parents, residents of Palamu’s Bishrampur block, brought her to the state’s biggest government owned hospital Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) on August 29 for treatment.According to the doctor, before the surgery could be performed they were required to take the baby’s swab samples for Covid test.“On September 3 at around 7 pm, her test report came positive and the same was communicated to the baby’s father. Since then, the parents are not traceable,” said Dr Abhishek Ranjan of RIMS paediatric surgery department.He added, “The contact number of the baby’s father is not reachable. We have informed the police and provided them all details which we have with us.”According to Dr Ranjan, the baby’s parents looked concerned about their daughter during the initial five days. But after the Covid test report came, they suddenly vanished leaving the baby behind.“They might have presumed that they would now be tested for Covid and might be sent to quarantine. The poor chance of child’s survival might have also forced them to take such an extreme step,” said Dr Ranjan, who is taking all care of the child with the help of some NGOs.The baby underwent blood platelets transfusion on Saturday. “She is in the ICU but stable. We are now facing a medico-legal issue in the absence of the parents. Their consent is required to perform the surgery. We can’t wait much and we would take other available resources to do it,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-alleges-parents-missing-after-newborn-girl-tests-covid-19-positive/story-pUmEsDBTwyvoKa6UAoaPbK.html
06-09-2020||India||Four villagers killed by Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur||Maoist insurgents have killed four villagers in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district on the suspicion of being police informers, inspector general (Bastar range) Sunderaj P said on Saturday. The fresh killings have taken the number of people killed in Maoist violence in the region this week to nine, which include two policemen.“The villagers were identified as Punem Sannu, Gore Sannu and Aaytu, natives of Pusnar village and Bhusku from Metapal village,” Sunderaj P said. He added the Maoists were unhappy with the development works, including road construction work, in the area.“They called the villagers, who were supporting the construction work and killed four of them. The other villagers were badly beaten by the Maoists in public. We are still finding the exact details of killings and on which date the killings took place,” he said. Sunderaj P said a police force was due to reach the scene on Saturday evening and then they will get the know the exact situation.On Friday, Maoists killed two men after branding them as police informers when they had gone to a village in Bijapur from Dantewada. A former sarpanch was killed in Pakhanjur area on Wednesday. In a pamphlet found later, Maoists claimed responsibility for the killing.Two policemen, who had gone missing, were found dead on Monday and Tuesday in the Bastar region.Sunderaj P said the incidents of violence have increased because the Maoists are frustrated and under pressure. “They are afraid of the entry of security forces in their core areas in Sukma, Dantewada, and Bijapur. They have been killing and thrashing innocent tribals out of frustration.”Another police officer posted in the region, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there has been more lodging of cases and villagers are coming out to report against Maoists. “Hence Maoists are trying to instil fear among villagers. Secondly, they want the villagers to not cooperate with or join the police. Thirdly, there is no clarity among Maoists whether to proceed militarily or increase mass support in Bastar. And lastly, there is a gradual deterioration in command and control of Maoists, thus resulting in indiscipline among cadres... cadres take decisions themselves without permission from seniors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-villagers-allegedly-killed-by-maoists-in-chhattisgarh-s-bijapur/story-5AYOVfQ0n2QAjkU4lBIFNM.html
06-09-2020||India||How people, technology help Facebook fact-check posts for accuracy||Facebook, which has also been facing flak over allegations of political bias, works with independent third-party fact-checkers certified through a non-partisan international fact-checking network. In India, the social media company works with eight partners including India Today Group, Vishvas News (Jagran), FACTLY, NewsMobile, FactCrescendo, BOOM Live, AFP, and the Quint, which fact-check in 11 Indian languages and English.Also read: Parliament panel grills Facebook officials“The minister has made a blanket statement and has not targeted anyone in particular,” Rahul Namboodri, the co-founder of FactCrescendo, said. “IFCN has very stringent methodology and a completely non-partisan outlook which we follow,” Namboodri added. “The fact-check is done solely on evidence and not on opinion. We tackle misinformation, irrespective of ideology.” HT reached out to BOOM Live and India Today Group; they declined to comment. Facebook told HT over email that the fact-checking system is a hybrid between people and technology, adding Facebook’s machine-learning models identify posts that may be false by using signals to check what’s going viral, user reports, and comments expressing disbelief. Facebook also allows several rating options that third-party fact-checkers can apply to content.FACTLY founder Rakesh Dubbudu said the role of a fact-checker is limited to assessing misinformation and Facebook has to take further action. “Our process is simple. We ensure that when we do a fact-check, everything is completely transparent and the public can repeat the same actions to confirm the information.” He said they focus on virality and potential for real-world harm when it comes to flagging the posts.According to a fact-checker, who did not wish to be named, if the right-wing ecosystem is throwing up more misinformation, then how is their fault. “Ahead of the Karnataka elections in 2018, we had also pointed to various pages that were spreading Congress propaganda.”People familiar with the matter said the fact-checking system is a hybrid between people and technology. They added Facebook’s machine learning models identify posts that may be false by using signals like how something may be going viral, user reports, and comments expressing disbelief. Facebook also allows several rating options that third-party fact-checkers can apply to content.Content that has no basis is marked as false. Image, audio, or video content edited or synthesised beyond adjustments for clarity or quality in ways that could mislead people is marked as altered. Content that has some factual inaccuracies falls under the partly false category, etc.When fact-checkers rate a story as false or altered, Facebook significantly reduces its distribution. Pages and domains that repeatedly share false news also have their distribution reduced and their ability to monetise and advertise removed. Facebook users are also allowed to mark content as false or misleading.Facebook’s strategy to tackle misinformation is three-fold, the people said. It also involves the removal of accounts and content that violate community standards.The Parliamentary standing committee on information and technology on Wednesday summoned Facebook officials following media reports that an executive from the company’s India operations team intervened to protect a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party politician from action over hate speech.The Congress has sought a joint parliamentary committee investigation into the allegations against Facebook, a criminal inquiry into the company’s conduct, and termination of its contracts with the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-people-technology-help-facebook-fact-check-posts-for-accuracy/story-52DaLjrOf5azdHCXCB8sOP.html
06-09-2020||Editorials||Biden has an advantage with moderate voters||Given the complex system of electoral college in the United States (US), and the fact that most states are either firmly red or blue, it is a set of swing states which exercise a major say in determining the outcome of the presidential elections. Polls suggest a tight race in these states. The larger electoral backdrop itself is grim, with the country confronting a pandemic, race riots and an economy in recession. President Donald Trump has given up any pretence to being a unifying national leader. He has positioned himself as a majoritarian law-and-order candidate, seeking to drum up fears in suburban America of minorities. He has added fuel to the fire by portraying his Democratic opponent as a radical leftist. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has given a starkly different message, arguing he would be a healer and address the long-standing grievances of the US’s black minority.The problem for both candidates is that neither is seen as presidential material. Mr Trump’s idiosyncrasies have cost him the support of a lot of Republicans. Mr Biden has struggled with his age and explaining why he should be in the White House . But his most important advantage is that Americans have changed when it comes to race. White Americans today accept their country has a race and policing problem and a policing problem much more than before. Some polls show this figure has tripled in just the past decade. And while support for the present protests has been falling, the sense the status quo is not sustainable has remained strong. If this translates into ballots, Mr Trump’s message will struggle to find traction with the middle-of-the-road voters who will decide this election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/biden-has-an-advantage-with-moderate-voters/story-o6Yl0Gwi34anvwwmIulZ3H.html
